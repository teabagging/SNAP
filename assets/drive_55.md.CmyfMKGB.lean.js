The cover has nothing to do with the book, and sadly the cover is by far the best part.I will try another volume in this publisher's series, but Stephen King should be ashamed of himself.

If this is want you want look elsewhere because you won't find them here. The pace is glacial, the characters dull, and the conflict non-existent. You might as well be reading a book about three people watching paint dry.

I'm a long-time fan of both crime fiction and Stephen King, so this novel looked like a sure thing to me! After reading it, however, I feel less like a fan and more like a victim of a practical joke. In my opinion, this is not a novel -- it's a piece of a manuscript that King should have kept in his desk drawer until he was ready to finish it.He sets up a nifty puzzle, then writes, apparently, until he reaches the minimum word count required by contract, then simply stops. After that, he has the gall to justify it in an afterword, explaining that an unsolved mystery is a metaphor for The Great Mystery of Life.That's all very well, if it's what King wants to do. But it should never have been published under the Hard Case imprint, which leads bookbuyers to expect a tale that adheres to the conventions of the pulp crime genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on you're a King, not a kid","review":"I'm a long time Stephen King lover, but this little story there's rarely anything to love.

The solving process is so repetive as if written for a child.The Cover to this book looks so good, like who is this raven haired beauty, she looks like she could cause some trouble but no!! She just solves a murder for a small paper that no one really cares about and is not that interesting.It's a short read that should take less than three hours, if your a true King fan your going to read it regaurdless of what I say, this is more for those people that have never read King because his books are too big, and they might see this and go I've always wanted to read a Stephen King, well don't pick this up get something earlier please.

After the first two chapters don't go anywhere, however, you realize that this is really just a short story exercise for King that never picks up speed. In fact, King says as much in his afterword: This book is a meditation on unsolved mystery. There's no crime, no sex, and no tension--all of which makes for a maddening pulp fiction book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bummer","review":"This is not one of Stephen's best books.

It's definitely not a hard boiled novel.But someone please correct me. How can there be a Starbucks in Denver in 1980?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow, thought-provoking mystery","review":"The Colorado Kid is a slow, thought-provoking novel more intent on highlighting the nature of mystery itself than it is giving us a concrete plot. Though virtually actionless, the story is highly atmospheric and unsettling as two old men relate a bizarre tale to a young woman, a tale full of questions but no answers. Twenty-five years earlier a man apparently set out to die--either by his own hand or by that of some unknown killer--leaving behind a series of clues that are so puzzling no one has ever been able to figure them out.King takes a good many risks going out on a limb where he knows many of his loyal readers won't want to follow. This is an intriguing, enigmatic novel worth exploring even if it leaves you full of questions with no real closure (which is the point of the book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steven KIng, yes; Hard Case Crime, no.","review":"Let me start by saying that I LIKE Steven King. I have read everything he has ever written, starting with Salem's Lot years ago, and this is vintage Steven King. The two old geezers in Colorado Kid could easily have been transplanted from Milt Crossen's store in Salem's Lot.The problem is that this was not supposed to be vintage Steven King, it was supposed to be vintage pulp fiction. The pulp fiction genre is clearly defined by the likes of Donald Hamilton's Matt Helm and Micky Spilane's Mike Hammer and, even back before that by every rawhide-tough cowboy that ever graced a Louis L'Amour western.So, if you sat down to read a Steven King book, you got up satisfied, but if you sat down to read a pulp fiction novel... well, then you got up disappointed.

I've been reading King since I was a kid and have always enjoyed his books, defended him against elitist snobbery, but never again.

Also, he didn't make any effort to fact-check, and his editor must have been asleep (probably bored by the story). Example: The story is set in 1980, and the character does three things that couldn't have happened then. First, he has a Diet Coke. Nope. No such thing in 1980. Second, he and his wife enjoyed renting movies at Blockbuster. Nope. No Blockbuster in 1980. Lastly, the character runs out of his office for a \\"real coffee\\" at Starbucks. In Denver, 1980. Nope.

Could a creative writing student done better? Perhaps. It was by far the worst published work I've ever read. It was unreadable. Throughout the entire first chapter I waited for a plot to be formed. The characters were choppy and the story went nowhere. The book seemed to be published on his name alone. I have been disappointed in S.

I'm willing to give him one more chance. If his next book (Cell) is anything like this one, it will be the last Stephen King book I ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving","review":"The most disappointing book that I've read in a very long time. I know that one shouldn't judge a book by it's cover, but this one was highly deceiving. By the title, the cover and the description, I thought that Steve King was writing a pulp mystery novel. He certainly didn't do that.What he wrote was a very long drawn out, sermonizing, story with one dimensional characters that one didn't care about who were telling a long, drawn out story that didn't go any where.Granted, some of the early pulp mysteries had one dimensional characters and no plots; however, those are not the stories that we remember from the Golden Age of Mystery.Mr. King didn't do this small press any favors when he wrote this book. I certainly won't be interested in anything else in their line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven","review":"I liked this story mostly because it sort of does leave one hanging.

As a matter of fact, the story of The Colorado Kid is an intriguing one. If executed properly, it would make a wonderful addition to the new Pulp series. However, the execution is frightfully dreadful. The whole setup, with the two jolly old guys and the wide-eyed intern, is embarrassingly contrived. I literally cringed at many parts of the story. After writing so many books that range anywhere from mediocre to brilliant, it's amazing that Stephen King is still capable of writing something that's so reminiscent of a high school sophomore's first attempt at novel writing. I read this book on a flight from Washington DC to Southern California, I wish I had opted the in-flight movie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"double-barreled boredom, ayuh","review":"Three characters. One room. And not one bloody thing happens.At times this book feels like an endless one act play starring Ye Small Town Maine Stereotypes; at other times it's more like being stuck in some airless retirement home. Is King trying to entertain anyone except for himself? Maybe his fans enjoy this stuff, but pulp noir readers would be better served by any other title from Hard Case Crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writers block or just a block-headed writer?","review":"I gave this book 2 stars - not because it was a bad book, but because it's only about 2/5 of a book. The story itself was more a a local color character study, and an easy pleasant read. The problem is the story was about a mystery, and finished up leaving it a mystery. In other words, the story went absolutely nowhere.King doesn't follow his own advice. One of the aging reporters in the story explains that nobody wants to read about a mystery that doesn't have a conclusion - leaving a story open ended leaves people thinking the writer failed his job, and they'd be right. King crapped out on this one - although in his self-important preening he takes the view that he did it right. No, Steve, you didn't.So, you get a quality 2 stars for the 2/5 of a book. You want the other 3, then get back to work and finish the damn story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very satisfying - spoilers?","review":"Perhaps this story was too subtle for me, but I think it's the writer's duty to provide some kind of resolution. The mystery was not in itself profound or engaging enough for me to want to speculate about it afterwards. We don't know enough about the victim; there is no emotional connnection to him. If Mr. King were not already a famous writer, this story would never had gotten published, because it's a slow burn and flouts the conventions of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"This is not a hard-boiled crime. In fact there's not clear indication of a crime at all, just an unexplained dead person. And it's certainly not hard-boiled. The recounting of an unexplained death 25 years later by two senior citizens is more a study in quirky New England personalities than anything else.Also, it really irked me that characters living in 1980 refer to Diet Coke, BlockBuster Video and Starbucks coffee respectively two, five and seven years before they could have ever even heard of them. (maybe King couldn't afford hiring a fact-checker)If you're a King fan, you might like this.

However, unlike peanut butter and chocolate, this book is an example of two great tastes that don't taste great together.This was the first of the Hard Case books that didn't deliver damsels, double-crosses, and tough guys. It reads like something King had hidden in the bottom of his trunk from back in the early '60s, and updated minimally for 2005. There was no tension, no thrills, and I had no interest in reading it after page 75, but pushed through the last 100 pages anyway.I think all fans of tough guy fiction and horror books should steer away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs down","review":"I've been a Stephen King Fan ever since I read Carrie. I loved The Shining with it's big old hotel high in the mountains and the madness that took place there. The Stand was a novel of epic brilliance.King has said that he doen't mind going for the gross out, and that's what Dreamcatcher did for me - grossed me out. But still, there was a story, a tale of the supernatural - or at least the unknown.Then comes the Colorado Kid. What can I say? It left me flat. When I read a mystery I eagerly wait the denoument. I want answers, a brilliant explanation. With the Colorado Kid, all I got was more questions. At the end I still wasn't sure if the death involoved was accidental or murder.I think Dorothy Parker said it well: \\"This book shouldnot be easily put down, it should be thrown against the wall with great force.\\"Come on Stevie. You can and have done far better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Colorado are you kidding me?","review":"I can identify with all you rabid Stephen King fans out there, as I am one myself. Most of you would agree that the master of horror couldn't write something uninteresting if he tried. This book has few bright spots however, and none of the \\"I can't put this book down\\" feel that is common to most of Mr. King's work. It is short enough that readers should make it through to the end, but what is waiting there to reward them is no prize. Mr. King's popularity sets him into a unique place. He can publish anything, and book sellers and loyal fans will eat it up. Because of this, I think he is toying with his readers, as an experiment. What he hopes to learn by this experiment is beyond me, and I am not happy to have been a part of it. Read this book if you feel you must, or if you have read everything he has ever written, but be warned, it is not up to his usual standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Novel of Stephen King's Career","review":"A mystery that never develops.

Now, he died in 1980. Blockbuster didn't open its doors until 1985.

Mr. King tried to write a book who's merits stood strictly on the narrative. As he repeatedly said throughout the book, there is no story. \\"There is no through-line.\\" It is a highly unsatisfying book, not because there is no solution to the mystery, but because there was barely any mystery. It was so mundane. At no point did I really care to figure out the mystery. If Mr. King had given me something to sink my teeth into, then maybe I would have been interested and I would have gotten involved. Instead, I finished the book, just to finish it. As the kids say, EPIC FAIL."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stephen King mystery","review":"\\"The Colorado Kid\\" is a mystery written by Stephen King. The three main characters are two older men and a young woman, all newspaper reporters, and the story is told through a conversation between the old-timers and their young employee.Years before, and unsolved mystery took place in their small New England town. The Colorado Kid was found propped up beside a trashcan on the beach, a piece of meat stuck in his throat and likely what killed him. The unsolved case sparks theories as to what happened, why he was found thousands of miles from his Colorado home, and if he suspected what was coming his way.I'm a huge fan of Mr. King and loved reading this story.

The intricate and artistic lyrics, the very creative melody and the perfect us of samples. I love the book-let for it is strange look. There are no lyrics but small tid-bits stories like the story behind sound mirror and the way they use the word looking glass, a word that is seldom used for mirror.

The courage of the bushman is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intriguing Tale","review":"A very intriguing story about the importance of myth in everyday life. At times, the writing is brilliant, poetic and powerful. At other times, it's more than a bit confusing.

A bare thread of traditional Christmas tunes is woven through just a few songs, most you can't recognize at all. I am not as good of a judge of Techno, but I found this a dirge. The labeling of this as \\"Dancefloor Holiday Favorites\\" is totally misguided. It would be more fun to dance to Phillip Glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool CD","review":"I bought this CD about 7 yrs ago, and my partner and I love it. We play it every year at the holidays. I don't understand the reviews about people asking why it doesn't sound like traditional Christmas music. It's techno, not traditional. I'm so sick of traditional this time of year and this is a nice break from it. If you listen carefully, you can hear the traditional woven in, but it's more like an abstract musical version of it. I'd recommend it for fun during the holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Read..","review":"But well worth it. Before reading this book I didn't think I would like it as much as I did. It was mystery, drama, suspence, and romance all rolled into one. There were all these different characters all of them some how being connected. My favorite being Agent Sullivan and Denise. The ending was a page turner. It was an exellent story about a young president and the dangers of being in a position to rule the United States. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its all about communication","review":"I have listened to the entire Album and I do believe that it should go places.

I use it to listen to MP3 formatted audiobooks. The concept is wonderful, as this can be used with many devices, but I find that I have to hit my power button up to three times before the unit will acutally play. It will turn on and then power down. This is something that I have never experienced with any other adapter. I even made sure the switches for polarity and voltage were in the correct positions - they were. Thought that this was just something that I was experiencing while I was at work, but it happens at home also. Don't get me wrong, it does ultimately work, but it takes a few stops and start to get it going. If you try too many times, it will start the book over, making me listen to a whole chapter over again as there is no function to listen page by page. Can be quite frustrating. Please comment if anyone is experiencing the same issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THESE CD'S","review":"This is just another way the music labels screw you. I'm beyond disappointed with this collection. This is akin to buying the \\"best of\\" and having to buy another disk to get that one song you want that is deliberatley left off all other collections. And they wonder why cd sales are down.

I was disappointed when I started listening to the songs and discovered that nearly all of them were live versions of the songs that were recorded at concerts many years later. The tracks that aren't live are also not original versions of the songs. Most of the tracks are so different from the originals that they are nearly unrecognizable - mostly from the super-annoying crowd noise polluting the music. I did get a laugh from this CD though. The artist for Poison's \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\" is listed as \\"Bret Michaels & Friends\\"! Apparently they couldn't use the name \\"Poison\\" since they couldn't get all the original band members together to do their low-budget re-recording.Do yourself a favor - spend your money on a different CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money!","review":"I ordered this for my daughter for her birthday, but we ended up opening it as soon as it got here.

My daughter has trouble getting the bottle into this ones mouth, and then she has trouble bedning the legs to actually get her on the potty. She hasnt touched this one since we first opened it and I doubt she would ever give a rats rearend if this doll somehow got misplaced into the donate or yardsale pile!I'd give it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good doll to potty train with","review":"This doll is great for playing with, but not for potty training purposes because she will only pee on her special toilet, which is very small and doesn't really look like a training toilet. Also it is almost impossible for my 16 month old to get the bottle all the way in the doll's mouth because it is really hard to press it in far enough. And if the bottle is not all the way in water gets everywhere.

The Van Halens can have their sour grapes, Sammy's got Mas Tequila!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Red Rocker","review":"It appears that Sammy has found a way to have fun with his music. This excellent follow-up to Marching to Mars is a great tribute to what Rock and Roll us to be - Fun and Energetic.Sammy and the Waboritas put together a good album with well placed songs. After a few high energy songs, Sammy breaks it down and plays a few ballads, before finishing up with more up tempo songs.This album has good songs on it - and if listened in succession is a great album. Furthermore, the album is like a Hagar concert - fun, energetic and full of good old fashioned rock and roll!RR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good,clean fun=classic Hagar rock!","review":"On this one Sammy appears to have left behind the Van Halen soap opera to the benefit of everybody concerned.This is a classic red rocker for 1999 and beyond featuring Sammy's Waboritas,a very enthusiastic and competent band-the chemistry between them is good resulting in a surprisingly fresh-sounding rock'n'roll set.Mas tequila!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it again, Sam!!","review":"I am a huge Van Halen fan. From Roth to Sammy & I also enjoy Cherone. Listening to Sammy with VH is what got my attention about his solo carrer.

However, it has a few fleeting moments with songs like the The Love and Red Vodoo. But Mas Teliqua is a rip off from Gary Glitter's Rock n'Roll part 2(come Sammy be orginial) It sounds like his last album and the lyrics are very cliche and similar to Marching to Mars.

FROM HIS DAYS WITH MONTROSE TO VAN HALEN, HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A QUALITY VOCALIST. HOWEVER, THE 90s HAVE NOT BEEN KIND TO SAMMY. I'M THANKFUL HE IS NO LONGER IN VAN HALEN.

How long did it take him to come up with that one?? 2 Minutes?? Van Halen sucks now and so does Sammy!! He needs to put down the Ding Dongs and get himself on a treadmill! And while he's at it he needs to dump his Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer land of misfit toy bandmates and get some REAL musicians! Where the hell is BILL CHURCH?? He was a HUGE part of Sammy's solo success and now he's no where to be found!! Sammy is trying to be way too PC with his multi-cultural subpar bandmates.

What a disappointment !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie...pay attention...you need Sammy more than he needs VH","review":"For the detractors of \\"Mas Tequila\\", sure..the music isn't all Sammy's, but give the guy credit for creatively updating Glitter's sound...I really don't think it's that blatant anyway. My personal favorites off Red Voodoo would have to be: Right on Right, Returning of The Wish, and Lay Your Hand On Me (although he could have done much much more lyrically with this one). But it sounds reminiscent of something from Balance. I think this disc has much radio potential...Right on Right, for example, is heavy enough to appeal to the kids today. Give Sammy a listen.

Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Bring the Family brilliant","review":"This is a good CD, if not as good as Hiatt's previous release under his own name, the brilliant Bring the Family. I have never liked the first few songs on this CD all that much, finding them too loose, jangly and happy-sounding to my liking. I much prefer the emotive ballads like Icy Blue Heart and Feels Like Rain, and the harder rock of Ride Along and Paper Thin, probably because they are more like the songs on Bring the Family. Hiatt being happy and light-hearted doesn't really work for me. Having said that, this CD is still well worth a listen and a must for Hiatt fans. As is always the case with him the musicians Hiatt gathered for the recording cannot be faulted, and Hiatt's voice is magical- it sounds like the voice of a man who has suffered, but has found inner peace, which is indeed the case with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums, ever...","review":"Need a classic Americana album for your desert island list? Add this all-time favorite from one of Nashville's greatest songwriters for the last 40 years. An allstar cast helps John Hiatt to make this recording ageless and true. Ashley Cleveland, Ken Blevins, Sonny Landreth, Bernie Leadon all play and sing, and the album was produced by Glyn Johns. This album convinced Shawn Colvin and Buddy Guy to cover a couple of it's tunes as well, so I hope that speaks to you.

Most of the info listed points to the 1508-10, but if they ship the larger one, who's to blame, them or me? Caveat emptor.

The second one that broke was when it was room temperature and I was pulling the plunger out, as I always do. I never use metal or small grinds of coffee but I have had two beakers break on me, three if you include the first one that broke a couple of years ago. Instead of harassing poor Amazon to send me yet another beaker for free because this one broke in a week I bought a stainless steel press pot not from Bodum. Be careful what you order from Bodum.

But for some reason it has come to sit in Vonnegut's pantheon next to \\"Slaughterhouse 5\\" and \\"Welcome to the Monkey House.\\" And again, it's not that it doesn't work; the odd little tale of island romance in the midst of revolution and the ultimate freezing element, ice-9 has plenty of terrific moments. But ultimately, the book feels cold and clammy; where elsewhere Vonnegut contrasts the sad and the funny here he chooses to club you with pathos and neglect to explain much of anything.

It left a huge impression on everyone who read it when it was first published. I just read \\"Cat's Cradle\\" for the first time, though, and I must say I was disappointed. I am a huge fan of Vonnegut; I read Slaughterhouse-Five and Hocus Pocus before \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" and several others since (I hope to have read all of them by the next millennium), but I think that \\"Cat's Cradle\\" was the least impressive of all, especially after just having finished \\"Hocus Pocus,\\" his best I have read so far. \\"Cradle\\" lacks the emotion and wit of 'Slaughterhous,\\" or \\"Bluebeard,\\" and the tremendous humor of \\"Hocus Pocus.\\" He seems to take the story just a tad too seriously, which is strange because this is his most bizzare and unrealistic story.

I also read Sirens of Titan and Wampeters, Foma, and Grandfalloons, his Autobio. Look, he's witty, but not deep. He is a cynic. If anything, his writing displays the fragility of human existence, and the fact that not a lot of people know what the point of everything is, including him. You will most likely reach a point, about half way into the book, where vonnegut is absentmindedly continuing the exposition while your saying to yourself, \\"get to the point already.\\" The other thing is that he is never uplifting. Nothing revolutionary here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat's Cradle","review":"Cat's Cradle has little to offer but Kurt Vonnegut's very pessimistic assessment of religion, politics, and love. The characters are just \\"types,\\" and so incompletely sketched that we can't care what happens to any of them. The plot brings together an assortment of these characters - for no apparent reason at all - to an island for a doomsday scenario. After the scenario plays out, we receive from Vonnegut the valuable intelligence that all of mankind's effort is meaningless and absurd, and that the best we can hope for is a good laugh at the joke that God has played on us.

Considering his Nobel prize for literature, I was disappointed. Cat's Cradle creates a handful of new words; bokonon, boko-maru, wampeter, and etc. The apparent purpose of this tome is to poke fun at religion in general, in a very gentle and inconsequential way.Generally, I was bored through the bulk of the story, with only the slightest uptick in the way Vonnegut tied up loose ends together at the conclusion.My next Vonnegut read will be \\"Slaughter House Five\\".

If the world annoys you, Vonnegut, work to improve it, or better, your view of it, rather than complaining to the world! Cat's Cradle seemed like an explanation of one man's depression and corruption so we could understand, even agree with him. I am certainly not saying the world is perfect, but if you are looking for a pensive and melancholy-toned book about its problems, I suggest \\"Demian\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and others of Bradbury's classics.

Roberts commands this audio with an easy-going style. Most narrators would take a hard edge and be very blunt in their narrative, not Roberts. This is one reason this audio novel intrigues on many levelsAfter the production is finished, there is a small piece of Vonnegut himself discussing his work.

I never felt like I had to search for greater meaning to the words in order to appreciate them.As an example there is an exchange between Miss Francine Pefko and Dr. Asa Breed early on in the novel that I found so hilarious I reread it about 8 times.Another that stands out in my mind is the chapter titled \\"Bicycles For Afghanistan\\" in which H. Lowe Crosby describes the current state of the American Bicycle industry.It just goes to show how politics can screw up the simplest of business models and although written in 1963, could very well have been penned yesterday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s Entertaining Cat's Cradle","review":"As a high school reader I missed the Vonnegut craze. But, on one Saturday with nothing to do my father suggested that I read this. I can say that a few hours later it is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. It my not be the best structured book, but I really enjoyed it thoroughly. It is written so the main character, Jonah, has already gone through this. This makes it helpful to the reader to explain some of the plot before you get there. Anyway, Jonah is writing a book about the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on a Japan. As we go though his research he see Vonnegut insights into the institutions like science, religion, and many others. This is a book that really is going to make you think about ideals that you hold deal.

I don't know if that's typical for Vonnegut or not to compare to other novels of his."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absurd and frightening - one of the best novels ever written","review":"Kurt Vonnegut wrote a number of extremely good novels. Two of them are truly great. Cat's Cradle is one. (Slaughterhouse Five is the other)Cat's Cradle treads on some of the same ground as Orwell's 1984, but where Orwell delivers his message with a heavy hand, Vonnegut delivers his message with sardonic wit and sharp insight. In Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut directs his considerable wit and insight at the institutions of religion, politics, and science.Cat's Cradle is arguably Vonnegut's funniest and most imaginative novel, and also one of his most profound. It manages to be both absurd and frightening. If you haven't read anything by Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle is a great place to start.

Do you think there is any importance to life (at all)? Well, the whole point of this book is that life means zilch. Religion is a crutch, politics is a crutch. Everything means nothing. I wonder why some people like to be this pessimisstic. Why people want to believe that life means nothing. If life means nothing, then why don't we go on murder rampages? Why don't we steal, rape, and loot? What's the point of trying to teach a lesson if life means nothing? There is no point. One of the previous reviews mentioned Catcher in the Rye. Awesome Book.

The story \\"bounced around\\" a bit too much for me and as a reader, I did not know what to focus on, and after a while, did not care. Unlike Slaughterhouse Five, I did not find this book at all funny (was it supposed to be?) although I suspect that Vonnegut intended the reader to take humor in the medical condition known as midgetism.

His unique genius truly shines in this novel as you are pulled along most willingly through the realm of both the impossible and unthinkable. Each character is vivid and lives on in your mind well after you've put the book down. Of course, actually putting the book down is a challenge. Even when you've finished, you'll want to read it again from end to beginning and look for hidden messages, because you know your own imagination is not nearly vast enough to have captured the seemingly endless facets of this story. Don't die before you read Cat's Cradle, because this is at least one more thing you need to do before you've led a full life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply, amazing","review":"Cat's cradle has the unique prose of Vonnegut. I'm talking about the perfect blend of humor, irony and truth that can summarize the most trascendental aspects of our existence. In this book - which to some people is the best of Vonnegut's novels- religion, science and politics converge in the stories of an imaginary inventor of the atomic bomb, a sustance capable of freezing the planet, a prophet, a banana republic and many other characters that reflect the contradictions of modern society. With memorable passages and new words of the \\"bookonist\\" faith, this book will undoubtedly leave a footprint in every reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of the world as high farce","review":"End-of-the-world fiction is probably my favorite fiction genre, and I found Vonnegut's \\"Cat's Cradle\\" to be by far the most bizzare addition to my library in this area. My interpretation is that it is suppose to be taken in the same vein as Stanley Kubrick's black comedy film \\"Dr. Strangeglove.\\" Not only was it written around the same time at the height of the Cold War, it has the same high farce tone about it. Vonnegut's ultimate fate for the world is sheer genius, though when it finally happens, it seems almost like an afterthought. Vonnegut's book is a challenging read and one that is not for everybody. Nevertheless, you'll find yourself thinking about it long after you've put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonnegut - possibly the most intelligent man in the world.","review":"Cat's Cradle is the first Vonnegut novel I have ever read and still my favorite novel of all time. Never before have I read an author that is so dark, fatalistic and twisted, yet funny and optimistic at the same time. Vonnegut writes like nobody else. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" makes you think. It makes you laugh at notions you normally wouldn't. Vonnegut's very \\"matter of fact\\" style of writing is genius. I'm sorry but, If anyone tells you that this book is no good its because they're just not intelligent enough to appreciate it.! I have read ALL of his works and I always eagerly await his next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up","review":"This book was great! Totally different than anything i had read before, but it kept me interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very very good book.","review":"I got into Kurt Vonnegut only about a month back at the insistence of a friend, and I've already taken that friend out to lunch twice to show my appreciation!!!!!! This and \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" are two of the best books that I've read in a long long time. Vonnegut's fertile imagination and his totally original way of presenting his stories, along with meaningful and witty and thought provoking content really elevates him to a pedestal few authors have had the honor of climbing. I loved the idea of Bokononism, and strangely, found myself agreeing with most of 'the fomas' that Bokonon sang! One realizes how narrow and petty the human race has become, with all its greed and 'granfalloonism', and if freedom from that necessitates listening to a pack of lies, so be it!! Good work, Mr. Vonnegut. I recommend this book to anyone, whether you just want a hearty laugh or whether you want to partake a spiritual journey. Read it ASAP!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's no Slaughterhouse Five, but is that really a bad thing?","review":"I picked this up because I LOVED Slaughterhouse Five quite a bit. While this book shares a lot of the style, the narration is a little off to me. Vonnegut doesn't write characters who are good or evil and he does a lot of foreshadowing. In this book, it almost seemed like some of the foreshadowing fell a little flat and the people were not as likeable. The book is still a fascinating read, more correctly classified as a Vonnegut but not poorly placed as sci-fi. I enjoyed it, but not as much as I loved some of his other work."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's no cradle, there's no cat.","review":"What's not to love about a book with paragraph-long chapters?

He argues that the Westhad just shed the last vestiges of feudal slavery in favorof an independent yeomanry by the late Middle Ages when theProtestant Reformation of the 16th century turned all this around, and resulted in the polarizationof wealth that has continued to this day. His thesis is that capitalism,left to itself, is inherently unstable and must rely on stateintervention. Ultimately, however, the large corporations benefit from moderate socialism.Themass of working people are reduced to servile wage earningconditions -- achieving basic material comfort, but nomeaningful economic freedom -- being kept in line by the bureaucrats to the benefitof big business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked On Chess","review":"A superb family film which demonstrates how a chess club turns life around for a group of inner-city kids at a struggling junior high.

The poem is unnecessary, mean-spirited and misguided. Just because the man criticizes America does not mean that he hates America, and just because some people call him anti-semetic does not make him anti-semetic. The poem left me wondering if she ever really read Baraka's work, or just criticisms of it. Although he is not one of my favorite poets and I don't agree with him on everything, I have great respect for his work as both a poet and a playwright. Unfortunately, after reading that one poem, I lost respect for Kleinman and I struggled getting through the rest of her book.

And the way she looks when singing is genuinely beautiful as well. Definitely a must-have for any classical music fan who can value the real quality rather than the commerically blown-up success!

I do know that I once bought a cheap set of luggage from a department store and one of the 5 pieces ended up having the same odor.

His passion, madness, future thinking and belief in himself led him to extreme success followed by downfall. Martin Scorse is quite successfull in bringing the life of Hughes on the wide screen. Leonardo Dicaprio and Cate Blanchett also performed very well with supporting actors such Alec Baldwin and Kate Winslet who were not so impressive. But in few scenes Leonardo forgot that he was Hughes, Scorse forgot that he is in 1920-1940's and the crash scenes were shot such as we are watching The Matrix or I,Robot of 21st centuary not The Aviator of 20th centuary. overall it was a good movie (8.7 out of 10) if you got enough potential to sit for three hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and lacking in in focus","review":"The movie does not have a deep focus whether it be Hughes as the Business Genius, Hughes as the Engineering Genius, or Hughes as the Deeply Troubled Man. Instead it hip-hops from topic to topic hoping that special effects will keep us interested and mere vignettes are sufficient. DiCaprio is hopeless as an actor when he is is required to show Hughes' slide into a compulsive isolated world. In fact the screen play gives no assistance in developing our understanding or sympathy for Hughes.Hughes' story has all the makings of a great tradegy; the hero brought down by the tragic flaw of compulsion possibly aggravated by physical injury. The only tragic element in this movie is that so much money and talent was wasted making it!It is an indictment of the movie industry that this movie is considered Oscar winning quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustingly Boring!

Leonardo is horrible childish and an ugly sight to behold. The girl who played Ava is fat, churlish and downright weird. All are misfits! FBI should investigate why this super duper bore movie got so many Oscars this year. The only saving grace was few Computer enhanced visuals.

Likewise I disliked Cate Blanchett in 'Elizabeth. Here, however, both actors give terrific performances, Cate Blanchett is marvellous as Katherine Hepburn and diCaprio carries this very long film without once boring me. There are excellent supporting performances too, I particularly enjoyed Alan Alda as obnoxious Senator Brewster, and Jude Law is suitably gorgeous and raffish in a cameo performance as Errol Flynn.It is diCaprio's film though, and a very good film it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A visual showpiece","review":"It's not often that a bio pic comes along that impresses me.

Most of the actors did a good job.However, the acting by Leo was not that great and a little embarrassing to watch. His Texas drawl (trying hard to sound like Howard Hughes) was sad to watch. Also, he did not look like Howard Hughes (Howard was better looking).When it comes to Howard Hughes there is reality and the myth, and this movie portrayed the myth. Howard was supposed to be very shy and more strange than the movie portrayed.

Not only was the story foolish as written but it was played out by a lot of bad acting. Some woman played Kate Hepburn as if she were acting the part in Philadelphia Story and not as if she were a real live human being. The male lead gave a wooden performance that was made worse by his being forced to act the part of a psychotic, which he did not do well. Unfortunately, the actor really looks like a little boy trying to act like a grownup.

The filming and editing are all in order. Thing that bugs me most is Leo DiCaprio. He still is too young to take on roles like this.

Yes, the cinematics were first class, the special effects were great, but for the average intelligent viewer, if it does not help us understand or develop the main character it is just so much fluff.I admit Decaprio is not among my top 100 actors, but the acting was not enjoyable to watch, maybe the script was thin, but when Decaprio simply barks orders without any foundation of authority it was, well - *painful* to watch.I turned off the video not caring about the man, which is really sad because I am positive there is a really great story there that is worth telling, unfortunately, this time, it just did not happen.PS Yes I did give this DVD to a friend (with a warning) and requested that it not be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"great to the end and beyond","review":"at 2 3/4 hours , i didnt want this one to end , edlessly captivating thru the whole movie , sequel best sooner thanlater"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a pretty boring movie.

While there were a few bright spots, it was much, much, MUCH longer than it should have been. Don't dismiss me as the kind of movie watcher that can't stand a three-hour movie. Some of my favorite movies are the historical epics such as the Lord of the Rings, Braveheart, etc. However, this biopic just didn't have the steam to take me through three hours. The best part of the movie was the acting. DiCaprio did a fine job, and I think they picked the right people for Katherine Hepburn (Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Beckinsale, who isn't hard on the eyes, might I add). I just wish it weren't so long."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a great movie...But it's too long.","review":"This film is a total disappointment-and a big waste of time. Leo's portrayal of Howard Hughes did not get my attention. Hughes' life was enormous than life itself. He was a major player, a risk-taker, and a gambler. He was america's first billionaire who turned dreams into reality,and later He lived a reclusive life. He was the man who went all out to spend his money, investing it on movies, airplanes, & aviation. Long before \\"Jaws\\", \\"Hells Angels\\" was the first blockbuster film that was ever made-And Hughes used most of his money to produce this film. If was'nt for Hughes, there would'nt be technology that would lift us up to the clouds. Howard Hughes was a true innovator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, boring, don't waste your time","review":"I thought I would like it. The topic seems interesting enough.

Left a multimillionaire by the early death of his parents, Hughes embarked on a remarkable career in movies and especially aviation. He continually risked everything to follow his dreams.Leonardo di Caprio makes a good fist of the title role assisted by a strong support cast and director Martin Scorsese pulls out every trick in the cinematic book (lighting, sound, editing, special effects) to tell this amazing story.Suffers a few lulls in the latter half when exploring Hughes's mental illness but builds to a powerful conclusion.Yet another exceptional film from the master Martin Scorsese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie is an absolutely terrible viewing experience.The movie totally focuses on Hughe's mental illness, and commits the crime of glorifying it.Whatever happened to entertainment?Whatever happened to having an enjoyable experience of watching a film?"},{"rating":"1","title":"the aviator crash lands","review":"Wow... What a waste of good acting - and of three hours. This movie has an incredible cast - Leo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Ian Holm, Cate Blanchett, Jude Law, etc. etc., and some very fine acting from Mr. DiCaprio, but wow... what a let-down. The first hour was great - I LOVE Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn, but as Howard Hughes' mental state starts to decline, so does the movie. The middle, until the last half hour of the movie (the movie being 170 minutes) just drags ON and ON, with explicit scenes of Hughes just going nuts. I just didn't see the point besides that a great man was destroyed by obsessive compulsive disorder. I was bored and weirded out.

Good overview of Hughes life as a young man and the beginnings of OCD. Apparently his mother taught him as a young boy how to spell QUARANTINE, told him of all the diseases, and that he was not safe. If that hadn't happened, we're led to believe, he would have been just fine. Perhaps a genius when it came to airplanes, just couldn't get it together in his personal life.This film could have been a lot shorter, OR it could have been more complete in Hughes' biography. Overall, interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have been wanting to see this film since this past Christmas, 2004. I finally saw it last night and was very disappointed. I cannot believe this movie got nominated in the \\"Best Picture\\" category at the Academy Awards. I can understand why \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" won, and I haven't even seen THAT movie.I found this film, as a whole, weird. Some of the soundtrack music was annoying, and reminded me of some of the music from \\"Bugsy,\\" Warren Beatty's early 1990s film. It was just eery, strange, or downright annoying.Leonardo DiCaprio is a fine actor, but he doesn't look anything like Howard Hughes. Not that it really matters. In my opinion, this film is a turkey.

Anyway, Leo shows he still has great acting chops (Basketball Diaries, Gilbert Grape) and let's not forget the wonderful Cate Blanchet. Yet, I did find myself glancing at my watch more than once and I wasn't too thrill with the editing in the last ten to fifteen minutes of the film. But it is a big story, great vision, and it was well executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Longer They Are, The Worst They Are","review":"Why is Hollywood compelled to keep making three hour movies that could be done in two?

Having seen and heard Howard Hughes speak, walk, smile, etc., the casting was absurd.Did not think that the movie dwelt enough on the many accomplishments and inventions of Mr. Hughes.Some of which are in use today - seemed more like a movie geared to silly teenagers with too much attention to sex scenes. Goofy"},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"I was excited to see this movie, and then found myself getting very restless in the crowd. What am I missing? I felt like I was watching someone read a book.Leo did a great job playing a tormented man. I just did not get into the story. A movie about rich people in movie's. Great idea! 3 hours to portray what could have been done in one and a half? I think they could have really added some details and went further into his life.To me it was about planes and movies.

They were too often schmaltzy, shameless, and as historically accurate as a politician's memory. But at least they knew how to tell a story and make it interesting. On the other hand, The Aviator replaces story line with jumbled imagery, dialogue with rapid-fire editing, and a heavy-weight subject with a light-weight actor who gets serious by scowling and stamping his foot as any 12-year old might. Surely Hughes deserves better, I know the audience does. The moral is that no amount of fiddling with period detail or special effects can make up for a chaotic core. Shame on you, Martin Scorsese for lending your good name to this cinematic mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"We added this movie to our family collection.We enjoyed this film on the Big screen and now we can enjoy it at home.Thanks to Amazon Prime and FREE SHIPPING.Shopping from home does not get any better that Amazom Prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful!","review":"I saw this movie this past weekend and I was extremely impressed!

Now he's a sad parody of himself, pitching a tired, bloated, by the numbers tale that runs out of gas not long after the premiere of Wings, which is where this tale should have ended. Everything after Hughes' short lived triumph is a predictable slide into madness. DiCaprio hams it up like the histrionic bore he's always threatened to be, while La Blanchett proves once again how over-rated she is. Her tiny little feet don't come close to filling Katherine Hepburn's shoes. This movie projects an illusion of class. It's insincere, pretentious waffle. Jonathan Demme's overlooked gem, Melvin & Howard, managed to say a whole lot more about Howard Hughes in five minutes than this overstuffed turkey manages in numerous hours.

I love classic movies and epic movies but this one is just terrible in my opinion. I just think someone else could have done a better job directing the movie as well as acting in it.

I personally think the movie should have won best picture of the year. Leonardo, much to my surprise, depicted the real Howard Hughes beautifully. Cate Blanchard, who played Kathryn Hepburn, was amazingly believable, as was the person who played Ava Gardner. The special effects, especially when he crashed the plane were very dramatic and realistic. I am an aviation buff, and love movies about flying. Aviator had enough aviation to be satisfying, and an amazing inside look at the mind of this incredible man. His paranoia, his idiosyncrasies, and his charm were lain bare. It is very worth buying and keeping in your film library. I could watch it two or three more times and still see something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lavishly produced portrait of an American enigma","review":"I recently rented this at our local library, and unfortunately all they had was the\\"full screen\\" version - meaning, chopped off at the sides.

I wish Scorcese had taken more time at the beginning to develop Hughes' character, and spent less time on his relationship with Katherine Hepburn (whom I found REALLY annoying).\\"The Aviator\\" is not a definitive depiction of Howard Hughes' life (nor does it pretend to be) but if you enjoy lavishly-produced movies with great sets, decent acting, and a sense of history, you'll enjoy \\"The Aviator.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"'Aviator' - - ok,overrated,not thrilling","review":"WhenI first saw the aviator,i was dissapointed.I thought most of the scences were way to long or extended and the movie would focus on one part then move to something else.(now,if you want a great time at the movies,and a great movie overall,see 'sin city.')The aviator had it's moments,but i am going to have to give this a thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS A LITTLE UPSET THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE TO THIS!!!!","review":"I was a little upset with this movie,because it was slow in certain areas in the movie and it was too long!!!!!!

I understand that Mr. Hughes was a busy and complex man, and that the movie spanned years of his life, but there was a serious lack of continuity.

There is a line where he actually compares her to her, \\"moonface\\" friends.

Not to mention that all this fancy and bizarrely sick killing is done by someone that has been otherwise a model citizen up to now? The psychology just doesn't match. Not buying it.

The author dispels several misconceptions about Islam and Christianity, and he builds a solid legal case of the eminence of \\"AL-Mesih Isa\\" (Messiah Yeshua/Christ Jesus) directly from the Qur'an. I've read several books on Islam, but this one is different. It is not angry and confrontational, but instead is gentle and loving.

Because if someone doesn't believe that Islam is a valid religion, it can't be used to 'prove' something else. Falsehood does not prove truth (as a logical principle).The title is misconstrued too though as love of God and God's love for humanity is mentioned just as much in Islamic texts.The author seems very sincere though and like a nice man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"I bought this book to help my with my Muslim friends.

On a positive note - my dogs like them and the colors are acceptable. I bought them because I have been looking for couch protectors for a long time, and most that are made specifically for dogs are very expensive.What I can't stand is that these blankets are made in China (not mentioned anywhere in the description) and they are disintegrating in the wash. I've washed them multiple times, and each time there are wads of very fine fabric dust all over the dryer walls. I have to wipe out my dryer with damp paper towels each time I wash one of these. Makes me wonder what type of toxic dust is being emitted every time you touch one of these. I am going to dispose of them and buy a couple of the expensive throws made in the U.S."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Throw Blanket","review":"The blanket was well made has worked out well to protect our couch when our grandsons dog visits.I woiuld purchase again from this retailer.

Many of her Decca recordings do not do full justice to her huge strong voice. Fortunately, her Isolde and Brunnhilde with Karl Bohm (Deutsche) more accurately captures her voice. Now too these recordings join the ranks of those two legendary recordings. In these recordings, she is recorded closer and you can feel the power of her voice more realistically.

The error rate I experienced was around 35%. I had scanned 30 cards, wasting time correcting data, and then the program crashed. In OSX. I hardly ever see a program crash. But here's the kicker: it didn't save the work at any point. In fact, there was no save funtion I could find easily, just export. I returned it right away, and ordered the CardScan Executive, which I run under Windows XP in Boot Camp. While it costs twice as much, its error rate is much more forgivable, at about 10%, with about 25% perfect scans/reads so far.

I bought Hazen because it was on sale and the band LOOKS hardcore. Unfortunately I was mistaken.The sound is uninspiring and VERY amateurish. Too many call and response hooks, the song writing is so simplistic it borders on annoying in many songs. I guess my main disappointment is that there are many quality bands out with alot of talent and potential who are not getting a shot while sub-par talent with industry connections move up the ladder.Hazen St. would make an excellent rock band to play at your local bar but to pay your money for their album? I would recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album rocks from start to finish","review":"Its a rare thing for me to love an album from start to finish and so Hazen Street really got my attention from the beginning because every song is a great. \\"Are You Ready?\\" gets me jumping every time and \\"Fool the World\\" and \\"Trouble\\" always put me in a good mood.

They sound like a cross between Eminem without the swear words, Will Smith, and an extremely tiny bit of Linkin Park. This disc is also very short, only 38 minutes long. I would much rather reccommend Good Charlotte for an alternative rock CD, or Linkin Park for a hip-hop/heavy metal/rap CD. Don't be fooled by Good Charlotte's endorsement for this CD. The only reason they are endorsing it is because Benji and Joel are singing background vocals on 2 of the tracks. The CD was really a disappointment.

(Go, Go!)","review":"Japanese avant-garde soft porn from maniac genius Koji Wakamatsu, who produced dozens of surreal, bleak pink films in the late sixties. Less claustrophobic and significantly more watchable than the almost unbearable \\"Violated Angels\\" (Wakamatsu's most famous film in the West), \\"Go, Go Second Time Virgin\\" is the bracingly nihilistic tale of two disillusioned youths, mutually victimized and devoid of hope, who form a fatal alliance. He's a bespectacled outcast prone to murderous violence, she's a multiple rape victim. Don't look for a happy ending in this one. The best movie I can recall that takes place almost exclusively on a single city rooftop. Also, my favorite use of repetition in a title outside of \\"Faster, Pussycat! Kill, Kill!\\" An exclamation point and it would be perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessness Glorified","review":"It would be hard to find a bleaker film. Wakamatsu's film is considered one of the classics of late 60's, early 70's Japanese underground film and that is unfortunate. The central character is [violated]..., and then hangs out in the same place, only to be [violated]... again. In portraying such an evil crime in this manner, the Director is adding fuel to the idea that some women want to be....

That really takes me out of the feeling of the show to be honest with you. It's not a deal breaker, but it isn't good.The show focuses on a fictitious Las Vegas casino and the main characters are all employees. The biggest focus is on the security angle, but there are other angles to it as well such as problems with the entertainment, trying to keep high-stakes gamblers happy, etc. The show is fast paced and very well put together.If I had to pick out some things to complain about, at times they get a little too happy just showing this or that celebrity that I really couldn't care much less about. There are also a couple stinkers of episodes, but I mean with what 23 in a season that's bound to happen.

I don't know how to define these guys, but here's an attempt: Take Alien Sex Fiend (seemingly the one strongest influence), Propellerheads, Nina Hagen and PHM-era NIN, wrap them up in vinyl and add lots of references to satanism and blood. That's kind of what this fantastic album sounds like. It's all over the top, no malice intended, great dancy fun for PVC gatherings. I'd love to see them in concert. If you like this, check out Alien Sex Fiend. Same kind of stuff in an Eighties version."},{"rating":"2","title":"yesssss","review":"ok heres what i want you to do...if you dont allready have it go buy Ministry's \\"mind is a terrible thing to taste\\".

I really can't say enough, although to complete the set you should also pick up Kooler Than Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hit wonder (At least on this album)","review":"I love edgy, alternative music, and was expecting much more from this group than what I got. 'Daisy Chain 4 Satan' and 'Waiting for Mommie' are actually pretty good, with some awesome sampling added that makes them really snappy. However, the rest of the album is a mish-mash of uneven quality, without any real draw. For some reason they decided to repeat 4 of the tracks on this CD, but it's a mystery as to why they did it. Supposedly they're different versions, but the differences are so subtle as to be almost imperceptible, and don't enhance the songs that were remixed. Look for it in a bargain bin near you. :("},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"This is a good video. Kinda boring. It shows a cobra spit at Steve without sunglasses.

Oddly, a few reviewers have given it marginal ratings as a consequence. I'm wondering if they read the title. The Naked Buddha is clean, precise, and poignantly written. Take the core of Buddhism, carve away the stratta of insubstantial and possibly distracting tradition, and here's what you get: the real thing. The Buddha's teachings were meant to be accessible, easy, and life changing. Here the author captures that intent in a language that I found rather pleasant and enjoyable. I've gone through my share of Buddhist teachings and this one stands out as the richest, the one I'll come back to time and time again (in addition to Mindfulness in Plain English)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good for Beginners","review":"Wish I'd read this book years ago, when I first started studying Buddhism. Howley strips away the various cultural accretions that make most strains of Buddhism confusing/contradictory to a novice, thereby laying bare the essence of true and original Buddhism.

It's rated at 1000M under the water and has huge oversized buttons to allow pushing them while wearing gloves. The glareproof crystal is great and you will never see a reflection under any condition. If there's any watch that's built like a tank, this is it. No none else makes anything like it and I think it is a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schubert Symphonies","review":"Schubert's first 6 symphonies were written for either student or amatuer orchestras. To me, they have never sounded quite right when played by full symphonic orchestras such as the Vienna Philharmonic, etc. These performances by the Handover Band, on period instruments, are played with great sparkle and energy. The later symphonies are excellant as well, with the 8th & 9th receiving performances of depth & substance.The recordings are problematic as the winds sound very hazy & distant. For those who have equallizers, a 2db increase at 2K hz will bring the winds forward and therefore much easier to follow the lovely woodwind melodies. Buyers beware, there is no booklet or program notes of any kind. Still these performances comprise an excellant Schubert cycle and a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet color book for the unicorn lover !!!","review":"I didn't know it would have so much legendary information on each page.

The common thread for the poor reviews of this book is that those reviewers did not comprehend all of the material in the book, or they had a pre-determined formula of how to write. I can also say with certainty, for a number of the reviews, the reviewer did not read the entire book.Bickham does not mince words, is not at all vague, and gives painstakingly specific advice based on years of teaching, and writing books that get published. Furthermore, the end of the book consists of several appendices of annotated published manuscripts which explicitly demonstrate the structure he describes. Believe me, he couldn't be more clear. As such, I also think this book is suitable as a first book on writing a novel.Indeed, if you only bought one book on how to write a novel, this one would do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crucial for Writers","review":"For anyone out there who is trying to hone their craft or just getting started this boook is a must - DO NOT MISS- Since reading this my writing has changed tremendously and I have been writing for 10 years.

This is about fun, writing fun and reading fun, at least to me anyway. I want books I wright to be fun, fun to write and fun to read. I'll take \\"Pot Boiling\\" as some other reviews have stated this is, I'm quite content to leave windmill tilting to more suitably equipped, perhaps better educated individuals.

And to say that every scene should end in disaster... I reread that multiple times to be sure that's what he was saying. Imagine a Clancy novel with this approach. There would be no resolution!Skip this book. Get Stephen King's On Writing, and Elements of Style.

Unlike other books on the craft of writing a short story or novel, Scene & Structure does not start at the beginning of the writing process and move forward; instead, it ambles from topic to topic with no overall guidance. Also, the author's corny references to himself (such as regretting his age) are silly and misplaced. I didn't buy this book for a bunch of laughs, but to get serious help. The book Beginnings, Middles and Ends, for example, or one of the many books about whipping out a novel in 30 days give more pithy information in a more organized format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Product!","review":"Great book!

I wish I had this book long ago as it helped me piece together important structure concepts I did not understand.A minor criticism was that it was hard to read. I mean it was boring and the book's layout could be dramatically improved for readability. Very fine print with minimal line spacing of a very dry topic, made the book slow going. That said, the info was valuable enough that I kept slogging through. Simple layout appearance would make a huge difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great message, poorly edited.","review":"It amazes me that a book club that sells books to potential writers will allow such a poorly edited book to be released with their imprint.Bickham's message is solid gold.

But \\"Scene & Structure\\" outdoes them all. In concise, readable prose, Jack Bickham has told me how to fix every bit of fiction I've ever written. At the end of this book I really understood how to pace a novel. I feel that this book has enabled me to make my writing interesting, exciting and intimate. If you buy only one book about writing fiction, buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Structural Concepts","review":"Just getting down the concept of Scene-Sequel makes this book worth the price many times over. It reminds me of the linked-list concept in computer science. It might seem overly formulaic until you are shown that the parts, once identified, do not have to be in sequence, do not have to be in order from scene to scene, and can even be ellipsed when understood or otherwise inferred. The concept of adjusting pace by modifying the balance of scene and sequel is brilliant. No aspiring novelist should start his first novel (or begin revision of the first-draft at least) without reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you never knew you needed to know!","review":"This is an excellent book. Though Mr. Bickam's style and genre vary greatly from my own, I learned so much from this book. I knew my writing wasn't as sharp as it should be, but couldn't identify the problem. (My friends couldn't either). I would never have guessed I had a problem with structure. Mr. Bickam's model of scene-sequel helped me clean up and focus my writing, to tremendous improvement. Thank you, Mr Bickam!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the serious professional","review":"This book is the best book I've read to date on how to write a novel. As Bickham himself wrote, understanding structure frees the writer. Once you understand structure, then you can decide when and how to break the rules.According to Bickham, novels are made up of scenes, in which there must be conflict; transitions; and sequels, in which the viewpoint character reacts to conflict and determines a new course of action.The protagonist is the author of her fate; whatever happens at the end of the book is a result of decisions, she has made. An ending doesn't have to be happy, but it has to be satisfying; it has to answer the story question posed at the beginning of the book.Reading a good book on craft is very encouraging for the struggling writer and this is a great book on craft.The reviewer of the title \\"Melodramatic Crap\\" needs to edit his comments; the spelling errors detract from his message... among other things."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down.","review":"I was very disappointed by this book; the author wastes a lot of words presenting \`cookie cutter' techniques that seem wrong in many ways.

Most of the problems I had with this have been stated, but i became confused when he says things like reader's need to catch their breath, yet he doesn't make it clear how a reader should catch their rbeath, because he goes right back to insisting on constant disasters. I was concerned for my own characters, who would lose so much of the charm I've spent so much time trying to create if i followed these rules... i have ADHD, so i have one aderal to take a day, and i take it to immerse myself into a book... i have NEVER had so much trouble getting deep into a book as i did with this book. it was a waste of my time and my aderal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much on too little","review":"How Bickham managed to write 168 pages on just this concept is beyond me.

Buy that book instead, and you can learn a lot more than just this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula for Melodramatic crap","review":"The author suggests that ending with disaster is a fundamental part of the scene. It is beyond obvious that this is wrong! In the story is to have a happy ending, then at least the last scene must end in success. Even with this excecption, it still means the protagonist still has to overcome all of the obsticles in his way in the last few pages of the book. It would be extremely difficult to pull this off legitimately."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie is better.....","review":"Yay!

Ann Rule's book is good too, from what I remember.Con: The book didn't have photos, of which I was disappointed.Double Con: There was one time in the book the author had said that I considered EXTREMELY inappropriate. He refereed to one of the murdered girls as to have a \\"cute fanny\\". That bothered me. She died a horrible death. She didn't need to be violated again, this time by the author.Anyway, This book offers more detailed accounts on his crimes. Its grisly, but it needs to be told.It was a pretty cool read.

I have never seen a book so totally unresearched on both pricing and product description. The majority of the photos of the S&P's do not describe the material utilized in their construction, so one is left wondering if they are looking at plastic, metal or other material.No person interested in Salt & Pepper collecting should buy this as their first book. If you do, you'll be in for a big surprise when you try to buy an S&P that has been valued in this book for $12, but is belling for $48.For the more seasoned collector, it does have some decent pictures, but is more or less a rehash of better produced S&P Collecting books.If you've been collecting S&P's for over 6 months, you'll realize that this is a piece of utter tripe; execpt for the photos of the S&P's."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the collection","review":"Very nice book. plenty of nice colored pics and a large number of s/p shakers pictured in this book. i would deal with any of the people that i recieved books from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"This was the first book I bought on Salt and Pepper Shakers.

The author himself makes note that it was just casual note-taking that led to this booklet, not a major scholarly work he labored on.The Gods of Man covers deities from the following cultures: African, Aztec, Celtic, Chinese, Egyptian, Greek, Japanese, Mesopotamian, Norse, North American Indian, Oceanic, Roman, Santerian, Slavic, South and Central Native American Indian. Each culture has a small sampling of deities, with a brief definition of each. This book is meant more as a dictionary, NOT as large biographies of each deity.

Rather, this is a real page-turning thriller that Maugham more or less dashed off for the fun of it. But whatever Maugham wrote, including pot-boilers like this one, was written extremely well. The Black Magic theme in the hands of a lesser writer -- e.g., Dennis Wheatley -- is usually hopelessly lurid and over the top (albeit entertaining). But this is not the case with Maugham's \\"The Magician,\\" which is that true rarity -- a sophisticated thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-wrought, magical realism","review":"The plot is now ridiculously common; man loves girl, girl loves man, \\"evil\\" other man ensnares girl, man and another girl and man's mentor attempt to save girl...I won't divulge the ending. I was surprised. This is the earliest work, I have encountered, that tells this story. Once I got beyond my thought of been there/seen this a million times in the movies and on t.v., I really enjoyed this work. I am continually impressed with Maugham's ability to write dialogue; the way in which he uses the interacting dialogue of his characters to advance the plot of the story. An early work of Maugham's and an easy, enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will make you a jazz fan","review":"Sometimes live performances don't live up to to their studio counterparts, but in this case Krall adds dimension and depth to her already formidable studio recordings. Dexterously inventive, she puts improvisation back into jazz-isn't that is what jazz is all about? You'll recognize all the old standards, and some super arrangements. She knows how to swing and her up-tempo version of 'Devil May Care', to my ears, is slick and simply dazzling.(Warning: Jazz critics may turn their noses up at all this as they seem to do when a jazz artist achieves a modicum of popularity or crossover appeal(then they wonder why jazz is an endangered species) but just ignore them-Diana Krall is one of the best to come along in a long long time)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding","review":"Let it be said that I AM a Diana Krall fan.

I mean REALLY shines! I can't help but tap my foot, sing along and wish to god that I could play piano when I listen to this CD.It doesn't get any better than \\"A Case of You\\", \\"Maybe You'll Be There\\" and \\"I Love Being Here With You\\".

Put the two together, and you have Diana Krall - at her best ever in this live recording. The DVD blew me away. Then, I heard the CD and picked up on the tremendous talent that Ms. Krall and her combo present. It's great to watch (even with the body english and facial throes of her guest guitarist), but there is a level of professionalism that gets lost behind the visual splendor and that manefests itself through the audio performance.

This isn't it. These are, for the most part, simply cuts from her other albums, worked in about the same way. Adequate concert material, perhaps, but disappointing in a CD.If Krall fans were honest, they would have to admit that she is a jazz pianist first, with often great arrangements, but sadly lacking a voice. Her \\"speak-sing\\" is like Tony Bennent has become in his old age, or Sinatra at the end of his career.Still, at least instrumentally, she has a good feel for jazz which makes her worth a listen. Best on slow, melancholic ballads such as the haunting \\"A Case of You\\". Not enough of these on this album however. Again I came away wishing her albums were instrumental only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't sing ... she's bad","review":"She can't sing but she's a good jazz pianist. I like her earlier release \\"All For You: A Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio\\" much better.The tracks on this cd are uneven in recording quality - they were cut from different live and studio sessions.Previous reviewer justifiably compared her to Tony Benett as in seriously over-rated shouting. Ms. Krall has problems pronouncing words clearly, like her mouth was shot full of novocain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking about the DVD???","review":"Buy it. Now. Stop reading.Are you still reading???? Okay, so I'll tell you my reason why. Reason(s) why. 5.1 sound. DTS. Different (some versions better to my ears/psyche) than the CD. Flavor. Beautiful production. Did I mention DTS - you gotta hear this in DTS. And she and her band deserve and have earned every penny you could spend on her (gratuitously inciting flaming).I am just hoping that she will give us the opportunity to have DVD's covering her 'Girl in the Other Room' and her 'From This Moment On'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait to Get the DVD!!!","review":"What a rush! This CD is magnificent!! I had ordered all of Krall's CD's to date, but the quality and excitement was waning for me until I heard \\"Live in Paris.\\" More soul, longer improvisations, more piano, and fewer stock orchestral arrangments! The orchestra is there on some tracks, but very subdued. \\"Let's fall in Love\\" (Track 1) sets the stage as it rocks on with a driving force. I also enjoyed the \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" riffs in \\"Deed I Do\\"; \\"East of the Sun\\"; and \\"Devil May Care\\" (listen carefully to her piano choruses and you'll hear her sneak it in!). Great comeback to the small jazz club atmosphere, even though it's recorded live in a big hall. I also loved \\"A Case of You\\" -- it's a change for Diana and shows the depth of her talent. If you haven't bought a Diana Krall CD, start with this one -- you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the Hype","review":"Diana Krall is an excellent piano player and quite a distinctive vocalist. The thing I love about her is that she continues to work at it. Her interpretations of this music are intelligent, studied, and fresh, but they are also passionate. And as her interpretation of Joni Mitchell's \\"A Case of You\\" shows (without question) Diana can also be very sincere. I hope that she continues to move in this direction; her voice is just fine without all of the vocal tricks and various breath gimmicks. It also re-establishes some of her street credibility as a serious musician after some serious marketing faux pas's. I certainly don't mind gawking at Diana's gorgeous physique (her Honolulu concert that year was also quite good), but that's not why I buy her records.This is an excellent presentation of how affecting Diana can be, and is, I think, overall her best album yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good...","review":"This album really flows and swings. Very enjoyable. I am not thrilled about the last two songs. The Billy Joel song is OK. Not sure about the other one. Still, the live songs are just great. I heard this CD before any of her other CDs. I really like this one better than the studio CDs - not to say that the studio ones are in any way bad. This one is just really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"What could possibly be better?","review":"If you love this CD, you'll really flip out watching the DVD of this live performance. Played on a good surround sound receiver, this is a concert to remember. Several friends have watched and listened to my copy and have since purchased it for their own use. Several weren't aware that she is as good a jazz pianist as she proves on this concert. This is Ms. Krall at her very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected!","review":"I was expecting good, and it was better than that! Most of the songs are on other releases, but I liked the arrangements on this CD better. They provided more freedom for solos, and were more energetic as a whole.Many CD's have some selections you like a lot, and most you just sort of like. That's what I was expecting here, but instead I got the reverse. That is, there were a few selections I liked so-so, but most I really liked a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"She plays jazz standards with good voice and solid technique. That's it. I'm a little sad that many other creative jazz musicians don't have as much popularity as she does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money, money, money...","review":"It's too bad Diana betrayed the music she was promising so many times to be devoted too ( OK, she bent it ). Miles Davis wanted to be as famous as Michael Jackson, I wonder what a role model is for Diana. After 3 consecutive albums with same catchy material maybe it's time to go back to jazz...We'll be patient, since you're are a musical genius and a Canadian too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Red Bull and Some Vocal Coaching?","review":"Does this woman have any vocal range or vibrato at ALL? Or does she sing every single song in the same key, tempo and way? If she is the standard that other Jazz \\"divas\\" (Pardon the cliche.) are expected to live up to nowdays, then Jazz is seriously slipping. Jaimee Paul can outsing Krall ANY day of the week and with 20x more flava! She (Krall) may be an adroit pianist, but her voice leaves a LOT to be desired. Vocally, she chops the ends of every word/note short and in a live setting, I can't imagine her showing any more (or less) personality than she shows in her music already.With Shirley Horn, one feels warm all over. However, with Krall, there is no warmth; just cold, gray, lifeless and dull EVERYTHING. Granted, her voice is sexy with its raspiness, but by NO MEANS is it enough to tow the line for years to come. She could use a Red Bull and some vocal coaching in MY opinion.A personality wouldn't hurt either."},{"rating":"1","title":"New to Jazz Vocalists?","review":"Listen to Diana. Take out of CD player. Put in Ella....light a cigar and sip some brandy. Do not put back this back into CD player unless you need to sleep. Good Band...Poor styling."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW WHAT A LET DOWN!","review":"I ran across Diana Krall's name on Amazon while purchasing some blues CD's. Based on the almost universal wild acclaim in the reviews I decided to purchase her CD - the quality of the songs that were on the CD also convinced me that it would be very difficult for anyone to screw them up. I apologize to Diana Krall fans but I only made it through the CD 1 and a half times before I punched the eject button and tossed it in the trash - $... down the tubes. If you enjoy monotone, mumbled droning of classic music - please be my guest and buy this CD. Bob Dylan sings with more inflection in his voice than Ms. Krall."},{"rating":"1","title":"you know that","review":"shush shuh shuh shuh sound that new cordoroy pants make? Well that's what Krall sounds like wiht her sibilant \\"s\\". Is she singing through false teeth?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to her roots","review":"I've been converting friends and family to Jazz for years and have been especially passionate about the music of Diana Krall. Yes, the record company has been pushing her \\"look\\" - but it's the talent that makes her what she is. And with this album she has finally gotten back to her roots. Small group: drums, bass, guitar, and Diana at the head of the group on Piano and vocals. The occasional appearance of Orchestration only enhances the performance rather than drag it down (which is what unfortunately happened with Diana's last album). With the crowd behind her, the strong musicians she always associates with, and the tasteful selections of music she chooses, this is a must have for Jazz fans in general, and Diana Krall fans specifically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for those who have the DVD too","review":"This CD is 5 stars. The following songs are a little bit different recordings from what we have on the DVD, probably taken from different nights:The Look of LoveEast of the Sun (and West of the Moon)Maybe you'll be thereS'WonderfulA case of youDiana Krall live in Paris literally vaporizes her detractors...Hey Diana, come to So Paulo, Brazil!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana in Rare Form","review":"This is a very great record that demonstrates Diana's vocal prowess and clearly demonstrates she's more than just a pretty face. Her performance of \\"The Look of Love\\" really does stand out. She also shows that she can improvise with the best of them. Can't get enough of this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Dynamo","review":"Diana Krall is a double dynamo.Her \\"Live In Paris CD\\" is reminiscent of the George Shearing and Peggy Lee recording that I bought many years ago.However,Diana plays both parts.On the back of the CD jacket she is referred to as the Queen Of Piano Jazz.She is that as well as a first-rate singer.Even though I own the CD,I feel compelled to don the earphones and listen to it every time I enter a Border's store.It's also my Christmas present to everybody this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm there!","review":"I can't get enough of Diana Krall. I didn't realize that she was playing the piano AND singing until I saw her live. Krall's music is in my \\"happy place\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a fan of \\"Live\\" albums but this won me over.","review":"\\"Live\\" albums kind of feels like a cheapened concert experience (Why go for that when you can get the real thing?). But I really enjoyed this album. Her voice sounds rich and the instrumentations are really done well. Considering this was my first real listen to a Diana Krall album (a live one at that), I was very impressed. Most of the songs I've already heard other versions of, but Krall brings a fresh approach that never bored me. I will check out her other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEWSFLASH....","review":"Diane Krall cannot SING!!! I was at a party and they were playing this CD it is relatively new and it was played like it was the only cd they had. The musicality and artistry that is portrayed through her piano is extraordinary...then unfortunately, she opens her mouth, which sounds watereddown, gargled like a saxophone with duct tape over the bell opening. \\"Just the way you are\\" is a studio version done on the cd with Michael Brecker and Christian McBride, incredible musically, but then luckily we all know the words because the lyrics by Krall don't break thru the gargling...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana","review":"She is the hottest one in modern jazz.

I have all of her CD's and adore each one, but to hear her live is something else. There is a demension not present in her studio recordings, not better not worse, simply another facet to this talented woman. Live she is more energetic, more daring, more virtuosic. In the studio she is more intimate, more controlled. The only thing better than hearing the Paris CD would be to have heard the concert in person. Her performance of the rare gem \\"A Case of You\\" is priceless! I only regret that I must share her with so many countless others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She is live -- the group is live -- the disc is alive","review":"I was little disappointed in the most recent studio recording that Diana made -- but this IS like hearing her live in concert. Diana's voice gets a little ragged toward the end of the concert, but the back-up swings! Give it a listen. Just The Way You Are is fabulous. Gotta love her. I think she is more than just a pretty face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her voice is husky and cool","review":"The first time I listened to her voice, I could not really match her voice with how she looks. She is a pretty woman. But her voice is husky and cool. I youtubed her and saw some video clips of \\"Live in Paris\\" and other performance videos. I've noticed that she often performs with a very talented bassist John Clayton. He is awesome. People rave about Diana but I have to say that John and other artists who performed with Diana are cool too. I think I am going to check out John's new project through ArtistShare.

At times Graham's conclusions seem deliberately provocative, but, as someone who has always had an interest in ancient civilizations, I believe he is on solid ground with his scholarship. More recent archaeological and etymological studies have tended to support, rather than refute, his ideas.I found his interpretation of the Book of Revelation in terms of Gnosticism and Jewish astrology particularly interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This is by far one of the most pathetically argued books I have ever seen. I literally laughed when I read it. The book is filled with scientific and historical absurdities along with the ever ridiculous conspiracy theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought provoking, but the mysticism made for a dull read","review":"The book was thought provoking, but did not provide references to check. The occasional anti-semitic remarks were somewhat bothersome and all the mystical nonsense led me to think that the author himself is very superstitious. However, the book provided me with leads which I can check myself so that I can reach my own conclusions regarding the validity of the Bible.For instance, I have always suspected that many parts of the Judeo-Christian religion were \\"borrowed\\" from some other religion or culture. The author implies this but does not back up his claims with references. There are a few names and titles of books sprinkled here and there, but not a proper bibliography.Additionally, I recommend that the author take a few more courses in the scientific disciplines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"This guy is a serious kook.

He claims that Christ-ianity came into being in 3rd or 4 century CEMost scholars state that Paul started writinghis letters about 60CE and Mark wrote hisgospel about 75 CE (source Frontline on PBS4/6& 4/7/98)I don\\"t think I will waste time with the restof the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God, this is bad.","review":"If books on D&D and crystal rubbing provide a substantial amount of meaning in your life, this book is the one for you. If you are less New Age and more interested in historical scholarship or \\"proof\\" when trying to be persuaded, this book is a total waste, save its comedic value. I cannot prove this, but I think Graham was loaded on psychadelic mushrooms when he wrote the 300 pages of undocumentable, comic-book-like, fantasy-physics. Had he even a remote knowledge of at least one academic field he encounters, he might feel a little embarasssed at what he wrote. I am embarrassed for not only him, but these other reviewers that claim to have been enlightened from his work. Nuts.If you wanna do some Bible bashing, go with the historical-critical method and its champions. At least they know some history and can read in Greek and Hebrew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, not a scholarly work","review":"I was looking forward to a critical review of the bible. I was disappointed because this book is just a mass of conclusions and the supporting material is not footnoted so that I could check the basis of Mr. Grahams conclusions, particularly the scientific ones. He asks that the reader read the bible critically and challenge its assertions yet he does not provide the cites to his own resources. This book is not worth the time it takes to read it since Mr. Graham asks that you accept his conclusions at face value. To bad... it would have been a good book. I will keep searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but...","review":"This may be a good weapon to infuriate your Christian friends until they read it for themselves. I say this due to the glaring lack of ANY SUPPORTING EVIDENCE. Quoting poetry, philosophy, and ONES' SELF doesn't quite cut it. No Footnotes, Bibliography, Quotes, etc. I've tried looking for his subject matter on the Internet and I've found nothing. Check this book out at a local bookstore like I did. The book is interesting in concept and well written, but it is one long gratuitous statement. Credibility is usually evinced with supporting evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crackpot work","review":"Lloyd Graham rails against people who unquestioningly believe the Bible, yet expects us to accept his system of \\"Causation\\" on faith. He bases his whole work on this system, which is not backed up by solid scholarship. He implies that priests invented religion out of the blue and then wrote the Bible in order to force their invention on other people. His dates for various events are questionable and his etymologies of names are often twisted to produce the desired meaning. Worst of all, anti-Semitic remarks appear every so often throughout the book.

If you're looking for rational scholarship, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptions and Myths of the Bible","review":"Mr. Graham's book, Deceptions and Myths of the Bible is both a deception and a myth. Mr. Graham shows little knowledge of Theology or elementary earth science. This book consists mostly of building straw men and then knocking them down. Though a reproof of the Bible and Christians, Mr. Graham uses both Christians and the Bible as references when he feels they help make his case. Where did Mr. Graham get his knowledge? Who knows.

It is the story of a rather mischievous young squirrel named Nutkin who loves to tease old Mr. Brown, the owl who lives on an island filled with nut trees. The little rythmes and verses Nutkin recites throughout the story are absolutely delightful. The illustrations are one of Ms. Potter's finest---filled with wonderful detail and color. Some might be offended by the way Nutkin is punished by old Mr. Brown---mainly by having his tail torn off, but if one thinks about it that is the way owls behave in nature. Ms. Potter never honeys things over and her tales always remain a joy to read. Children should not miss out reading this humorous tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well bound","review":"Cute little book perfect for little hands.

This movie is so funny. Woody Allen is a genius. Seriously. From the moment i put the movie in, i was hooked on this movie.

The good part is that he really tried to make something light, enjoyable, happy ending, not using instrospectiveness all the time. Also, Allen himseld says, on the DVD extrar, that the main reason for the success of this movie was that Dreamworks promoted it with energy, a thing that seldom occurred before.There are simply not enough jokes here. You'll feel comforable watching it, but not laughing. Two-third of the csat disappears before the middle of the movie (Michael Rapaport and Levitz), and at least we get an Elain May in top form.This is more like a \\"study\\" than a real movie by Allen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing.","review":"I have never been able to watch a whole Woody Allen movie. This one took two sittings, but I was determined to see at least one thru to the end. And what was the point? The only reason I was able to was because of Tracey Ullman and Hugh Grant. Woody Allen is so aggravating with his ranting and raving and complaining. It's jut not funny. I didn't laugh one time, kept waiting for a punch line or something. Nothing.

Well, they are poor, they loved each other, basically what this movie's about. Woody always have plans to get rich, but Tracy would always shoot them down. The movie started with Woody gathering a few friends to dig a tunnel to the near by bank from a shop they rented. Tracy makes her famous cookies as a cover. Well, the small time crooks dug, Tracy's cookie business took off... They turned rich over night. Tracy wanted to be among the elites, while Woody still favors the way they used to live... But things didn't turned out as Tracy would hope... And soon, Tracy realized money changed, but Woody is always true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light comedy","review":"This is a surprisingly old-fashioned comedy from Woody Allen. It is a much lighter film than most of his recent ouvre, but the frequent suggestion that this movie is unphilosophical is false -- there is a message in the film about the futility of trying to transcend one's working-class roots, a rather undemocratic sentiment. Nonetheless, the movie mostly is going for yuks instead of trying to make a statement, and at that level it succeeds. And how often do you get to see the scrawny, nebbish Allen mimic Jackie Gleason's large and loud Ralph Cramden? You do here, and I found it quite amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Time Crooks, Small Time Comedy","review":"Woody Allen is seldom bad, but even he cannot overcome a repetitive series of ethnic joke sequences and a monotonous script. At first, one is almost waiting for the burlesque drum \\"thump\\" at the end of the obvious gags, but after the third or fourth time one wonders when something new is going to happen. The plot is thin and implausible while not really being funny. The concluding half hour has a canned, almost desperate-to-finish quality. Don't buy this movie before renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woody Allen's second-worst","review":"The first 30 minutes or so are fun. After that, \\"Small Time Crooks\\" becomes a terrible embarrassment. It does not mark a return to his early comedies; it marks the loss of all the humor and wit that has characterized his writing and filmmaking since the beginning. I am a big Woody Allen fan. I've seen every film he's directed (except \\"September,\\" \\"Another Woman,\\" and \\"Shadows and Fog\\") and I've enjoyed all of them but \\"What's Up, Tiger Lily?\\" (which Woody himself tried to disown almost as soon as he was done with it). \\"Small Time Crooks\\" is his worst film ever, hands down. Rather, it WAS his worst film ever, until the painful \\"Curse of the Jade Scorpion\\" came along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Time Results !","review":"Even the genius of Woody Allen couldn't save this weak story and even weaker cast. Anyone who has the slighest dislike for Hugh Grant will hate him at the end of this film in which he play his usual whining pompas Englishman. Just when this film is starting to find it's feet it has a stupid twist that would work if it was the slighest bit funny - it's not. In all, Woody is just some amazingly talented and his body old work is great enough to let this one die a quiet death. My advice, wait until this DVD is reduced in price or buy it at auction so you won't feel like you've done your money !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I've seen nearly all of Woody Allen's films & consider myself a huge fan, but this was a huge letdown....even by the standards of lightweight comedy it's disappointing. Except for a couple of scattered scenes, nothing here displays Woody's typical wit and insightfulness. The characters are cartoonish and unlikable, and the production is flashy and garish. Even comparing Small Time Crooks to other recent films of Allen's (let alone his masterpieces of the 70s & 80s...you know which ones), there's none of the fun found in Bullets over Broadway and Mighty Aphrodite, the dark wit found in Deconstructing Harry, or the quiet soulfulness of Sweet & Lowdown. If you must see this one, rent it--definitely not one to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This has to be Woody's worst effort","review":"As a big Allen fan, I expected the usual amount of laughs...about 1-2 every 5 minutes. This movie provided maybe 3 laughs from start to finish. This is my first review ever in Amazon, but the film was bad enough to compel me to post this to prevent anyone to spend money on this. Rent it only if you are really compulsive to see every Woody Allen movie. Very slow and predictable. You were warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is your wallet speaking, save your money!!","review":"This DVD was so wonderful I and everyone watching it, fell asleep 45 thrilling minutes into it. I am a huge fan of both Jon Lovitz and Michael Rappaport, and was expecting this to be a good old fashioned comedy without all of the sexual preversion found in many recent comedies. I was wrong, it wasn't even a comedy. It was an extremely annoying movie being that Woody Allen talks the entire time, and never shuts up long enough for anyone to get a word in edgewise. I have seen and enjoyed other Woody Allen movies, but not this one. I would strongly suggest that you keep your money and spend it elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SMALL","review":"This train set is much, much smaller than it's photo.

Now she's showing me stuff that I had no clue on how to do with my iPhone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh what tangled webs we weave...","review":"Three actors of HBO's \\"Rome\\" (Cirian Hinds, James Purefoy and Polly Walker) make this movie a tragic and twisted joy to watch. You find yourself sympathizing and then hating each of the characters (save one) from one moment to the next. Everyone lies for selfish ends and yet no one seems to fully get what they desire.Cirian Hinds is masterful in his role, and it is up to YOU to decide whether you ultimately felt sorry for him, or if he gets what he deserves....Only 2 things keep me from giving this film 5 stars - James Purefoy gives a laughable Scottish accent, and Jodhi May (the innocent girl in the film) irritatingly snarls her mouth when she is emotional. BUT the overall movie is a twisted tale - that was delightful to watch for the romances - and fun to watch in hating those who are deceitful! Set in mid 1800's England, this intriguing find is more than just about hay harvesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing and well acted","review":"I found this version of the Mayor of Casterbridge to be very satisfying. The characters are somewhat one dimensional - the wife is long suffering, Mr. Farfrea is perpetually optimistic and good, the mayor is all bad, and the daughter is an innocent pawn- but it is done with surprisingly good effect. You see yourself in all of these people. You root for them. You pain for them. I really wanted to save the mayor from himself, but I both applauded and regretted his end. It was totally engrossing. The scenery helps to make it all real. It's well cast and the acting was on point."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Need to See This One","review":"After reading the posted reviews on this movie, I purchased it. I was not dissapointed. I loved this movie, the plot, the characters, its twists and surprises. I have watched it over and over. I highly recommend this one. Thanks to all who led me to the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man tormented","review":"If you are in the mood for serious story telling, this adaptation of a Thomas Hardy Classic will easily fit the bill. The Mayor of Casterbridge gives a compelling look into the life of a reformed alcoholic. Ciaran Hinds in every way masters the range of emotion and intensity needed to convey the essence of Michael Henshard. James Purfoy as his friend soon becomes a target for Henshard's demons. These two were later teamed up once again in HBO's epic ROME. Polly Walker also plays important women in both stories. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Closed Caption or Subtitles - Shame on You!","review":"When will film and TV distributors recognize that there is a growing audience of viewers that require either closed caption and/or Subtitles for Home Viewing? They are capricious to discriminate against those who have a physical impairment that is not of their own doing. In fact, I would be so bold to suggest that Amazon (and others selling Video Products of this nature) BOLDLY LABEL these products as either friendly or non-friendly to the hearing impaired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greek tragedy, British style","review":"I've never in my life seen a film so continually and artfully portray the scourge of ego and vanity in a man's life, to the predictable tragic end. This poor guy can never do what is wise and good (in the moment) because of his powerful ego, and very soon regrets it, even before having to pay the price. And he just keeps doing it, almost compulsively, over and over again. And even to the very end, his ego dominates by ultimately condemning him, and demanding maximum punishment. That in a nutshell is what dominates this film. Clarian Hinds brilliantly dominates this film. You have to credit him and the director (primarily) for taking what could have been a rather stodgy soap opera, and turning it into a very fine film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment","review":"This is an exceptionally well-acted period piece. Ciaran Hinds (Rome, Phantom of the Opera, Persuasion)is perfect for the role of the Mayor, who, as a young man, and completely inebriated, auctions off his wife and baby daughter to the highest bidder. (A passing sailor takes her and the baby, and they leave the area). When he sobers up, he realizes what he has done, and makes a promise never to drink for 21 years. 19 years later, the wife is now a widow, and she comes to find him, in hopes of obtaining help. She finds that he has done quite well as a merchant, and is now the mayor of the town of Castorbridge. The movie moves on through the next few years, with twists and turns in the plot. Ladies: get out your Kleenex for the ending, because it jerks a few tears, but the movie is very enjoyable, and well worth it. The scenery and costumes are splendid, and the supporting actors do a fantastic job in rounding out the cast. This movie is a worthy addition to any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Being a fan of this type of literature, I couldn't wait to watch this. But I hadn't read the book. About 15 minutes into it, I couldn't stand the boredom and never finished watching the movie.However, if you are a fan of the book and a Thomas Hardy fan, it's probably a must for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mayor of Casterbridge","review":"This is another movie that I have been wanting to purchase. I have never seen or read Thomas Hardy so I didn't know what to expect. My reason for purchasing it was because of the lead actor. The movie is excellent but more on the dark side like the Bronte sisters writings. Since I have not read the book I do not know how well it follows the original text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adaptation","review":"I've seen this movie 3 times on A&E, and I loved it. The Mayor of Casterbidge is about a man named Michael Henchard, who sold his wife and baby daughter to a sailor at a county fair after he had had too much to drink. He regets this the next morning, and swears not to \\"drink anything stronger than tea\\" for the next 21 years. 19 years later his wife and her daughter come searching for him, and find him the mayor and respected citizen of a town called Casterbridge. The rest of the story is filled with complications, secrets and everything in between. This is the story of the rise and fall of Michael Henchard. All of the main charactures are wonderfully played by Ciaran Hinds, Jodhi May, James Purefoy, Juliet Aubry and Polly Walker, the supporting cast is great as well. The script stays close to the book, the story is beautiful and bitter sweet, and the sceenery is breathtaking. All in all this is a great movie, and I highly recomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas Hardy adaptation","review":"The quality of the dvd was excellent, and this BBC presentation very well done. I'd recommend it to Thomas Hardy fans. They won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of subtitles is a disappointment.","review":"I would love to own this DVD because of Ciaran Hinds whom I admire greatly, but the above description of the production says nothing about sub-titles, so it would be of little use to me. I can hear well, but have trouble understanding the dialogue. So A&E has lost another sale here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Emotion--Don't waste your time and money","review":"I have watched both the A&E and the BBC production of this movie after reading the book. I must say that the A&E leaves much to be desired. Had I not read the book, I would not have understood all that was going on as far as feelings between the father and daughter--very bland. No emotion between the two main characters. In the BBC production, you were pulled into the very hearts of the father and daughter--acting was super!! If you want to see this film and get the true story, don't waste you money on the A&E. Get the BBC production. I'm glad I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pietrp 3","review":"A low rate because of the lack of the subtitles who helps to undestand foreign people not so accustomed with spoken english"},{"rating":"1","title":"So not good.","review":"Dull dull, dull and too depressing.

I was excited to see it on dvd at the movie rental store and decided to check it out once more. Sadly, it doesn't stand the test of time. While the cast is terrific, they just couldn't rise above a lukewarm script and a shoddy production. The action sequences are so staged looking that I felt like I was watching a youtube video.I was surprised to learn that the producer had worked on The Guns of Navarone. Now that's a movie that stands up. If you want a good military adventure, check out Navarone or Where Eagles Dare (also starring Richard Burton) or Uncommon Valor (with the great Gene Hackman)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very verosimile.","review":"It is a pity that a wonderful picture is demerited by Roger Moore' performance. Her's good for a dandy, in the continent, but in this film he is not convincing at all. He is verry debonnaire, like he is just sipping tea in Great Britain.Thus, the film becomes stiff and you don't believe it. The other actors simply try to do something, like a farce.

I have it on good authority that Cessna 210's, while excellent aircraft, are NOT capable of dropping napalm or bombs.Good God.The only good thing about this barker is the number of FN-FAL's on display.Joe Bob says 1 star.

I encourage all to sign up on the waiting list to hopefully persuade the studio to release this on DVD. Hard to believe ALL the second rate sequels, which star none of the original cast, are readily available on either DVD or at least VHS and it is next to impossible to find a good used copy of this, which has been out of print for some time.

It paints a pretty fair picture of many of the growing pains of post colonial black africa wrapped up in the guise of a shoot 'em up war movie. The cast is superb and the story line while a little predictable and formulaic still makes a good pic to watch on a rainy afternoon.The understory is still going on. Just look to Sierra Leone, Rwanda and a number of other countries in sub-sahara Africa and you'll see what I mean.

One particular page of The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon contained over eight As If phrases. I found the author's lack of verbal imagination distressing.

The account doesn't just tell how they did it - it covers the aftermath of the break-out, which involved getting out of Germany entirely. It may read like fiction with high drama, but The Wooden Horse is pure fact and an important chronicle in the history of the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was spell-binding!!!","review":"I read this book for a book report.

It's probably my all time favorite book. In my opinion, the first 1/2 of the book, which outlines the actual escape from the POW camp, is a little better then the 2nd half where they are trying to get out of Germany. The story is truly amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice story","review":"If you enjoyedThe Great Escape, you will enjoy this one as well. The story on this book happened at the same prison camp, at the same time. The difference is that these 3 guys made it all the way to England. I'm not spoiling the story, the author tells that on the first pages.The only thing I would change on this book is that I would tell the real story, with real names. The author changed the story, renamed people and changed some facts. I wish I could tell fact from fiction when reading.Very nice. I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written as \\"faction\\" rather then non-fiction","review":"The story is true and very interesting, but Eric Williams made a couple of horrible mistakes in writing this. One is that he changed the names of all the main characters and wrote it in third person. It comes across as a novel rather then non-fiction and Williams has admitted that some of it was added at the insistence of his publisher to make it more exciting. It simply isn't as good a book as it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Shame","review":"What a shame we didn't have the recording technology of today when the tracks of this album were originally layed down.

Now, without Michael Denner, Timi Grabber and Kim Ruzz, it Bris a band which lives sorely upon Hank Shermann's virtuosity in the guitar.

Now they sound just like a bad trash metal band. This album lacks even a single interesting theme, but has plenty of repetitive ones with no direction. Where are the vocal harmonies, the twin guitar melodies and tricks, the eerie atmosphere, or the breaks and time signature changes ?I love the sound of a distorted guitar, but simply stepping on the ol' stompbox doesn't guarantee a great song! Also, the production is muddy, and the vocals are buried in the mix.I was expecting a lot more from the likes of Shermann/Diamond, given MF's early masterpieces, 'Melissa' and 'Don't break the Oath', two albums I'll bring with me to a lonely island, even without a means to play them. If you're new to MF, buy those instead.

These should be in the collection of anybody who likes heavy music. It is because of these albums that I was stupid enough to buy \\"9.\\" This was a BIG MISTAKE. The band playing on \\"9\\" is nothing more than a parody of Mercyful Fate. Where are the great double-guitar solos? Where are the thought-provoking lyrics? Where is the excellent layering? Not here! As far as I am concerned, the band performing on \\"9\\" bears no more resemblance to \\"the original\\" than Iron Maiden did without Dickenson.

Its fast and heavier than anything they have ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"LEGENDS NEVER DIE.......THEY BURN IN HELL!","review":"A strong collection of songs from the band with a few different things to keep it all fresh. A welcome return to darker Satanic style lyrics, which suite the Fate style so much better than silly songs about Headless Horsemen etc. Highlights are many, perhaps House on the Hill with its interesting arrangement on the chorus or its sister song Burn in Hell. But like most Fate or Diamond material a few weeks listening will uncover new favourites! Good to see the band expanding its styles! Yeah I love Melissa and Dont Break the Oath, but that was then and this is now! Praise be to Satan that this band is dedicated enough to still be around to entertain us all! \\"If thine ears deceive thee, block them up with thy fingers!\\" Haha haahahahaha! Mercyful Fate still rule Hades!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Fate's best, but still better than most!","review":"This CD represents a very solid effort on the part of Mercyful Fate. Without a doubt this is the most straight-forward, hard-driving album the band has ever done. Unfortunately, that straightforwardness takes some of the luster off when compared to the band's earlier efforts. Still, having said that, Fate gets it right where so many other bands get it wrong! If are looking for an album that rocks (and I mean ROCKS! ), look no further. While I prefer the more complex and intricate songs found on the band's earlier efforts, the musicianship on 9 is still excellent and nobody, and I mean nobody, sings like the King! Long live Mercyful Fate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ ON, LEARN THE LAW AND BURN IN HELL","review":"Reviews with 3 stars or less are totally *** reviews !

Another Mercyful Fate album! Cool! I put it on! Hmm! Pretty good songs. Lyrics and vocals . . . the same as ever. One problem. Something's missing and I can't put my finger on it! Maybe it's the lack of Michael Denner? Maybe not! I'd like to say I think this is great, but I can't. On the other hand it doesn't TOTALLY bite.

I use to like alot of bands that came out of the 80's( metallica, Maiden, ect.) but by '99 they began to.. well.. suck. Other bands were still good but not as good. MErcyful fate is an exception. This CD still makes ya bang your head more and more as you listen to it. some tracks are kinda slow.. but they still kick total a$$... This is a MUST get for any fans of metal, 80's metal, or fans of M.F.'s preveous work.

This band has little in common with the original band. That's my first complaint. My second complaint is that the lyrics and songs are really lame.

Obviously, Bruce Catton was at the forefront of his genre, weaving meticulously footnoted anecdotal material with insightful historical analysis using a highly literary loom. His soldier's eye view, never straying far from the man in the trench, kept me involved and identifying. And the copious footnotes, far from being arcane, assure the reader of the authenticity that is lacking in Shaara and Frazier. 20th century rewrites of the 19th century soldier's perspectives are kept to a minimum, while the real soldiers are allowed to express themselves. Thanks Bruce Catton. I can't wait to get my hands on Volumes 1 and 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil War History","review":"Bruce Catton is the father of Civil War historical books. A stillness at Appomatox has been around a long time and takes the reader from the Army of the Potomac camps after Gettysburg, then thru the wilderness, Spotslyvania Court House, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, and finally to the surrender at Appomatox. This is a primer for Civil War history buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil War history","review":"Stratigy and tactics explored in this book. Battles not ordinarily written about prior to surrender.

In this case A Stillness at Appomattox was read before the other two books in the trilogy. Nothing was lost by doing so; it makes me want to read the other two books now. At times there is a lot of detail to plow through, but patience will reward you descriptions of astonishing clarity - you are there. The book is well deserving of the Pulitzer prize. Much of the book is relevant to the present political climate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading for the Civil War enthusiast","review":"\\"A Stillness at Appomattox\\" is one of the great and essential pieces dealing with the latter part of the Civil War--from after Gettysburg to the surrender at Appomattox Courthouse. Catton tells the story of the war in a detailed and yet engrossing manner, which captures the reader's interest and really gives the reader a feel for what those terrible times must have been like. The Union Army had won a great victory at Gettysburg, but the Confederacy was far from defeated as the war continued to rage on. While some have said that Catton takes something of a Southern viewpoint in his writings, I do not agree with this; his treatment of both sides is even-handed for all that this one is told mainly from the Northern perspective.This one is an absolute must for all Civil War enthusiasts. I look forward to all of Catton's books being available for Kindle. Highly recommended. RJB."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I picked up a dusty old copy of this book from my local library thinking it would show its age and wouldn't be nearly as well written as a more recent one such as Battle Cry of Freedom. However, Catton's writing is very eloquent and engaging even after almost 50 years. He is poetic at times. Criticism? There's always room for a little bit...this is definitely a Union view of the war. Catton relates the Union generals' strategies, but we never learn of Lee's thoughts and strategies in as great of depth. I think this book is better than Battle Cry of Freedom, but it doesn't go into the Southern perspetive nearly as much as Freedom does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"I would recommend anyone just starting out with interest in the civil war to read this. I found it to definitely be a page turner. The authors writing style you can't beat. I know in due time I'll reread it, yes, it's that good. I thought the end,Lee surrendering would have been (You could've heard a pin drop) moment. Not at all, it was more generalized if anything. James McPhersons, Battle Cry of Freedom was better in that moment of the end of the war.That said, buy it, You won't regret!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The True Civil War","review":"Bruce Catton grew up in Benzonia, MI in the early 1900s. There were still Civil War Vets living at that time and a few lived in that same town. It was listening to their stories as a child that inspired Catton to write the Army of the Potomac Trilogy, of which A Stillness at Appomattox is the third and final installment.Stillness, along with the other two books, Glory Road and the other's name escapes me, paints a picture of the Civil War few have been able to duplicate. He tells the story of the Civil War from the perspective of the common foot soldier.Drawing heavily from personal correspondence and regimental histories, Catton puts us smack in the middle of the Wilderness, at the breastworks of Spotsylvania Courthouse and in the trenches around Petersburg as well at the surrender of Lee to Grant.If you're a Civil War buff, and you haven't read Catton, you're not a Civil War buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilderness to Petersbug!","review":"Bruce Catton's writing is superb and his attention to detail is vivid and at times hard to fathom.

Don't believe anyone who tries to tell you this is \\"underrated\\" or a \\"return to form\\". This is pretty bad.

A few of these songs manage to rise above the muck to become somewhat memorable, and could potentially have been quite good if recorded with the right production and feel.

I find it no wonder that she and her husband didn't get too far as screenwriters. Of course, the fact that their greatest success was a now-forgotten Betty Grable musical should tell you something. As for the \\"shocking\\" facts about early Hollywood, the trade reviews (see above) quote every one of the most interesting, gossipy and shocking passages in the book. So save your money: you've just read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and Entertaining","review":"Fredricka Sagor was the daughter of immigrants, the youngest sibling and the most independent.

Before long she was running the show, and she had a very fine wardrobe to show for it. After a string of lovers and related film industry jobs, Sagor met Ernest Maas and promptly married him.This story is fascinating not only for its glimpse into the not-often profiled writing industry of early Hollywood but for its solid writing style and critiques of an era that is often glamorized. Maas is not afraid to name names, but she does not attempt to scandalize them. She often expresses pity, even for those who stole her hard work.The most poinent part of this book is the ending when Maas describes losing her husband.In spite of the fact that the narrative wanders at times, this is a worthy read for a broad audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The shocking Miss Pilgrim","review":"I enjoyed having a woman's perspective on the early Hollywood Era but found the writing style a bit dry.

IT works great to organize them, and you can carry them around like a briefcase as they will stay in their respective compartments (that you can customize and make bigger or smaller based on your needs).

I received the second of the two pics. Disappointing to say the least. The item in the first pic is a great box and features a double sealing rim which seals really well. The item I got only has a single rim, which means it does not seal well at all. The latches also do not lock down as well. Basically, don't order this item unless you want to 50/50 on what item you actually get. Could be the good one, could be the not so good one.

The mayor of their town gives them five things to name, and the final one stumps Carr, but can Fibblestax rise to the challenge?

Using bible verses, stories of prominent women of history who have made a difference, and stories from her own personal experience she provides the reader with practical tools that can easily be applied by any woman, to improve her life and the lives of those around her.

Give a listen and see if you don't agree - \\"OLD WAYS\\" is a real down-home barn-raisin' time!Total Time: 36:45 on 10 Tracks/ Universal-Geffen - 069 490 705 2 (2000)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Roads","review":"Neil Young is probably the most eclectic performer in rock. The trio of albums he released between 1982-1985 are the best example of his wandering muse. Trans is a futuristic, electronic album, Everybody's Rocking is an homage to 50's rock sounds and this album, Old Ways is a countrified album in the tradition of Harvest. The album contains some great tracks awash in the steel guitar sounds that mesh so well with Mr. Young's voice. Old Ways has some great stuff including \\"Are There Any More Cowboys?\\", \\"Misfits\\", \\"California Sunset\\" and the superb \\"Bound For Glory\\". Old Ways is like an old pair of jeans, comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Neil Country","review":"This CD is a hidden jewel in the Neil Young catalogue, especially for those who enjoy Neil's forays into Country Music. Classic songs include \\"Once an Angel\\", \\"Are There Any More Real Cowboys?\\" with Willie Nelson, and \\"Bound for Glory\\" with the late, great Waylon Jennings. Recorded during his feuding days with David Geffen, this was one of the CDs that Geffen sued Young over, claiming Young had recorded albums that weren't \\"like Neil Young\\". Perhaps Mr. Geffen forgot about songs like \\"the Emperor of Wyoming\\", \\"(When You're On the) Losing End\\", \\"the Old Country Waltz\\", \\"Harvest\\", etc. If you like Neil Young, and you like Country, you'll like this too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Album","review":"This is the album that introduced me to Neil Young. I bought it purely because I love Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson, who appear on several tracks. Previously, I had a preconceived view that Neil Young was loud and noisy! I still prefer his accoustic stuff, but at least I learned the errors of my ways. This album holds its own in any category, i.e. country or rock, and comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but one of his best","review":"Don't listen to the negative comments on this album. If your a big Neil Young fan you probably already have/had this. Recorded during a heavy country phase. I saw Neil with Waylon Jennings when this album first came out. This album is no joke. It's country, but it's Neil Young country. A little weird, a little outlaw, a little my way or the highway. In other words all the things you like about Neil Young. Accusing Neil Young of being too country would be like saying Bob Dylan is too folky. It goes with the territory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil Young's Eddy Arnold album","review":"During this period of time, Young went through a febrile episode of trying to be all things to all people. Such as a 'Fifties rocker (\\"Everybody's Rockin\\") and a Kraftwerk clone (\\"Trans\\"). What I'm hearing in this album reminds me of a number of Eddy Arnold singles my father owned when I was a kid. Young even brings in a fairly faithful imitation of Hugo Winterhalter's orchestra as it backed Arnold on Dad's old 45's. This is most noticeable in \\"Wayward Wind\\". There's only one problem. If you've already excelled in two other styles--the pre-grunge of the Crazy Horse albums and the mellow but pointed commentatator/ folkie--taking on other styles might not necessarily be such a good idea. Versatility from Neil Young when we're expecting him to sound like Neil (not Eddy, Buddy or Ralf und Florian)is a mixed blessing at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Neil's career spans the spectrum from country (this album) to punk, but never does he seem more out of his element. This, to my ears, fails to be either good Neil Young or good country. No reason to listen, except for the most enthusiastic collectors of Young.'Harvest' is a much better effort at Young country (if you'll pardon the expression)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is album is terrible.","review":"Even though I love Neil Young's country-rock stuff, I found this album completely uncohesive. Kinda tough to listen to. I was warned about this album from other Neil-o-philes but I didn't listen.

Just avoid this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoe Rack is not too good","review":"This product is possibly the cheapest thing I have ever owned. It's very cheaply made and is made out of the thinnest metal possible. I almost broke it just trying to hang it. The fact that it says it will hold 18 shoes is BS. If you are using it for childrens shoes it might be possible. Normal sized shoes cant fit on the sides because there is not enough room. I do not recommend this item at all. I wish i had not bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"The shoe rack was easy to put together and hung without any problems.

The screws are near impossible to get in. Out of four screws I only successfully screwed in one; the other three are only partially screwed (hoping it will hold). Not sure if it would support the weight of the shoes, but for the scarves it seems ok so far (couple hours). I will probably reinforce the places its screwed with tape. It also snags my scarves as it has rough edges where the metal has been attached. This will probably not be a problem for shoes though. Overall, I would not say its a good purchase but not bad enough to deal with the hassle of returning. If you're comfortable with the quality of product you're getting and you're not trying to hang something super heavy, it should be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done for narrow shoes","review":"Very efficient shoe storage, but really for narrower women's shoes.

I can only fit two pairs per row even though there are hooks for 3 pairs. I disagree with the complaints that the screws fall out. Just don't over tighten the screws and strip the hole and it holds together just fine. I wanted my rack to hold cycling accessories such as gloves, helmet, and shoes and it is serving its purpose.

Mood Pieces is a remarkable example of hip hop ingenuity and creativity, painting pictures with Rude's lyrical onslaught. Definitely this is a must have, not because it is a rarity, but because it is simply a great example of content and skill, which these days are hard to come by, unless delving into the underground catacombs. Abstract Rude has the talent of creating a mood that directly coincides with the subject of his song, any of which would be a good example. I am thoroughly impressed to say the least. Such intellect is appreciated and long awaited. Furthermore, I must point out that he is from the west coast, a place where hip hop was thought to be dead to the world...but I think we were the ones sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"Abstract Rude has certainly gotten better... the lyrics and production on this album are awful.

Or even believing that she deserves a life of her own. She's mostly content (whatever her whining) to bask in vicariously living through what crumbs her employer throws her. I lost patience with her very quickly. What little she learns is mostly too little and too late. As for those who say \\"this is how life was for maids -- sure, for some. But they aren't the ones worth a novel. I can't recommend this book at all. I do recommend \\"Not in front of the servants\\" which is a fascinating description of true life tales \\"in service\\" that doesn't involve hair shirt flagellation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joy to the World","review":"This brings back the fondest Christmas memories from my childhood.

Very few, if any, survive the test of time much less the test of human experience.This great book, written almost 400 years ago, addresses the basic problem of human discontent, suffering and offers a timeless and tested solution. 16th and 17th century Divines did not mince words, cater to the fickle tastes of the reading public or care about being poitically correct. They preached the truth.True contentment, argues the author, is achieved by subtraction and not by addition; by surrender and not struggle.Read this great work and toss all those written by people who will be forgotten next year. It will set your heart on fire and elevate your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"It should not be rare","review":"There should be no reason for a true child of God who has trusted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour to not be content. Sadly, we forget who we are and the grand privileges we have. I had a copy of this for years, and finally replaced it with a copy for my Kindle. This is practical and encouraging. Romans 8:1,26-39 contain some of the reasons for contentment. I gave this as a gift and the person was delighted with it. Whether you are a new Christian or one who has been one for years, this will bless your souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version incomplete","review":"I assumed I was buying this entire book, but the Kindle version is only one chapter.

It caused me to think about whether I was really content with the circumstances God had given me or not in a way that is not the common teaching heard in this century. It was originally written in the 1600s so it takes concentrated thought to read it but it is a great way to take your mind off the exercise bike at the gym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition terrible","review":"The content of this book is excellent.

Listening to the Flowermaidens was torture. I don't know why this is--other Wiener Staatsoper recordings from this period (e.g. Die Frau ohne Schatten, also with Karajan and Ludwig, on DG) sound much better. Grammophone waxed idyllic about this Parsifal without mentioning the severe sonic shortcomings. It does seem to be a good performance underneath all the distortion. I can't believe the Vienna engineers would have made such a lousy recording--perhaps the tapes were poorly stored or damaged. Maybe this cheaper version is better, if it was taken off a live radio feed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comes up Short","review":"The shoe is excellent, it looks good and would go with so many things. As always I ordered it in a 13M because I range between 12M and 13M, going with the latter when the toe is somewhat pointed. It was way too small. I put that aside.My friend who is a 10M ordered her 10M and it came, she was all excited, alas, alas..... the shoe is way too short, it looks like she needs a 12M, ideally 11 1/2.So what is the point of a good looking shoe if you do not indicate that it runs short. It is truly important to indicate that on your shoes. Very disappointed, first experience with a Moda being short, hope it is my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rack BEWARE Exhaust","review":"I just used this hitch rack to bring my son up to University. It worked well, however, my own dumb fault, I didn't realize that my exhaust piped right into the rack.

Ford replaced the rotors at 6k miles and less than 1.5k miles they were as bad as ever. Awful! I did the research and decided to try these pads. I did a hard sanding of the rotors on the truck and installed these pads. Awesome!! No more plusing after 25k miles. They don't have the bite of the OE pads when cold so be warned. Do yourself a favor never buy any other brake pad. And no dusting makes them unbeatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Excellent book on meditation","review":"Walters offers many helpful hints for meditators of all paths, novice or experienced.

Every aspect of planning the sales call and pre-call planning is covered. Addtionally, there was a sticker on the book that I purchased that directed me to their website, where I was able to download a free sales call planning report on one of my doctors. This book really hits the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a huge Christy Canyon fan and was hoping that what I'd find in her book was that she really enjoyed being a sex star. I wanted to hear that she loved the adult world and her fans and was glad to meet them every time she was performing.Instead, her real story is one of abuse that drove her from her home to a life she feels is unsatisfying. She is not a particular fan of the adult industry, even though she became one of it biggest stars, and was anxious to leave it as soon as she could find an alternative.If you want to remain a Canyon fan then don't read this book. If you do, you won't be able to watch her films or see her pictures in the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christy Canyon A Goddess","review":"I have seen Christy Canyon for a long time and she was in many videos in her career but what I remember is Pretty Peaches and I think that was the beginning of her career. Christy Canyon, Thank you for writing ths book you are a true Goddess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal, and personally done, by the author","review":"This wonderful book relates, in Christy's own words, the early years of her career. They are her own words, they are not edited, and dramatized by an editor that would take the feeling and tone away.Using experiences from her childhood we can get the idea of things from her childhood that effected her career and how she got into the adult entertainment industry.Told in her own words and edited by her own hands, this is an up close and personal account of her career.Very few other tell-all authors have done likewise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The new voice","review":"Christy Canyon's biography is a stunning achievement because it shows the person behind the pornstar. Brilliant, candid, graphic, hilarious, revealing, and with all of its pain and beauty, Christy lets us in. She welcomes her reader openly and tells us exactly what happened and how she got to where she is. Her life is not unlike any of our own thus making her journey accesible, fun and harrowing all at the same time. This book is not just for the fans, its for everyone. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good First Book by a Classy Lady","review":"Christy Canyon proves how wrong negative stereotypes of female porn stars are. Her curves and bedroom talents arouse fans of her movies; her brains and honesty in this first volume of her memoirs excite our admiration too. Professional editing would improve her writing, but take this for what it is: a strong first book by a writer without literary training. In that light, this book is impressive indeed. Everyone interested in porn should read Ms. Canyon's book, whether they favor porn or despise it. Ms. Canyon is fair-minded, harsh on those who deserve it, kind to everyone else, endearingly candid about herself, and artlessly eloquent. May her literary skills grow with her wisdom as she lives on, and may she live long and happily."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent bio","review":"Interesting what really occurs in the adult video world. The writing is not on par with John Grisham but I didn't expect it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Enjoy My Ride!\\"","review":"That's what Christy wrote on the inside cover of my copy. And you know what? I did enjoy the ride (no pun intended). Although the poor editing of this book is difficult to overlook, I found that the content more than made up for it. There is plenty of gossip and detail in this book, but what sets it apart from the rest is Miss Canyon's sparkling personality. She is beyond witty and just plain laugh-out-loud fun. If you're looking for deep insight and wisdom regarding the porn business, this is not the book for you. If you're looking for an entertaining inside story about the porn business and one of its stars, then you may really enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysteries of the Crystal Skulls Revealed","review":"I love reading about crystal skulls and anyone who is interested in the subject I would highly recommend this book. It is well written and chock full of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Psychic Computers???","review":"A little flakey at times, but what do you really ecpect.

Records phenomenon. While one of many, they were also one of the best. \\"Soar\\" is a journey to power-chord heaven. There isn't a clunker in the bunch, each track buoys you alone with its own brand of infectious energy. This album for me represents Samiam's apex. They went on to a short major label career, but never produced anything consistent and never quite found the formula to break through to a large, more mainstream audience. The formula that worked best is right here on this album. One of the most under-appreciated rock albums of the last 20 years.

Notice i didnt say emo, because the emo bands of today are totally different that the sound of TBM. Josh Hagquist's voice is very melodic and soothing as it works its way in and out of Shawn's gut wrenching screams. Blazing, techincal, and driving guitars are commanded by the precision drums of Armin Chami, and its all backed by the simple yet adequete basslines of Johnny Minesota. The songs are not typical \\"oh please love me songs\\" of most watery emo bands today. Their lyricism is that of self-damnation and realizing personal flaws. Songs deal with substance abuse, child abuse, lost friends, and dealings with God. Best songs on the CD: Stavesail, Circular Parade, Light a Match..., Narnian Analogy, and For a Friend. I highly recomend that you buy this CD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this....but this now","review":"I bought \\"Light a Match...\\" when it came out. I've listened to it every day since then.

It covers the Soviet manned and unmanned missions up to MIR space station. Both informative and great documentation value, great photos and drawings of all Russian hardware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Images","review":"Perhaps the best collection of images of Soviet Space hardware I've ever seen. Many of the photos seem to have been taken in a museum. Best of all are the up close, detailed images of probes and spacecraft.Drawbacks: Published in the late 80's, it's a bit dated. Its frequent use of the \\"older\\" nomenclature for boosters and spacecraft make it hard at times to compare with today's name for the same item. For example, the Soyuz booster is today said to be based on the R-7 rocket, while in this volume it's called \\"A-1.\\" However, the fault is entirely that of the Soviet Government, who were forever changing the names of design bureaus, launch centers and spacecraft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Attractors Indeed!","review":"In this 2nd installment of the adventures of Hobart Floyt and Alacrity Fitzhugh, the reader is once again caught up immediately in sharing the trials and tribulations of the spacefaring duo. As the story progresses, we learn more about the forces working against the pair, the true Terran Inheritance, and more about Alacrity's past. The harried and hounded friends manage to survive one mishap after another, and gain vital information along the way, that makes the ending of this book absolutely riveting. Brian Daley is at his best with this book, his writing captivates the reader with vivid descriptions of the environment to the point you really feel you have \\"been there\\", and the interaction of the two friends is such that it often seems as if these are people you really know. Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sci-fi books...ever!","review":"Brian Daley continues to work his magic in this book, the second of a trilogy which sees our heroes get into and out of some very interesting situations.

I selected the 1/2\\" square drive because the majority of sockets on the market are made to for this size drive (without having to spend a great deal more money for the larger size sockets). The cord also will detach for the tool itself for easier storage. Milwaukee tool storage cases are excellent! They are rugged, dependable, and well thought out for the tool placement inside.Milwaukee Heavy Duty is a great line of tools. I love the 5 year warranty on the tool. Worth every penny you spend on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product with one annoyance","review":"The impact wrench works very well.

This impact wrench removes and installs wheel lugs on my pickup (140 ft/lbs of torque) with ease and with dial set at only half power. This has made my life much easier as I have a bad back and pulling on a lug wrench is no longer easy for me. Now I can rotate my own tires again!

I really do like this album and think it could possibly be one of there best if not there best album they've ever released. Some of the best songs include tracks 1-4 and tracks 6-10 are pretty good.

Great performance!","review":"As said before by another reviwer, the microphoning of the singers is completely wrong, what spoils this recording!

This performance seems to have been great (specially for Gencer and Grilli) unfortunately it is not very pleasant to listen to this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great performance of a mediocre work","review":"Gencer was a great soprano all right, but NOT of the 1930s and '40s as the previous reviewer stated...she made her debut in the early 1950s and sang until the early 1980s. Therefore the poor sound here is just the result of EXTREMELY bad miking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's going to make you cringe","review":"I own this c.d. because I own all of Neil's albums (and obviously enjoy most of them). I will probably continue to buy all of Neil's releases, but, trust me: this one is an unqualified disaster. It's as if he'd just heard Kraftwerk's Trans Europe Express and a Devo album and then wrote and released this an hour later in a lame attempt to be techno/modern. Try as I might, I just can't even give it 2 stars. I think the reviewer is probably correct who states that it's so bad that you kind of admire the guts it took to put it out. Of course, this album was one of a few that was rumoured to be deliberately bad to get back at Geffen Records during a notorious contract battle. (Lou Reed famously put out Metal Machine Music in the mid-70's for similar reasons while contracted to RCA; it remains the most unlistenable joke ever released!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It - one of Neil's worst albums","review":"Of all the stylistic detours Neil Young took during the 1980s, new wave synthesizer guru was probably the least likely to work. It might have helped, however, if he had brought some better songs to the occasion. Simply put, there is not a memorable tune on the whole album. The synthesizers in the background become particularly grating after a while. Give Young credit for never rejecting a musical idea. But skip this ill-fated project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, zero stars, sorry Neil","review":"This is far and away Neil Young's worst album, and I'm even counting Greendale. Many consider his albums for Geffen subpar, and they are, but this is just bad. The songs are repetative, boring, and unimaginative, to say the least. If you're even thinking of buying this album, DON'T. Just don't. Please take my advice, build a collection of Neil Young and forget this even exists. Synthesizers just aren't his bag, and it shows on every track. If you want his best album of the 80s, it is arguably either \\"Hawks and Doves\\" or \\"Freedom.\\" If you have listened to this and think it is representative of Young's music, think again; he is the greatest songwriter of all time, barring perhaps only Bob Dylan. This album is an anomoly, one of two of his albums that I can say are truly bad and should be avoided (the other being Greendale); the rest of his catalogue should be bought and appreciated forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"NY's most under-rated album","review":"I recon that if this album were recorded with accousting instruments, it would get rave reviews.

This sounds too new wave to be him.

It's still neil, so its not all bad (the stand out track , hippie dream, is excellent), but the overwhelming majority of these songs just flat don't work. The biggest thing this album has going for it is its low price. Since its so cheap, its almost worth picking up just to satisfy your curiousity. Just don't expect it to be a constant fixture in your daily listening. If you want to check out neil's experimental period, you're much better off checking out trans..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A contract record","review":"The main problem with this record was that that it was only a contract record. Neil was under contract to make one more record for Geffen. He gave them the garbage he had been playing with at the time. The only value this record has is for the collector of the whole collection. It is just a sad consequence of the music business that we have to see stuff like this still. Geffen is still trying to get money out of Neil by rehashing old stuff. Lucky Thirteen is a prime example. 2 stars, because it is still Neil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil Didn't Even Try On this Album","review":"With the wealth of talent Mr. Young has it is disapointing to see it wasted here. Can this be real? That's what I thought when I first listened to it. I thought maybe this could be a \\"golden Turkey\\". It was not. It was a poor,poor effort.

Being the hard-core fan I am, though, I also realize that Neil doesn't really like to identify himself with one type of music. But this was a failing attempt at being part of the hip ways of the 80's. It's just not his thing.

I still own it on vinyl. The one good tract is \\"Touch the Night,\\" a poor man's \\"Like a Hurricane.\\" As New Jersey's biggest Neil Young fan, I half understand, but still wonder why, a minor Neil Young album title grabs my attention while I'm watching the US Airways plane floating south down the Hudson River on CNN. Secondly, I wonder whether Neil himself pondered the relevance while he watched from Australia -- he's currently there on tour. Finally, thirdly, and sadly, I did think about the poor souls on the plane. But they're alive. Hey hey, my my.And lastly, if you own the LP, you realize that there is a cool photo of Neil sitting in an airplane seat, a flotation device strapped to his chest, the plane ready to hit water, and Neil looks scared. Real scared."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fresh Neil Young Album","review":"I really think this album makes more sense in 2006 than 1986. I like Neil Young for Harvest and classic Neil, however this album is a refreshing album for me. Neil lovers should not buy this album ever!There are abundant synths, and the drums sound synthetic. The guitar is sparse and the vocal rythms are enticing and symplistic. In the same way Ozzy's voice is limited yet enjoyable, so is Neil's.The subject matter is dark and the whole thing does not sound like Neil - which upsets Neil lovers. People who can get over that and don't hate synths will enjoy this album.It does not suck like Avante Garde Pop or introspective emo cheese rock, so get over it and judge it as a completely different work than Neil Young folk rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I tried to find something positive about this album, but I can't.

Save your money and buy other Neil CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil goofing around....","review":"Geez....What's Neil up to here? This isn't too good. If you think Neil should be backed by Toto you might enjoy this one. I hate to throw darts at the guy (cause he's great) but this sounds like he wants to be a pop star. This wouldn't fly on Star Search. Bottom Line: This cd is to rock music what etch-a-sketch is to art. You go Neil!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad ideas don't get much worse than this","review":"Okay, Neil with synthesizers and drum machines. Strike anybody else as stupid? Because this, along with Life, is the worst Neil Young album out there. The lyrics are frequently embarrassing (I've Got a Problem; Hippy Dream; Weight of the World; Violent Side; Drifter), and the aforementioned drum machines and such got on my nerves fast. There's not a single song on this mess worth salvaging. Neil's put out some great stuff, but this isn't an example of what he can do. There's not even a memorable guitar solo thrown in. Skip over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Neil doesn't recommend this one...","review":"I read the recent biography of Neil Young called Shakey...even he considers this one of his worst albums. The sound is terrible. The worst of 80's production technology. It all sounds like it's in a tin can which makes sense since basically the musicians didn't actually play together. There are a couple of good songs like \\"Pressure\\" but this one really doesn't stand the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album ever","review":"Neil Young is a great song writer and I'm a huge fan of his.But the only reason you would ever buy this album is so that you can brag to your firends and family that you own the worst album ever made.The irony in all of this is that I actually have far more respect for Young after listening to this garbage. It amazes me that he can do something so awful and then come right back and release albums like Harvest Moon and Ragged Glory.If you are just getting into Young's music then do not buy this album until you have most (if not all) of the other albums he has done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil's absolute worst","review":"Let me start by saying that Neil Young is probably my all-time favorite rock-and-roll artist. I own thirty of his albums and still eagerly await each new release. But this turkey is the only Neil Young album I ever actually sold back used. I can not say a single good thing about it.Simply put, \\"Landing On Water\\" was a ghastly miscalculation by the master. How Neil could have thought that a collection of mediocre songs driven primarily by synthesizers was a good idea is beyond me. And while I have often been pleasantly surprised by some of his more unconventional projects (the Shocking Pinks, for example), my only reaction to this album was horror.If you want to hear Neil doing something interesting with synths, check out \\"Trans.\\" Avoid this disaster at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WAS JUST A HIPPIE DREAM!","review":"I may be bias,since i bought this album as kid,so it didn't sound that bad too me,but the terriable reviews are overboard.Try and come up with one 60's or 70's artist that didn't suffer from 80's production and sound.It is one of neil's weaker cd's,up there with old way's and everybody's rockin,but i don't hate any of neil's work.there's some great song's here,hippie dream,touch the night,people in the street,drifter and maybe violent side.Dylan's 80's output was less than great too,so to judge this compaired to neil's classic period is unfair.probably only 3 star's,but someone has to give this one some love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful.","review":"If there was a way to leave negative stars, I would for this album.

It's so amazingly bad I can't find the words. So if you're unfamiliar with Neil Young and see this one on sale, and start to think that maybe it's time to explore Neil Young...RESIST! Do not touch this album (at least not as your first Neil Young) cause the risk is very high that you'll never look at another record by Mr. Young - and that would be a pity. Instead of this one you should get \\"Harvest\\", \\"After the gold rush\\" and \\"Comes a time\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"Landing on Water was nothing but a dissapointment.

However, after only two days of taking the supplements, I have had constant headaches. These are not due to the lack of caffeine as I do not drink this stimulant on a normal basis. I have changed my diet to help with the cleansing process, but haven't noticed too much of a difference. Also, the pills from the third phase must have some sort of sleeping aid in them as ten minutes after I took it, I could not keep my eyes open. This sounds good in theory, but the idea of putting something in my system that forces me to go to sleep makes me a little nervous. Anyway, maybe you'll have better luck with them than I did, as it seems other people have found them helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle","review":"I'm 8 days into this cleanse and the only side effect I've noticed was mild headaches the first 4 or 5 days. The headaches weren't painful enough to even take a pain reliever. I have felt pretty fatigued but I anticipated that. This product has not caused diarrhea which is nice, I was hoping it wouldn't. I chose to do this cleanse because it seemed more complete than other cleanse products out there and it isn't marketed as a weight loss cleanse, which seem to be pretty unhealthy and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame","review":"One of the worst Don Carlo ever! Very abridged. Only three good singers: Christoff (Philip), Neri (Inquisitor) and Loretta di Lelio aka Mrs Franco Corelli (Tebaldo).------------------Cet enregistrement de Don Carlo réalisé en 1954 est srement un des plus mauvais. La version choisie est celle en quatre actes mais avec de nombreuses coupures : les airs sont souvent tronqués et de nombreux seconds couplets ont ainsi disparu ! Le chef est sans intért, les chanteurs aussi. Tout le monde, ou presque, s'ennuie. Les rescapés de ce massacre général sont Philippe II (Christoff qui n'a pas encore les tics insupportables et clownesques que nous lui connatrons) et un excellent Inquisiteur (Giulio Neri). Une curiosité : Tebaldo est chanté par Loretta di Lelio, l'implacable épouse du grand Franco, et elle chante fort bien !

The characters are extremely two-dimensional and the dialogue is weak. The author is not a good writer. What he does have, however, is a great imagination. I liked the story of this book and thought the hook (ie. Jesus cloned from the Shroud of Turin) was enticing.I think you would have to be a lover of Christian fiction to be blown away by this book. If you are not, this is an average thriller and not \\"edge of your seat\\" stuff. I am not feeling inclined to read the rest of the series and I feel slightly suckered that I bought this book based on the glowing reviews which are found everywhere else, it seems, on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best End Times Fiction","review":"As the first book in a trilogy, \\"In His Image\\" sets the stage for the two books that follow. An intriguing plot, and well-developed characters combined with pain-staking research combine to make this perhapse the finest End-Times novel. This book (as do the others in the trilogy) reads like a mystery, a techno-thriller, and a science fiction novel all rolled into one. I'd give it five stars except for the mild profanity. You'll probably want to think twice before using the Christ Clone Trilogy in a Bible study."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT biblically-based reading","review":"I bought this book because it was recommended along with the Left Behind series. Buyer beware: if you are looking for an end-times story that is solidly based on biblical prophecy, this is not the book for you. The author takes certain biblical references out of context and weaves them into his own New Age interpretation of \\"all roads leading to God\\". He even blatantly makes up lies that seekers who aren't familiar with the Bible might swallow. For example, he says that the apostle John was the true betrayer of Christ, not Judas. I would hate to see anyone be led astray by the theology in this book. If you enjoy Bible-based reading, stick with the Left Behind series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dianetics was better","review":"And that's not saying much. The only reason I'm comparing this book to Dianetics is that it employes much the same marketing methods. Throw enough recommendations out there and some poor sap is sure to bite.

The story was moving and interesting, and the plot was well done. It could have been better,but not bad for a first novel. There's too much cussing and violence in this book for some, but I can overlook it for the better of the message. There's a great message for all of us in Nicholas' novel. Read it. IN HIS IMAGE was OK, looking for better work on number two. The Fist of God a solid (three and a half star).

I can't believe the publisher let them slip. But when I say it's badly written I'm not talking about poor grammar. I'm talking about a horribly mismatched story that is that disappoints. The dialogue is horrible. Kind of like the dialogue in \\"Attack of The Clones\\". Ugh. I struggled through this baby hoping it would get better and getting ever more disappointed. I don't think this author should quit his day job. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I wish I would've opened this book sooner than I did.

The plot is intriguing, but author's need to use every \\"end-time\\" prophecy was distracting and weak. Also, the stupidity of the characters, both named and un-named, takes away from the plausibility of the storyline. For example, when \\"millions\\" of people in all parts of the world mysteriously die all at the same time, bio-terrorism is assumed to be the cause - NO ONE suggests the possibility of \\"Rapture\\" even after no cause is found. Please! I can't believe that someone, somewhere wouldn't start shouting \\"The end of the world is near\\" at this point!

BeauSeigneur started a lot of interesting stories -- like the mysterious disappearance of about a quarter of the World's population, the cloning of Christ, the life of a news photographer and struggles of Israel to be independent, then got bogged down in a United Nations quagmire that skipped through 5-8 years of the story at a time. I found myself flipping through pages looking for continuations and answers, but never found them. There's probably a good reason BeauSeigneur self-published the book to begin with -- he couldn't find a publisher to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher was AWESOME!","review":"It is difficult to put in words the power of BeauSeigneur's The Christ Clone Trilogy holds without the grave risk of understating. Using real events to pull the reader into the story (or as another reviewer put it - invading my real world and turning it on its head), BeauSeigneur has created the scariest, deepest, most intesting, and undoubtedly the best book I've read in a long time. When I started In His Image, I couldn't put it down. When I finished Acts of God, I immediately began to reading the series again. Even now, after I've finnaly somewhat gotten over it, there are still some nights I can't sleep thinking about this unbelievably incredible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Trilogy - Extremely Engaging Story","review":"This is the first book in a fantastic trilogy. It portrays the end times in an extremely engaging story, which is very intelligently written. The reader is slowly guided into a Christian perspective over the course of the series. In fact, it is difficult to tell that the first book is even a work of Christian fiction, as it deals with the last days from a very secular perspective which will appeal to Christians and non-Christians alike. I personally loved the way in which various end time prophecies came to pass in non supernatural ways. The events prophesied in the Bible are initally brought to fruition using natural forces that God has already put into place in this world. I could not put this series down and literally plowed through all three books, one after the other. Get these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.....","review":"After being left hanging by Left Behind series I was desperate for a conclusion to an end times story. I had heard that this trilogy was exciting and well done so I bought all three books. I forced myself to read the first book, yawn. It laid the groundwork for the story, but it was boring. The second book was a bit better, still no real rush. The third book had promise, but ultimately was a race to the end. The climax was a huge disappointment.

Years later I had to read the books again to try to figure out how the author crafted the facade that fooled me so. The book is a real eye opener, a great series.

A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly inspirational, barely readable","review":"Considering myself spiritual AND literate may make me a commoditiy, but I think hardly a rare one. This thinly veiled telling of John's Apocalypse appeals to neither side of me. An addition to the growing list of fundamentalist novels, it will have appeal to the Wednesday night study group, but I fear, not to many more. As a Christian, I found the pseudo-scientific approach to Christ's return insulting. (Do we really think that He will come again by being cloned from cells scraped off the shroud of Turin? Really!) As a reader, I thought the writing too weak to grab me in its own right. (I never learn enough about the manchild to really care about him.) I see that it has been revised to a second edition. This must be a unique event; a novel rewritten to make the story more accurate. Per haps my expectations were too high, but I fear that Christian Literature has not found its Faulkner.

His plotting and poor editing are atrocious. The characters are cliche. The prophecy seems tacked on like an afterthought. There is much better Christian fiction out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the billing","review":"I found these books disappointing. I read the first one in its entirety and thought it rather amateurish in style, although there were a few good moments (and I did like the Shroud of Turin aspect and storyline, just not the way it was developed.) I skimmed the second volume, but couldn't finish it and will not read the third. The two I read were very simplistic, I feel, and predictable, following the old, standard, fundamentalist Christian line. That's my honest appraisal for what it's worth to anyone considering risking money on these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"I've just finished the final book in the trilogy. The author has done an incredible job of using factual details, biblical prophecy, science, and a vivid imagination to create for us a very realistic portrayal of the soon-to-be last 7 years on earth. I spent every free moment I had reading these books.I highly recommend this very well done trilogy. Thank you, Mr. Beau Seigneur, for your wonderful contribution to the bible prophecy literature!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great End Times Book","review":"This book is masterful. Having just finished the Left Behind series, this is a nice change on the same topic. It's a wonderful end times novel, based (in the first two chapters) on acutal facts. Beauseigneur intrigues readers with his very apt combination of science and religion. Although it gets a little tedioius in the exact description of happenings at the United Nations, this book will carry you through and leave you hungry for the next. I can't wait to receive the second installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyed","review":"Fascinating concept,original. I think better written than the \\"Left Behind\\" Series, which I found tedious after the 2nd one. The Christ Clone books are totally believable. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent piece of work","review":"I've read a number of Christian related books & seen a number of Christian related movies (including the \\"Left Behind\\" series) but this is far better than any of them. I'm surprised they haven't made it into a movie. The first book is mainly background information you'll need when you get into the second & third books. The second & third books are where the fun begins. The author sticks close to the bible. I had a hard time putting the books down & wish there were 5 or 6 books to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Must Read It More Than Once!","review":"I have read The Christ Clone Trilogy three times and each time I have discovered greater and greater depth to the story and the characters.

I'll wait a few months, but I WILL read these books again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a HUGE let-down. . .","review":"It sure is a good thing I never actually bought this book - I borrowed it from the library after reading 5-star reviews on amazon. This is awful writing if I've ever seen it. The characters, as mentioned by scores of others, are one-dimensional - the author tells you what happens rather than bringing you into the situation and letting you see and feel for yourself. I am a fan of the Left Behind series, though I find the series to be quite long (it's not even finished yet!), at least you can connect with the characters and feel for them. The swearing also turned me off, it is unneccessary and does not belong in Christian fiction.Do not buy this book - if you really want to read it, see if you can borrow it, but DO NOT waste your money on poor writing, awful editing, and Christian fiction that is not even based on Sciptures. Read Left Behind if you want true-to-Scripture, edifying reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT read!","review":"I have read this series of books at least three different times and am amazed by them each time. I have read the Left Behind series and enjoyed them very much but I cannot compare the two series because there is absolutely no comparison to be made. The \\"right now\\" feeling I get from the CCT is spine tingling and makes me question the world around me, wondering if I too could be so easily fooled. I sent these books to my father-in-law a few years back, who I would not call a practicing Christian, and he finished all three books in less than 2 weeks and was searching for more by this author right away. I would suggest this series to any and everyone because there is not a slam you in the face religious rant to them, just a GREAT story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The real deal","review":"Forget the other ten or more series book.

I bought it just to have something different to read, but when I got it I couldn't stop reading it until I finished. I found that I had been reading the whole night. Be careful not to start reading in the office or in public places, you'll find yourself bound to your chair until you finish.After that I couldn't help it and bought the others.I would like to see this trilogy translated to spanish!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary flatulence","review":"The only thing spouting more hot air than this book is its author, who had the audacity to take a nitwit, trite story and stretch it into THREE tedious volumes.

Avoid, avoid, avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Profane and Inane!","review":"Devoted Christians should definitely stay away not only from this book but also from this author... better he should spend the time trying to improve his writing skills and reading the Good Book (if there's no profanity in the Bible why should there be any in this series?).

Stay away if you value the Lord's Word as well as a sense of good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedius!","review":"I'm so disappointed! After all the glowing reviews, I expected something a lot more professional and sophisticated than this. The book reads like a senior high school science project, droning on and on about the most trivial and boring details, as if to say \\"hey everybody, see how smart I am!\\" when in fact, it just bogs the story down in minutiae and overkill. I'll not read the next two, and highly warn everyone else to avoid this drugery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SALTING THE MINE!!","review":"This book was a huge disappointment, especially since Amazon's \\"customers recommendeded\\" it as the perfect addItion to or substitute for virtually EVERY book on the best seller list -- fiction and nonfiction. If you peruse the titles, it is the perfect addition to Star Wars, Star Trek, The Left Behind Series, all visionary fiction, and a lot more! Sorry, I don't buy it. Hard to believe that real fans would read that range of books. Whether the author is behind this or some misguided fans, I don't know. But, it sure seems sleazy for a book with a supposedly \\"righteous\\" theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time!","review":"Not only was this very poorly written, the theology was very anti-Christian. God is presented as a selfish, arrogant deity, John the disciple as a traitor, and Judas Iscariot as the only true friend of Christ. Do not waste the time reading this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloning christ? Give me another one!","review":"Well, all I have to say is just that I won't just go for anything in search of entertainment. The Left Behind series was true to the scriptures. All this stuff about cloning Christ's tissues and stuff leave me with a bad taste in the mouth. It's not scriptural and I wonder what we are headed to...Let's not take creativity too far, please. Otherwise there's no difference between true christianity and the rest. That's no thanks for me.Of course, some may disagree. That's OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing but stupid story...","review":"This story was, quite simply, based on nothing. The Turin Shroud has been proven to be a fake - not just by Carbon-14 dating but also by thermoluminesnce and electron spin resonance tests as well as by historical criticism of extant records. Yet this whole book is based on it being \\"the real thing.\\" There are enough flaws in Christianity as a religion without bringing in patently false history. This is not to bash Christians - it is simply a fact in the research that I have done.The somewhat \\"other-wordly\\" nature of Jesus posited in the book was an interesting twist but not enough to carry the day for me. This book tries to walk that secular/religious line and, I guess for the most part it does okay on that, but the whole basis of the plot is ruined right from the start with the Shroud material.True believers in Christianity will probably not like where the book goes. Secular readers will not be gulliable enough (in the religious sense) to buy into the premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demise of a good story","review":"This series appeals as another of the \\"end times\\" novels and is a good story, as it goes. The reason for only 1 star is that the author, in pursuing \\"realism,\\" has his characters use profanity throughout the book. As Christians we are to keep our language pure, and even if only the non-Christians use profanity, the reader must still experience it. With violence, the author would be telling us ABOUT something evil, but with profanity, he is committing it against us. Too bad--I was hoping for something appropriate for Christians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept but poor writing","review":"I ordered this book after finishing the last Left Behind book. Despite the strange bi-polar reviews, I still gave it a shot, because of the idea. Unfortunately, an idea is not enough. The writing is strictly third rate.

This isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"In His Image","review":"I ordered this book because I had read the Left Behind series which follows the Book of Revelation without error, in my judgement, and was anxious to read another approach to this subject. It was a huge disappointment to me because, as a Christian, I found this near blasphemy. I was uncomfortable reading the book with such distortions of Biblical doctrine. Though I realized this book was not a historical account, I wasn't prepared for the twists and turns, which were written convincingly well, thinking all the time about those who read this but aren't well read in the Scriptures. The danger ever present in my mind was the harm that could be done to a person seeking spiritual significance when they are not founded in sound doctrine. What would such notions do to earnest seekers?I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't bought it.","review":"This book is totally wack. The research was impressive, but that's about it. The only reason I even finished was because I bought the book and felt obligated to finish it- I'm not even interested in finishing the trilogy. Decades are skipped and connection to the characters is non-existant. On the back of the book one reviewer wrote, \\"C.S. Lewis couldn't have done it better.\\" C.S. Lewis wouldn't do it in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY GREAT","review":"I absolutely enjoyed this trilogy. I enjoyed it so much that I actually emailed the author, via the publishers, to find out if he had written any other fiction books!!! That's a first for me!I read quite a few of the reviews tying to decide if I should purchase the books. I must admit after reading the reviews I was put off from buying the series thinking that maybe I was wasting my money - BUT - I'm sooooooooo glad that I changed my mind and went for it!What an amazing, gob smacking read they have been. I could not put down the first book in the series. There is just no way to know what was going to happen next - this trilogy is not a predictable read.Other reviewers have written about the the main storylines so I would just like to say that this trilogy is much better than the last 10 books of the Left Behind series rolled together.Don't be put off by the other not so positive reviews - go read it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just the \\"Enola gay'....","review":"In \\"Inferno\\", published 2000, it is projected that B-29 firebombings killed more than both atomic raids,yet the public is not aware.

Machen represents a hero to evangelicalism of the past. However, I truly believe that his grammer is out of date. I think that the leading tool for teaching NT Greek is William Mounce's Basics of Biblical Greek. There are probably less than 10% of colleges and seminaries that even still use Machen. If we are going to make Greek more easier to comprehend and attain, then other sources than Machen's ought to be used"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, no-nonsense, no-frills introduction to NT Gree","review":"Machen's book, though dated (c.1923) is still in use in leading theological seminaries and the text chosen by the Newark (NJ) School of Theology for its first and second year NT Greek courses. Machen is a no-nonsense, no frills, dead serious introductory text, but a student who has completed it will be able to read NT Greek. Each of the 33 lessons concludes with 20 Greek to English sentences and 16 English to Greek sentences to be translated. At the end of the first year of Machen, I discovered that Zodhiates (AMG Publishers, Chattanooga, TN) has published keys to these exercises, together with cassettes covering all 33 lessons, and a workbook with its own key booklet for each lesson. Gresham taught NT Greek at Princeton Theological Seminary in the early 20's and was a fundamentalist preacher there of considerable renown. I recommend Machen's text without reservation for serious students of NT Greek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its longevity testifies to its worth.","review":"I am a Lutheran pastor. Forty years ago I used Machen as the first year text by which I learned New Testament Greek. Over the years, I have used this text to teach a few interested persons New Testament Greek one-on-one. I tried another text once, but its arrangement of subjects seemed out of place. For me, the great feature of Machen is the numerous exercise sentences at the end of each chapter. Too many first year texts provide the students with too few exercise sentences by which they can practice what they have learned.It is not really a book for self-study. But, with the help of a teacher who has studied New Testament Greek, it is simply the best book available after its nearly 80 years in print. That alone speaks much in its behalf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Machen's Book is Still the Standard","review":"The long ago departed J. Gresham Machen provided the academic world with the standard text for teaching Koine (common) Greek, often called New Testament Greek. This book is extremely well done, and after viewing two three separate Greek texts, this is the most detailed. He covers all the rules in Greek such as declensions, Present Actives, Participles, aorists, imperfects, Perfect tenses, subjunctives, etc. His vocabulary section in the back is great for the student as a quick reference or study tool for memorization. Further, as another reviewer noted, one can practice what they have learned in each chapter with Greek to English and English to Greek exercises. This is more difficult book than Mounce's text if one was trying to learn Greek alone. With a minor in Greek, I suggests one seek a teacher or someone with at least two years of Greek if using a book to learn Greek anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginners book","review":"I took four years of high school Greek and we used this book all the way through. I am now taking Greek in College and we are using Croy's book: A Primer of Biblical Greek. After using Croy's book for two semester's, I can say that I prefer Machen.

Written in 1955, this Pulitzer Prize winning work traces the development of Populism and the beginnings of Progressivism from the 1890's to the rise of WWI. However, this book is in my opinion \\"primarily a study of political thinking and of political moods\\" and, therefore, suffers from a major weaknesses. Put simply Hofstadter's book is largely devoid of primary regional sources, and his work pays lip service to the crucial values and strategies of key Populist leaders. I recommend Lawrence Goodwyn's account over Hofstadter for this reason...otherwise, a well written and intellectual achievement...worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me like book","review":"Richard Hostadter is a wonderful historian who paints with broad yet nimble strokes.

I was especially intrigued with his argument about the myth of the idealized past, and how that myth becomes increasingly stronger even as it moves further away from the reality (take, for example, the image of 1950s small-town America in today's culture). If you believe, as I do, that the era in which we live has strong similarities to the American situation at the last turn of the century, then you will no doubt find this book valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Stink-free is an awesome product.

The first part of the book is a Peter Lynch rip-off, talking about how we should only invest in things we understand, and use our knowledge of particular sectors to make money. The discussions of fundamental and technical analysis are so superficial as to be practically worthless. The author's assertion that it's easy to tell when a stock has bottomed or topped is ludicrous--if it were that easy I'd be on my yacht right now instead of writing this. The remainder of the book essentially talks about how analyst's reports are not to be trusted, which is very true but certainly not a novel concept. Readers would be far better served by buying Peter Lynch's first two books and/or the first Motley Fook book in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious analogy, too much market timing","review":"The guerrilla analogy gets exceedingly tedious.

Quite unlike any other band in the world. They've moved from a pure Gaita (Venezuelan Xmas folk music) sound in the 70s/80s to a glorious mix of Salsa, Jazz, Rock, Funk.... Incredible. Best songs in this CD are Como Sera, Como es tan bella, Que Cobardia & El Sueno De Don Simon. I got hooked on this band after listening to this album. Other good Guaco albums are Triceratops, Classico-II & Amazonas. Saw them live in Valencia, Venezuela in Dec '97. They are like Gods there... my best concert ever! Dont miss this CD! -Dan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good music","review":"GUACO is an unique band in its style. It is a perfect mixture of rhythms so diverse as the jazz, salsa and gaita zuliana.

His book is just as great as his talks. He is a medical doctor who uses a holistic approach to health mainly in a proactive and preventitive way. This book is easy and fast reading. It is jam packed with useful information on what everyday things we can avoid for better health. It includes information on detoxifying the body and gives people a \\"heads up\\" on harmful things that we come into contact with everyday that we don't think even twice about. It is a great book and I highly recommend it for people to see what things they are really exposing themselves to every day and what you can do live a healthier life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book everyone needs to read","review":"I found this book to have such detailed information on subjects that most people know little or nothing about.

I really enjoyed it, it gave so much powerful information. I have changed the way I eat and the things I put into my house. I have learned to make household cleaners naturally homemade.

It was painful to watch. First, there is virtually no suspense AT ALL. And there is no mystery. There is also no Mystery Gang, which really makes this feel like something is wrong. The animation and sound effects reminded me eerily of The Smurfs, which is not a compliment.That said, my 3-year-old DID seem to enjoy it - but only through one viewing. They have not asked for it since, but still ask for other Scooby movies (especially Cyber Chase).

It is yet another feeble attempt to rehash forgotten Scooby \\"misses\\" from long ago. With only Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy-Doo (yuck!), this is the most disappointing \\"new\\" Scooby Doo release yet. Not only is the story-line predictable and disconnected, but the entire movie is TOO LONG. The jokes are unfunny and most of the lines are cliche.

What the cover and description fail to show you is that the... little Scrappy Doo character is also in this \\"feature\\". For those of us who grew up watching the \\"gang\\", Scrappy is a slap in the face to the original classic. It looks like Warner Brothers knows the popularity of Scrappy is zilch so they masked the box to try to increase sales! My 4 year old watches the classic Scooby with me and when my son was ill I made a trip to the video store and rented this. Thank the heavens I didn't actually buy it!! It was long, dumb and the type of silly that requires an off button.

He enjoys the \\"old\\" Scooby as well as the \\"What's New Scooby Doo\\" series, and I must say that I do too. That said, this awful movie was not just aimless and devoid of any of the usual fun and humor, it was downright painful to watch. This might have been more palatable as a single half-hour episode, but I doubt it. Twenty-five minutes into the movie, my husband asked me how much longer we had to subject ourselves to it. Forty-five minutes into this thing, my son muttered to himself \\"I wonder when it going to get to the scary part!\\" I don't think it ever quite got there. Avoid this movie like the plague, and go for something else.

We own about 20 Scooby DVD's and this one is BY FAR the worst! Even my daughter thought it was awful and she never criticizes anything Scooby Doo.This movie is not your typical \\"Mystery Inc solves another mystery\\" movie. Only Scooby and Shaggy are in this one, and they are really more like the supporting cast.

She wants the best ob-gyn of the stars to see her, but when it turns out that the doctor is one of Luke's (Beckys husband) ex's Becky finds out that she bit off more than she can chew.Also making apperences in the book are Becky's best friend Suze who helps her out getting ready for the baby. Becky's mother, sister, and childhood neighbor Janice who make reading the book a delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I have been anxiously awaiting this book because I LOVE this series...I will admit that it is not AS great as the preceding books but the book is still a great read! I raced through this book, laughing out loud and sometimes even crying. I too hope that Kinsella continues this series, just so I can see how Luke Becky and baby get along!! Love the author, love the books, love Becky!! Great buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"I read all 4 of the Shopaholic books and they seem to just be very repetitive. You can basically predict after the first book what the main character will do. But I still got through them all and though they were cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Love Sophie Kinsella!!!","review":"I started reading chick-lits when my roommate told me to de-stress myself. She said I should start with the Shopaholic series, and I may get addicted. So I went to the library and borrowed the first 4 books of the Shopaholic series. I CAN'T STOP! I read it before bed, during mealtimes, on the subway! I bought Can You Keep a Secret and The Undomestic Goddess, found them as nicely written as the Shopaholic series (though Shopaholic is still my favorite...), and I even looked for her books written under Madeline Wickham. But I guess they only published those in Britain. I was one of the first on the line to buy this new Shopaholic & Baby and can't stop reading it!!! Sophie Kinsella's amazing! Love Becky!!! Her lame excuses to shop -- irritating but lovable. Can't wait for her next book to come! I know they said this is the last installment of Shopaholic, but I hope Kinsella will publish another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"I didn't like this book very much. It seemed to be the same as the other books and, in my opinion, very predictable. Becky is always getting herself into ridiculous situations and misunderstandings that nobody would ever get themselves into in real life. I suppose that's part of the charm to some people, but I found it very annoying this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous!","review":"I have directed my dear sister to never, ever use me again as guinea pig should she want a \\"guy's reaction\\" to a book. I can only hope that this expression of so-called chick-lit is not the standard by which most women are entertained. Ms. Kinsella has, as we say in pre-school sandlots, a bit of a potty-mouth, and has transformed this into a genre that I title as \\"Wants to be cute so she swears.\\" OK, we get that you know all the FCC-forbidden words. We get that your characters think endlessly about consummation of, well, just about any enounter they encounter. My recommendation for Ms. Kinsella's penalty is that she must stay on a desert island for one full month (one of the longer months, like March), and then read and read Bronte and Austen (not re-read, as I am sure that writers like Ms. Kinsella have never read Bronte or Austen), and learn from them how to use prose to transform the reader. I even have a new crime of which I now accuse Ms. Kinsella: Prose Abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shopaholic & Baby","review":"Just finished reading Kinsella's latest enstallment for Becky Brandon (nee: Bloomwood). Was as funny and entertaining as all of the other books in the series. If you're a fan of Becky Brandon, I'd suggest reading this latest additon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love/Hate Relationship","review":"I've finished the entire series and do think Sophie Kinsella did an overall good job. The books are fun to read. As I went through the series I got more and more annoyed with Becky. Her habit of telling lies to her husband (Brandon) was hard to read through at times & even the lie about going in labor. You'd think by the end of the series Becky would have learned something, but she doesn't. She's still the same Becky Bloomwood readers were introduced to in the 1st book (Confessions of a Shopaholic). The side stories (Suze,Jess, Janice, Tom, Mum & Dad) are what makes this book cute and fun to read. Good book but don't expect anything new from Becky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Shopaholic in the Book and in Me!","review":"While I want to scream sometimes at the tension that Kinsella creates in the last several novels between Becky and her man, I understand the theory behind creative writing enough to understand that Kinsella has to give us some tension beyond Becky's shopping habits and upcoming baby. Let's just say though that at the end of the novel, I kept hoping for a more monumental showdown between the infuriating OB/GYN doctor and Luke. :) Becky seems so weak sometimes as a person, and yet I can't help recognizing those qualities that make her both seem weak and vulnerable within myself at times too. Overall, a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good while it lasted, but the series has run its course.","review":"I've been a huge fan of the series since my first laugh out loud reading \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\". Each subsequent edition has been slightly more watered-down and ludicrous, but Shopaholic & Baby conjures up eye rolls and groans rather than giggles and guffaws. I think it's time for Becky to hang it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The series is so fun and Becky is one of the funniest characters! If you liked any of the other books in the Shopaholic series you will love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"For some reason, I couldn't get into this book like I had with the previous 4 in the series. Once I finally did, I devoured the rest of it. This one is probably the most \\"dramatic\\" of the series, but still light and fun. Becky learns important lessons with each book, yet she's always the same old Becky - and that's why we love her. Now that I'm back on the Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) wagon, I can't wait to read Mini Shopaholic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FEELING SORRY FOR BECKY'S KID","review":"This wasn't very good. I struggled to finish it. Becky proves in this book that she just isn't mature enough to be a mother. The name she gave her baby girl is beyond dreadful! This unbelievably cold, red haired witch is trying to steal her husband off her,worse of all the red haired witch is her obyn doctor. Becky really thinks Luke is leaving her and it really messes with her head.The other books in the series are spot on. Also ,I liked that they brought Jess,her level headed sister back as a character and gave her a love interest.It was nice to see Danny her friend from New York pop in and out of this book, but other than that this book was pretty lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the next one","review":"Good audiobook, love the accent. Becky didn't do as much shopping as she usually does, but she definitely got herself in the some tight situations. Can't wait for next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the lot","review":"In typical Becky fashion, she chooses to go for the snotty OB GYN. That's fairly realistic, given her persona, and I know plenty of people do go this route.But when the OB GYN turns out to be your husband's gorgeous ex? Really? At that point, you cut bait.I don't know if Kinsella has ever had a baby, but surely she's been an adult female long enough to know that going to a doctor you don't trust and letting them poke you in parts to which you generally restrict who gets access is really unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more sopholic books! (spoilers within)","review":"Sopholoic and Baby starts out with Becky discovering she is pregnant with her and Luke's first child. However, one of Luke's former girlfriends is the premier obstrecian in London right now (of course) and Becky wants her baby to be delivered by her. Soon Becky starts to believe that Luke and his former girlfriend are having an affair and that he no longer loves her.Of course the same things that have happened in the previous four novels occurs here. Becky and Luke have huge misunderstandings, Becky spends too much money on baby things, Becky is being self-absored. The book had the worst ending ever with Luke somehow losing his company and Becky having made millions of dollars through some hare brained scheme.I struggled to finish this novel and ended up donating it to my local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"non stop antics all the way through!","review":"brilliant, just brilliant, i laughed all the way through. Becky gets funnier every book, she is written so well, she is a real person, i feel if i met her i would want Becky to be my best friend. The way her mind wanders to the most crazy conclusions about Luke and his college sweetheart, and her logic for buying things she will never need or use never gets old, and i sometimes read about a situation and say 'i would probably do the same thing.' From beginning to end just a laugh out riot, my favorite part is when she walks into the doctors appointment wearing heals and the jewelry and the big bag, something i would do, and then get yelled at by the doctor for it. The ending was very sweet, and as usual an extremely unexpected one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't take anymore!!","review":"I am not the type of person to not finish a book, but I couldn't force myself to read all of this. I have read the other books in this series. I liked the first one. It was kind of original and somewhat relatable. But now, the main character, Becky Bloomwood, is just annoying and irresponsible. The foreign bank accounts, credit cards, etc. are just ridiculous. Her husband has become a joke. What man, of any means, would put up with this amount of lying and trickery. I realize that there are people out there who have shopping disorders such as this, but it's an addiction. I think that the next book should be Shopaholic and Therapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously?","review":"I guess everyone found this book funny except me. Just as in the previous 2 in the series, I wanted to punch Becky for being such a stupid, selfish cow rather than cheer for her. I bought the book b/c of the good reviews here. I have read the original Shopaholic at least 5 times and adored it for its humor and page turning laughs. 'Shopaholic Takes Manhattan' continued the storyline nicely...but the laughs end when it's the same recycled plot and the protagonist never--ever--grows up. It's not \\"cute\\" that a woman in her *late 20's* (does anyone else realize this?) still giggles, LIES, and shops her way out of everyday situations. Where I used to love Becky, I now loathe her. Between the last 2 books I wonder why Luke would stay married to such a braindead bimbo. Yes, these books are an escape from reality, but there's also something called an insult to a reader's intelligence, and this series has definitely crossed that line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters not 'lovable' enough for me","review":"Although she is witty and sometimes funny, I found it hard to care about what happened to Becky Bloomwood. Her irresponsibility really bothered me and Luke didn't seem like that much of a catch. I like happy ending stories but was still disappointed in the overall story in the end. I most likely will not read any more of the series. The only thing I found amusing were her analogies of shopping/fashion to everything else in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last shopaholic book I'll ever buy!","review":"I've been a big Kinsella fan ever since I read her Undomestic Goddess book, followed by the Shopaholic series (yes, I read every single one of them!) I HAD looked forward to this one...and what a disappointment it was! Kinsella had a lot of material to work with...there's dearth of material to write about having a baby! But instead, Kinsella made Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) so STUPID! This is the first Kinsella book I bought that I cannot finish. This book was absolutely AWFUL! (Did anyone read her draft before publishing it?) I may never read any of Kinsella's books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could have been","review":"After the boring \\"Sister\\" chapter of this series, I was hoping that Becky would get back to shopping like the maniac we all know and love! Alas, it was not meant to be. Instead she focuses too much attention on the \\"other\\" woman in this story and it fizzles out. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I came away feeling very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same--but a fun read","review":"By now, Becky is well known to anyone who has read the series. This book isn't any different than the others--but it's a great, easy weekend read."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than shopaholic and sister","review":"hey shopaholic fans! this book was fantastic, had me laughing outloud and i finished it in no time, didnt want it to end though. im looking forward to the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like any of the characters, which made me not like the book","review":"Since I am pregnant and I have to take a lot of bed rest, I was hoping to read something fun. I forgot to read any of the reviews before I bought Shopaholic and Baby.I like shopping and playfulness but I also like adults communicating as grown-ups with their partners. I like to read about honest relationships and I guess, the \\"games people play\\" bore me.The main character, Becky was super selfish and immature. And everyone else played along with her shallowness. It made her adventures sad, not fun nor funny.I would not recommend this for readers, who would like a bit of cheering up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shopaholic CDs like Potato Chips, I Want More and More","review":"This CD is fun to listen to in the car. I love all the Shopaholic books, CDs, you name it. In this CD, our heroine Becky has a new baby and a new job as a personal shopper at a new department store. Unfortunately, the store is failing--but Becky manages to turn it around. Becky is losing the battle of her shopping addiction. She uses her new baby as an excuse to buy the craziest, most impractical baby clothes and products. It is hilarious and I enjoy the Shopaholic series, like potato chips. I will listen to or read as many as Sophie Kinsella can write."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's baaaaaaaaaaaack!!","review":"Becky Bloomwood strikes again in this cute chick lit comedy.

Will make good beach reading for summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful","review":"While attempting to read this book, I could not stop my gag reflex from releasing vomit into my throat. I have never in my life tried to read such a dreadful, plotless piece of tripe before. I slightly enjoyed Can You Keep a Secret? and was looking for another light read. This was so light it floated away on a sea of disgust. The book is 99% dialogue, i.e. there is no plot. The main character is heinously insipid. I refused to donate this book to be sold as used to prevent someone else from having to waste their time with this horrid book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of the Shopaholic Books","review":"I'm not going to get into the book but just wanted to write that I love all the Shopaholic books and this was by far, my favorite. When I read chick lit books I'm not expecting sudoku or political enlightenment and I'm sure most of you aren't either. It's a quick read because it's light and fun and you can escape everday life and live in Becky Bloomwood's little dreamworld for a while. ;) Perfect for the beach or a plane ride. If you haven't read the Shopaholic series yet I suggest you start from the beginning, Confessions of a Shopaholic. Enjoy and try not to take it all so seriously!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just because I am pregnant...","review":"...doesn't mean I want to read this book. This book was a gift from someone who when they discovered that I am expecting. I couldn't stand the first book, but after my coworker asked me multiple times if I had read the book, I decided to sit down and read it. I cannot relate the the main character at all. She is shallow and uninspiring. I can't comprehend what people like about these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This book is great! So funny!

I thought this Mellville guy writes and interesting and egageing story. Perhaps he does go into details that the story doesn't need, but even his tangents on trees and fruits, etc. are well written.Worth the money, worth the time, and worth the attention. Plus, there is the added benefit of acting like a literature snob on a review.:)Its a book, people. Relax, and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Kindle edition","review":"This is not a review of the book \\"Typee\\" but only the Kindle edition. The Penguin edition is based upon modern scholarship, choosing among four texts to create one version that may be close to Melleville's original intent. But the Kindle version is full of typos, word substitutions, and other artifacts of optical character recognition. There is about one typo per pageShame on Penguin for offering such a corrupted version of what was a well-edited edition. Buy the paperback if you care about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor kindle version","review":"There are plenty of free electronic versions available of Typee. But I decided to buy this one anyway assuming that the time spent by the editors on the footnotes and on combining several editions of the work, would be worth the money. But to my disappointment, this Kindle edition is just a scanned version of the printed book with OCR software applied to it. The book is not divided into chapters, there is no link between the footnotes and their location in the text (I didn't manage to figure out what the numbers of the footnotes actually refer to) and there are frequent OCR errors. If you want to read Typee on your Kindle, there are probably better versions available than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Melville Adventure Novel","review":"This book describes the story of Tommo, who finds himself in a valley with the dangerous (rumored cannibal) tribe of the Typee. Through a series of animatedly depicted scenes, Tommo's interaction with the natives is recorded first hand. Melville spent 4 years traveling through several Polynesian Islands and this undoubtedly influenced this book.Expect to see the typical Melvillian depiction of Christianity as oppressive, the culture of the innocent natives praised, all wrapped in the most creative/inventive/genius of language that Melville so strongly commands. My onyl critique is that the middle section of the book is quite slow, and his repeated explanations of the goings on in the natives lives becomes rather cumbersome to read. The volatile and exciting ending is fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Three stories -- one good, one thin but decent, and a third just hack writing in the thriller style. The good part of this novel is about the failed Franklin expedition -- interesting history, well-rendered, good focus on the boy, Gus and the second in command, Crozier. The decent story is of a polar bear, also well-researched and captivating. Tied to these two is the modern day story about the explorer and the journalist. The author creates stereotypes instead of real people. The story of the child is nothing but a tear jerker. The behavior of the half-brother, John, is extreme and unbelievable. And the idea that an intelligent and drop-dead beautiful woman like Catherine would fall for the warped John is absurd. Other than that, it's a decent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Vacation Novel","review":"I got this book at a book exchange grocery store in Arkansas. I enjoyed reading it and am with many of the other reviewers who had never heard of the Franklin expedition to find the Northwest Passage. The mix of present day with past and the incidental story of the polar bear kept the book fresh and one could never declare they were bored while reading it. I came away feeling the book would make a great movie and with an insatiable curiosity about this expedition. I loved and appreciated the authors footnote at the end of the story. I gave my book exchange book to my friends in Arkansas to read and now must get another one for my Northern Wisconsin friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unhappy blend of romance and history","review":"I opened The Ice Child expecting to read an historical novel, informed by the abiding mystery of the lost Franklin expedition. What I got was a warmed-over romance novel, ridden with cliches and purple prose, its characters about as convincing as pasteboard puppets. It's too bad, too, since the parts of the novel actually set during the 1840's when Franklin was underway are quite decent -- McGregor could have written a fairly compelling historical novel, but instead has produced a mashed-up mini-series. Readers looking for a fully mature historical fiction drawing upon these themes would do much better to pick up Andrea Barrett's Voyage of the Narwhal, now in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"This book was recommended to me because I am fascinated by the disappearence of the Franklin expedition. This book provides another possible outcome of the lost expedition. The Franklin material is interspersed with the tragic story of Jo Harper. Harper's story is timely in that her son is in need of a transplant, and the lack of bone marrow donors available. The ending was kind of predictable, but yet I never knew for sure if the donor would be found in time...or would Jo's son perish as those Franklin pioneers so long ago. I feel the author could have used less Franklin material and shortened the length of the book (433 pages in the paperback). Still, all in all, an exciting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb,unforgetable...","review":"Amazing story. Beautifully written. You MUST read the Ice Child.

The music is a great send-back to the country styles prevalent in the early 50's: western swing, honky-tonk sendups, and close harmony.

I cannot explain the disparity in strength rating between teabag and tin for the Irish Breakfast tea.My reason for buying Irish Breakfast tea was for my first cup of tea, higher strength than their English Breakfast tea.

The actors were terrific, as was the script and soundtrack. Each of the characters has a lot of depth and humanity, and I think a lot of women can relate to what Berdie goes through - the feeling of having lost yourself and your identity somewhere along the way.I had never been an especially big fan of Sandra Bullock until I stumbled upon this movie at a yard sale. I'm from a small town in Texas and have also lost a parent to Alzheimer's, and I thought this movie was very realistic.I think some people may have been dissappointed in Hope Floats because they were expecting it to be a comedy or have more action. It is drama and if you don't like dramas, you're not going to like this movie. I found Hope Floats to be very uplifting though.

In brief: a woman who is jilted by her husband returns home to Texas with her daughter. She's reunited with a classmate who had a crush on her in high school(and still does). The rest of the movie follows them spending time together, her being tentative about a new relationship, and a gratuitously goofy scene meant to tug at your heartstrings with the cast lip-syncing; it's just far too obvious. The best part of this movie revolves around the daughter; she's bullied in school, missing her father and actually makes us feel her emotional pain.

The good part about the film is the performance by Gena Rowlands. What a diverse actress she is, and her portrayal of a woman who loves but shows it in detached ways is credible.As for the \\"real\\" portion, having been through some of the life situations, I was pleased that they weren't undermined nor catastrophized.

Perhaps the script or directing was to blame. For whatever reasons, the movie ends up a flop.The initial \\"hook\\" -- cheating husband revealed on TV -- was clever enough, and the trip home to an oddball mom starts out kinda interesting. But from there, it's as if the writers/directors quit, and they just went through the motions for the rest of the movie.

Instead she discovers that the best of her and of life was there all along.Gena Rowlands marvelously portrays Birdee's eccentric mother and the remaining cast is a potpourri of great faces, none showy enough to be out of place and all the likes of those that Norman Rockwell would have been proud to portray in one of his \\"slice-of-life\\" masterpieces.THE HORSEMAN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life Drama","review":"Birdie Pruitt(Sandra Bullock)is shocked out of her complacency with the, so called, perfect life when her husband admits, on a public television talk show, that he has been unfaithful.

It was a HUGE waste of my time. Sandra Bullock STUNK in this movie. Normally she's great. The soundtrack stinks and I think adults didn't even like it, I know most teenagers didn't. We all thought this was going to be a romantic love story, not about a guy being totally boring the whole movie while trying to win some girls heart. This was a total waste of time and it took way too long to get the story down. I mean the first time she actually considers going out with him, it's been an hour. Most people turned it off because it takes her 55 minutes just to realize she loves him. Then they waste more time on this and that. This movie gets half a star and if they had it, that's what I would put. I don't recomend this movie at all. The people who gave it 5 stars are nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this movie","review":"I like Sandra Bullock and Harry Connick, Jr. I think they are decent actors.

Connick and Bullock deliver consistently fine performance throughout the movie, but the really spectacular heartbeats come from Bullock's daughter and mother... These two character actresses almost steal the show with their obvious love for Berti and their everyday emotional outbursts. I went to this movie with two friends, and we exited in sobs and tears. I bought the video immediately and whenever I need to really FEEL something, I take it from my shelf and watch it again. It may be corny and it may be predictable as a Hallmark card, but then, check the sales of Hallmark cards! We love things like that in our lives.

We actually had some that we spread melted Almond Bark on and sprinkled a few pecan pieces and sliced almonds on top. That was really good and different.

I was in my 20s then and bought it for everyone I knew who had a connection to the region.

However, the book is really much more than that. It gives brief biographies of 14 fascinating women from the Eighteenth Century. These were women such as Abigail Adams, Rose Bertin, Vigee-Lebrun and Madame Pompadour who were women of their time and yet, in many ways, curiously modern. Some defied convention, some worked within it, but all were unique personalities. The writing is enlightening and interesting and the illustrations are lovely. If you like the Eighteenth Century and women's place in history, you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow moving and below her usual standards","review":"It took me six weeks to get through this book ... and only because I was determined. The start was dreadfully dull. It was so slow every time I'd pick it up I'd fall asleep. I have to agree with the reader who said it was like a sleeping pill. The 3rd book wasn't as good as the 1st and 2nd, and this 4th installment was awful. If not for the interesting literary tidbits incorporating Sabine Baring-Gould into the story, I probably would have turned the book into the used bookstore. The ending was dull and uninteresting and did not make this read worthwhile. It was a simple and silly and too quick ending after all that work to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Even Finish It","review":"I've read Laurie R. King's work before, but this is the first \\"Mary Russell\\" novel that I've read, or tried to read, and it will be the last. It's premise of Sherlock Holmes marrying this boring shrew of a woman was unbelievable to me. Also, he seemed to have become dumber in his old age, asking questions that would have been \\"elementary\\" to the old Holmes. The plot, a phantom coach and a ghostly hound on the moor, is poorly developed and while supposedly a sequel to \\"The Hound of Baskervilles\\" isn't nearly as interesting as it could be. The book was incredibly slow to start, and I was so bored I couldn't read it for more than five minutes when I can usually sit and read for hours. There's hardly any mystery, no adventure, no sense of thrill, no brilliant deductions by Russell or Holmes, nothing which would mark a Sherlock Holmes mystery. Apologies to Ms. King, but she is no Doyle, and should stick to her non-Mary Russell novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This was my first and last Mary Russell novel and it doesn't surprise me that I'm not the first reviewer to say that. I'm not a purist so I don't mind it being unfaithful to the canon, but this book was just awful on its own merit. I agree completely with those who thought that this book was boring. I feel that \\"The Moor\\" was just a complete waste of my precious time and hard earned money. I will definitely not be reading anymore Laurie R. King books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This a great series. I recommend any book in this series. I can't wait for the next one to come out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very exciting","review":"This is the first book I have read by Laurie King, and I will have to try another before I judge her too harshly. This book was filled with rich \\"sherlock holmes\\" style story telling and fit the period nicely, but it had too little action for me and I found it too boring to finish. If you are looking for a fast paced thriller, this is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST read for mystery lovers!","review":"When I try to explain the premise of this Mary Russell series to my friends, who've admired my previous book suggestions, they all look at me with, well, lets face it - disappointment and sometimes concern. They get over it as soon as I can get them reading the first book in the series. These mysteries are intelligent, historical, bringing in theology and I just really appreciate Laurie King's use of language, her editing eye, really interesting and intriguing stories and characters. This is a great mystery series with both a strong female and male lead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reader from New York City","review":"This book is awfully slow going and pretty boring. The author spends most of her time describing things like her opinions, her surroundings, and the books she reads to fill in the time because even she is often bored. Unlike Conan Doyle's THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, the sense of mystery and tension just isn't in THE MOOR. Naturally, things pick up at the very end, but after trudging through some 400 pages to get there I mostly felt relief that the story was finally over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary, quite contrary ?","review":"I've given up trying to read this book. Like everyone else, I started with the wonderful 'The Beekeeper's Apprenctice' and am trying to read my way through the rest of the series, but none of the others have matched BA so far. And this one is just so bad, after struggling my way at the rate of 1/2 pages per day (v. rare for me I can tell you), I've now given it up as hopeless. I think the worst for me is to see Mary become the total antithesis of what she started out as - I think some reviewers here described her as a shrew, and a more apt expression couldnt be found. Most of the fun, in reading these pastiches was, alongside Holmes, to have the development of Mary into the wonderful character she was in the first and second books. I'm so disappointed with this, and even though O Jerusalem has good reviews I might take a break before getting back to the Russell series again."},{"rating":"2","title":"feminist escapes the great grimpen mire","review":"In Laurie King's excellent new addition to her popular BeeKeeper's Apprentice series, Holmes and his wife, the intrepid Mary Russell, return to the Devonshire Moors, home of the Baskervilles and numerous ghastly legends. They help out Sabine Baring-Gould (a true British eccentric in the most Monty Python sense) and bond further. King takes a lovely scholarly approach to her mysteries, much admired in this less than literate age, although her details are more Sayer-like than Doyle-esque. I still have a little trouble with Holmes as a love god, but maybe in the next book, Mary can elope with Lord Peter Whimsy. Here's hoping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take your time to enjoy this","review":"In the fourth book of the Russell - Holmes series Laurie R. Kingpresents us with a novel that echoes the time and pace of the surroundings - the moor. As many reviewers noted, the pace is slow. Time is spent on atmosphere, character development, and in subltle humor that will not be to the taste of everyone. I liked this book better than books two and three in the series, but that might have been because I was in the mood for more leisurely pursuits than when I read the other two. I think Ms. King handled the challenge of returning to the scene of perhaps Holmes' most famous case, in a deft and successful way, but don't read this immediately after watching an Indiana Jones movie. Put the kettle on to boil, let the tea steep, and take your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beach Reading without shame!","review":"The fourth in the Mary Russell series. I agree with the other reviewers about the slow pace of the book - but I liked it. It's a great series - the books are generally a quick read, and usually touch on some topic in enough detail that your interest is sparked into finding a little more about what you're reading about."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Happened to Laurie?","review":"I was initially bowled over by Laurie King's \\"Mary Russell\\" series(and her Kate Martinelli series too). THE BEEKEEPER'S APPRENTICE remains one of the best Sherlock Holmes sequels ever. But it seems each Russell book is a bit less effective than the last. THE MOOR has some wonderful bits of atmosphere, and Ms. King always finds amusing character insights, but the book starts and ends with little of genuine interest ever happening. Halfway through I had to admit that there was nothing other than sheer stubborness to keep me reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"CSI: NY Fourth Season","review":"The company mailed the video set in very short order. The item was in excellent condition. I recieved the package well within the timeframe given."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, terrible reading","review":"I honestly like the actual text of this book well enough. The Mary Russell series, particularly the first four, are an entertaining take on Sherlock Holmes. This narration, however, is very disappointing, primarily because the reader can't do a consistent American accent. The American in the tale veers wildly from southern to midwest to New England in his origins. Maybe non-Americans with particularly dull ears could enjoy this, but I couldn't even finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like it","review":"For those of us who are visual, the bird-call diagrams in this book are particularly helpful, and I've not found them in any other book. For example, we are shown that a Ring-Necked Pheasant exhibits a wing-whir after its song, even thought it can be difficult to hear in actual recordings.Some of the bird names, both common and scientific, are a bit out of date. The Boreal Chickadee is called the Acadian Chickadee here. Sedge Wren is Short Billed Marsh Wren.At rough count, there seem to be around 200 bird species documented here, and they (like many birding books) appear to have a slightly east-coast bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cautionary words - no 'Live\\" recordings of Rachmaninoff exist","review":"I must confess that I have not actually listened to this cd, but seeing the title says \\"In Concert\\" feel I should warn any unwary buyer that the cd cannot contain performances by Rachmaninoff in concert.Rachmaninoff, as the notes to RCA's set of his complete recordings tells, refused to broadcast - and all searches for rumored 'live' recordings turned up nothing.

They catalogue the fossils found, examine how we know what we know from the bones, tools and even the ash from the fires.The only problem is that the book was published in 1993-1994 and does not take into account later DNA tests and the four-year-old child who lived five thousand years after the last of the Neanderthals SHOULD of died (found in 1999)who showed signs of interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals.

The trains are very durable and I have no fear that he can choke on small parts. He has about 20 to 25 trains and has memorized each trains. Not just the names, but the facial expressions and how that expresses emotion. How he can tell the difference between some of them is beyond me. Bill, Ben and the other train pairs look identical to me. But he can rattle them off without error no matter how much I mix them up.

However, that light went bad too, doing the exact same thing as the first light only the problems started almost immediately (within weeks of getting it)With both lights, I did try putting brand new batteries in and for both lights it made no difference.Never again.

The carabiner-type opening is too near the edges so it is very difficult to remove it from a belt loop. If this is your intended use, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"I bought two of these lights and one functioned and the other did not. The instructions says if the light does not work, check the batteries. This means an additional charge to buy new batteries for the light which was supposed to come with batteries that worked.

The light is easy to turn on and off while wearing gloves in the winter, the clip is easy to attach to a zipper pull or to a key ring and the light is plenty bright to help me see so I can pick up after my dog at night. I also use this light to see when I'm trying to fit a key into a lock at night -- it's a great tool for this purpose. In a pinch, this light is bright enough to read by in the dark. The Impulse Multipurpose Light also comes with a clip so that you can attach it to the brim of a baseball cap and use it as a hands-free light, but I've never had occasion to try this accessory because the basic light works so well on my zipper. If I have any gripe at all about this product it is that it is just a wee bit larger than I might like for my use of it as a zipper-pull accessory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"These plates are just as good (better in my opinion) than regular paper plates you get from the grocery store.

Before using the Sonos I tried to use a low cost Linksys system and had a horrible experience. If you have more than a hundred or so tracks, these other systems are completely impractical. I use the Sonos with both my own MP3's that I keep on a NAS device, and with the Rhapsody service. Both work great. The only significant issue that I have is that it can be hard to find a particular track when you have thousands of tracks. Rhapsody has tens or hundreds of thousands of tracks. You have to guess the Genre right, and you have to scroll through a lot of artists. Sonos really needs to add a Search by name capability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy at this Price","review":"I love sonos but this listing appears to be for the ZP80 - an older sonos model and originally sold for $350.

I will not buy any Shakespeare from any other publisher - Signet Classics or anyone else. Folger has the best version hands down with its useful words and phrases on the left-hand page to help you out if necessary and give you a deeper understanding of the many references to outdated historical religious figures Shakespeare includes in The Merchant of Venice.A \\"Comedy\\"? I know technically its a comedy, but nonetheless with the less than comical themes of greed, morality, and anti-semitism, its hardly a laugh riot. Au contraire, it is Shakespeare's tour de force amongst his many enchanting comedies - much more potent and provocative than Midsummer Night's Dream. It's a shame it is banned in many high schools and colleges throughout the U.S. due to its supposed anti-semitism.

Along with the other Oxford Shakespeare books, this one has outstanding notes that are presented in such a way as to be easy to glance at while reading without breaking rhythm too much. I have found that each time I think to myself, \\"I don't quite understand,\\" there is a note on point that sets me back on the right track. There are also high-quality but very accessible essays and background information provided after the text of the play.Every time I'm going to read a Shakespearean play, I look for a version in this series; it is certainly worth a couple extra dollars or the frustration of reading from different page numbers than classmates if you are reading for a class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, Witty, Morality Play","review":"This is a wonderful play - and unless you have seen it or read it you don't know it at all. That's because everything the popular culture tells us about this play is false (for example; how many of you think this play is about a merchant named Shylock? ;-)The Merchant of Venice is a lively and happy morality tale. Good triumphs over bad - charity over greed - love over hate.There is fine comedy. Portia is one of Shakespeare's greatest women (and he ennobled women more than any playwright in history). There are moments of empathy and pain with all the major characters. There is great humanity and earthiness in this play. These things are what elevate Shakespeare over any other playwright in English history.Plays should be seen - not read. I recommend you see this play (if you can find a theater with the courage and skill to do it). But if it is not playing in your area this season - buy the book and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare at his worst.","review":"This play is one of the major works of anti semitism in history. This play made me very angry and hurt that Shakespeare thought this way about the jews. Shylock was a fully dimensional character but he was just a human representation of a bigoted idea. Shakespeare had never met a jew in his life because all the jews had already been expelled from England. The ending was sad and pathetic. Maybe I missed something in reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean it up","review":"When I want to read Shakespeare, I want to read Shakespeare.

I didn't notice it the first time around, but that page is really scary and disturbing, especially to a little kid who is sensitive to the emotions on other people's faces.

The original version of DX (HBK, HHH and Chyna) is featured more than the second incarnation (HHH, Chyna, X-Pac and the New Age Outlaws), so those hoping to see lots of footage of 'Pac and the NAO will be a bit disappointed. However, all DX fans will be delighted with this humorous video, as many of the early, classic DX moments are featured.

Ofcourse, I bought this around four years ago but it would be nice if WWE made a new DX DVD and added more such as matches, promos, etc. Despite that, it's a good non-pay per view video and highlights the biggest moments of DX mainly during the the HBK version of DX. It seems to stop after May of 1998 since there is some footage (very brief) of DX fighting the Nation. If anything, it highlights some classic moments such as the war on WCW, the countless (...) jokes, and others. As I said, it would be nice if this video was turned into a DVD with much more footage. Still, this is the best (and only) DX video available."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the funniest wrestling video ever.","review":"When I first heard of this video, i knew it would be cool. Once you pop it in, you are entertained till the end. The clips of HHH, HBK, and Chyna are hilarious, especially the little part on the language of Raw is War. It does have some nudity, when HBK, HHH, and the new york girls show a little somethin'. It would have been better if they showed more of the Michaels/Undertaker fued, but they can't fit too much into 1 hour.

Pierre Leulliette left the Army after three years of service and returned to France, but came away troubled by what he saw and what was done during his time in the military.This book is one of very few accounts in English to cover this conflict and is well worth the time tracking down a copy.

The Golum is a formidable apparition of sticks and cloth and assorted bits of rubbish and toss-away things (doll heads, plastic spoons, etc). I brings to mind the Spell Golem creature made famous by Stan Winston, Pumpkinhead, and is equally frightening,; as shown on the face of the young woman ensnared in it's grasp.

I know little about trains, myself, but have always loved British movies filmed onboard, especially the Orient Express.I had no idea that a train of this caliber was running in Mexico today, and then was further floored by the scenery and history behind this particular leg. I especially appreciated the narrator's respectful comments about the people of this land, and his encouragement for people to take this journey to this marvelous canyon (few Americans know about) if they can.This would make a wonderful commentary in a History or Spanish classroom, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have LP/CD!","review":"As a Record/CD/45 Collector, I must say there are certain LP's now CD's in Today's World, you MUST OWN, if you're willing to capture the BEST sound in ANY ERA!Well, there are many, too many to explain in this short reference, but when I first received my initial LP/45 to CD Recorder, the most important [Hard-to-find] LP was \\"If You Saw Thro My Eyes\\" by former Fairport Convention member, Ian Matthews!

The plot was thin and there was way too much thinking. I found myself skipping through pages and pages.

They spent a total of two short meetings in his office and two days and a night together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Sandra Marton","review":"This was very a very entertaining read. Great dialogue and chemistry between the her and heroine, and very romantic. Thank you Harlequin for re-releasing these out of print books in kindle format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fascinating!","review":"I can't wait to go out and buy this book, which I read in hardcover from the library. It is very well researched and illustrated and discusses clothes and fashions from long ago up till today. And not just fashions and how they change, but what they MEAN. For example, did you know....in olden times, not just elegant clothing, but cloth itself was and admired and expensive commodity. The more cloth making up one's clothing meant that person was wealthy. Paintings of the period featured draperies in the background to indicate a person's wealth, and even today designer clothing uses more cloth and is cut fuller, carrying on the tradition. Anyone interested in not only fashion and clothing but symbols and history should read this book, it is just fascinating and delicious."},{"rating":"1","title":"half-hearted effort","review":"the information in this book is not bad, but the way in which it is presented is confusing and poorly edited. there are many mistakes, from the quiz answers assigned to the wrong questions to misspelled words. i would highly recommend cliffsap biology in place of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT ITALIAN PROGRESSIVE ROCK WITH A TOUCH OF FUSSION","review":"OSANNA BELONGS TO THE PROGRESSIVE ITALIAN SCENE OF THE SEVENTIES.

Can't beat this shoe for the price!","review":"Love the super sticky new rubber. Great all around shoe for beginners and advanced climbers alike. But as the other reviewer said, these are designed to be a very tight fitting shoe and every shoe fits people differently. Street shoe size is a good tight fit with toes fully curled. Not comfortable if you're not used to it. While I like the idea of vegan friendly shoes, the unlined leather is still unbeatable for comfort because it will stretch and mold to your feet. Plus isn't leather a renewable resource as opposed to synthetics which are usually made from oil? I expect these to stretch quite a bit and get more comfortable as I wear them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sized small!","review":"These shoes are sized about 1 to 1.5 sizes smaller than what I generally wear.

I read it. All the way through. I thoroughly enjoyed it--I loved Shel Silverstein's poem, Mary Higgins Clark's story as well as many others.Though the cover made me feel embarassed to be holding the book, it is worth being teased for reading something that looks like pulp fiction. If you like this book, read \\"Murder for Love\\" as well.

Other than that, the storyline is easy to follow and there are alot of action packed scenes that keep you on edge. I would watch this a second time. And that's saying alot being that I am not much of a Nicholas Cage fan. Good film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Nicolas Cage....usually","review":"I know many don't like old Nick, but I typically find his movies enjoyable and entertaining.

I'm a Nicolas Cage action movie junkie. Face off, Snake Eyes, National Treasure, Next, on and on. If Cage is in it and its done halfway decent, I'm probably going to like it. Cage is intense, believable and likable as an action star, and its best when hes on the run and all the odds are against him. \\"Stolen\\" fits that bill to a tee. Classic Nicolas Cage, back against the wall, on the run, everyone in the world out to get him and running out of time. Loved every minute of it. Fun, exciting, good story line and Cage on the run. Nothing but fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Nic Cage might have done a nice job in his role, but the movie suffers from a cliche plot. I'm not kidding, I saw pretty much EVERYTHING coming before it did. His daughter being kidnapped. The happy reunion. The hidden heist. I mean, just about every plot point in here has been done to death. Using ONE of these plot points would have been adequate, but when you mash in a whole bunch of them, it makes for a rather predictable story.

They even use the overgrown theme park that closed a few years ago. Josh Lucas is indeed a well rounded actor and he played quite a different role than I am used to him portraying. He did it well. Cage was in a similar style. It wasn't outstanding but overall it was certainly worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicholas cage fan","review":"What can I say.

The revelation is there's no revelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbed Jr?","review":"For some reason, as i listened to this album, I kept picutring David Drainman from Disturbed's less evil twin as the vocalist for this band. I also expected the singer to break out into the chorus of \\"Stupify\\" at any moment as well. Oh well. This band is pretty much like any other hard rock band out at the moment. The usual quite verse followed by a heavy chorus. Nothing new or to write home about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Solid Hard Rock","review":"The Up Side: Revelation Theory sort of flew under my radar earlier this year when they released Selfish and Cold, so I'm a bit new to these guys, but if Truth Is Currency is any indication of what greatness this band will become, they've got a fan for life in me. Currency is refreshing hard rock in the vein of Staind and early Breaking Benjamin, a style that seems to have dropped off quite a bit in recent years. From Out Of Our Hands to Over The Line, RT packs 10 gems back to back for a pleasing 30+ minutes.The Down Side: Currency is pretty short. A couple more songs would have rounded things out nicely. Also, one of my favorite RT songs, Far From Home, isn't on here!!The Conclusion: Fans of Seether, Staind, Breaking Benjamin and Allele should find alot to enjoy on Truth Is Currency. Even casual rock/nu-metal fans can enjoy the singles, so what are you waiting for? GET IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rev Theory Has Me Addicted To Their Music","review":"I love this CD, the singer of Rev Theory reminds me of how Trent Reznor (nin) does vocals, not on all of the songs just on a few. I love bands that do this kind of rock music. Rev Theory's music is more than amazing, because they inspire me, and I can relate to their songs in my life now , or in my past. This is a band you should know about. I can't stop listening to their music. Rev Theory's lyrics are also great. It's to hard to choose my favorite songs off the album, because i love the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome cd","review":"i bought this cd and their latest one the other day and this one hands done is better. its short but every song is good. every chorus is great too. i didnt even skip one song on the first time listening to it. i wish their newer cd was more like this one. favorite songs are undone, world to burn, and slowburn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I use these cartridges on my 3M 7500 series half facepiece mask when I'm adding muriatic acid to my pool.

Remixed by the Urban Shakedown Bid (Mickey Finn and Aphrodite, albums you should pick up as well!), they set the wheelz of steel into overdrive. However, the other tracks lack in the jump up intensity as \\"Fire\\", but there is still a mighty serving of the dubplate special with plenty of dope ragga MCing on the side.

Based on the true-to-life experience of the Simpkin Family, I was very impressed with the flow of the film, the acting was wonderful and the writing team did a fantastic job. I also love the fact that the Simpkin family was directly involved with the filming process. All emotions will be felt as you watch this movie, so prepare yourself and have tissues near by. What really resonated with me is that even though Randy and Christal marriage struggles through the movie, and Randy's family is not priority, you see the hand of God throughout all the circumstances. I was truly impacted by the faith journey Randy took in The Way Home.A great movie that I highly recommend! Great for the movie buff on your Christmas list this year! Received as part of my participation with Book Sneeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for The Way Home","review":"This movie shows the importance of keeping family priorities straight. The movie is clean and shows nothing controversial or ungodly. However, it is very slow moving in it's story line, and I found myself questioning 'When are we going to get on with the plot?'

I found this book a joy to read and quite an inspiration to visit the natural wonders of Hawaii."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Cunningham went through great lengths to give an in-depth look into the mystical, beautiful world of Hawaiian spirituality. He did it with the view of a deeper understanding of the people and places that make Hawaii such a unique paradise, and he presented the native Hawaiian's spiritual views with the respect they deserve.

The control and feel are unmatched by any other pick, and they fit perfectly in my hand reducing pick re-positioning when strumming for an extended period of time. This was the perfect pick until I came across the Dava Master Control pick. It is very unique with a plastic grip (tactile) for your hand, and a nickel metal edge for the string. Years ago I used to use a nickel for a pick, but of course this was hard to control and the edge seemed to prematurely wear the strings. This pick solves both problems, control and a more rounded edge produce an outstanding pick. They are expensive, but worth it if you are a serious player."},{"rating":"2","title":"dava pic control","review":"I like these pics .

I used the Master Control Pick for the first time today, and I just had to order two more, because they're so amazing!! The attack is second to none!! At first the pick felt a bit strange as I'm accustomed to the thicker Dunlop, and I have to admit that initially I was a bit weary of the notably thinner Dava; but in no way has my playing been hindered, if anything it just seems to run along the strings effortlessly, and by far these are the most comfortable picks I've ever used!!

My only complaint is that the eye holes in the mask were too small. They were very close to my sons eyes and his lashes kept sweeping the edges of eye holes. I cut them a bit larger but he still wouldn't wear the mask pulled over his face. Before going out I used face paint to frame his eyes like a mask. It worked well, but later he decided to wear the actual mask with the face portion scrunched up on top of his head. It was just as cute that way. I took another reviewer's advice and used black socks just in case the suit was a little short. It was right at his ankles, so I wouldn't try it on a tall 3 year old. Mine wears a 3T. Over all, the bat suit was great and came with everything pictured. Some dark colored sneakers made it complete. Totally worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK, but runs small.","review":"When I received the costume it looked as I expected and thought we were going to be happy. But when we put it on my son, it was too small. The mask didn't fit at all over his head and the neck was WAY too small to close. So we just decided not to close the back (which was going to be covered by the cape anyway) and not wear the mask. But then my son complained that it was too itchy (I was surprised, because it seems like it would be soft).

I would have waited to buy this CD until then. My CD arrived scratched because of the \\"fancy\\" packaging and there are a couple of tracks unplayable. While Joni Mitchell's singing is AMAZING (5 stars! ) on the tracks I could play, it is NOT worth the extra money to buy this edition. WAIT until the CD only one is available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz From Both Sides Now","review":"On Mitchell new project she takes a break from educating herself and the masses (Even if it takes up awhile to catch up) and escapes into jazz standards. The selection of song goes from love found to love Lost and then reflection. The songs are well chosen The arrangements are lush, and Joni's voice is richer Than ever. Her voice does not have the quality Of a Sarah Vaughan, but her phrasing and delivery could teach Dianna Krall a thing or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"What little I was able to hear of this new CD, oh so fancifully packaged- sounded wonderful! But like other reviewers, I must say the packaging itself seems designed to destroy the CD before you can listen to it!

In fact, I returned the first one, recieved a second one and it too arrived damaged in the same way! (I returned it also.) I gotta tell ya though... the folks at Amazon were great! They rushed out that replacement in a couple days, and were helpful and understanding when I had to call them back to arrange the return of the second one. (And gave me a full credit, no hassles at all!) Now all I have to do is await the release of a good old regular version, sans fancy packaging that destroys the product.

Gunnar's sense of humor and practical advice really made me think about college. If you know of some1 who needs some help in college, this would certainly make a great giftI only have 2 complaints that prevent this from being a five star book:1.While humorous, its a bit unstructured and its difficult to fully harness the advice. You really need it to settle in2.I dont like how Gunnar litters the pages with his seminar material. It just feels like a get-rich quick scheme.Overall, don't go on his website to order extra materials for college success. This book will suit most just finePersonally, I found two books to be more helpful: \\"How to win at college\\" and \\"how to become a straight-a student\\" both by Cal Newport.

These errors really are a distraction, and I found them take away from the telling of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious spelling makes this book painful to read","review":"We are READERS and know how to spell. It is extremely painful to read a book with such a large number of spelling mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I wanted this book for the story line. The story line was interesting about revenge and even had a small subplot in which a man and wife are able to resolve their issues after several years. The story line itself was enjoyable, but the typos in this book detracted from the story. I found myself continuously fixing the typos in my mind as I was reading this book, and even had to re-read a section because the characters were confused (as to who was doing and saying what) at one point. I was able to get through this book, but was left severely disappointed with it. Had this book been edited, I think I would have truly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really not a good design book","review":"This review is of the 1982 paper back version of the 1968 hard cover book. I've included in Images above a few of the pictures. There's not a single picture in color and there lies the rub: it's very hard to apply pattern or texture without color. Only specifically black and white patterns are useable but the vast majority of photos would show rich vibrant color. Look at the final image above: those directions for color are part of the book, not mine. Pretty much a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPARKS LOWEST PEAK","review":"Though it is hard to give one of the greatest ignored bands a two-star rating...\\"Terminal Jive\\" is probably one of Sparks' most unlistenable albums. \\"When I'm With You\\" is a good intro to the album...danceable, rhythmic, & romantic. But, the rest of the album sounds a like score for some made for T.V. soundtrack. It is not what's expected as a follow up for the \\"No. 1 Song in Heaven,\\" disco-rated Sparks, yet humorous & ball-sy. \\"Rock-n-roll People in a Disco World\\" reveals the album's theme, but album sounds flat overall. For Sparks fans...there's a few here you'll love & the album's worth purchasing. In fact, it's great to see the album availble in the U.S. for the first time ever! But for newcomers, this album is no go. Don't let this rating distract you from the #1 band in heaven! Sparks will have as big as a following as Led Zeppelin as soon as people stop listening with their eyes and start listening with their ears again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This is among Sparks weakest albums by any measure. The fact it is the follow-up to a brilliant monster of a record (No. 1 in Heaven) makes it seem all the worse. When I'm With You was deservedly a smash hit in Europe, but there is precious little else worthy of anyone's time here. If you happen to be in the process of building a Sparks catalog, this should be among your very last acquisitions."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not made of wood. Very flimsy.","review":"This cabinet is made of a very cheap version of particle board covered by thin paper veneer. It is a total piece of junk. The shelves are not designed to take mixed media. I would not recommend this cabinet to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirates?","review":"There are 4 movies on this DVD. Only one is a pirate movie in the sense that most of us think of them. That one is The Black Pirate, which is in black and white and is a silent film (with a rather annoying accompaniment). There are some great \\"pirate\\" scenes in this movie. Jamaica Inn is a really good movie, but it deals with \\"wreckers\\" (people who lure ships aground) and not pirates on the sea. Captain Calamity and Wallaby Jim are 'way too modern to be considered pirate movies. I was quite disappointed with this purchase. I gave it a rating of 2 because I really enjoyed watching Jamaica Inn (it was Maureen O'Hara's debut movie alongside a great cast)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great mystery","review":"The saga of \\"The Queen's Man\\" continues in this well written, fast paced mystery. As before, Penman weaves more than one story line throughout the narrative. A delightful book; don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant","review":"\\"Cruel as the grave\\" as well as \\"the queen's man\\" are mysteries you find the answer before the end of the book. They are easy and fast reading historical mysteries.I highly recommend Dorothy Dunnett, \\"The house of Niccolo\\" and then (not before) the \\"Chronicle of Lymond\\".Of course, one shall also read \\"The name of the rose\\" (Umberto Ecco)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Penman quality I've come to expect.","review":"The first novel I read of Sharon Kay Penman took me less than a week to complete. It was well over a thousand pages and I had finals in graduate school, but I couldn't put it down. Cruel of the Grave is not the same caliber of book. Penman's gift of developing characters and a storyline that readers feel intimately involved with is not established in this text. I have read all of her historical novels. After reading each novel I anxiously waited for the next to be published. Penman's talent clearly lies within her ability to write amazing medieval novels, not medieval mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for people who want a stress reliever","review":"I really enjoyed every track of this album.

Pre 2003 does not do it for me.As I write this, I am listening to track 2...........repetitive. there is no creativity.i hate i wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the Bad Reviews, I Loved It!!!","review":"I absolutely loved this movie and highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't yet seen it. It's a wonderful collage of several suburban families who are somehow linked together although the reason is not revealed until the very end of the movie. Do yourself a favor and ignore the bad reviews and try it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"This movie got more confusing as it went on. The only reason we kept watching was the excellent cast, which was wasted on a rambling, pretentious, faux arty mess. Four simultaneous and overlapping plot lines with four families is an invitation to chaos, and they fully take that opportunity. Lots of intriguing possibilities but nothing really develops into coherence - reminiscent of Bergman's \\"Scenes from a Marriage\\" in its bleak, unrelenting despair. Like other reviewers have noted, the sudden happy sending seemed false and grafted on, suggesting that the movie makers had the same trouble we did in figuring out where all this was going."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Confused Mess!!!","review":"Large ensemble pieces like this take a great deal of directing skill, ala Robert Altman, that this filmmaker obviously did not have. The movement between stories of three different families and several individuals was awkward at best and completely muddled at worst. I also found myself not caring about these people, who struck me as uninteresting, unbelievable and unengaging. In addition, most of the actors, with the exception of the often wonderful Patricia Clarkson, either overacted or felt like cardboard cutouts of their characters. This was an abyssmally bad and silly film that should have gone straight to video with a warning on its cover that read \\"For less than mature audiences only.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"To confused to get emotional","review":"Im a sucker when it comes to emotionality in films and will often get teary during movies: Big Fish, Seabiscuit, etc. This movie was so confusing that instead of getting emotionally involved with any of the characters I found myself concentrating more on trying to figure out what was happening in the story. I felt that there were two really interesting parts in the movie, one where a young boy holds conversations with his sisters barbie doll but finds out that a real girl is much better and another scene where a young girl gets abducted. Overall not a very well done movie which was disappointing for me since there are some excellent actors in the movie. The book was probably much better since it didnt need to be condensed into such a short time frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"FIGHT CYSTIC FIBROSIS NOT IRAQ\\"","review":"I had read \\"Alex The Life Of A Child\\" and at times could imagine where Alex may have been were she alive today, especially as of late I couldn't help but see her in my mind's eye as one who may have kept *very* abreast of current events and knowing the sort of dreams she had, she would be at anti- war protests carrying signs reading \\"FIGHT CYSTIC FIBROSIS NOT IRAQ,\\" for she would have wanted war on afflictions of that sort rather than on Middle Eastern countries.Had read the book and found Alexandra Deford seemed to show a lifetime of gutsiness and true grit in dealing with things such as her affliction in just 8 short years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Passion for all of us","review":"I read this book several times and each time it had made me cry. Alex is such a strong character. This book is touching and spirit-lifting. Alex only lived for eight years but while she lived she touched the livesof the people around her, and when she died she left behins a incredible story of courage and stength. This is the kind of story that stays with you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and Inspiring","review":"Frank Deford lovingly recounts the brief life of his precious daughter, Alex as she battles Cystic Fibrosis. Not only is this a loving biography of a child, it gives a perspective of what it is like to have a child with special medical needs, who ultimately dies. It isn't just the patient who must deal with the disease, but the whole family. I would recommend it to anyone, but especially to those who either know a family who has a special needs child or who works with children in any capacity."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hey, Mom pass the soap - Alex Deford\\"","review":"I am so thankful for people like Alex and for her father for writting this book.The first time I saw the movie was with my best friend that had CF.We were just ten years old.I think it was my friends way of telling me about her disease and the severity of cf.

It's the best piece of this type to come out of this period and seen by many as MacInnes' best work.

What I found was a poorly written, poorly researched, poorly documented, poorly argued book that will satisfy only those who have already made up their mind about the Bible. It is not for the genuine truth seeker who seeks to weigh and evaluate evidence. THe author uses inflamatory language to degrade people who do believe in the Bible. Instead of consulting primary souce material that is readily available, the author quotes from secondary and tertiary sources, mostly from anti-Christian sources. The author claims that this work was his Doctor of Theology thesis. I can't quite understand how any reputable university could accept this work as scholarly research.

Best soccer shoes he's ever owned. Made it thru August, Sept and Oct with either 2 hours of games or practices at least 5 days per week with minimal wear. The insoles were the first to go, however, he's still playing in the shoes over the winter because they are more comfortable than the Diadoras he wanted to try next. The shoes come with leather conditioner - we used it about every two weeks plus we kept cedar shoe trees inside the shoes when not in use.

The subject inside has nothing to do with the title. I was pulled in by false advertizing on that alone. I felt like I was invited to an old country estate and left outside to look in the windows. The interesting vignettes are far and few between, and the reader never really gets to know the characters well. I don't know the author, presumably who is the center point of the book. There are better books that discuss the decline in religious life, or chronicle individuals who have lived out their vocations.Perhaps \\"The Calling\\" will be a better read for someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glimpse","review":"The reviewer below notes that the subtitle is a bit misleading and I agree. I was expecting the story of one woman's time spent in cloistered seclusion. The story that unfolded, however, was far more intriguing. Whitney adeptly addresses her own \\"calling\\" while exploring the faith of other women and the evolution of modern standards for nuns.If this topic holds the same type of fascination for you, I strongly recommend the novel Lying Awake by Mark Salzman."},{"rating":"1","title":"No part sufficient for a whole to develop","review":"The overall sense I received from this work is that Catherine Whitney is more interested in speaking of herself (without so much as answering the question of why she suddenly shifted from would-be religious Sister to unbelieving radical feminist). The anecdotal information about several Sisters in the earlier chapters seems a promise of real development later, but this promise remains unfulfilled.Half stories, some of which seem flavoured by stereotypes and prejudiced assumptions, are profoundly unsatisfying, particularly since the natural presumption to which the early chapters would lead was that depth, development, and understanding of the various Sisters' situations would follow. It did not happen. There is a sampling of moments from various Sisters' lives (not, as the sub-title implies, a chronicle of a year in the life of an Order), but no insight into anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was she really called?","review":"I find it hard to believe that the author was ever \\"almost\\" a nun. This rambling memoir gives no insight into the vocation, and is blantantly wrong on a serious matter of theology, e.g. The Immaculate Conception. This church dogma refers to Mary being born with without original--immaculate at HER conception. It does NOT mean \\"she was not defiled in the process\\" of conceiving Jesus! This is a basic tenet of the Roman Catholic church, and one that jumps out at a reader with a background of religious education."},{"rating":"1","title":"No part developed sufficiently for a \\"whole\\" to emerge","review":"The overall sense I received from this work is that Catherine Whitney is more interested in speaking of herself (without so much as answering the question of why she suddenly shifted from would-be religious Sister to unbelieving radical feminist).

She exposed her own misgivings and feelings very clearly and chronicled (nicely) her own spiritual quest."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting, but anecdotal, without a bibliography, and with some startling mistakes","review":"This book is a mishmash, and is poorly named, particularly the subtitle (maybe the publisher chose it?). It's interesting and heartfelt, and obviously the author cares a great deal for the subject. But it wanders back and forth.She makes some errors that would be astonishingly easy to have corrected.As someone else pointed out, the Immaculate Conception is Mary being born without the taint of original sin, not Jesus's birth. That's the Virgin Birth.The word \\"discalced\\" does not mean anything \\"literally\\" about poverty. It means \\"shoeless.\\"The correct name of the high school in Seattle is not \\"Blanchette\\" but \\"Blanchet.\\"She has no bibliography and cites no sources for her information.Interesting and heart-felt, but not a work of scholarship, which is a pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title!","review":"I got this book because as a post-Vatican II Catholic, I wanted to know what type of life nuns had. I never went to Catholic school and my parish really never had any nuns present. To date, I still don't know! This title is very misleading. The author did not chronicle a year in the life; she took anecdotes from various nuns of their personal experience with their vocation. Also, one should be warned that the author is a lapsed Catholic with some bitter feelings toward the male hierarchy of the Catholic church that she has not resolved. Most of the anecdotes in this book are by women who left their orders because they were dissatisfied. Overall, the book was well-written and kept me very interested, but I believe the title is completely misleading and will cause more people to buy the book than normally would have, myself included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probes the face of modern journalism","review":"This profile of both journalism and events after September 11th provides a blend of social history and a survey of how journalism's classic structure was shaken by the events of September 11th.

Call it alternative country, alternative folk, whatever - Hazeldine's high desert harmonies are brooding, introspective and sometimes (as on track three, Jeff Magnum's \\"April 8th\\") verge on eerie. Think Mazzy Star meets Emmylou Harris. There's the mystique of the long dark desert highway in all Hazeldine's music and this CD is no exception. They perform these covers with as much intensity and integrity as their original music. It was recorded during the same session that produced their Polydor European release \\"Digging You Up\\" (all original music).

The recordings on this 2 CD set only serve to further showcase the true talent of these four brilliant musicians. Not only do they sound note for note perfect playing original Beatles tunes, but here, they take a recognizable Beatles song and mix it with a popular Christmas song, making for a clever Beatlesque version of the latter. I have given several of these sets as gifts, each time to the total amazement of the recipient. One thing I can guarantee... Christmas music or not, you'll want to play these all year long.

After the song was over, the DJ said that it was the Fab Four.

Here they continue their mastery with performances unsurpassed in ensemble precision, musicality and beauty of sound.The recorded sound, as always from this source, is demonstration quality.[Having other recordings of the Zemlinsky symphony and Berg songs, I was not bothered by the omission of the text inside the booklet.

It was great and as an impulse bought Seven Ways. The set was great but somehow I didn't really enjoy it. When I got 45 RPM, it became one of my all time favorites, and probably the best PVD tracks, especially For An Angel. After listening to 45 for a while, I gave Seven Ways another try. How amazing the change was! At first I thought the set was mediocre, but after 45 RPM, it just blew me away! If anyone out there wants to try PVD, I suggest you try 45 RPM first, then move on to his other cds (try Seven Ways next), that way you'll probably appreciate Paul Van Dyk even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"Paul Van Dike mixes some of the best music I have ever heard.

It starts off very slow and dreamy, building its way up and down at a steady pace, the way DJs are supposed to. Often we'll find an artist seemingly assemble a CD randomly with their tracks, where a slow and sensual groove can become a banging wreck the very next moment. There are no such problems with this CD, featuring the infectious single \\"For an Angel\\", and also includes a more dance-oriented remix at the end of the disc.I refrained from giving this album the magical 5 star rating because it wasn't quite as good as \\"Seven Ways\\", which is a masterpiece among masterpieces in the electronic music genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again, I requested to see DVD's and instead was delivered a used book instead of a DVD","review":"Please stop mixing books with DVD's when the request to SEE DVDs is what is requested.

Scenes of brilliantly theatrical melodrama and broad, attractive comedy jockey for position in this engaging novel, showing Dickens at his best : as both a social crusader and a sharp-eyed commentator on the foibles of the world he lived in. A marvelous, rewarding book"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Not A Review of Nicholas Nickleby","review":"This short review is not about Charles Dickens or his fantastic book - Nicholas Nickleby. This review is about Robert Whitfield. Although I'm not an avid book listener (maybe 30 within my life so far) I found the reading of Dickens by Robert Whitfield to be absolutely fantastic! There are many good voice actors out there but Robert is the best I've ever heard. Every aspect of the reading is amazing... from the different voices to his clear narrative reading of the English language the way it was meant to be spoken.

The latter is depicted as a hero, but really does nothing heroic, ie: beats up two considerably older men and gets away scot free; gets bailed out of a hopeless situation by the lynch pin inexpicably suddenly dying; and his love for a woman is based entirely on her looks. His poverty and misery occupies maybe only a quarter of the book as he again gets luckily saved by these two do-gooder brothers.

Alongside Tommy Lee Jones and Melanie Griffiths you find Sting ( carrying coals to Newcastle indeed) and Sean Bean. The plot is pretty straightforward, mafia boss comes to do a deal on Tyneside and tries to get rid of the minor obstacles in the process. The movie goes along a la Long Good Friday but without the mystery and menace. Gratuitous violence is liberally sprinkled around as are the shots of the city. Nowhere in the movie do we have a shot of the city of Gateshead located on the opposite bank of the river where the Michael Caine movie, Get Carter was filmed, but the movies themselves have some similarities.In the end Sting and Sean win the day...All in all an enjoyable gangster flick with a Geordie accent.

He finds don Juan, who indeed knows a lot about such plants, including the fact that they are (only) minor aids on the path to becoming a \\"man of knowledge.\\" Unfortunately, Castenada doesn't figure this out, doesn't understand what is going on, and generally gets scared and confused by the mess he's gotten himself into.Readers are often encouraged to read Castenada's books in order, and that certainly makes sense, but this first one can (and should) be safely skipped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Unique Read","review":"This is a unique story of a man's path to knowledge through the use of hallucinates.

Thinking, if it is meant to be that I find out about it - it will happen. Almost twenty years later, someone mentioned that a man whom I knew already would have written many books which are well-read in the world in many languages. These books would be published under the name Carlos Castaneda. Since that time I have a different connection to the man who is the true writer of the books. In case you are able to read Spanish and have a chance to travel to Mexico, here is the book's title written from the author about the situation he had with Castaneda: \\"Cuando sea grande...\\" Since this poor author had to do all himself, the book does not appear the way readers from North America are used to, but it is well worth to be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"personal fav","review":"These books are just classics!

But with the others under my belt, I was able to see what Castaneda was demonstrating out of his bag of tricks, and also could appreciate his maturing by the time he wrote his subsequent works.My view is that each word in the title is misleading, especially to someone new to Castaneda. The information and perspectives are not from Yaqui tradition, and this book does not represent what don Juan actually taught."},{"rating":"1","title":"Castaneda's books are hoaxes","review":"When I first read this book, I completely swallowed it and became obsessed with the idea of this separate reality and way of knowledge described by Castaneda.However, a modicum of skeptical thinking marks this and the rest of Castaneda's books as shameless hoaxes. And not very good ones, even... Comparing his different books it's easy to find lots of inconsistencies. They, of course, can be rationalized by the true believer by saying that Castaneda's own perception of this reality was evolving, but I'd rather use Occam's Razor and say that they signal a sloppily-constructed hoax by Castaneda. Unfortunately, even a sloppy hoax is enough to fool lots of people and make lots of money.If you are thinking about buying this book, please do yourself a favor and read Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World\\" instead. After that, reconsider."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perspective from a decade reading about dreaming.","review":"The necessary collision of Castenada's anthropological perspective with a new description of reality. Even the description of the enemies of a \\"man of knowledge\\" is worth the price of this book.

Like many others, I was duped. These books still have some genuine interest and redeeming worth, but not as nonfiction, and it is definitely a disservice to present them as such. Maybe we need to include these books in a special subcategory: \\"Nonfiction, bull****ting\\" . . . or some such. Really, these are best enjoyed as works of fantasy. I could give a higher rating if the author had been more honest in his presentation, but as they were presented to us they are potentially harmful to gullible readers.

The author subjects himself to an experience with drugs, vomits, does not wake up for several days, and then continues to subject himself to this...repeatedly.If anybody wishes to know what it is like to experience various narcotic trips after a white rabbit and is not inclined to read Alice in Wonderland, this is for you.

Xichel has taken a very fragile subject that mirrors most of the world,and put it into a made for tv drama that everyone should see.

First off, there's the misguided cover of \\"Tears on My Pillow,\\" the lazy pop of \\"I'm Over Dreaming (Over You),\\" and the cringeworthy \\"message\\" song \\"Heaven and Earth.\\" Quite frankly, the whole album sounds rushed, as if SAW didn't pay too much attention to the songs and needed to get their product out to earn a quick buck.

I own four of their five albums, so far, and know I'll complete the set. This is odd, as I don't like Americana and about the only things I have in my collection that are even close to this are people like Bruce Cockburn, Mark Heard and a few others. In a musical style that is far too often so generic and bland (in my opinion), Bob & Wendy are at the front of the pack in terms of creating music that is arresting and so fraught with imagery and feeling that I just keep adding more of it to my collection.

This album is a well-crafted and intense collection of original folk music from the king and queen of folk on California's central coast. Guitars, mandolins, great harmonies, cellos and mandocellos. This album has it all. Wendy's lyrics are so thought-provoking it makes you wish you had written them. Great CD. Get it or you will be missing out.

Her book is comparable to Anne de Courcy's biography of Diana but has a number of additional details. Her portrayal of Diana as an intellectual who is also a bon vivant is quite accurate. She also somewhat emulates Diana in her own role as an author who offers a bit of sarcasm.

This was the second book I read of his after \\"The Immense Journey\\" and it was no let down at all! It too is haunting, beautiful, disturbing, hopeful, fearful, and immensely imaginative.Here's a taste, from the chapter The Places Below: \\"If you cannot bear the silence and the darkness, do not go there; if you dislike black night and yawning chasms, never make them your profession. If you fear the sound of water hurrying through crevices toward unknown and mysterious destinations, do not consider it. Seek out the sunshine. It is a simpler prescription. Avoid the darkness.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"First-hand adventures","review":"The Night Country describes the setting of many of Eiseley's stories in this book. His encounters with nature occur when most of the world is asleep. For him, this time is ripe for thinking, reading, or exploring. The mostly first-hand adventures describe his interaction with animals (spiders, cattle, birds) and with recovered bones. With the first he demonstrates to the reader his affinity with wildlife -- sensing what they might do and achieving camaraderie with them. With the second he fulfills his nickname -- being known as 'the little bone hunter'. He quested to discover evidence that linked humans to their prehistoric ancestors. These entertaining essays about nature reiterate his philosophy that the future of humanity for good or ill lies in their intelligent actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to this in candle light!","review":"This recording features some very thoughtful music by Demantius.

The song Cry is a very pretty song, it showcases Faith's voice perfectly. The song Shadow is a sad love song. The way Faith sings the song makes it so believeable. Shadow should have been on the c.d.

We felt ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"The difference between a live show and the cd:","review":"...Is nothing. Their Seattle show was really dull, the cd, which I bought on the way out after meeting the band, was worse.

So I spent about $50 between tickets and souvenirs that night, and even though its not possible now, I was sort of wishing for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"More Cowbell!\\"","review":"I can't help but picture the Saturday Night Live sketch with Christopher Walken in the studio with Blue Oyster Cult, pushing them for a slick commercial big- hit production for a major label, demanding \\"MORE COWBELL!!\\" Jim Scott has produced some big almost-extinct dinosaurs back in the day, but that was in the last century, so the guy must be in a bit of a time warp here, looking for something to revive his career. This band doesn't quite seem to be able to pull it off regardless, and why would they even want to? This is that album, only Walken is played by Jim Scott, and Blue Oyster Cult is played by whoever these guys are. I only checked it out because I kept getting these big flashy Atlantic email ads, but I should have realized I might not be taking the best chance when they were next to the ad that said \\"Read Mudvayne's Tour Journal, click here!\\" I'm bein' serious. Anyway- more cowbell! Doesn't that fix everything?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've heard this one before","review":"They have pulled together a few decent songs, but 70% of the album is way too sappy for me. Final verdict: the music in itself needs a lot more punch to get anything more than 2 stars from me, and it'll be impossible to shake their connections and the similarities they are going to face. Note: I did not risk a purchase, I burned it and listened to it on the way back to school. I threw it out my window. Not to be dramatic, or because it's that bad, just disappointed and knew I would not be listening to it often.

They play the same uninspired music, and this review could be duplicated for any of their debut full-lengths. Go pick up this cd!! It will be the next best thing to taking that $20 and setting it on fire and throwing it out the window!!!!This has to be the most uninspired album that I've had the misfortune of listening to in a LONG while.

It just keeps going and going and going. Does an Energizer Bunny proud. It's like a broken record, only after a while when it has nothing new to say, you sort of just tune it out. It also sounds like it lacks sincerity, it sort of sounds like it's trying to follow a formula, and as a result it's really predictable from one line to the next, so it comes off sounding a little shallow in quality.Once it was out of my cd player, i found it difficult to ever want to play it again at any point, because it's just long, you find you're just waiting for it to end after a while. It's sorta forgettable, like one of those cds you see a year from now in the cut-out bin at the record shop, and you see cover and vaguely remember it.

There's no excessive melodramatics that you would hear in emo or screaming to try and make yourself seem hardcore, it's just great songs. Drive Away has some of the best hooks I've heard in awhile, The greatest wonder reminds me of U2 (in a good way), and Someone to Love knocks me out every time and the ending hook is priceless.

Worst of all, the discussion had nothing to do with the custom he had started off with. He has nothing good to say about any of the towns and cities and, most of all, absolutely nothing good say about Sicily.

Much of the book revolves around organic evolution and the evolution of a sentient mind. And how complexity analysis might aid in the understanding of these fields. Not the least in devising deeper forms of artificial intelligence.So intriguing techniques like cellular automata and neural networks are studied. There is a fair amount of speculation as to how these and other topics might ultimately relate to sentience or consciousness. But the musings are grounded in solid science.

I have, by now, a very good idea of what preceded Slam and Major I finally found on \\"Shut Yo' Mouth\\" at the very same time as the Complete Colombia Master Takes album.

That last statement is also true of the title track and \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart.\\"And this album also contains one of Neil Young's best extended rockers to balance out all of the mellow songs that dominate this cd (Southern Man).There is also a cover of \\"Oh, Lonesome Me\\" and a tender \\"I Believe in You.\\" The tempp picks up with \\"When You Dance You can Really Love,: and the cd concludes with a song reminiscent of the Band (Cripple Creek Ferry).This is a short, but sweet Neil Young cd.

Who is able to combine folk music with crunching guitar rock better than Neil Young? Still going after more than four decades his best days are behind him but he was able to remain relevant longer than most of his contemporaries. \\"After the Gold Rush\\" was recorded in 1970 after his work on CSN&Y's \\"Déjà vu\\" and before the seminal \\"Harvest\\" which made him a bona-fide star. The title track, \\"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\\" and \\"When You Dance...\\" were the hits while \\"Tell Me Why\\" and \\"Southern Man\\" (the song that Lynyrd Skynyrd fans love to hate) also got a lot of play. The period (1969 to 1972) represents Young's peak of creativity and this record captures Young right there. I only wish that \\"Till the Morning Comes\\" was a complete song instead of a 1:28 chorus. But, the record as a whole is wonderful and deserves a place on any Top 100 album lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a genius!!!","review":"In my opinion the best album ever produced by this genius.Neil Young can make you cry and laugh, it makes you wanna sing along all night and through the day, heavenly songs, beautiful lyrics...and one of the most important artist of our era.Songs like Tell me why, after the gold rush, southern man and I believe in you, among others, can take you away to a place where your heart doesn't belong you, but to the joy of being part of something bigger, better and more illumineted, where artists like Neil Young do their magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"With the possible exception of Harvest, this is probably Neil Young's finest album. Neil's vocals are strong and sweet, perhaps his best vocal work ever. The song writing is very strong with Southern Man as the centerpiece of this album. Only Love Can Break Your Heart is the prettiest thing Neil has ever written. His vocals on it are as high and penetrating as I have ever heard him. I can't say enough good things about this effort.

Finally, you can no longer lock yourself to an individual player. You can not even lock the goalie to compuer control. This constant switching of players can be very disorienting. I was terribly disappointed to find that all of my favorite features were massively reworked for the worse or gone altogether. I am glad, though, that they used a different naming scheme.

The issue of how ISAPI extensions work is waved off by the author as drudgery.

If you find yourself being stuck on the likes of Brian Eno or Aphex Twin (who are both great respectively), and feel that there are no other ambient artists who compare, let this album be your challenge. Chill Out is absolutely nothing like Cauty and Drummond's club-type works. You may be familiar with their hit \\"3 A.M.

The music soundscapes are dated and incohesive. KLF does not stay on target and they're all over the place as if they couldn't decide on the concept for Chill Out, if it was ambient or techno. Poor choice of dialog and audio samples makes it at times irritating, and an excessive amount of country influence used which takes away from the electronic space ambient feel. Some of the sound design is good but for the most part it's uninspiring and plays out as a demo CD.

Mertz has a great prose voice that the reader will really appreciate; she is always relaxed and personal. However, I need to emphasize that this is an informal text. There are much newer histories of Egypt with far more organization and precision. However, for someone who has read a bit about Egyptian history, this is a great way to review the information and appreciate everything that Mertz adds to the conversation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated, but still a classic","review":"As a graduate student in Egyptology/Egyptian archaeology, I have a slightly different perspective on this book than some people. As other reviewers have noted, the text is a bit dated, having been written a few decades ago. However, the basic facts are still solid and Mertz writes so well and brings so much of ancient Egyptian history to life that a few inaccuracies can be excused, especially as one hopes that so well-written a text will encourage people to go on to do more research.Mertz also manages to capture and discuss, though not in detail, a bit of what it is like to study Egyptology professionally in a few humorous off-the-cuff remarks in the texts. If memory serves, she compares demotic to a series of frenetic commas. :)In short, this is a book I re-read on occasion, even as a professional, not for any particular research needs, but more to remind myself what my own writing *could* be and, sometimes, to remind myself why I decided to do this for a living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the latest, but maybe the greatest.","review":"I picked this book up in an airport when I was a teenager, and it sparked an interest in Egyptology which has lasted 30 years. Mertz is a graceful writer, deftly mixing scholarship with humor and 'human interest'. The book is not intended for Egyptologists, (Hence 'A Popular History') and bypasses, wisely in my opinion, the wrangling between experts which makes the field so frustrating to the lay reader. Honesty prevails, however; when she is stating a personal opinion, she says so. The result is a fascinating, funny and intelligent look at the ancient culture of which we know so much and understand so little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Loved the movie from the beginning to end.. laughter all the way through even laughed through the weekend as I thought of different segments of the movie..Bess"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Funny Funny","review":"Rare Asian American Comedy.

I'm not even going to bother purchasing Spyhunter 3 where the Rock actually gets out of the car.The bottom line is it's just not that much fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"There is no storyline at all, all you hear is that you're driving a G2742638274 or something Interceptor. The levels are horribly boring, and after the first level it's almost impossible to beat. I gave up because I can't stand doing the same boring level 12 times. This game is worth about $5 at the most. Not worth it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series!","review":"This is book two of the Andy Carpenter series. This is just as good as the first one. Here, the lawyer Carpenter has to defend his PI (and his lover) from a murder charge. Attacking the case with his usual sarcasm and wit, makes this an easy read. With his collection of slightly strange colleagues, Carpenter uncovers a twisting story that would rival anything Ross MacDonald might have written. His ending is excellent, a little on the edge but complete. And I am glad he worked his Tara Foundation into the story line. As a rescuer of five English bulldogs and three mixed mutts over the last thirty years, I enjoy reading about a similar person. Read this author...he is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPECIAL PRICE???","review":"WHAT'S UP WITH THE PRICE OF THIS BOOK?? DID ANYONE NOTICE WHAT WAS ON THE COVER?SPECIAL PRICE...$4.99.

The author seems to have quite a sense of humor and it leeches into his main character. I love the wise-ass jokes that take you by surprise as you're reading the fast-paced, intriguing story. More than once I had to put my Kindle down and just laugh before I could read on. The witty repartee doesn't detract from the story at all, but rather adds to it as you find yourself relating to the protagonist. Based on this book, David Rosenfelt is now one of my favorite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Second Book Let Down.....","review":"After greatly enjoying the first installment of the Andy Carpenter series, \\"Open and Shut\\" I was so hopeful that the next in the series would be just as solid entertainment.

Characterization is Rosenfelt's gift, if you like regular guy humor and an eccentric cast of supporting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this author!","review":"I have added David Rosenfelt to my list of favorite authors.

Rosenfelt's book, First Degree, blew me away. I loved it.

While he writes well in his magazine, the book left a lot to be desired. There was not enough detail in this book to really get into Chyna's entertaining biography. In Warrior Queen, Edelman relies on old interviews, magazine articles, and video tapes for the subject matter. There hardly was any dialogue which made the book quite choppy at points. The writing style was extremely basic and rather boring, but fairly easy to read. Unfortunately, the brief trivia section at the end of the book was the best part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book. An OK intro to the first lady of wrestling","review":"Remembering it is a slim paperback that will fit into your pocket, the best part of the book was the early years, and maybe some of the photos.

Now that I have an adopted child, this book is very important since it addresses the issues of foster care and adoption. The book is old, but Kate's search for love and acceptance is as current as today. It is a loving, wonderful book of hope. Every child should read this book.

However, it presented the Egyptian gods (or netjer, as the author refers to them) from a fresh, new perspective hitherto unseen in most texts pertaining to them (including most Wiccan \\"Egyptian\\" books). After so many years of poorly-researched books and manuals that used Budge or 70's romance novels as their references on the subject, it's good to see someone out there worth her salt putting effort into the matter (and amusing to see how many people imitate her pronunciations and use her definitions without giving her any credit whatsoever).

The controversy about models challenges us to continue striving toward a better understanding of our intellectual development.

Its not the greatest for concealment, but it works well for what you pay for it. The release system is intuitive, and the whole SERPA line is versatile. I already have other components for the SERPA system, so I can swap the basic holster from a concealment belt rig, to a paddle, to a tactical thigh rig. There are those that don't like the SERPA holsters for various reasons, but I've never had an issue with mine, and it was used very hard during a year deployment."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"easily adjustable, many mounting positions. comfortable to wear in various positions. very good positive lock, that is also easy to disingauge when needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I use this holster with my glock 19.

Can be integrated with a blackhawk tactical leg harness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable Holster","review":"Although there have been some concern about the design of these holsters, I believe they are quite safe.

If you have good and practiced gun skills, this holster is an excellent tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great holster for the XD-M","review":"This is my third Serpa and I love it. Great design and quality. Big bang for your buck (so to speak) with both the belt attachment and a paddle. I bought this after searching high and low for a retention holster for my Springfield XD-M 5.25 9mm. This works perfectly. The muzzle protrudes through the end of the holster but there is zero chance of the sight snagging, which was a big concern. I know there has been talk of this somehow being an \\"unsafe design\\" because of your trigger finger placement. My two cents: I've been a police officer for 12 years, shoot competitively and think that estimation of this holster is nonsense. Your finger should index the slide when you draw, period. This design puts your trigger finger where it SHOULD be. If you can't draw safely without discharging your firearm yu have no business owning one. Don't blame the holster for something you did! Great product, highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with holster","review":"Great idea, poor execution. At least that's been my experience. I used the paddle option for a CC @ belt line. Within 15 minutes it was broken. Not broken in, like when you practice the draw with an empty magazine, just broken. As in retaining pin fell out, spring went somewhere downrange, and pressing the trigger release button gets you nothing.The quick fix is to super-glue the pin back in AFTER you have ground off the retaining nub that sticks into the trigger well. Sound like a good experience to you? It works, but only as a LEVEL 1 (no retention). I'll see if I can get another, but I'm not sure why I'd want one. Take your time researching this holster, and all BLACKHAWK SERPA system products. Some ranges won't let you use BH SERPA holsters. Too many self inflicted wounds.

Do your homework!","review":"There are serious issues with these holsters. If debris gets into the retention mechanism the holster becomes inoperable. There are also numerous accidental and negligent discharge incidents that have resulted in self inflicted gunshot wounds. Be aware that many ranges, agencies and trainers now ban the Serpa from their ranges, and or programs. Almost all of these incidents occur using the belt and paddle mounted system (except the debris issue).I would highly recommend buying a Safariland ALS or SLS system if you require or desire an OWB retention holster. Safariland has been on the cutting edge of retention holsters for decades and is the preferred choice of most elite LE and military units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken holster from Black Hawk trouble getting replacement","review":"I recenetly purchased a holster from this site for one of the firearms i have to use for my work duties.

I called to see about returning the holster for one that was functional. This is where my problems began. I have gone back and forth trying to get a working holster and to date i still do not have a functional holster. I was mailed back the broken holster because i did not send the box back with it.

Build quality is good, the design is great, and it is fairly easy to switch between the paddle and the belt attachments for the holster. However my M9A1 - a member of the 92 family - wouldn't fit in this holster because the M9A1 has a rail under the barrel. Although it is advertised as a holster for the Beretta 92/96, it will not fit one with an accessory rail. That detail was left out of the product description.

So I was skeptical when it said fits 1911 Government Model and Clones, considering variations can screw things up. This holster lives up to what it promised, and I love it. The best feature is that the release for your weapon relies on the finger, and by design, will place your finger on the frame and out of the trigger guard, ensuring you won't shoot yourself or discharge when you aren't ready. It helps to remove error, teaches the shooter the proper draw, and works extremely well at doing it's job: carrying your firearm. I highly recommend this holster to anyone who plans to carry their weapon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great basic holster!","review":"Love this holster! Simple design, easy to use!

If you are about to do the same... don't! This is simply an audio book with the Beatles' history in about an hour. It is nice and probably very good for someone just getting to know them, but for the true fans there will be no revelations since all the material has been covered before. And there is also no music by the Beatles whatsoever, though there are a few audio clips of interviews with them (which you have already heard). There is a single Beatle-like backtrack that repeats throughout the reading, but that is as much music as you will get out of this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful - read only if you are addicted","review":"Dorothy L. Sayers has her points but she is neither a great writer nor a great crime novelist. This is, in my view, the worst of her Lord Peter Wimsey books. Nearly 400 pages in my edition - yet the mystery could have been set out and solved in a 20-page short story, which is what Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle would have done. Most of this book is about the relationship between Peter and Harriet, and I find this tedious at best - it often verges on the emetic. The unchallenged snobbery that runs through all the Wimsey novels is at its worst here. If I hadn't set myself the task of re-reading the whole series I would have put this one down after the first few pages.If you must read a Sayers novel, go for Murder Must Advertise or The Documents in the Case instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"For Dorothy Sayers fans who have been following the Lord Peter series, this story gives us a sigh of relief. Finally after a long and difficult courtship, Peter and Harriet are married! Nothing is ever simple for this couple, not even a honeymoon. The characters are entirely believable, and we get caught up in all the joys and trials of the first days of marriage tangled with a murder investigation. At the end, we're left wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Story With Detective Interruptions","review":"Summer 2004 Reading List - Mini ReviewI was intrigued by the premise of this book: An accomplished detective and a famous mystery writer marry, only to discover a corpse in the cellar of their recently purchased home the day after their wedding.This book is subtitled \\"A Love Story With Detective Interruptions\\" and lives up to that billing. I had not read any of the previous books in the Lord Peter Wimsey series but I did not find this an impediment. Sayers did a good job of making Busman's Honeymoon accesible as either a stand alone novel or part of her Wimsey/Vane story line. I so liked the characters that I am going to try to read previous installments in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, thoughtfully and intellegently written mystery","review":"This is a very well writted mystery with the usual \\"who do it\\" aspect and in addition to a in depth character study of two very different people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your time.","review":"This entry in the Lord Peter Whimsey/Harriet Vane series is a little unusual because it has more humor than usual. You get to see a more light hearted Lord Peter, at least until the murder. Agatha Christi concentrates a little more on the relations between Lord Peter and Harriet, starting just after thier engagement and continuing through the honeymoon. You will have to sit through a lot of letter and journal reading in the beginning, but it is worth wading through for the background. A delightful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb mystery- great love story","review":"This is one of Sayer's best mysteries in my opinion. She leads you to so many red herrings you think you are at a fishmonger's and the solution is truly believable. I loved the tender love story but I think that it wouldn't mean as much uif you had not been following the courtship through earlier books. I love the setting of Talboys which Patton uses again in one of her collaboritive stories. I had read all of Sayer's books back in the 80s and now I am re-reading them to my delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"This was the second copy of Busman's Honeymoon that I bought. I wore out the first copy!!!Recommend to mystery fans, but it's a good idea to read the three previous Peter Wimsey/Harriet Vane novels first for context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Busman's Honeymoon","review":"At last Harriet Vane has succumbed to Peter Whimsey's persistent pursuit! Now the reader watches so see if Harriet can still maintain her sense of self and at the same time deal with the upper class life which she has married into.This novel was originally a play and although perhaps Sayer's very best novel was Gaudy Night, there is obviously a very real sense that Sayers is now aware of her reader as an audience. The philosophical introspection of Gaudy Night has been replaced by a much lighter tone. Peter Whimsey is now fighting his personal demons (shell shock and horror of bringing criminals to their death) with a much more aware Harriet who seems to be able to support him without submerging herself.Interesting social perspective on the dynamics of marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad it wasn't made into a movie","review":"This would have been a great addition to the Dorothy Sayers series shown on PBS.

Like with most 70's martial arts movies, either you love'em or you hate'em. I loved this movie right off the bat, the dubbing was classic, great costumes, a white-haired villain, and it also stars Lo Lieh portraying the \\"warrior sage\\" role. Unlike most Kung Fu flicks, there are a couple of beautiful Asian ladies who help led the fight against odds. Except for a few twists that don't seem to make sense, but that just adds to the nostalgia of the genre, it's a cult classic.

The graphics are somewhat similar, and you have the option to play missions or free roaming sandbox play. However, unlike GTA, this game doesn't have any vehicles that you can ride in. Also, NARC seems to take place only at night (there is no change in day time or weather conditions).What seperates this game from GTA (other then playing as the good guy) is the drug aspect. Just about every popular street drug is in this game, and if you choose to be a bad cop you can take them (and see the effects). Also, the fighting engine in this game is much better then GTA. You can grapple, throw, hancuff, tackle, ect (and there is a super arrest move meter).

Her novel of postwar Detroit (really of postwar America), Them, is her best. Nothing she has written, before or since (even including her newest, the fictionalized biography of Marilyn Monroe) brings the reader the emotional power, or the superb prose of Oates' immortal classic. Readers who read Them when it was first published years ago deserve to study the new Modern Library edition. Readers unfamiliar with the best of Oates should run, not walk, to their bookstores or their personal computers and order this classic. It is as simple as that. Them is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing, yet enthralling","review":"In this novel the characters seemed to be desperately trying to escape from each other, but unable to escape the past they share together. Joyce Carol Oates descriptions of the characters lives are vivid and oftentimes disgusting. The characters rarely seem to be able to make the right choices and are often victims of circumstance. Still, I was constantly intrigued during the novel. This novel is an excellent view of the sixties. Another wonderful novel by Oates is \\"Because It Is Bitter and Because It Is My Heart,\\" whih is set in approximately the same time period. \\"Because it is Bitter...\\" adds the aspect of race relations and has a more solid ending than \\"Them.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong effort","review":"Continuing the same kind of slightly raucous new wave pop-rock of 'Whomp that Sucker', this is a collection of mostly very good songs which have lasting appeal.

The story was poor, but the writing was abysmal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery at sea","review":"\\"Bear Island\\" is a mystery novel set on a boat heding for the remote Bear Island (Bjrnya) in the Barents Sea. The ship is carrying a film crew and actors who plan to make a movie on the island. The novel is narrated in first person by the ship's doctor. A number of people die from apparent food poisoning, but Dr. Marlow suspects murder.The story tends to drag a bit before they get to the island, but not too much. Once they get to the island, MacLean throws in a nice plot twist and the pace picks up. This, and the humorous narrative helps it earn 4 stars. I also like MacLean's description of Bear Island. Even though I hate when it's cold, it almost made me want to go there."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little something else from the Skinny Puppy crew","review":"Damn Canadians!

Id like to respond to the previous bad review. A ton of baby products are considered safe that could be potentially dangerous. Thats why adult supervision and common sense should be used. It is not safe to leave a 4 month old with ANY blanket unless you have your eye on them. Thats common sense. I mean look at the Bumbo that was recalled because of parents putting them on top of high objects and the kids diving off. The Bumbo, just like Taggies blanket is safe when used correctly.

It is much easier finding a sneaker that can go with those earth tone colored clothes, white sneakers aren't bad, but I am glad that a sneaker came out that suits my needs.

The haikus are related to the name of each section and flow with the imagery. This is an excellent book to relax with after dinner or during lunch. I find the haikus calming to the mind. Great job!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one delivers, a really good episode!","review":"First off, great title. \\"The Hundred Days of the Dragon\\" is not only catchy, but correct to the episode. The funny thing is, \\"100 Days..\\" is more in style with the second season outings. Limited budget, no special effects (other than the props) and a more earthly threat. Yet the music is top notch and the use of light and shadows, particulary in the lab shown early in the episode is stellar. Good performances all around help make this one a keeper.Not to be picky, but this is also the first episode of the Outer Limits tradition of NOT GUARDING ANYONE that's so critical to the bad guys plan. It's rather hard to believe that a presidential candidate or the vice president would have no guards around. But still, that is a minor nit that does crop up in several episodes.Worthy of your collection, \\"The Hundred Days of the Dragon\\" lives up to it's title and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT ALBUM","review":"From the first few measures of the album: \\"I've got a snapshot of your Aunt Maureen, she's 90 and you're a teen, I'm trying to cheer you up, don't be so mean!

He made me a casette of selected songs, but for some reason, it didn't impress me at the time. But now, I find this album irresistible. My favorite songs are probably TIPS FOR TEENS, THE WILLIES ( a brilliant idea for a song ) and WACKY WOMEN, but there really isn't a bad song on the album.

It is a collection of DanceHall music, and lyrics which poke fun at puritanical ...... attitudes. It is captivating and entertaining to me because the lyrics are so sardonic, nearly jaded, yet more than anything else, cheeky. The music is also jocular. I especially like the campy, samples of the James Bond theme. SEX ON WHEELZ is the deserved hit, and everything seems to come together but all the songs are great. LEATHERSEX is an effective use of a diva over dance beats, and the bonus track of this song replaces the diva with a swell duet. If you are interested in one of the most controversial albums from (MY LIFE WITH) THRILL KILL KULT, or if you enjoy fun, infectious dance grooves, this CD will interest you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for beginners!","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer this book is not for beginners.

I would cite specific examples of the book if it didnt mean I would ruin it for others who wished to waste their precious time reading it.....The British lingo is often cute in these books, but this was outright ridiculous! Way over the top--If I hear the words snogging, shagging or of someone smoking another (...)any time soon, I might snap. With all the great books out there, PLEASE find a new one-- Let your Bridget Jones memory be a good one-- Remember the disappointing feeling you had after seeing the movie?? It didnt quite spoil the book--but this book will make you hate ever reading the first. (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing up to a point...","review":"Reading the first \\"Bridget Jones\\" book, I became increasingly annoyed with its heroine. I was hoping in the sequel that she would get a bit brains. Well, I was disappointed! While there are some laugh out loud moments in this book, I got fed up with Bridget's appalling stupidity and vapid self-absorption. The only reason I can think that a supposedly intelligent man like Mark Darcy would be interested in her is that it stokes his ego to be able to rescue her from her ineptitude and to be able to patronize her at will."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sequal just as good as the original","review":"Helen Fielding was one of the original chick lit authors when the genre first started in the 1990s. I have to give her points for originality.

Helen Fielding is giving us a spicy slice of life. I'd like to point out the soul of the whole audio project : Tracie Bennet who plays the part like her life depended on it. Read critics about histerical interpretation... matters of taste and cannot be criticized. What I LOVE in an audiobook is an actor/actress (because it really needs good acting skills) living the story. Makes me want to go and search all Tracie has played and watch/listen to it. At the moment would gladly isolate myself from rest of the world with audioplayer and relisten to both books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and entertaining!!","review":"Bridget Jones is a very memorable and enjoyable character.

It's pretty close to the movie but of course things are a little different and closer to the book version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine continuation of the life and times of Bridget Jones","review":"I just finished this book today and found it thoroughly enjoyable and a page-turner. I lost several nights of sleep, unable to put the book down -- just reading and laughing at Bridget's many antics. In some ways, I found it funnier than the first book and I originally had my doubts. I thought I even detected a hint of Jane Austen's Persuasion in some of the scenes. Helen Fielding's fans will NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Fidelity is for men....","review":"Such a perfect account of the signleton's life, in London or the US. All of her personal issues are real and everyday worries for so many women. And haven't we all been embarassed in front of many, said the wrong thing, sought the wrong guy, and so on. She's just so honest about it. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This sequal was just as wonderful as the first Bridget Jones novel.

I recommend this book to anyone who needs a good laugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Equal Sequel","review":"Better titled The Euthanasia of Bridget Jones, this disappointing sequel abandons the momentum of the first book's happy ending. Instead of enjoying Bridget's and Mark's deserved happiness, which could have incorporated a diverting plot and unforced comedy, we get more of Bridget's insecurities, Mark's stupid faithlessness and a ridiculous, trumped-up story.If I could unread a book , it'd be this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I bought this book because of the editorial reviews, but I was so disappointed with it. The stories are so trivial and boring that it was a struggle to finish reading the whole book.

I would give that book to someone who is willing to pay postage."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"I loved the first book. I could identify with Bridget, I could sympathize. The second book takes a very odd turn. Bridget get what she wants and we only see Mark in the very beginning and end of the book. Then she goes to Thailand where not even strange but stupid things happen. This part of the book is copied from the movie Broke Down Palace. I found myself skipping to the parts with Mark. That was what I wanted to read, their romance. And Daniel Cleaver comes out of no where and seems like just filler. Bad book. Don't waste time on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget Is Back For More","review":"Bridget is back and she hasn't changed a bit, she is as hilarious as ever!

It's just the same old same old. Perhaps the problem is that I'm past all the \\"will he call\\" ridiculous dating stuff and Bridget is not. I wish she'd grow up a little. I'm still reading this book (though I considered stopping) to find out what happens in the end, though I already know, but still I keep reading--but I find myself skimming and skipping pages; sometimes Bridget will just go on and on and I don't want to hear it. I think this book could have been shorter and Bridget could have used some actual character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative and predictable -- sad, really.","review":"After having thoroughly enjoyed the first Bridget Jones book, I was all set to love the second. What a let down. The charm from the first book is completely lacking here. This reads like a strained attempt to get a second book on the market quickly -- hurried and without true feeling. Many of the same situations from the first book are repeated here, and they just seem ridiculous the second time around. Many of the British words and phrases which gave the original Bridget Jones its personality have been done away with. No more \\"stones,\\" now Bridget is weighing herself in pounds. We already know that Helen Fielding has talent to spare . . . hopefully she will choose to USE it in her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first (if possible)","review":"For some reason, I liked this second BJ than the first.

Fielding once again manages to capture the ups and downs of Bridget with humor and care, making the reader feel like Bridget could be the girl next door."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you liked the first one. . .","review":"All you really need to know is that this is a satisfying sequel. You've probably read the first one and are just worried that the second may be monotonous and redundant. Well, it's a little redudant, but in a thoroughly enjoyable way. Who doesn't want to watch Bridget fumble through a relationship in much the same way she fumbled through being single?Liked the first one, you'll like the second one. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel That Is Better Than The Orginal","review":"I truely adored this book. I liked it so much that I read it in just one day. I thought the sequel was better than the first simply because I thought this one was funnier. The only problem I had with it though was the whole trip to Thailand. The part was just silly. The book would have been 10,000 times funnier without it, but I digress. Do your self a favor a check out this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarously Funny! Better than the first Bridget Jones novel","review":"This was a quick, hilarious read. I was laughing so hard I starting snorting! No novel in recent memory has made me laugh so much. The first half of the book is non-stop laughter and Bridget's relationship woes throughout the book are a comic delight. The book becomes a wonderful comedy of errors and misunderstandings that could happen to anyone of us. I will say I was disgusted with the Jed subplot. The Thailand holiday mishap was not only unrealistic, but it brought back memories of a recent movie with the same plot. However, this book is so hilarious it hardly registers.Kudos to Helen Fielding on writing one of the funniest novels in recent years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the sequel","review":"As a fan of the first novel, I was anxious to read Fielding's sequel to Bridget Jones's Diary. I found her follow up very disappointing. While there were a few funny moments that almost every woman could relate to, this installment of her diary was filled with the most insane events. The strength and appeal of the first book was that it Bridget's life seemed to mirror the lives of so many women. However, this book makes one believe that Fielding was desperate for something to give Bridget to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Feel Good \\"Light\\" Reading","review":"I was thrilled with this sequel. I love the style in which Fielding writes; it gives the reader a real since of what life is actually like through Bridget's eyes and leaves out all of the \\"fancy fluff\\" that can be tedious. Once I began reading this book I could not put it down until 4 hours later when I realized it was 3am! It is so much fun to read and the ending leaves you feeling all warm and happy. We have all been in \\"Bridget Situations\\" and I'm sure we can all totally relate to her daily life. It is wondefully witty and, in Bridget's drunken terms \\"blurdy hurd terput down!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first!","review":"I was just looking for an easy vacation read, and wound up getting a new obsession! I just loved this book, thought it was better than the first and was v. proud of our heroine and her humanity. Brillant writing, hilarious, funny, sad and so, so true.I have reread the end dozens of times,and wound up taking the Pride and Prejudice videos out of the library just to sink even more into Bridge's world! Can't wait for the movie or another sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CASHING IN?","review":"I adored the first Bridget Jones novel, so naturally was very eager to get my hands on this latest one. What a disappointment! Bridget is just silly in this one. I found myself not really caring what happened to her. And let's face it, in this sort of book, it's not like there won't be a happy ending. The whole way through, I couldn't shake the feeling that Helen Fielding was only in it for the money in this instance. Not the worst book I've ever read, but disappointing given the pleasure I derived from the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reader","review":"I thought the first book was a little more realistic and you can relate with the characters, well maybe except for Bridget's Mom (A very annoying character). With the second book there were some parts that were laugh out loud but I find myself getting irritated with the characters more often than not. Bridget just became this dumb girl who didn't have any common sense, not knowing what is right and what is wrong; and the part when Bridget and Mark broke up, I didn't feel like there was any valide reason behind it. I'm pretty dissapointed with this book, I had high expectations after reading the first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry but I can't relate to the sequel Bridget.","review":"Like most of the reviewers, I enjoyed the first Briget Jones's Diary because her insecurities and fumbling we all have been through at one point in our lives. I was really looking forward to the second one but I found this Bridget just awfully stupid! My god, how many times can a person shoot herself in the foot? The interview part with Colin I couldn't even finish because you knew she was going to screw it up. Why must Fielding make Bridget perpetually incompetent? After a while you could telegraph the plot because you knew Bridget was going to make a dumb move. I hate to say it, but she is an borderline idiot with friends who undermine her relationships and self-confidence.I couldn't relate to Bridget in this round, and I yearn for the day when more women writers will make a more complex heroine, whose goal in life is not just about reducing flabby thighs and catching a man before her eggs dry out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What fun! Can't wait for the next Bridget Jones book","review":"I finished this book last night and miss it already. I liked it better than the original, and that's quite a compliment considering how much I enjoyed that one. Mark and Bridget make a great couple....I can't wait to find out what happens next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Characters and Depressing Storyline","review":"What I loved about the first one was that it was simple and \\"real.\\" The situations were hilarious and the hilarity was subtle and exquisite. The first book was also very chipper - even though she had some bad times, you knew she would be \\"ok\\" at the end.This one began slowly and got more and more depressing as it continued. I was very disapointed in the portrayal of Mark Darcy who is \\"meek\\" and \\"didn't know he was being hit on\\" etc. He plays the \\"poor man who was seduced by a woman and had no choice in the matter\\" inanely.Bridget is a strong char - and to make a weak mate for her is as unreal as her getting arrested in Thailand- *ugh*."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number of times couldn't put book down (countless)!","review":"I have waited soooooo long for this book. Thank goodness Helen Fielding has done it again! The first Bridget Jones was fab and this one comes in a very close second. Although there are times you wish you could hit fast forward, there is so much going on with each chapter, you feel that if you do, you will surely miss something hysterical. I must say....the final chapters are by far the most superior. I laughed out loud on numerous occasions and even stooped so low as to take my book to work so I could finish! Hurrah for Bridge! She's someone we've all been at some point in our lives(or currently are)to one extent or the other. It definitely is a feel good book. I passed the first one around to so many friends that I'll have to come up with a waiting list for the second. Keep them coming Helen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"After reading and loving the first book, there was much excitment to read Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. However, it was a big dissapointment. It is not funny, or even entertaining. I give it 2 stars only for the last pages, of Bridget's christmas cards (which were hillarious). However, I don't think the joke is worth a whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lousy love story","review":"Helen Fielding did a good job when she wrote \\"the diary\\" but she shouldn't have written The Edge of Reason. Chasing a man and being jealous of other women is a lame plot and the book adds nothing to the first one. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second verse, same as the first","review":"I read to page 10 and thought I could care less about this story...a young woman who thinks a six-week relationship that involves sex is a form of commitment...where has she been? She may need a copy of The Rules, a health exam to be sure she hasn't a dread disease, and some help getting some confidence in her own life. This is no longer funny, but rather pitiful. The first book seemed funy, but she learns nothing and is obviously doomed to repeat her life in daily notations that add up to little or nothing. ..................."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inner Poise","review":"I didn't think that it would be possible for this book to outshine the original Bridget Jones novel, but it has. Fielding has mastered the art of making women everywhere realize that they can not only relate to Bridget, but they are Bridget. We all think that we could be better if only we could quit smoking, stop being a singleton, and of course, develop inner poise. In this novel, Bridget sheds her singleton image for Mark Darcy, a conservative yet wonderful man. Through their ups and downs, One will pray that the couple prevails. This novel is brilliant and hysterical. It will leave the reader with one ultimate question...\\"When is the next Bridget Jones novel coming out?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great.","review":"Okay, so I wrote a review for BJD the first one and loved it. I was however, a little disapointed with this one. Is it possible Fielding has Americanized her once lovely heroine? It's a horrible fate for BJ, but life will go on. I'm dying for another installment, as I live my life through BJ. 8st 12, cigarettes 200(understandable) Number of times thought about killing Rebecca:100 000! (v.g)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequels are Never Better","review":"I loved the Diary of Bridget Jones, so I was looking forward to the sequel. I was not disappointed in the least, but if you're looking for the greatness of the first book you won't find it here. Bridget continues her neurotic behavior of counting calories, cigarettes, phone calls, and alcoholic drinks (which is the funniest thing EVER) and she tries to carry on a relationship with Mark. It brings back all of the characters and will definitely bring a smile to your face. A good follow-up, but can't top the original...in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the inimitable Diary, but it has Bridget","review":"If you have not read Bridget Jones' Diary first, go do so before reading The Edge of Reason. Okay, done that? Now of course you want more, but how can anything rival the Diary? It can't. But if you want to spend more time with Bridget, at least this book affords that. Whereas Bridget was a tapestry of neatly woven plot lines with echoes of Jane Austen, The Edge of Reason is like several story lines running parallel down a track, some falling down short, others overshooting the finish line, not one mixing too well with another. The timing's off. But The Edge of Reason has its laughs and it has Bridget, who in the worst moments, like in a Thai jail, always pops up a survivor. For those who don't know: the real Colin Firth is set to play Mark Darcy in the film based on Diary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurrah! V. Good","review":"no.of times laughed out loud 1(but continuous so maybe countsas much more?), no. of times told others to read this 12 (same asnumber in book club), no. of people I would like to tell-all( but to busy reading) no. of times glad Helen Fielding wrote this sequel-too many to count(hurrah! v.good) Bridget is back, and gets in even more predicaments than ever! Can Mark Darcy help? Will he be around in the end? Who was the young boy in the bed, or at the bar? Will her mother find out what is really being potted in the shed? Will someone round up all the Rebeccas of the world and ship them to Thailand? This is another fun book from Helen Fielding. v. good, v. ridiculous, and v.v. enjoyable! END"},{"rating":"2","title":"V Good Book.....Hurrah for Bridge.","review":"I have been waiting for this sequel with bated breath. And, it didn't disappoint. I read it in one evening and was so sad when I was all done. Her charm and personality are such a breath of fresh are. Her \\"singleton\\" ways are funny, adventurous and make you dream for the days when you could live a life like hers. And, in many ways...she's just like all single gals out there. You root and pray for her....you're even tempted to skip to the end and see if she and her \\"Mr. Darcy\\" make it a happily ever after ending. this book doesn't let you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was Persuaded","review":"Wasn't sure if I would like this installment as much as the first but I can't deny that I laughed out loud just as much this time. My favorite moment, though, was when I realized that Fielding was doing a gloss on another of my favorite Austen books, Persuasion. Actually I had just watched the wonderful film version on TV the night before I started the book and couldn't miss the parallels (of course if I had paid attention to the reviews I might have realized sooner and picked up the book before it became paperback). Anyway, a truly diverting read. Am looking forward to Helen Fielding's next hilarious book. And of course there's always the much-anticipated movie of Bridget Jones where we can watch poor Bridget embarrass herself over Mark Darcy all over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my vote is yes - a resounding yes","review":"once again, ms. fielding has created a massively compelling and highly amusing tale of a certain class of mid-young womanhood in the millenium. I challenge even the naysayers to get through without laughing out loud. HOWEVER, this is a book for people who are able and willing to laugh at the foibles of love and dating; those who are not afraid to acknowledge certain values that the culture dishes out, and turn it delightfully on its head. she is a consommate storyteller and her ear for humor never falters. I very much doubt whether she would have rocketed to stardom had her gifts been less than noteworthy. I for one look forward to her next effort with enthusiasm......."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite follow up success!","review":"Helen Fielding has struck again! And this one is even better than the first one...the reader will find the same funny situations, same problems Bridget faces in her daily struggle as a woman. The book is enjoyable, fun to read, amazingly unpretentious and joyful for a good afternoon of reading. This is the kind of book you want to read when things aren't so great around you: with Helen Fielding's book under your arm, the worst can happen and it will still make you laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, Sequels Can Be As Good As the Original","review":"After thoroughly enjoying Bridget Jones's Diary, I felt let down. The book had ended too soon and I wanted more story. I wanted to know what happened between Bridget and Mark, Colin and Pam, Jude and Vile Richard. I was not let down for long though because I soon discovered this book and I was able to have all my questions answered.I was pleasantly suprised by this delightful sequel and I read it with the same voracity that I had read the original with. This is a warm and delightful book and readers won't feel let down(except I wouldn't mind a third installment.) If you still haven't read the first book, buy it and read it, then move on to this delightful sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridget is pathetic","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" and was really looking forward to the follow up. But here Bridget is truely pathetic and annoying! Get a life!! Don't bother with this book if you loved the first. You will be disappointed!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first","review":"I think it must be the sequel issue--I just didn't like it as much as the first one. Maybe that is more of a compliment to the first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget's Back!","review":"If you loved Bridget Jones' Diary, you'll love this book. Bridget is back, and is crazier than ever. Her character becomes much more developed, as do those of the people around her. The plot gets thicker and thicker and is very unpredictable but one thing you can be sure of is that you'll laugh with the turn of each page.This book doesn't claim to be an amazing feat of literature in the academic sense. It's not always grammatically correct, nor does it pretend to be something it's not. It IS light reading, but entertaining. That's the beauty of both of these books. You open the cover and you are immediately immersed in her world, which is believable, colorful, filled with adventure and fun. She seems so real... it's almost as though you're reading letters from your best girlfriend, and she's filling you in on what's going on in her life.I just can't wait for the next sequel. I'm definitely addicted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was cute","review":"Although I have seen the movie I have not read the first book so I can't really compare the two, only the story.I thought it was a pleasant read, I read it in only three sittings over three days but at points it kinda did drag a little.Some parts in it were a bit absurd but I guess that's the appeal of Bridget Jones!! At times I was really laughing :) so if you do like the movie or the first book you might wanna read this.I didn't find this necessarily better than the first story but I think it could have been a bit better.I just wish there was a third book because the story does leave you hanging... and i hate when that happens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No more ripping off Jane Austen","review":"Pure drivel. First book humorous, but this sequel is just derivitive of BJD and Jane Austen's Persuasion. I now don't even like Bridget. Nor do I get Mark Darcy. They certainly do not belong together. Helen Fielding and publishers were just trying to make money-although not from me, since I took this out of the library. I will not even read another Bridget Jones sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A guilty pleasure","review":"This book is so irritating -- Bridget has been so dumbed down. It's difficult to relate to a heroine who is so stupid and clumsy and \\"can't do anything right.\\" Of course, this is meant to be endearing, ala \\"I Love Lucy\\" -- but it's freakin' annoying. It's still entertaining, and I will read it till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of the same","review":"As much as I loved the first Bridget book, I am having a very hard time maintaining my interest in this sequel, much to my disappointment. I find myself constantly feeling impatient at the lack of change and personal growth in the characters. All of the things they said and did and felt in the first book are identical in the second. I keep wanting to yell at Bridget \\"Stop living in the same old rut -- and try growing up a bit!\\" The writing is frequently humorous, and I've gotten some good laughs, but overall I feel this is a retread of the first book -- a few of the names have changed, but the situations and experiences and dialog are the same ole same ole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Single Story!","review":"The first book of this \\"series\\" was exactly what it was supposed to be--a desperate singles story. However, I expected this one to chronicle Bridget Jones in a relationship. Boy, was I wrong. Single again, she is quickly driven into the same self-help cycles as the first book. Come on, Fielding...just reprint the first one with a couple names crossed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget's at it again!","review":"OK, Love Bridget. Really. I do. I'm always flipping to the back cover to look at Helen Fielding and imagine her to be Bridge. The best fantasy after the ones about sex are ones about the perfect girlfriend. And that's what Helen's given us with Bridget Does Anything. One small mark against Volume II: the end, while fun, funny and still Bridgetinteresting, is somewhat too whacky. Come on, we all like Bridget just fine in her flat, chugging chardonnay, watching Mr. Darcy come out of that damned pond ONCE AGAIN in the soaking wet puffy shirt. We don't really need a stretch in an Indonesian prison . . . But, hey, it's Bridget. And I really don't mean to complain. Buy. Read. You'll love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Bridget Jones' Diary - This ones even BETTER","review":"Just to keep it short and sweet: This book brings us even more hilarious, unexpected twists and funny scenes than the last one. She continues to develop some of the most enjoyable, original characters I've seen in literature in the past few years. The movie comes out today, and I'm not ashamed to say that I am looking forward to seeing these great people come to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M CONFUSED! DID WE ALL READ THE SAME BOOK?","review":"What the hell happend to this one. I couldn't even finish this; I returned it to the library when I was 1/2 way through!Her first novel was pretty good, but not great. The dialogue was getting me crazy! I know the lines are supposed to be quick and funny, BUT THIS WAS NOT FUNNY! Too much for my taste!If you want to read something hilarious try \\"Watermelon\\" by Marian Keyes. That one will make you pee laughing!I SAY \\"ENOUGH OF THE DRY ENGLISH HUMOR.\\" IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY ANYMORE!\\"A NOTE TO THE AUTHOR: \\"PLEASE DO NOT COME OUT WITH A 3RD TO THIS!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, Irreverent Nonsense, Disappointing","review":"A ho-hum sequel. Sure, it's fun. The characters are all back and the laughs still flow, but the plot is thin, the story is ridiculously unbelievable, and so much of this story is plucked right out of some classic novels, including Pride and Prejudice. Overall, this is a rushed sequel, contrived, and far less enjoyable or inspiring than its predecessor. A bubbly, witty, and consistently surprising Bridget Jones gives way to a boring, paranoid, and totally un-funny darker side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to read","review":"I like the story, I like the movie, but the book was impossible to read. It was just too broken up with a lot of slang - maybe if I hadn't seen the movie first I would have enjoyed it, but after a few pages I put the book down, it just wasn't worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more enjoyable than the first","review":"I haven't enjoyed the original 'Bridget Jones', but after reading a lot more 'chick lit' since then, I learned to appreciate Helen Fielding's work, and gave 'The Edge of Reason' a try.Authors sometimes try to replicate their original \\"hit\\" story line again and again (and again)until even their most devout fans are sick and tired of it. Fortunately for us, Helen Fielding hadn't done that. Not only did Bridget grow up - so did most of her co - characters, and the plot takes them to some exotic places, but also to some familiar ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"I read much of this book while working out on the eliptical machine at the gym and it really made me forget where I was and laugh out loud. And believe me, having a laughing outburst at the gym is worse than having one in the library!As sequels go this one cannot be missed. Rest assured, Bridget fans, you can hold it to the same standards as the first one. She's the same Bridget with the same personal crises and picadillos, but there's originality to it as well. This is not just a copy of Bridget Jone's Diary. Bridget evolves, and comically falls into the same ruts now and then.Since the movie isn't out yet this book is definately worth reading before hitting the theatres. Look for the chapter that has caused a dilemma in the film production: Colin Firth makes a cameo appearance as himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good sequel","review":"I'd heard that this book wasn't as good as the original. While of course the format is not new anymore and Bridget's tone is familiar, this was a riot to read.After a few weeks of blissful romance with Mark Darcy, Bridget's world begins to disintegrate, little by little, beginning with the evil Rebecca, who will stop at nothing to pry Mark away from an insecure Bridget, and, most memorably, the \\"Brokedown Palace\\" episode where Bridget finds herself in leg irons in a Thai prison.Of course it all ends well, but for a few moments there, we do suffer along with Bridget and cheer for her at her happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurrah! v. good books (2)","review":"Bridget is back! I fell in love with the first diary, and reading the second was like falling in love all over again! Helen Fielding has done it again. I admit, the Thailand trip was a little bizarre and a bit far-fetched, but amusing just the same. The interview with Colin Firth was hilarious, and I was so glad to see things work out for Bridget and Mark Darcy. Also, the downfall of Rebecca, the \\"jelly fish\\" was great---it is so easy to identify with Fielding's characters. I hope she will bring Bridget and the gang (Jude, Shazzer, Tom, Vile Richard, and of course, Mark) back for at least one more diary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous, sweetie","review":"As a thirtysomething singleton, Bridget has become a good friend! She is once again navagating life with her assortment of pals, both smug and otherwise. Despite the craziness of a few situations-Edge of Reason is for anyone who loved Bridget the first time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plot falters a bit at end, but hilarious & insightful","review":"Once again, Helen Fielding has made me laugh out loud, nod my head appreciatively, and inspired me to read passages out loud to anyone who will listen. \\"Edge of Reason\\" is a worthy successor to Bridget Jones I: hilarious, insightful, entertaining. The plot does lose focus toward the end with the introduction of a melodramatic Thailand twist. This portion of the book is unbelievable and self-conscious - makes you aware that Bridget is merely a character, rather than the very real person she is elsewhere in the book. But this relatively minor flaw was far outweighed by the pure, unadulterated pleasure I took in reading the book. Is this novel the literary equivalent of a \\"chick flick\\"? I don't think so; I think there is more than enough substance and humor to the book that no matter what your gender or marital status, you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a worthy reprise","review":"The irrepressible Bridget Jones continues her diary for another year with this sequel to \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\", and the hilarity of her adventures is undiminished. Written in the highly comic trademark Bridget style, the new diary recounts Bridget's adventures in her relationship with Mark Darcy, her attempts to have her flat renovated, and her observations of her mother's shenanigans. Although \\"The Edge of Reason\\" is necessarily less original than, well, the original (and is clearly not going to spawn an entire subgenre of popular literature the way \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" did) it's still an excellent read; Fielding is a better inventor of plot, and surely a better stylist, than most of her imitators."},{"rating":"2","title":"still a funny good read","review":"hurrah! bridget has returned! this book was thoroughly funny! though i have to dock it one star because towards the end, it seemed quite predictable & a little cliche (her predicament seemed quite familiar, nothing new...) but Bridget is still hysterical! definitely read the first bridget jones' novel before you read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed out loud!","review":"To truely appreciate this book is to laugh out loud at the use of the video \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as a device to cheer the characters in this book up. As an owner of this video and admirer of \\"Mr Darcy\\" and the famous pond scene, I laughed out loud! It was very hard to explain to my finance who did not like the movie as much as I did! Loved the book, even better than the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"v. disappointing","review":"I really loved the first BJD but this sequel is a BIG disappointment. Very contrived and ho-hummish, the characters totally overdone. Also Bridget gets to be a bit of a whining bore, and so desperate that I found myself not really caring about what happens to her. The book feels like it was all done in a rush. I've just discovered Tiffany Trott which I thought was much, much funnier, and with a kind of whacky innocence and charm. Also Tiffany is really independent, unlike Bridget. But I hope the next Bridget will be better than this one as I used to be a big fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"I have only finished 1/3 of this book and I love it even more than her first book. This one is even better. I haven't been this entertained by a book in a very long time. I love the struggles between the married and not married friends and Bridget's constant battle with not letting anyone down now that she is finally involved. It hits so close to home. I have a library copy now but I am going to buy my own this week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two much of a good thing","review":"I read Bridget Jones' Diary quite a while back and had been hoarding this book for ages, looking for just the right amount of uninterrupted reading space. Sad to say, it wasn't quite the 'unputdownable' book I'd expected it to be. It started off on the right note, but soon began dragging unbearably. The gaffes began to seem awfully repetitive -- one just had to imagine the worst-case scenario and our heroine was right there. Also, the book could have done with some heavy editing, maybe in the middle months? It's reading value would have gone up considerably had it been around 30 pages shorter. They do say sequels rarely live up to their predecessors. Sad to say, this one only reinforces that feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget delivers the laughs","review":"This is one of those rare books that required me to stop reading because tears of laughter were making it impossible to continue. Yes, it's silly and implausible but that's also what makes it so charming and hilarious. The section concerning Bridget's discovery of the \\"Asian boy\\" in Darcy's bed had me howling, and her mother is truly hysterical. Overall I enjoyed this one even more than the first. It should also make for a great sequel in the movie department."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget is in all of us!","review":"That is why Helen Fielding's 'Bridget' is so accessible. Because she is our most neurotic selves. Helen Fielding has improved upon the Bridget in the initial installment and made her more realistic. How can you not chuckle at her thoughts surrounding Mark Darcy? (Sidebar: having seen the movie starring Rene Zellweger, the character is more alive). Have we not all been in love but not been sure how the other person really feels and so we go around attributing the wrong motives behind our loved ones actions? Helen/Bridget had me wanting more. Hopefully, she will you, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait For the Next Bridget Installment","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as well as Bridget Jones's Diary. All women can relate to the things that Bridget records in her diary about weight, men, finances, emotions, etc... Ms. Fielding draws you into Bridget's life so that you actually begin to care about her character and feel joys and the disappointments that Bridget feels. I found the book charming, heartwarming and delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"In some ways better than the original","review":"In some ways I liked this book better than the first one.

I wasn't disappointed, even though I have to rate \\"the Edge of Reason\\" slightly below \\"Diary\\". (I can't think of ANY sequel that has eclipsed or even equalled the original.) As it happened, I'd just finished a re-visiting of Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion\\" when I got hold of this book, and I must say that that added to my amusement and enjoyment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"v.g.","review":"The recording of Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason was fantastic. I laughed so hard I was practically crying. My life demands that I spend lots of time in my car. The book on tape was a terrific way to enjoy commuting. My favorite character is Bridget's boss. The audio does a terrific portrayal of the characters.

It was so wonderfully written and true to almost everyone. The way Bridget saw the world is just hysterical. No matter what awful disaster happened, she found a way for it to be funny, whether it be a gigantic hole in her wall, 2 weeks in a Thai jail, or having someone after her. I just thought the entire book was totally funny, and better than the first one. I wonder if there will be a third diary? There is a little of Bridget in every one of us which is why I think so many people can relate to this. Anyway, definitely two thumbs up and an eager wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Fit- Great Price","review":"Direct replacement requiring only a small flat blade screwdriver (I used my key chain Swiss Army knife's driver).

The amount of force that it takes to close the window is too much for that angle. I am 6'2\\" and found it very difficult to close the window.

On top of that, the gas arms are so strong that we are afraid that the glass will crack under the pressure (plus my wife had to use all of her weight to get the glass closed.

I don't plan on keeping it. It was a big disappointment. There were scant few interviews with any big name hair/metal bands from the 80's. Jani Lane did some interview footage, but since he's been kicked out of Warrant, the interview is sort of pointless. I'm a huge Cinderella fan and the only one they interviewed was drummer Fred Coury who I love, but he had little actual talk time and there were no other interviews talking about Cinderella or any clips of their videos or songs. There was not a lot of time spent on Poison either. If they could have cut out all the x-rated clips of naked women dancing, there would have been more time to have put in footage of things that people would have actually wanted to have seen and heard. It did seem very poor quality overall. It was a waste of time to watch actually.

C. Brown Physical Education Activities and Dance Series\\". It was written when Backpacking required a little more skill for the basics. Even today we need to get diversions periodically it would be useful to pick up the skills needed when all the electronics give out. It sometimes can be fun not to use electronics as that is what we are deviating from.All the fundamentals are explained form equipment to training. There are 107 pages, a preface, 6 chapters, 7 appendixes, and an index. There are questions to be sure that you covered the material.Chapter four is in navigation. It falls a little short of orienteering. There is no mention of azimuth or reverse azimuth.The equipment is a tad dated but the principle is sound.This is a good beginner book and a plus to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's on First, charlie Brown?","review":"This is wonderful book that shows every Baseball related Peanuts strips spanning from 1951 to 1999!

Lackluster versions of holiday favorites, especially disappointing because it's from Frank. The whole album is overproduced (all Frank is overproduced, but usually in a good way) in all the wrong directions. The \\"Twelve Days of Christmas\\" is the biggest stinker of them all with its terrible rewritten lyrics sung by Frank's terribly un-talented offspring. Stick with JOLLY CHRISTMAS from Capitol and you'll ring-a-ding-ding in the holiday season in style."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chairman seems bored","review":"Of the three Sinatra Christmas CDs available, this one is the runt of the litter. While its hard to criticize a Sinatra CD this one is dragged down by his strange lack of emotion in his singing, his questionable choice of obscure Christmas songs and the dubious decision to include his kids on three selections. While there's still some gems here this is not Sinatra at his holiday best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too shabby-some fun stuff here","review":"First off let me say I agree with other reviewers-yes, Frank's Capitol holiday album A Jolly Christmas is far superior-but come on, it was recorded when the man was really at his peak & also with the wonderful arrangements by Gordon Jenkins. This Reprise collection, while nowhere near as great as 'Jolly', is still pretty good. Many of the songs are garnered from his Sinatra Family Christmas album as well as a few tunes Frank recorded with Bing & Fred Waring's Orchestra. Standouts include those 2 songs with Der Bingle-Go Tell It On The Mountain & one of Frank's hippest, swinginest tinsel tunes -We Wish You The Merriest. Yes, The 12 Days Of Christmas sung by Frank & his children is kind of corny but cute, as well. Still a compilation true Sinatra fans should have in their collections. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS ALBUM","review":"Sinatra and Christmas - what a great combination. Plus Nelson Riddle's and Don Costa's great charts. Happy Yule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fills a Spot (partially)","review":"This collection of seasonal songs by Sinatra brings together miscellaneous material from the Reprise years, 1962-1975. It's a nice complement to, but no substitute for, his earlier holiday offerings on Columbia and Capitol (\\"A Jolly Christmas\\" is not only Old Blue's best but possibly as good a Christmas album as anyone has ever recorded). If there's any dissatisfaction with \\"The Sinatra Christmas Album,\\" it's that no one has seen fit to reissue in CD format the original Reprise LP from which several of the songs were collected: \\"12 Songs of Christmas Sung Together by Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, and Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians.\\" Perhaps the title is too long, or the music is deemed excessively sentimental by today's standards. A pity, because the album is not only of a whole but a rich and moving experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip the capitol xmas album, get this one instead","review":"I'm a huge sinatra fan and expected the capitol sinatra albumto be a swingin' affair. I've grown to appreciate it over theyears but it doesn't come close to the Reprise Sinatra ChristmasAlbum. Album covers a period from the early 60's through themid 70's. What I like about this collection:1. It's in chronological order2. Great arrangements (sorely lacking on the capitol album)3. Great choice of songs with a nice mix of the secular andsacred.4. Hard to find stuff like Christmas memories and a baby justlike you.Skip tracks 8-10 and you've got a perfect sinatra christmas collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What ever happened to Christmas\\".....","review":"I bought this CD for the song \\"What Ever Happened to Christmas\\", one of my very favorite Christmas songs.I was disappointed by the family renditions of the songs.

I really missed playing some old games from Sega and my brother informed me of Cd for PS2 that you kind find with an array of games, but I thought just like many before me, if i ran across any of them they would probably be filled with some crappy games and only one or two good ones. But just like the others reviews I was wrong. I purchased it through one of the other sellers who sale there products through amazon for less then 11 bucks, and I think I got it for like 8 bucks, shipping cost was ridiculous but overall I felt it was well worth it in regardless. The day it arrived I was eager to pop it in my PS2, and was so satisfied with what I saw. I feel there is no need to list the games on my review, since so many before me have. But it was what I was looking for so for me it was worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great selection from a wonderful group","review":"There is a reason why these songs sold so well.

Similar info on rest of world too. Highly recommended for library, school, or home."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old friend","review":"Forget School Library Journal. I've had a version of this same atlas for 25 years, and when it became outdated--I looked until I found an updated version. Why? Because this Atlas has so much information, so clearly printed and accessibly arranged, that I couldn't find a comparable book (in the same size) without getting an updated version of the same thing. I just couldn't buy anything else until I found my old friend. One of the very great virtues of this book is that it's fully packed with info and doesn't weigh a ton.

Great for looking up counties of states. Much good information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hammond Citation World Atlas","review":"Agree with most of the reviewers here. I like the countries presented all separately. That way the index lists the cities and populations, provinces also, on that and the previous page.Color overview maps describe rainfall etc physical phenomena. Roads, railroads etc are not shown for the world section (shown for N America), so the text you see is clear to sort thru. No countries are chopped into two pieces to seek thru.Looks a lot like the Hammond United States Atlas.Perhaps not as detailed on data as needed for a college level atlas, but more than enough for most of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editing of Wild Strawberries","review":"This is a wonderful book by a wonderful author with the worst formatting and copy editing I have ever seen in a commercially published volume. It reads as if it was scanned in from an old pre computer version, cursorily spell checked and grammar checked, which made things worse, and then formatted following some arcane principle that made it almost impossible to follow the turns of speech. Thirkell's work is sufficiently robust that to have this version is better than nothing, but it is really somewhatdisrespectful to her heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal!!!","review":"This record is one of the greatest live records ever made by an R&B Artist. It is well recorded and it ranks right up there with James Brown at the Apollo and BB King at the Regal. The listener will get an authentic taste of the greatest soul performer that ever lived. I used to go to the Regal Theater often in my younger days and I caught many a show by this man. The only person who ever came near Jackie in performance (voice and dance steps)is Michael Jackson. Jackie needed no pyrotechnics, dancing girls or backup singers, he was the whole package by himself. Check out St. James Infirmary, That's Why I Love You So and my favorite song on this record, This Is My Beloved and you will know who the real king of soul was. I have a lot of records but this one is special. So was Jackie Wilson."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest-On His Worst Day","review":"I was conditioned to believe that nobody can beat Jackie Wilsonas a singer/entertainer by an uncle who knew Jackie's manager andonce sort of \\"acted\\" as a bodyguard for the great singer at New York's Apollo Theatre;apparently it was impossible to keep females away from the stage.Like my uncle,I just don't think anyone does it better.

One is the classic tale of Riki Tiki Tavi which was a nice surprise! The others include a story about a white seal, another told from the POV of a man who can secretly understand animals' speech, and another alternately told from an elephant's perspective, then from a small boy's.

Lets face it, Insineratehymn and In Torment In Hell sucked. Thankfully, they are done with Roadrunner Records and 2006 is a new era, not only for Deicide, but for heavy music in general.

I've listened to some old Deicide here and there but nothing attracted me as the song \\"Homage ...\\" and that's when i went ahead and got this one! If this helps you in any way, you're welcome! But to finish I will describe \\"the Stench...\\" as: sick & brutal sounding, death metal with growling-high pitch vocals from a band that's been in the game since the late 80's early 90's and still going strong! That right there means a lot! Looking forward to the next record!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cute","review":"I was very disappointed with this book.

Well let me save you a Jackson ($20)....do not get this. First off the little holder does hold our hair especially if it is thin or you have layered hair. Also it is not easy to wrap it around the spirals. It says it is easier to follow and it is not. Also the top of the iron does not have a finished surface. Stray pieces of hair get stuck at the top and when you unroll the iron it pull out those stray hairs. Also it does not curl it well. Lastly, forget the little stand that is comes with. It falls over. This could cause a fire hazard! Seriously invest in a good flat iron. You can curl and straighten your hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my money","review":"This curling iron gave me a problem from the start. The cord would tangle up while I was trying to use it. Then I would notice it would cool down while I was using it and realized it was actually cutting off on its on while I was using it. Finally, after having it for 2 months and not using it every day either, it has stopped working all together. It comes on, but will not heat up. Seemed to be defective from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"i like it","review":"um.. well the only thing i can complain about this spiral iron would be that when i put it on its highest setting 30 i think it is, the little light that lets you know when it reaches that point that of heat mine never stops. a little frustrating but its no big deal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This curling iron is OK. It only curls one way, but that is how every spiral iron is-the \\"spiral's\\" design only goes one way. My hair stayed really nice and cute all day, the only things i would suggest is hold your hair on for a while if it is like mine, be sure to follow up w/ hairspray, and I get best curling results on second day hair (i wash my hair every other day-it's not too dry.)My hair is thin, about 2 in. past my shoulders, and doesnt hold curl on its own very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This product is so useless!

THAT was the best curling iron I've ever owned and I would have never used anything else had it not broken or if I could find another. I bought this thinking it would be similar just updated. It's not.This curling iron is difficult to use, makes crappy curls and the ones you get out of it don't stay long. It's just not any good. The other one even curled (and kept curled) the hair of my best friend with pin straight hair. My hair is wavy and relatively easy to curl (they just don't stay) even and this iron won't curl it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"This iron is junk.

That is true. The only problem is once it is heated you cannot operate it. The area to grip and curl your hair is only 1\\" long. Since I have a 3-4\\" pixie cut this is not possible due to physics. I got my hair cut and waited a week and modified my travel for the day to stay home to receive something that was not clearly explained to me is not intended to actually be used.

The album, sadly, was not one of Melanie's best. \\" I've Got My Mojo Working\\" does not suit Melanie's style or voice. It sounds forced. \\" What Do I Keep\\" should have been a classic, but the song is too long and at one point her voice loses its pitch. \\"Almost Like Being in Love\\" sounds like elevator music. The album is backed by musicians that clearly do not want to be there. However, there are some bright spots, mainly \\" The Sun And The Moon\\", \\" Where's The Band\\" and \\" Sandman.\\" The rest of the album is tired and listless. It's a shame too because Melanie's voice was in fine form. This does not reflect Melanie's superb writing. It's almost a wasted effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listening to it over and over...","review":"As a musician, I am impressed with the quality of the performance on this CD, as well as the excellent texts adapted to ancient Celtic melodies.

Loved every minute of it and play it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Celtic CD","review":"This CD sounds more \\"celtic\\" than other celtic CDs I've heard.

Babs truly showed herself as a talented MC, not just as a female MC. Freddy Pee and Young City (formerly Chopper) also ripped this cd into shreds! I personally like Ness's style because he has that 'Philly' sound, and I like his flow. Sara came correct with the vocals, and put everything into place. I recommend that you buy this cd, if you haven't already done so!

I just expected so much more after watching the show. It let me down in a major way.

Holla\\"Yung Lipse\\" aka \\"Stand Up Nucca\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"There hott","review":"This cd is hott. First off much love to my old-head from Philly, Ness. He did his thing on every track. Sara also kills the hook or verse in every song she is on. Babs is okay. My young boy Miami(Fred) is hott, I dont care what anyone has to say. The only two people that messes up the band is Choppa and Dylan. To make is simple Dylan sucks. Choppa is okay, but he raps about stuff that isnt true. He dont even got money like that(yet) All he rap about is money and girls. I heard when da band was in Philly he was tryn' to holla at every girl, but none even wanted him. He's immature. Rap bout real stuff not stuff you wish would happen. \\"Bad Boy This, Bad Boy That\\" I would have to say was the wrong single to put out first. Like I heard someone say, they all rap about different stuff. There is no theme. But after seeing all the stuff Diddy made them go through, I support them 100%. Dont think thats the only reason I say get the album its hott. Trust me you wont be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Better next time","review":"Now don't get me wrong all of them can rap.(And you can sign Sarah). But this album wouldn't even be looked at if they didn't have that t.v. show. I want to give this album a higher score but there is something big missing from it. I don't know what but something all albums have. And some songs on here sound the same. Maybe ya'll do better next time. D-A B-A-N-D!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one HOT album!","review":"This is a pretty tight debut CD for Da Band. The only thing I didn't like was that Dylan is not on too many songs, and when he is, he is only doing the chorus, or hs a very short verse. In this order, I rank the artists in Da Band: 1. Dylan- I love the reggae sound. Livin Legends is one of my favorite songs. 2. Young City a.k.a. Chopper- He does remind sometimes of Lil' Wayne and Young Turk, but the boy can hold it down, just as he does on his solo song Chopped Up. 3. Babs- The girl is hot! She kind of reminds me of Shawnna with DTP. 4. Sara- The girl is fine and can blow! 5. Ness- I like his vocabulary and word choices, especially in Bad Boy This, Bad Boy That. 6. Fred- Just cuz he is last on my list, doesn't mean that I don't like him. His voice is kind of weird, but he's still gangsta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This cd is Hot and has pretty good beats. I must admit, I didn't think the lyrics were all that but when I listened to it the second time around, it didn't sound too bad. On the show Fred talked about leaving the band... I really hope he doesn't. He brings life and personality to the band and in my own opinion, I think he's the best rapper out of the group. Anyway as I said before the beats are pretty Hot so go get the CD. I'm sure glad I did, and I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Bad Boy Classic","review":"Da Band's debut is off the wham! I thought it might not be that good before I listened to it, seeing how undedicated they seemed on TV. It seemed they spent too much time fighting and not enought time making music. But I guess when the cameras were off, they were turning out one of the best CDs I've heard this year. This is one of those songs you can listen to all the way without skipping songs. My favorite so far is track 6 - I Like Your Style - I'm glad Dylan finally listened to Diddy. If you buy this CD, you won't be disappointed. Anytime you can listen to the whole CD on repeat without getting tired of it, you know it's a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Individuals= Good Group","review":"After getting a copy of this CD right before it came out i just couldn't wait to here it because i was a regular watcher of the show much like most of the people who will buy this. I was impressed to a certain extent that it was exactly what i expected, a solid overall CD with very talented individuals. Of course some songs are much better than others, but the backround beats of the songs will always keep you interested and in tune. I think Chopper and Fred are the stars of the group and every song there in just make that song better, and every song there not in doesn't make it as good, and I have a feeling when this group is over they will have terrific solo careers, but i am not totally sure exactly where the group is headed, they may all just be too talented for eachother. All and all, this CD has a variety of different types of Rap and RB that keep it very unique and it would be a great CD for any fan of both types of music. Da Band is here, hopefully to stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"G-A-R-A-B-A-GGGEEEE","review":"Ok, i seriously haent heard the whole cd, but i just wanted to say \\"G-A-R-A-G-A-GGGGGEEEEEE\\".

Lets face it...Da Band is a pop band with a hip hop face. I bought the CD because I felt somewhat of a kenship to them, but the music itself points out the true nature of what Da Band is made for....future (mostly unsucessful) solo careers. There is no need to review every individual song because you hear the same one on every track. If you have to have Bad Boy This, Bad Boy That as your opening single...you know it can only go downhill from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"diddy does it again","review":"I'm rep. Jersey And all I have to say is that the cd is hot. From the tracks to the position everyone is playin. I felt like da band held it down for this being their debut album. People need to watch out for this group because if they could do this album in a few months with the whole country watching their every move. Imagine what they will do with some experience and alittle more time to focus without the pressure. Usually artist get to sit \\"on the shelf\\" at big record companies and soak up the game and learn the ropes. But with diddy's work drive and B.I.G watching this group had no choice but to step up.

Instead of letting the rappers perform from their hearts he wanted them to rap the way HE wanted them to sound. That pretty much destroyed the fire of the group. It sounds like the album was rushed and the verses sound copy and pasted to the tracks. Hip hop is about individuality and originality. When you dont have those its all garbage. The only person Puffy didnt seem to control all the time is Ness. Thats why I gave this CD 2 stars because of Ness performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Da Band - just plain sucks!","review":"I love rap but what a bunch of talentless wannabees!After MTV runs this show into the ground for a few more seasons, Da Band will eventually and thankfully just dissappear.

I think that my expectations were a little high before I bought it and I expected more, but as a whole I can't complain. My girl Babs is doin' her thang. Ness is the MF'n man. And I have to say that although I usually don't like too many mc's from the south (there are a few exceptions) Fred and Chopper have mad skills. They never, never, never, ever, ever, ever should've let Mysterious be on the album, cause that chic is GARBAGE!!!!!

There are plenty of female rappers who can rap their asses off, but this one couldn't get funky if she sat in a toilet for a week. Then you have the R&B cutie named Sara...I hope she'd never admit to writing the stuff she sings, cuz it is WACK. Basically, you have a group of lesser talents who were put together for TV and given almost a year of hype with the aid of MTV and P.Diddy.You are better off buying the DVD of Season One, because that is actually entertaining.

Their album was a flop, their show sucks now, and from the looks of it they'll be lucky if they stay together for another month. They're among the dumbest people I've ever seen on TV (and there are ALOT of dumb people on TV). None of them have any communication skills and so they just yell at each other without any understanding.

I can teflon tape the connection and it very well may seal better, but I don't feel I should have to do these things for a brand new setup. Also, the filter box part is difficult to keep submerged.

Not what I expected. So I saw reviews about the OPPO DVD player and thought, heck its under 200$ what could it hurt. I couldn't be more pleased! NO scan lines, better picture quality, and better sound quality (wasn't expecting that). The true test was that my wife even noticed a significant difference.

For those with Version 1, you can get the updated remote on OPPO's website (just pay shipping).So far, I'm incredibly happy. I think I'm seeing limitations in the DVDs, themselves, now- artifacts and poor mastering. Better quality discs have a vivid picture and I haven't even calibrated my tv yet.

Shipping a device that doesn't provide closed captions in this day and age is just unacceptable -- especially in a product that does have the ability to update its own firmware.Furthermore, I will also be letting others in the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities that I am part of know that Oppo doesn't consider the needs of the disabled to be important in its product design, and will be recommending its competitors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Find","review":"Chicago Trib spotlighted this product & they were right.

I have it hooked up to my Infocus 4805 via the DVI out. It is amazing. I know most people would be hesitant to shell out $200 for a DVD with HD-DVD's on the way. However, think to yourself about if you'll be hanging onto your DVD collection. If you are do yourself a favor and pick this up. It will offer the chance to rediscover you entire DVD collection which is worth a lot more than $200 in my opinion. One other comment is I have a 6.1 surrond sound system powered by a Onkyo receiver.

After power up I was instructed to insert a CD containing an ISO image of a newer version of firmware; unfortunately that disc doesn't load either. So I am stuck with a low-profile inferior bookend that used to be an excellent DVD player. You decide -- is a near High def DVD player that works for 11 months worth $200? As an engineer, I'm voting with my pocketbook and saying \\"no\\".UPDATE: After consulting again with customer service, Oppo RMA'ed the unit (including paying all shipping charges) and then replaced it with a new player w/ current software.

Great DVD player & price!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, excellent product....","review":"Oppo has hit a home run for picture quality on this DVD player. While I feel time is running out for it's usefulness in light of HD-DVD/Blu-Ray, it doesn't change the fact that standard-def DVD's look excellent on this machine, especially when driving a 1080P panel.The setup menus are straightforward. The manual is better than many. The remote is very usable with decently large buttons. Comes with both types of digital cables you may need. And finally the player itself looks cool, as well.My one gripe is that it does not come in black, but I guess that is what the newer OPDV981 is for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality image from this player","review":"I bought the OPPO to replace a badly-performing Sony DVD player (periodic freezes during playback were driving me crazy). I was also looking for an upconverting player--something that my Sony wasn't. I have not been disappointed. The image I'm seeing on my Sharp AQUOS TV, connected through the HDMI (or is it HDCP? Too many acronyms...) connector is excellent. Much smoother and cleaner than a standard DVD player. And I have experienced no problems with playback (freezing and the like).The only issue I've encountered is the fact that my All-In-One remote doesn't already have codes to control this player. However, I sent them an email and they say they can update my remote with the needed codes over the phone. So that should be a non-issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic initial impressions","review":"First off, a big well done to Oppo for supplying all the cables that you'd need - both a DVI to HDMI and a DVI to DVI cable were supplied in the box which was a pleasant surprise given that most makers would just have supplied one or the other at best.I tested this player out with Men In Black, outputing 1080i to my Sharp Aquos which is native 1080p, and wow it looked great! I'm very impressed with the upconverting ability. I moved on to a DVD of 2001 to check out older movies and while it was not as sharp looking as MIB which is to be expected, it was still very good and so much better than my other DVD player outputing 480p.The remote is decent and the options menus seem to have plenty of things to adjust, if you're into that sort of thing.Overall 4/5 easily...probably should be a 5 given the price and the DivX and region free features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD player","review":"This player has everything I expected:- Plays DIVX, XVID, etc.- The upconversion at 1080i produces a great picture for my 40\\" Sony LCD HDTV (upconversion only works with the DVI output)- It comes with DVI-DVI and DVI-HDMI cables- DVD's that used to freeze on my Philips DVP642 work very well- The response is almost instant when skipping chapters on a DVD- The DCDi by Faroudja really improves the quality of the imageThis is by far the best DVD player I ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Player - Awesome Price","review":"I use this Oppo with my HP MD6580n HDTV. The upconverted DVD's look as good as HDTV. Depending on the quality of the DVD, the usual garbage in garbage out applies.

The Oppo does have DVI out, but does ship from Amazon with the DVI to HDMI conversion cable.If you buy this from Amazon and it comes with the OLD remote, all you have to do is email a copy of your Amazon receipt to Oppo support within 30 days and they will send you the new glow in the dark remote for FREE, you don't even have to pay the $5.00 shipping.Likewise, if for some reason you don't get the DVI-HDMI cable, let Oppo know and they will send it out to you for FREE.You shouldn't have any issues buying this from Amazon.Until HD-DVD and Blu-Ray get here, this is the next best thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I have had this DVD player for over a month now, using it several times a week.

So, I highly recommend this battery pack if you use 35mm.It works well with my tripod, no complaints. It may appear bulky but I don't really care about that. I think it is easier to hold now anyways.

The setup (treachery, revenge, and an unsurprising surprise revelation) has the potential for classic Sabatini treatment, but from that point on the plot collapses. The main dramatic interest from that point on is how Sabatini will get himself out of the corner he's painted himself into. Minor spoiler warning: He doesn't. The ending, driven by coincidence (as is not uncommon in Sabatini) fails to satisfy the reader, and is completely unsatisfactory by Sabatini's later standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Author / unreadable edition","review":"This edition of Sabatini's novel is a poorly typed manuscript-- 8 1/2 x 11, typewriter font -- with a cover slapped on.

It helps that Julien Bravo, who plays Antoine, is really quite easy on the eyes, but that's not as important as it usually is to me.Beyond that, the acting in the movie is very good, and the writing and direction are decent as well. And if the plot's a little cliched, and if you know what's likely to happen at the end, well, that's not always a bad thing.Basically this is just a very sweet, very pleasant film.

I continue to put in her food although the dose becomes smaller and less times a week as you use it. She loves the beef although that's the only one I tried. I sprinkle it on her dry food and stir some very warm water in to disolve the powder and it makes a gravy. Also this way she gets it all and none left on the bottom on her bowl.

It worked for my shih tzu (Using for approx 2 1/2 mos) who had extremely bad tear stains on her face and even from when she licked herself. My husband likes her a lot more now since she doesn't look like Oscar the Grouch. I can say that it defintely took away the major brown stains around her eyes, but there is still a slight discoloring on her face.

Within a few weeks the stains were completely gone. I have to sprinkle the powder on a small slice of turkey or ham and roll in up to get him to eat it. He looks forward to his treat every morning.

Here is the catch- you have to be diligently committed to giving it to your dog every single day for about four (that's right four!) months straight and then you are supposed to taper down to just two times a week. The highish price ($15 for a tiny bottle- $30 for the big one) was not a big deterrent- God knows I wasted way more than that on other products (Diamond Eye,etc.) that did not do half as good a job and smelled pretty bad too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I started my dog on it December 2008.

There may be a natural remedy in it instead, but apparently it does not work as well as the actual Tylan.

But Angel Eyes' contains an antibiotic (tylosin). My dog is now recovering and should be ok. But I thought about. Would you give your child a daily dose of antibiotics? It can irritate the digestive tract. Also after awhile, you dog develops a tolerance for antibiotics. What if your dog develops pneumonia etc. ?, and the you find out that antibiotics no long work for him because his body has built an immune system against antibiotics ?

Also, it is exhorbitantly expensive, and if you want your pet to be on an antibiotic to be stain-free, then you should talk to your veterinarian, for tetracyclines that are cheaper and work just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not receive anything","review":"I have not received my item that I paid AMAZON.

My blessing is a pound doggy, a dark gray & white Shih Tzu, we've named Angel (not because of the product, that was pure irony). It is not a cure, in fact, discontinuing use allowed the tear staining to return. However, since I resumed the regiment, her eyes and overall coat is clearly healthy. She us a finicky eater, but this powder is easily accepted. Knowing the product works, when I reordered, I selected the larger size. It appears to have been exposed to some moisture as it is rock hard and has to be chipped apart.Should have compplained and sent it back, but, it still works and this is the first time I've had a moment to anything.

The stains were so bad at one point that they were starting to leave sores under our eyes (OUCH), but Angel's Eyes took them away in about 2-3 weeks. We noticed improvement after 3-4 days.

After about 3 weeks on it he started vomiting almost on a daily basis and his stools were very loose. I stopped it immediately and, after 2 weeks, he's back to himself again.

Within a couple of months, all the staining had disappeared! Any staining that is already on the dog when you begin using this product either needs to grow out or be removed with some other method, but once it is gone, no more will return as long as you us this on a regular basis.

I did not start using this product until he was 9 months old because I thought maybe he was just teething and it was causing the staining. I used Angels Eyes for 2-3 weeks before I actually saw a difference. I was happy that it worked but disappointed that there was still some staining. I have now used it for 2 months and the red staining is gone completely (after cutting the old fur away).

Researching the \\"Angel Eyes\\" I found that if given to puppies before they're adult teeth are in, it can turn their teeth yellow. I stopped immediately and started putting lemon juice in their water (it supposedly changes their system to a more acidic one which kills the yeast in the eye excretions), they liked it and within three weeks, no more tear stains.

They came back this year, so I started the regimen again. Please follow the directions provided. You do not leave your dog on this drug forever for tear stains as stated in some of the reviews.

I'm sure the dogs don't care. The chicken flavor is much more acceptable....hardly any smell. My preferred way of giving it to them is to put 1/4 can dog food in a bowl and mix it up. These are the small cans usually around 50 cents. I also sprinkle some over their hard food in the bowl in case I forget one day. Be patient....it takes up to 5 weeks like the directions say, but it does work.

It can be dangerous.","review":"Tear staining is a natural oxidizing process where the enzymes in the tears react with air and natural bacteria on the skin. This product contains a low dose antibiotic called Tylosin that disrupts this normal physiology. You are literally 'treating' your dog with a daily dose of antibiotic. It is not considered responsible use of antibiotics by many veterinarians. The safety of long term use of antibiotics like this have not been properly studied and are likely to cause long term effects. This is why many people have reported GI signs in the reviews. The best thing you can do to reduce tear staining is gently wipe the area with warm water every morning as well as routine grooming.

I will probably replace with another, medal that doesn't \\"sound\\" so cheap when worn..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful compared to CTR","review":"If you like Crash Team Racing this game pales in comparison. I only wish I had read the other review before I wasted $50 on this game. I love CTR. I like it a whole lot better than Mario Kart for N64 because it has so many added features and the kart handling is so much better. Crash Nitro Kart is terrible and has none of these qualities. It feels like your kart is going 2 mph and feels like you're floating and not actually on the track. The camera seems to jerk a little and the sound effects are also awful. The loading times and saving also get in the way because each take so long. If you want to play a good kart racing game play Mario Kart: Double Dash! on Gamecube or CTR for PS1. These games are both awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash's crash landing on Gamecube.","review":"If this game was released before Mario Kart: Double Dash!! I would have given it 4 stars. Sadly though, poor Crash picked the wrong time to crash land on the Gamecube, the time of Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and F-zero GX. It seems like a good racing game at first, but Mario Kart: Double Dash!! makes Crash look like trash. The controls aren't great either and it isn't very fun to race. Sure your little brother might enjoy racing with Crash, but more serious gamers should stick with F-zero GX, Double Dash!! or Kirby Air Ride. This game looks stupid when compared to F-zero GX, Double Dash and Kirby Air Ride. By the way, here's some advice for the person who said this game is good because of the advertisments: companies make the game sound good so people will buy them. It's up to you to play them and see if they are right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!","review":"I have been looking around for this game for awhile.

This game is LAME and a BIG WASTE of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is a huge letdown after CTR!","review":"This game is way to easy!!! I got it thinking it would be tough, challengeing, and fun like CTR(crash team raceing)!

Also, it crashes every 20 minutes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cover LIES!","review":"The cover makes the game look cool but, its stupid. Your slow as heck, Horrible graphics.

Dont waste 50 bucks on this stupid game because it belongs in the toilet. Where did the old crash go?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A high disappointment","review":"I am a big crash fan, but this game disappointed me. The control sucks. When you turn you lose all of your speed. You have to powerslide every single turn to come in a decent place. Ever since Naughty Dog stopped making crash, the games have stunk. The two for gameboy were horrible. So easy it's not even funny. If you want a good crash game try the first, second, third, or CTR. VICARIOUS VISIONS RUINED CRASH FOREVER!

This film expertly illustrates how easily a powerful democracy can begin to slip away and how, even under responsible leadership, we as citizens must fight to keep it alive.

Unfortunately it is hard to point out these flaws without being a spoiler so suffice to say that the ending was not borne out by the behaviour of the characters throughout the book and I think that, even allowing for the mores of the time, there are elements of a nurse's job that would have required closer contact with the patient than Miss Latterly seemed to exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to Write, to Read","review":"I can think of no other writer with the skill to take us back in time to explore the issues presented in The Silent Cry.

He shares the circumstantial evidence he has with others who all become absolutely convinced he's right, despite, in the case of the police investigator, having knowledge of contradicting evidence. It all comes out in final climactic scene where the reader should say \\"well finally the idiots see reason!\\"If this were a story about detective work gone wrong, people being wrongly accused, and what can happen when anger blinds people so much they just want a guilty party instead of the truth, this could be decent. As a story about a detective who is supposed to be the best in the district it's immensely frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Silent Cry","review":"I'm on #12 of Anne Perry's William Monk Novels and I have really enjoyed each one.

The reader will come away with a rich understanding of Nietzsche's life and philosophy. Curtis Cate really did his homework on this one.About three-quarters to four-fifths of the content of the book is biographical. The remaining one-fifth to one-fourth, interspersed throughout the biography, is an examination of the primary themes of Nietzsche's philosophy.Again, I want to reiterate that the book is quite readable.

It was published by a self-publishing company, but the author is listed elsewhere on the net as an editor. If so, she didn't edit her own book.One website printed her intentions that this book not be so identifiable with lesbian writing. However, her mechanism of avoiding the main character's partner's gender by always using her name was artificial and pointed glaringly at what she was trying to hide.If you want to read this author's books, please give her feedback that she needs to be more craftsmanlike. There's no excuse for this level of poor grammar and writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting Errors.","review":"Impossible to to read due to all the the errors. Spelling, punctuation, logistics, you name it- it was wrong. Every single page had errors. Even the title character Lynne went back and forth from Lynne to Lynn. Sloppy and lazy editing made it way too difficult to concentrate on anything resembling a plot. Also, I have lived in Leadville for 18 years and the inconsistencies with what actually exist in Leadville were extremely annoying. My dog could've written a better book. Do not waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BLOW DRYER EVER","review":"When I received the box I was worried about how light weight it was. The only thing lightweight about this blow dryer is the number of pounds and ounces. It is easy to handle and so fast!

It is worth way more than the price they are selling for. LOVE IT!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dryer Stopped Working After 3 Months","review":"I was very impressed by this dryer immediately after purchase. For such an inexpensive dryer it did an excellent job drying my thick wavy hair. The dryer is lightweight and dries fast. The issue is that this week about 3 months after my purchase the dryer stopped working. It sounds like it is the motor as it sort of turns on for 5 seconds and then dies out. Since the dryer is cheap it looks like I will just be tossing it in the trash and looking for a better quality longer lasting dryer. I knew it was too good to be true. Only purchase this dryer if you want a disposable short term option."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best dryer I've ever had!","review":"I use a hair dryer everyday and also color my hair.

This one makes my hair look lustrous and full even the day I color it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I Found A Good One!!!","review":"After much searching, trying others and a lot of research, I finally found a GREAT hairdryer! I can honestly say this is the best one I used and so glad I purchased it. The diffuser, I haven't used, but I'm sure is fine. I purchased a separate universal one from Conair. It is a tourmaline one. I like the diffusers a bit curved in the middle (this one is flat), like a cup so that I can make my waves a bit curlier and it does just that. Although my hair is consistently frizzy, this leaves it a bit less so, but with some products in my hair, it helps. It doesn't last all day, then again, it is a hair dryer.This is the next best one, from what I have read, to the T3. I love the cool setting and everything. Those who had complained regarding the placement of the switches and buttons... maybe they don't know how to use a hair dryer, or have really big hands, but I have yet to get that problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for fine hair","review":"I read a reviewer stating it blew too hard and too cool for her fine hair. I have very fine hair and think the blow dryer is great. Boy, I can really tell a difference between a regular blow dryer and an ionic one! My last ionic blow dryer from Hot Tools broke suddenly one day (after only a year). So, I was using my old back-up. My hair was so dry and brittle using that. No wonder I always thought my hair was so dry growing up. Once I received this ionic blow dryer from Revlon at such a GREAT price, I was in heaven again! My hair is incredibly soft. I love the tool it comes with to control the airstream. My hair has never looked so good and it cut my drying and ironing time in half. I would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Bang for the Buck","review":"Great Hair Dryer.Issues with the location of the on/off switch but willing to deal with that because for the price its an awsome dryer.

It stopped blowing hot air, so after looking at the reviews on the Revlon RV544, I decided to take my chances on it. It works better than the CHI for $130.00. It is lighter and dries my hair quicker.

I am extremely happy with my choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hair Dryer at a Great Price!","review":"I must say I was skeptical about buying this hair dryer, but no more. For $20 it gets the job done beautifully. I have long curly and frizzy hair, and it normally takes me twenty minutes or more to dry my hair, but with this dryer it is done in 10 minutes. It also leave my hair feeling softer and much less frizzy that a normal dryer. I have only used it twice so far, but I am a happy customer. The only problem with this hair dryer is that the cord is about 10-12 inches too short, but I can deal with that for $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"If you just want a cheaper hair dryer, this one has power and works fine.

My fine hair dries fast and smoothly. It took some getting used to the fact that the \\"hot\\" setting isn't consistently hot, but it doesn't adversely affect the outcome, so I decided it is not a problem. Maybe it's actually just keeping my hair from getting dried out and damaged. My shoulder length hair dries totally in 7 minutes. With the concentrator attachment I have excellent control.

It was not dropped or used to beat a rug. So this is ridiculous. Amazon's return policy says I'll only get a portion of the cost returned. Maybe I'll write to Revlon.

Perhaps my expectation are too high? I used this almost daily, but my hair dries in about 10 minutes, so I don't quite understand how that would wear it out so quickly. To be honest, other Revlon hair dryers haven't lasted too long for me, either, so I think this is the last Revlon hair dryer I'll purchase. I'm tired of replacing these things so frequently.

Worked well when alive.","review":"This hair dryer worked great and was light weight when it worked. After 1 year though it started to blow at 25% power and eventually it just died completely.

Revlon needs to work on their product reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for fine hair - I should have listened!","review":"Amidst the happy reviews there are just a few that mention that this might not be a good dryer for fine hair. Wish I'd listened! My fine, straight hair is normally no big deal to style but this dryer leaves it limp, limp, limp. Plenty of hair spray is the only way to salvage a little curl. And perhaps because my hair is both fine and short, the dryer runs too hot for me. Can't handle pain before breakfast. Glad it works well for so many folks but, for me, time to find another dryer. I strongly recommend the Elchim Professional 2001 2000 Watt Classic Hair Dryer, which is not ionic, works perfectly with my fine hair, and has proved worth the higher price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading box picture - Product missing a part","review":"The product box shows a plastic attachment called a concentrator. That part does not come with the product. I tried to get that part shipped but had no luck. Amazon is not the seller so they can only accept a return. Tried the manufacturer but they will not ship it (they said that they do not have the product which makes no sense).I also tried Amazon feedback and asked for them to remove the box picture since it is misleading - the response was that there is no merit to my comment. Feels like a catch 22 and I am trying to help them. Amazon definitely lost quality with the introduction of other sellers. They are making money but are driving me to other options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent results","review":"Fast, gentle, light, hair dryer. No frizz, quick drying results. The diffuser attachment is rather large and hard to pack into a small travel bag but gives good gentle air. The dryer is very light to hold and has a cold setting to finish the job. The motor can be rattling and rather loud but over all performance is excellent for daily use. Don't waste your money on the expensive ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the cheap price...","review":"My CHI hairdryer bit the dust after 7 years, so I bought this because it had great reviews and was cheaper. This hair dryer is not good on my hair, I'm going to put it in my garage sale. My hair feels very dry and looks frizzy after using this dryer and I never had that problem with the CHI. Sorry, but I'll spend the money now and get a good hair dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"If you have straight hair that you actually do something with stay away from this dryer.

I will take my chances with my old beloved CHI that has a short in it until my new one is comes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if going overseas","review":"I bought this lightweight hairdryer to take with me on a trip to England after reading the good reviews that it had. Once in the UK, I used it with a wall adapter. About half way through drying my hair, it became hotter, so I switched it to the lower setting. Suddenly I smelled hair burning, and in what seemed like an instant, I realized that my hair had been badly burnt, the natural bristled brush had burned on the ends, and there was lots of burned hair in it. I had to leave the hair dryer in UK as it wasn't worth it to try and fit it in my suitcase, but I would not trust this dryer, at least not to use in another country. I don't know if it simply can't be used with an adapter or if the dryer itself cannot be trusted. Has anyone else had a problem like this with it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good purchase","review":"I had a Conair Infiniti hair dryer that was not working so well anymore, so I replaced it with this Revlon hair dryer. I had high hopes for it based on the reviews, and I was looking forward to having a lighter-weight hair dryer. I have slightly wavy, thick hair that I blow dry straight. I used this hair dryer for 3 weeks and every time I did, it made my hair frizzy and dull. I was so disappointed. I have now replaced it with a Conair Infiniti Pro, and my hair looks great again. That hair dryer makes my hair straight, smooth, and shiny. I did give this Revlon hair dryer 2 stars for being lightweight. That was the only nice thing about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best option available","review":"Over the course of many years we've gone through many different blow dryers. For a long time I scoffed at the idea of there being any difference for this thing called ionic, until I tried it. There is a very noticeable difference. It makes the air coming through the blow dryer much cleaner feeling. I know this may seem strange, but it works. It means that your hair dries faster with less static. This is all we buy anymore for replacements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks with a year, poor warranty service","review":"Purchased this product 14 months ago, and it broke this morning. Agree with the above reviews about its quality as a dryer, it had worked well, but now I'm hair dryer-less.Called up Helen of Troy, since it is still under a 2-year product warranty. However, to get a new dryer I'd need to ship in the old one, write a $5 check, and wait another 7-10 days processing time before they ship out. Plus, if they don't have the RV544 dryer in stock (which they can't tell you on the phone), they'll send you a different model, who knows which kind. (mailing address: 1 Helen of Troy Plaza; El Paso, TX 79912)Sp one way shipping fare, plus $5, plus 2+ weeks processing time does not equal a stellar reason to use the warranty, so I'm just purchasing a new one with my Amazon Prime account.Overall unfortunate customer service experience from Helen of Troy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great dryer...while it lasts","review":"I loved my dryer, it worked great on drying my hair while leaving it soft and shining. However, after 4 months of daily use it broke down on me. I know it's probably just the fuse, but I've had other dryers at a must lower quality rating that lasted for years. Thankfully I still have one of those old goodies as a back-up kicking around so I was at least able to finish drying my hair this morning. A \\"good\\" product like this from Revlon should prove to be of better quality; I'm very disappointed and will be looking to probably pay extra for something that will actually be good quality. While I would still recommend this type of hair dryer, I would not recommend this model to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Major Flaw","review":"I have bought 2 of these hair dryers because I loved it so much and thought the first one died by a fluke. It wasn't. While it's working this is a great, light-weight, lower noise hair dryer. Unfortunately, after less than a year both started flickering on and off when held at certain angles, and just got worse with continued use. This time I'm not waiting for it to get worse- I'm getting something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less $$$, less frizz, less time","review":"I used to hardly ever use hair dryers because they always made my hair really frizzy, poofy, and dried out. This one dries my hair very quickly and it feels much smoother and straighter than any other hair dryer I've used. The fact that it's only $20 makes it the perfect hair dryer for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"My Chi dryer died after 7 years and I asked for a new one for Christmas. My mother-in law saw all the great reviews on this dryer and got me one instead. Well, Chi it ain't. First of all, it didn't work properly and had to be returned. It didn't heat up at all. Second, it just doesn't have the balance or quality feel of a high end dryer. If it worked, it might be ok for the guest bath, but I'll stick to a professional dryer like a Chi or Babyliss for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hair dryer","review":"I really like this hair dryer. Especially the root lifter attachment - its like a mini massage for my head every day. The only complaint I have is that my hair is still somewhat frizzy when I use it. Otherwise, its light and drys my hair the fastest out of any dryer I have used (I have long, thick hair)."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIRE HAZARD almost caught hair on fire!!!","review":"I have had this hair dryer for less than 6 months and today a coil inside started to catch on fire and spit out flames that almost caught my hair on fire! I plan to contact Revlon and voice my concern over their very dangerous appliance! Do not buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blow dryer","review":"After working at home for two years, I took a job downtown and had to learn to get ready in a hurry. My other blow dryer was hot, but the air flow seemed moderate. I wanted something that would dry fast, but didn't want to spend a lot of money. This is an excellent dryer for the money and performs similarly to dryers that cost more than $150. It drys super-fast and does not seem to damage the hair. My hair looks full and shiny and it gets the job done in about five minutes. Gotta love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent drying","review":"Bought this for the current girlfriend to try to get her out of the bathroom quicker. She had some outdated blow dryer and it seemed to take forever to dry her hair. Since we got ready for work at the same time in a one bedroom apartment, this was becoming a problem. Bought her this and I must say I'm just as happy as she is with it. Quick with different settings. The only downside is the noise but when isn't it with a hair dryer? Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hair dryer, terrible delivery time","review":"I love this hair dryer. My old dryer would leave my naturally curly hair frizzy and awful when I'd blow it straight, but this is a great machine. My hair now shines with the combination of this dryer and Kiehl's Smooth Silk Creme.Since I wasn't a regular hair dryer user when I ordered this, it didn't inconvenience me so much that this product took a little over a month to arrive. If you need this product, you'd probably be better off paying more plus shipping at Target than to buy from this vendor unless or until this vendor will address this problem.The reason I'm giving this four stars is that it's a great product. I don't feel it's reasonable to pan the product review just because of the service, so I only removed one star for the vendor.Buy the product, be weary of shipping times from this source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"I had one hair dryer for 20 years and since then I have been going through one a year. This is the best yet. Leaves hair with nice shine and soft. Last 2 I bought left hair fried and dull after first few uses. Daily use now for 4 months or so and still works great. Unfortunately can't expect to get that 20 years out of anything anymore. 1-2 years would be great on a 20 dollar hair dryer I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife loved it - but it lasted just 8 months","review":"We bought this from Amazon Dec. 2010 and it just quit Aug. 2011 - not very long in my opinion. So why are we getting it again? My wife loved the ability to hit the cool air button and the instant switch from hot to cool air to set her hair, it is light weight, and while it worked, she loved it. She has fine hair and some reviewers said it wasn't the best for those with \\"delicateness\\" in the hair strand arena. Not a problem I was told. So because the primary user loves it, the price is reasonable, we are getting another with hope and prayers that it last longer than 8 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for Daughter","review":"I purchased this for my daughter. She wanted an expensive professional model but agreed to try this first. She has coarse-wavy hair which takes forever to dry. She said it works very well and it's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I researched hairdryers on various sites and kept coming across this one. I had my doubts as it is much lower priced than professional models. But it delivers! My hair is healthier and it doesn't take long to dry my medium-length hair. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!","review":"I had the dryer for about a year. This week it literally caught on fire and sparks came out the back. Pieces of metal shot out damaging the bathroom mirror. Luckily no one was hurt. This product should be taken off the market. If one of the metal pieces went into her my eyes I would have been severely injured."},{"rating":"2","title":"lightweight","review":"I love it! It's lightweight and has a warm setting so I don't burn my hair. I would recommend it to anyone who uses a blowdryer daily!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great hair dryer","review":"Dries fast and evenly. I would have given it 5 stars, but the on switch it right where you hold the dryer so I often hit the switch and turn it off. Not a big deal and I'll get used to it, but it's been a bit annoying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revlon rv544","review":"A very helpfull hair dryer for any busy woman on the go. Revlon makes nice hair dryer products! If you have long, thick hair, this dryer will probably work well for you too.! The high setting throws out a lot of heat so air cutting drying time in half what it was with my old dryer. The low speed setting is great for styling and taking your time or if you are worried about creating frizzies. I have never dried my hair in a faster way. It is also not too loud and not too heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Hair Dryer","review":"I haven't bought a hair dryer in a long time. This hair dryer is great. Lightweight and does an excellent job drying your hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update - Great Value","review":"This dryer is great quality for the money. It does dry hair quicker than my old ion dryer and seems to be overall more gentle on the hair - less \\"frying\\" out of the hair even on the hot/high setting. This is really helpful for me because my young daughter has long thick hair. It is convenient to be able to get her hair dry as quickly as possible without damaging it. I have fine curly hair and it works great for me too - I use the concentrator for my roots first and the diffuser for all-over drying. The different choices of speed and heat settings are great including the cool shot. I'd recommend this dryer - it is so nice to get a good deal on a quality product.Update: July 31, 2011 - Well, unfortunately this dryer has stopped working. It started just cutting off and then actually set off a burst of sparks while I was holding it and smelled like a burnt heating element. I won't be using it anymore of course and will now work on getting a refund or replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKE AFTER 7 WEEKS","review":"I liked this hair dryer when I first got it. Worked well, although I didn't think the tourmaline made any difference.After using it twice a week for 7 weeks, it just stopped working. I tried the reset button -- nothing. I waited till the next day to try again, with the same results. I didn't drop it, I didn't get it wet. Nothing was done to it and yet it stopped dead.I called Revlon and was told I could return it to them for an exchange. However, as it cost me $18.99 when I purchased it last Nov., and it would cost me approx. $8 to return it and another $5 for them to return it to me, I didn't bother.I am extremely disappointed in this blowdryer and will never purchase anything from Revlon again. I guess this is just more junk made in China. I'm going back to my 25 year old Gillette dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melted","review":"I have had this dryer for 2 months and the concentrator, the attachment that you use to blow your hair straight, has melted and continues to melt after every use. The dryer leaves my hair limp and lifeless and my ends are dry and split since using this dryer. I cannot believe that this product was developed so poorly. I would not buy again and would not suggest it to friends either. Terrible choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!!!","review":"I went out of my way to buy this one (not to mention a day on research I did to find a good diffuser) . I asked my realtive to buy it from US and ship it to UK. I bought a $55 adaptor and this diffuser blows off when I switched on. I have many other US hair tools (Remington , Conair etc) which worked perfectly on this adaptor so its definitely not adaptor problem. Well, I was hoping to use it everyday and I didn't get a chance to use it even once...very very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I had boughten this as a gift which turned out to be an aweful idea. It is way too loud and the force of air is way too strong. It literally causes loss of hearing and causes your hair to look like you were just caught in a tornado. I do not recommend this hair dryer for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hair dryer for the money","review":"I did a lot of research before buying this dryer. I wanted something that had the ion technology yet was lightweight, dried hair quickly, left my hair shiny, yet was reasonably priced. I came very close to purchasing one of the $100+ high-end driers, and I'm glad I didn't. This little guy is strong, extremely lightweight, and leaves my hair really shiny. It also dries my hair quickly. I gave it 4 stars because the concentrator attachment fits pretty loosely on the nozzle, so it tends to turn and shift position while I'm using the drier, and I have to re-adjust several times. Otherwise, it's a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet... Fast.... Inexpensive... Perfect!","review":"I love this dryer. I have medium length, medium thickness hair and it works great for me. The high speed is high enough to really get to the roots, and the low speed is soft enough to style my bangs without blasting them all over the place. The only issue is the buttons on the handle. I find I inadverantly change the selections because the toggle buttons are right uner my fingers, but it is really no big deal. It does dry my hair faster than my pervious dryer, if you had long or thick hair, I bet this dryer would really make a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"It is really light weighted, and it dries the hair fast, but the cold shot button does not make the air cold, it just makes it less hot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great dryer so far","review":"I bought this based on the reviews on Amazon and the decent price. I have been wanting to try an \\"ionic\\" hair dryer but did not want to spend $$$ on one to try it. This one by Revlon has been well worth my money so far. It really does seem to leave my hair softer, shinier, and with less frizz than my other former dryers. (most of these have been Revlon or Conair)It is relatively quiet compared to my others, has two speed/heat settings; a cold shot button; a diffuser and concentrator attachment; a decently long cord; is lightweight; back part comes off to clean the filter; drys my hair fast.I cannot speak for the longevity of the product. I do know my previous revlon dryers have lasted several year; I hope this one also does.

I kept reading about diffusers and how it helps with naturally curly hair, so after years of using a regular blow dryer, I decided to buy this and all I can say is WOW. Not only is it a good product over all, the diffuser attachment it amazing! I wish I could have had this years ago, it would have reduced a lot of bad hair days. The price is unbeatable, and it is lightweight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This dryer works great. It dries your hair so quickly.

There's nothing fancy about this one but it does the job. The attachment stays on well. Can't attest to the Ionization - makes no sense to me and I can't tell any difference between it and many others we've used without this feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"Performs perfectly for an excellent price.

It only blows cold air regardless of the heat setting that it is on. I purchased this hair dryer based on the positive reviews that it had received, and I am very disappointed. I will not be purchasing a Revlon hair dryer again. I have an old Conair hair dryer that I have had for almost 10 years that still works like a charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job, but button placement could be better","review":"I got this blowdryer to replace another one I had for a few years. At $20 and pretty good reviews, it was a hard bargain to beat.The dryer gets the job done. It dried my hair faster than my old dryer and I like that it comes with the two attachment pieces, though that seems to come standard nowadays with any dryer.My only comment is that the shape and placement of the buttons are slightly inconvenient. It's smack in the middle of where you'd hold the blowdryer, and since they are just big push buttons, it's very easy to accidentally change settings in the middle of using it. I use this dryer at least 3 times a week and, in the month that I've had it, I've accident turned it off or switched a setting almost every time I've used it. But let's face it -- when you're paying $20 for a blowdryer, you are getting it because it's good at its job and are not expecting any extra bells and whistles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great! (For a year...)","review":"My wife and I used this hair dryer daily for just over a year and we were pleased. Now it turns off unless I hold it a certain way, suggesting a wiring problem.

I just wish the controls were placed differently or were a slide kind of switch, instead of the button-type. It sticks out a bit too much making it a little uncomfortable in your hand! You get used to it after a while. Relatively quiet, dries my medium length, thick hair pretty fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"light, but warm setting is too hot","review":"I was looking for a new dryer and found this one. It is very light and not very loud. The diffuser is huge which can be bad if you travel a lot like me, or have limited storage space. The ionic part works well. My hair is less frizzy and have lot of natural curl so I usually have frizz when I blow dry my hair. Why I returned it was that it the 2 heat settings were not good for me.

One day I got a nasty electrical shock when I turned it on, and it started sparking.I took it apart at some point before I threw it out to see if I could fix it, and it turns out that their \\"Ionic/tourmaline technology\\" translates to the hot air being blown through a cardboard toilet paper tube that has been spray-painted gold.

The one I have is a vortex dryer(with a bell shaped end) that lifts the hair as it dries and is wonderful! Anyway, I can't find the same model, so I tried this Revlon model. Oh my...I have shoulder length color treated hair, kind of medium thickness and I ended up with a fuzzy mess! I gave up before it was quite dry and went back to my other dryer. I wish I would have had time to start over, but I would have been late for work. Ugh....hate a bad hair day. Another thing....the on/off switch is at a bad place.

From the beginning, I wasn't thrilled with this dryer. The on-off power switch is poorly placed and/or poorly designed and it took some time before I quit accidentally turning the hair dryer off while drying my hair (which happened multiple times every time I used the hair dryer). This dryer has two heat settings. I soon discovered that use of the high heat resulted in my hand getting burned because there are screws in the handle that heat up and cannot be avoided. The only way to avoid getting burned is to use the lower heat setting. Then, less than nine months after I purchased this dryer, I threw it in the trash after the heating element went out altogether.

As long as the hairdryer lasts at least a couple of years I will be very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerfull","review":"Just what my wife wanted.

I did not want to spend a fortune on it, yet after reading reviews, decided I did want the tourmaline ionizer.Found this one, bought it, and love it.

When I realized it was the tourmaline-type dryer making my hair flat and lifeless, I went to the store and bought a NON-tourmaline dryer and now my hair has its volume and bounce back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, Good Hairdryer","review":"This hairdryer is powerful and lightweight and does a good job drying my usually frizzy hair and making it relatively smooth. The only drawbacks are the noise (I bought it thinking it would be quieter than my old dryer-- not so, but about average for hair dryers), and the placement of the buttons (I keep hitting them by accident, but it's nothing I can't get used to). Overall, I would recommend this dryer, especially if you don't want to spend the money on a T3. I like the diffuser attachments that come with it as well. Also, keep in mind that the airflow is POWERFUL, so if you don't like getting blasted by a stream of air on the high setting, then this isn't for you. It would benefit from a medium setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love it","review":"I purchased this product looking for something to get the job done quick with my waist length hair. I also wanted a dryer that wouldn't damage my hair. I definately found it here! I love that this hair dryer isn't too heavy, has a hot, warm and cool setting and is ionic. So I don't get damage, and it really dries my thick hair fast! The diffuser is fabulous for when I curl my hair as well. Overall a great product! I would definately recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick dryer but still loud..","review":"This hair dryer reduced the time it took me greatly.

Worth it though since it takes less than 10 minutes to dry my hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing value","review":"I have had this dryer for several weeks now and I love it.

It still works like its brand new and we've never had a problem with it. The temperature settings let you choose hot, warm, or cold which is nice and the dryer itself isn't very loud. I just recently bought another one of these because I am moving out to my own place in a month, and I must say this dryer is wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly terrible and possibly dangerous","review":"I bought this hairdryer based on positive reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere. I have to wonder if Revlon paid for those reviews. For me, it was a total disaster. It has been compared to more expensive products with similar technology, but did not produce the same results whatsoever (I previously owned a high-end dryer that died after 5 years and did a very nice job while alive). Further, this dryer got so hot while drying my hair that it once literally burned my palm. It consistently emitted a horrible burning smell. Finally, it abruptly stopped working after 2 1/2 months, probably due to how hot it got. I am surprised and lucky that it didn't catch on fire (yes, I should have returned it right away, but got caught up in life). I consider this a dangerous product which deserves zero stars. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"The switch doesn't work well...","review":"The dryer looks good and feels light.

It is very easy to style with and the different heats are well modulated...so the warm works well.Thanks to the other reviewers for helping me find this dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusably hot","review":"This hairdryer has 2 heat settings: (1) Too Hot, and (2) a setting I can only describe as Unsuitable For Hair But Handy For Paint Removal. If you want a good thumb workout, you can flash the cold shot button on an off in a vain attempt to prevent this thing from vaporizing the hair right off your head. Mainly my hair ends up hot and still wet, or frizzy from overheating.I threw the packaging away before I realized how awful it is, so I'm stuck with it. I am incredibly cheap, and yet my intention is to get rid of it and buy a new one next time I'm at Target. I hesitate to even give this thing to Goodwill, but maybe I'll do that instead of throwing it out. I'll be sure to attach a note saying \\"not for use on human hair\\", just to preserve my karma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dryer","review":"My wife and I use this dryer daily with great results. It's powerful yet lightweight and comfortable to hold. I highly recommend this dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dryer!","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this hair dryer. Its very light and it drys my hair in like 5 min. I bought a $300.00 ion dryer and i have to say I like this Revlon dryer better. I read the reviews and i decided to try it. I have to admit, maybe because i read so many reviews that stated that they keep shutting the dryer off because of the location of the on and off button, but i havn't done that once. hasn't been a problem for me at all. i am going to purchase a couple more."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!","review":"I've had this hair dryer for about a year. It started off working perfectly, i was surprised how powerful it was for such an inexpensive hair dryer, but i guess you really do get what you pay for...A few weeks after i started using it it started flickering between the high and the low setting without me touching any buttons. I didn't think much of it, but as time went on it got worse and worse. Now it wont stay on for a minute without flickering to the lower setting, and since no buttons were pushed i have to wait it out for it to come back on high. It takes me 40 minutes to blow dry my hair when it used to take 20. I am in the market for a new blow dryer, but i wont be buying this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned out (smoke! fire!) after less than a year","review":"I purchased this product 8 months ago, and it stopped working properly after three or four months, no longer running at full power. I was thinking about buying a new one because of that, but was holding off because I haven't had it that long. Tonight it started popping and smoking while I was using it, and while I watched, things inside caught fire and more smoke started pouring out if it. I quickly unplugged it and thought I was going to have to use a fire extinguisher to put it out, but fortunately once it was unplugged the smoke and such died down. I will be buying something else to replace it. Having it fail on me so quickly was bad enough, but this kind of fire hazard is a whole new level of bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Dry!","review":"I first read about this hair dryer in a magazine at my beauty salon. It was reviewed side by side with two other hair dryers that were well over $100. I figured it can't be any worse than other hair dryers that you buy at a drugstore, so I gave it a shot. My shoulder length, color-treated hair is very thick and really retains moisture so it can take forever to dry. This hair dryer has cut my dry time in half. I've used it all week and I'm pleased with the results. It is very lightweight and came with both the diffuser and a concentrator attachment which is nice. My only complaint it is very loud. Whoever said it is quiet must have had a hair dryer with a jet engine on it before owning this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Well have only used it once but it is good I guess.

The first one I brought home didn't work at all, so I returned it and got a second one. The second one never worked right, but since I threw my old dryer away as soon as I opened the first one, I TRIED to use it for about a week, before ordering a new one and throwing this one away. The switch to change between high and low speeds is a rocker switch (not a sliding switch) with high on the top, off in the middle and low on the bottom. NEVER did it work. Once used on high, I could turn it off, but not switch to low. After a couple of days, it switched to low, and then never switched back to high again. Junk. I ordered the Conair Pro (the orange one) from Amazon, have been using it for a couple of weeks, and like it SO much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken bottom of it!!!","review":"I really doubt it's a new one or a second-hand thing, the plastic is really delicate to be broken and actually it's broken already! the bottom of of the dryer, where to input the air, it's broken totally and I can't believe why I pay money for this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"after ALOT of research......Love it!","review":"I searched and did ALOT of research before I purchased this hair dryer. There were so many high quality brands at very low prices, but this one stood out. Some of the other brands actually had reviews that said the other dryers \\"caught on fire\\".

However, I noticed the motor making a funny sound, first just on \\"high\\", but now on all speeds and temperatures, and it's not getting hot any more. I came here to buy another one, so I looked up my previous order, and it was only January 2011. Hair dryers shouldn't die that quickly. So thankfully I had the old Conair in another bathroom, and will use that until I figure out what to get next. I'd love to recommend it, but I consider a one-year failure rate too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps your hair healthy","review":"I love this blow dryer!!

The result, however, is a detailed acount of some of the important events of the Second World War. As is often the case, individual magazine articles are very focused on specific subjects. Stand-alone essays are independent of the need to insert unnecessary verbiage and superfluous transition paragraphs to introduce other chapters. The WORLD WAR II READER is no exception. In book form this work is like a fine cable television special without commercial interruption. This volume contains 24 well researched and well written articles about World War Two in the European and Pacific theaters of war. As a beginner or long time military history enthusiast, this book is certainly something that should find its way into your personal library."},{"rating":"1","title":"318 Love:","review":"Although I'm from the same area as this group, I was very disappointed with the overall album.

For students wishing to go beyond the basic Taijiquan form, and learn more advanced levels and techniques of qi flow, the different types of jin, and how to generate them, this book is indispensable. One caveat : as its title suggests, this book is for more advanced students, and assumes that the reader has a foundation in Taijiquan, at least the basics of the form and some basic qigong."},{"rating":"2","title":"re: tai chi theory and martial power","review":"excellent guide for the beginner and beyond. background information and detailed descriptions and photos for internal energy work and tai chi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor book","review":"Even though this book looks like an advanced Tai Chi book in reality it tells you about nothing. Nothing about the back spine management on how to generate energy while you are pushing (or whatever you are doing in tai chi work). There is something on accumulating energy in the position that's absolutely not useful. Even the younger beginner understands the back leg needs to work like a spring without buying this \\"advanced\\" book. But the question is not on how the back leg should work, what it is exspected from a book like this is to get tips and training methods on the \\"back spine and waist /hips work\\" that's the real point on generating martial power in Tai Chi and Internal Martial Art. The level of this book is so lower that is absolutely not comparable with other Dr Yang's books I've read and reviewed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This work obfuscates the true essence of taichi.","review":"The author purportedly wanted to explore the martial applications of tai chi chuan; however, his understanding of the subject matter appears to be inadequate. In the most crucial areas, his explanations are often obscure, and worse, incorrect. This is a good book if you want to pick up some rudimentary ideas about the vocabulary of higher levels of tai chi, but it does not get to the true essence of the well guarded secrets of tai chi as a powerful martial art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Music Expected","review":"Before you purchase, if there is an option to listen to the music, PLEASE do so. I didn't follow my own advice and now have an album that I'll probably never listen to again. This \\"I'm Gonna Miss You\\" is not the popular version being played on the oldies segments of the radio stations. I purchased it just for that reason. The rest of the album does not make up for the one bad song. Sound quality is okay, but not worth the purchase.

If you don't know, Melinda and Melinda tells two stories, one comic and one tragic, about the same woman, Melinda. Like the contrasting of the comedic and dramatic stories in the movie, this soundtrack sets the tone with a contrast of jazz and classical, from Duke Ellington to Stravinsky. Overall, this contrasting mix of jazz and classical sets the tone for what appears to be a great movie (I've not seen it yet, it's not playing where I live). I particularly enjoy the swingin' jazz that's used in this soundtrack. It's of the style of the 1920s, and reminded me of the excellent soundtrack to one of my favorite movies (not Woody Allen), The Cat's Meow.This soundtrack (along with The Cat's Meow soundtrack I just mentioned) is great mood music for the long ride home from work, like I learned last night on my way home. I wholeheartedly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This CD is a great way to relax and hear the sounds of the Islands. I suggest checking out some of the songs before you buy it though because some people prefer old reggae and some prefer new reggae. Being a fan of all kinds, I really enjoyed listening to this CD.

It turned out to be one of the greatest books I've ever read. I cried lots, which I rarely do when reading books. It made me think a lot about how I treat people- I'm one of the rich, spoiled kids who would be a Soc if they were still around today, and I don't think I've always been incredibly kind to gang members and kids who aren't as incredibly lucky as I am.

I am 13. We read The Outsiders as one of our books this year for Seventh Grade.

I really liked how readers got the opportunity to step into Ponyboy Curtis' shoes and see what he thinks about all of the events that happen to him and his pal Johnny.I have a warning for readers: Do not watch the movie before reading the book, it has different parts to it than the book. Read the book then watch the movie, you will like the movie just as well as the book.I have to give S.E. Hinton her props on this because she was only 16 when she wrote it.

The socs are always there to bring a knife to their necks, and will. He and his buddy, Johnny cake, are sleeping in the park, when a bunch of socs come to get them. And just for self defense, Johnny kills one of them. Then they are on the run.I am not going to tell anymore, that would take away the fun of reading it.

I was forced to read it in my English class and I hope I never have to again. S.E. Hinton does a quite shabby job of portraying the boys in this novel, whose abominable grammar is irritating and difficult to understand. The plot is ridiculous and the dialogue is poor; I found myself laughing in the most serious parts of the book. The characters are interminably dumb, and their actions are equally foolish. Hinton adds an obnoxious air of melodrama and sappiness to the story in so many parts. Ponyboy's inept attempts to be poetic and deep annoyed me especially.

I oringinally thought it was a book about baseball, because the name was similar to the outfielders, and i didn't want to read it. But soon i picked it up, and i surely thank my father for reccomending me the best book ever!It is a story about Ponyboy and his friends-Soda Pop, Darry, Jonny, Dally, Steve, and Two Bit-they are the greasers. The greasers are a group of people who wear a lot of grease in their hair and don't have very much money to buy clothes, so they are placed at the bottom.The Socs, who are rich compared to the greasers are known for jumping the greasers-this is where the story starts. It is a wonderful story of truth, belonging, friendship, and hope. The characters make you feel for them-you angry, sad, adn all the other feelings they feel.Please, pick this book up and read it. You won't regret it.Love the #1 fan Ashly"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is an awsome book, its my favorite.

I liked the way the things happened, not too ridiculous, but like the everyday life of a greaser. It touched me. She saw clearly the bitterness of life and the way a 14 year old sees things, not understanding that Darry actually cared, but was too worried. She weaved all these things into a fascinating story. I liked the names 'Ponyboy' and 'sodapop' too. They added a special touch to the book. The names were unique and there was this aura spun around the names that set them aside in a nice and funny sorta way. Everything about the book had a deep sense of reality in it.

I read it to my kid sister for a lesson on what it was really like to have a hard life.

I first learned of the story from its the movie version. I remember reading the book for the first time sometime in the summer between my eight grade and freshman year in high school.I found myself relating to some of the issues that Pony Boy is faced with. I find the story to be an accurate description of a young man's struggles in a society where his is not given a fair chance to succeed. I appreciate the way that Hinton incorporates Pony Boy's rough and tough exterior with his inner appreciation of beauty. I suggest it as a must read book for any teen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good book for Teens","review":"I read this book, I must say I don't enjoy reading much, but this book kept me reading it.

I had to read this for my Language Arts class. The whole eighth grade had to. Well, the book was, well, extremely interesting. It really hit home for some of the us. When we got to english class, and my teacher, Mr. Richards, would pass out the books, everybody would be itching to read this book. Mr. Richards said, \\"If there is a book that you just can't wait to finish, unlike most district required novels, it definitely is good literature and writing.\\" He also told us that S.E.

It is full of suspense and action. There is never a moment when the book is boring. It tells of a boy by the name of Ponyboy who belongs to a gang along with his brothers Darry and SodaPop. It is a story of groups of teens going against each other basically because of what financial class they are in. The two groups this book relates to are the \\"Greasers\\" and the \\"Socs\\". The greasers being the \\"lower\\" class and the Socs being the higher. If you haven't read this book I highly recommend it.

It is a exciting adventure as Ponyboy and the Greasers, deal out their daily problems. This book would have to be one of my favorite's. One minute it is sad and the next they are getting into fights. The Greasers are a group of poor kids who's parents let them get into all sorts of trouble. They rob banks and gas stations for fun. The Socs are an group of rich or wealthy people. They beat up people for fun. They have a little better education too. The Greasers and Socs hate each other. But in the book they see the differences and feelings between one another. S.E. Hinton couldn't have wrote this book any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Outsiders","review":"THE OUTSIDERS The Outsiders was a great book from beginning to the end.

I was appalled by the violence and my fourth grade self could not grasp the themes and the importance. Then later this book was assigned for me for the 9th grade and when I read it for the second time, I was surprised to find myself enjoying it. It turned out not to be the book itself, which was very well written, but I was just not ready for it when I first read it. I'd say make sure your son or daughter (yes, this book is for either gender) is at least in the 7th grade (6th if they are mature) before letting them read this book. The Outsiders do have some very important themes that are important for young people to learn before they get to far in highschool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for teens by a teen","review":"This is my favorite novel.

Huh."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I had to read this book for my english class. It is my least favorite book out of every book I have ever read. We had to answer these questions, which were like, \\"Are you surprised that a high schooler wrote this?\\" Well, NO! The writing is immature, an adult with higher education has far superior text. This book is pointless, stupid, and violent, and I see no benefit in reading it. Maybe they want us to not join a gang or you'll end up a smoking 14-year-old wanted for murder in the hospital. Or maybe it's just don't grease your hair. Honestly, who would write a book about greasers and rich kids? Not all kids then belonged to one of those groups! There is no plot. It's a \\"boy book.\\" if it is anything, and girls would never read it by choice. A girl wrote it because a boy who experienced this wouldn't bother. I suggest you not bother to read this either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Read","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I was forced to read it in my English class and I hope I never have to again. S.E. Hinton does a quite shabby job of portraying the boys in this novel, whose abominable grammar is irritating and difficult to understand. The plot is ridiculous and the dialogue is poor; I found myself laughing in the most serious parts of the book. The characters are interminably dumb, and their actions are equally foolish. Hinton adds an obnoxious air of melodrama and sappiness to the story in so many parts, namely the one where Dally \\"kills himself\\". Ponyboy's inept attempts to be poetic and deep annoyed me especially. The characters also set horrible examples for today's youth with their inexcusable and absurd behavior. I advise you all not to read this book unless you are prepared to undergo extreme boredness for a good laugh at mediocre writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly the Stupidest book I have ever read!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is your average typical teenage book that is so absurd and hard to believe that even if you used your imagination to it's limit, you can't even think about what the characters did as human or possible.

When I was heartlessly forced to read it in school (funny that, school, you'd think that in school they wouldn't want you to read books that glorify gangsters), many other kids enjoyed it. I HATED it. Perhaps this is because I felt to childish for my tastes. Everybody had a lame nickname, the writing was without merit of any kind, the entire book reaked of kiddieness.

I was always wondering what was going to happen next. The two gangs continuously brawling and one time someone got killed. This was a very suspenseful book because I never could predict what was going to happen next. The book was short, but long enough to get all the details in, like the character, and a detailed description of what was going on at every moment. And the book was very easy to read. Even though I cant relate to any of the characters in the book, I can imagine what it would be like to be in a gang. Being in a gang would be very hard because you are expected to do a lot, like get into a fight if someone makes fun of you. And if you don't then you let the whole gang down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book that illustrates the hardships of life in a gang.","review":"This book was full of action and made you want to read it until the end.

After i read this book (i was 12, now i am 14), reading became one of my habits. The fact that the author was only 16 when she wrote it, also caught my attention. This book is about a 14 year old named Ponyboy Curtis (the names were a little weird at first but despite that its a good book), who lives with his brothers Sodapop, and Darry. They are all in a gang with more members (Steve, Johnny, Two-Bit, and Dallas) They are called greasers. They don't live on the rich side of the towm. The people that do are called the Socs.

It may give a look into what your parents had done in the past, but for a modern day teenager, leather jackets and tons of grease are no more than a mere figment of their imaginations to see in real life.Quite similar to the themes in Go Ask Alice, where drugs and friends make all the difference in the world. Not an especially thourough deep look into each character's well being and thoughts, but emotions are well played out.

The book tells about how gang life can be and the effects of death on someone.The story is also about ponyboy and his brother darrel who fight alot.

Another reason I recommend this book is because it deals with friendships and my friends and I have always enjoyed books that involve friendships.Ror example when Ponyboy and JJohnny ran away together because one of them was in trouble.

The Socs,(also called the Socials) are the higher class of boys in the city. They bully and beat-up the greasers just because they are poorer than they are. I enjoyed this book due to the characters, how they act, and how humorous they are. My favorite characters are Darry and Ponyboy. I like Darry because he is smart and strong.

She also does a good job of explaining, in rich detail, how Ponyboy goes through his troubles.In which they all begin when a small fight begins, and Johnny saves Ponyboy's life by taking another.

In the movie things were left out that were in the book, but it wasn't important. What I liked about The Outsiders was that the guys were so tight. I mean in the movie and the book I could see how close they were. It was like they were related to each other.In life, now-a-days, we can relate to the story, The Outsiders. Teens have lots of problems just because of the fact about groups. What happened in the movie and the book is what is happening now between us teens.

In todays society with all the broken families, the subject rings true; there are many more kids out there raising each other than one might suspect. Even a child of a single parent will also be drawn into this book. If you get it on the Kindle edition, you might want to go through it first and highlight the slang words -- then make notes for your kids- who might not know what a \\"heater\\" is. The built in dictionary will not help with the slang. My son read this book in about two weeks, which for him is really really good. It is hard to get him to read anything longer than a magazine article. We bought the Kindle edition, and he was hooked within a few \\"pages\\".There are some unsettling topics covered, but it was not a drawback; it actually helped spark discussion about what makes a family, and why some older siblings might choose to raise their younger siblings if they felt it was necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"My class just finished reading this book the other day, and I loved it!

Back then, they were considered a gang, although nowadays, the concept is laughable. Anyway, this so-called \\"gang\\" is known as the greasers. They wore leather jackets and had greasy hair. This went back to the Happy Days years. There is also another \\"gang\\" called the socs, and they are rivals. The problem is, one day one of the greasers killed one of the socs. This book tells all about all the non-adventures of the greasers. Personally, it sucked big time, but notice how all the adults in this school seemed to like it. Probably because they were alive when people like this existed. So I suppose I should recommend it to all the adults alive in the 50s. This book wasn't up to my standards, seeing how there was extremely annoying characters and promotes smoking and beating people up. Not acceptable for flourishing young minds, but maybe for adults.

Its about these boys trying to make the best out of there lives and ya they get into some trouble, but in the end they come out heroes. I thought it was a good book because its real life. This book just shows the truth about life and how kids live it. Yes I have to agree that we don't alway live it the safe way, but it sure is the truth about how kids treat other kids on the way they look or dress and not on how nice and sweet they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugggg","review":"i hated this book. it was horrible. i had to read it for school and i was disgusted. sure it is suspenseful but it was horrible. you might have thought oh, whats gonna happen next?!?! but did you really care???? i kno i didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, undeveloped characters","review":"I read this book back in the 1970's when I was in 7th grade. It was an assigned book. It was a terrible read and I found the violence to be in the book because it was needed to advance the characters. Good books should be lead by great characters. Violence, or any action should only be in the book if it's character lead - not the other way around. No wonder this author got a D+ in English! This book, and movie only survive because teachers have been taught that they must teach this book.While the \\"idea\\" of this book is interesting, exploring class warfare through the eyes of teenagers, the book itself is not worth reading. Hopefully the educational system will catch on and stop making kids read this horrid book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like it.","review":"My favorte character in the book was Ponyboy because he had a chance in the future. My favorte part was when Ponyboy decided to save kids out of a fire. This showed great change in him. I did not learn a lesson in this book. It was basicly a copy off of WEST SIDE STORY AND ROMEO AND JULET. So if i am telling you if you are think of reading this DONT. Read ROMEO AND JULET which is a clasic story not a recopy. They are the same because there are two rival room. If you still want to read the story watch the movie instead. There the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved this book because there was so much action it kept me turning the pages.

They hide away in a church with the help of Dally. When the church catches on fire they go in and try to save some kids Ponyboy gets out but Johnny breaks his back.When they get back Ponyboy makes up with his brother.

I will now be giving it to my teenage granddaughter who, I know, will be just as fascinated and impacted by this honest, gritty and descriptive book as her parents (and grandparents) were when they were her age. I can't wait to see her reaction when she receives it (in a few weeks) and actually READS IT! It's a classic she'll never forget. I never have...and neither have either of my (grown) children. S.E. Hinton is a wonderful writer and I plan on giving both my grandchildren ALL of her wonderful, descriptive books...in which the emotional life of teenagers and young adults is so sensitively and honestly depicted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too shallow in the detail section","review":"I guess I didn't think this book was so great. It is told from an interesting point of view, but the plot development was too shallow. The beggining is better than the end because there is more description and detail at the beggining.

I watched the movie before reading the book. The frist time I read it it was in my exploratory class. I thought the book was interesting for a kid my age. I would have to say 2-Bit was my favorite character because of his jokes. Tim Shepered is the one I hate most because of his attitude. I think I would rate this book a B+ for childrens books.I think the book had a realistic story to it.

Usually I hate reading. It bores me, but for some reson I can't put this book down. These characters are great. Ponyboy is my favorite! He seems like he is really nice, and he really cares. Unlike Dally who you think might not care as much, but really does. This book was outstanding, its on the top of my list. I have never read anything like it. My favorite character besides Ponyboy must be Sodapop. He is just so great, he is always there and careing. He is also always trying to help Ponyboy in anyway that is possible. Soda really looks out for Ponyboy and I think that is great to have someone like that. Who is always helping you and asking whats wrong when you seem down, and just loving him more then anything and showing that he actually cares. And once again this book is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A STORY WRITTEN FOR ALL AGES","review":"The Outsiders is a story written by S. E. Hinton for all ages.

The gang and all of the Greasers, how the boys living in the same area as Pony are called, have a lot of problems with Socs, the rich boys. Because of one incident with some Socs, life changes completely for our characters, and since that moment, he has to decide staying there and do not do anything, or keep moving. Definitely, a very good story with a lesson to take and a message to get for all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"The outsiders review","review":"This book is ok it has kind of wild out of this world names like ponyboy and sodapop. If you like gang fights and fighting themes this is the book for you. Its only a couple bucks so buy it and read it for yourself. I'm not a book person but this is a good book.

I felt like a couple times they would throw in a new word and not really explain it but most of the time the repetition was done nicely. I took french in high school and college and I didn't learn the pronunciation the right way in a lot of the words.

I had listened to an old series of cassette tapes I really liked and hoped this would be as good - it isn't. What you get here (and in all the other methods I've tried recently) is lessons in how to TRANSLATE from English - which is not at all what I want to do. I want to SPEAK FRENCH. Switching back and forth between English and French and English and French makes my head hurt.

After 8 hours of (granted, well-articulated) repetition, you will have the phrases down pat, but it's an awful lot of time spent to only be equipped with enough phrases to get some mythical French woman to go out with you...and then have nothing further to say to her.

However there is no written transcripts for you to verify the spellings or the subtleties of pronunciation, and very often the tense changes with a minor twist in pronunciation, which our non french ears may not be able to decipher. Considering the high cost of the package the company should have included the transcripts, maybe in a soft form.The other thing is that grammar is not really explained during the course. Its more rote learning. I would strongly recommend the 10 CD Michel Thomas method along with the Advanced course. Not only are the transcripts there, but the tenses and grammar are explained very well, as well as its far cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and fun","review":"I have enjoyed the Pimsleur method. The way it builds slowly, from individual words to sentences to whole conversations, makes the process quite user friendly. Even though they recommend that you don't try to read or look up the words until you get to a higher level, I found occasionally that looking up the word just to see what it looked like made it easier to remember. All in all, I've truly enjoyed this series and feel quite prepared for my upcoming trip to France."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice way to learn the basics of French","review":"This is the second pimsleur product that I have purchased. I also purchased Pimsleur Spanish. Like the Pimsleur Spanish course, this is a good way to learn the basics of a language, especially if you are planning to travel and would like a course that will prepare you with words and phrases that a traveler would find helpful. The teaching pace is rather slow but you will truly learn the material that is covered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pimsleur - French Conversational - oui, oui!","review":"So far so good, have just gotten through 2 discs, but I love it! Easy to understand and follow. Nice mix of explanation (in English), and french speaking, with just enough time for you to speak after the example. Time will tell, when I finish all the lessons, how good the entire package is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat repeat repeat ad nauseum","review":"I was really disapointed with this set of CDs having read that Pimsleur was the best way to learn French. It's so repetitive and after 30 minutes I jumped ahead to the final CD to see if progress was ever going to be made. Admittedly by the final CD you have learnt a little French, but at what price, hour after hour of boring reptitive lessons. I've also bought the Michel Thomas series, which I find much more enjoyable. In that series you feel part of the class and that you are moving along quickly and I look forward to making time for the lessons.I wouldn't recommend this one. I'd suggest using Michel Thomas instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got to be an easier way?","review":"I followed the instructions and made my way through the 8 cds.

In the future, I will make every effort to direct my business towards other online merchants who deliver the merchandise they promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"saved the party !!!","review":"i ordered these cd,s for an annual party that i have had every year for 9 years and this box set was a lot more than i bargained for,these cd,s were the hit of the party,everyone danced and boogied all nite long ! thank you amazon.com !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the ballerina","review":"My 2.5 year old plays with this daily. She loves to create different outfits for the ballerina. The quality is great - just like other Melissa & Doug products.

Lots of fun changing their outfits, and easy to do. The only downfall is that there is no lid or top to put on when done so pieces can easily fall out and get lost. I wish I had known that before I purchased. I do love the little stand that help the dolls stand up making it more fun to play with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful toy!","review":"I recieved this puzzle much quicker than I thought I would and am very pleased with the toy. I know that my daughter will love playing with this. My daughters love paper dolls so much but they rip and do not stay together to play with without tape. This puzzle has very strong magnets and very large durable, toddler able pieces to hold and play with. I love how the figures are healthy looking and the clothing they wear cover them selves. I also love that the packaging offers other ways for parents to play with the toys with their children to help the child learn while playing. And so many of the idea's go along with what my oldest is learning in preschool! Wonderful product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"This gift was sent as a birthday present.

I actually bought it too and looove it, as for the Melissa & Doug one, I have to find another box to put all the pieces together... not very smart.With kids, you want to keep things organized and mess-free as much as posible, so GO with the Target brand, it is just as good quality, better design and cheaper!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan-tas-tic!!!","review":"We got this for our not-quite-three-year old daughter last week.

Amazon shipped an item which was labelled as \\"Baroness\\" but was in fact a different pattern. I didn't blame Amazon for the initial problem because the box indicated that it was \\"Baroness\\". The return though proved difficult. Amazon charged me a \\"restocking\\" fee but ultimately rescinded that charge when I complained.Royal Doulton declared bankruptcy so you can get much better prices at both the Royal Doulton Outlet Stores or at the company web site. I want to add that I love this product and own service for 14. This is fine bone china and makes a tremendous presentation and I recommend it without reservation.

This morning I realized that I had not tried the lens without this filter, I removed it and BINGO!! the lens is living up to its price! Like I said, I always use UV filters for protection on my lenses but from now on I'll buy a premium grade filter, not an inexpensive one!

It does not even come close to the album \\"river runs Red\\".

Jeremy Keller is lost in his life, clueless enough to be pitied, but not so dumb that we lose interest in the mysterious turns his life has taken. Stein writes briskly and subtly; when the readers begin to accept all the absurdities in \\"Lost\\" as real life they gain another laugh at themselves. It's like getting your sleeve caught in some stranger's briefcase and being hopelessly dragged all over Manhattan, through his odd days and odder nights. Enjoy the trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating for people interested in sign painting","review":"This is fun, has lots of drawings. Some of the paint chemistry info in it is probably too old to be true, but some of it still holds. The basic info on sign lettering is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved these characters!!!!!!!","review":"This book was one of the best western's I have ever read. In fact it may just be the best. I am not a fan of western's in general but I fell in love with both the hero and heroine as well as all of the supporting characters. I hope there is a story either out there for Sebastion or being worked on for him. I fell in love with him. Of course I wouldn't mind one about Owen, Brandon, Mathew, and all the rest of the h and h's brother's. The story was a very fast paced and sweet romance that keeps you holding on till the end. I loved the spunky attitude that was displayed by Leanne and I might have drooled a little over Hunter's protective, manliness.If there was one bad thing I had to say about the book it would be that the ending was just a tad bit too mushy and long for my taste. I think it could have ended much less cheesy and been just as good. Overall it is a must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stolen Ecstasy","review":"I recommended to anyone who hasn't read Hannah Howell work.

I checked out the nice layout and supplementary images in the sample online. When I got the book, I opened it up to see unattractive font with absolutely no layout and no beautiful images. This book advertised images, which-for a book on interior design- are kind of important for demonstrating the point the author is trying to make. I imagined, based on the description and online sample, that it would be something of a textbook. Instead I got a kinko's self-print. Thanks so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Bad\\" Ibsen","review":"A genuinely wonderful comedy, not a bit dated, & a wiser way into Ibsen than any of the later & generally rated greater problem plays. Peer is immensely charming, if reckless & stupid from time to time. He learns, some, with special assistance from Mom & a perhaps incredibly grand sweetheart. Christopher Fry's translation (Oxford) seems particularly nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good play, terrible edition","review":"The play is fine.This printing of it, however, is absolutely terrible. Do not waste your money on it. I don't care how much cheaper it is than any of the others. This is completely unreadable. It appears to have been scanned from an 1908 edition of Peer Gynt. They OCR'ed it (Quite poorly I might add), then they print it on demand.There are no stage directions. There is almost no punctuation in sentences (no commas, etc). There are numerous misspellings. It is nearly impossible to tell who is speaking as the names are misspelled, sometimes in all caps, sometimes not, sometimes indented. The Act and Scene divisions are almost nonexistent.I read about 5 pages of it before I gave up and got a photocopied version from my teacher. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ibsen's Version","review":"This version of Peer Gynt should be avoided at all costs. It is a copy that was made with robotic page turners and character recognition software that was marginal. The book is full of misspellings and punctuation errors. If you've never read Ibsen's Peer Gynt, this text is very difficult to follow,"},{"rating":"1","title":"order a different version!","review":"I ordered this play to read for a class in school.Not only was this \\"robot generated\\" edition extremely difficult to read due to typos and random formatting inconsistencies, but portions of it were completely missing - for example 2 entire scenes in act 4.I actually need to know what happens, and reading this version, I don't.You get some kind of membership with it that means you can view this play, and other books, online, but if I'd wanted to read the play online, I would have done so with one of the free sites that offers complete verions of texts that are in the public domain.Apparently, the \\"robot\\" technology saves on costs, and if it had cost me 2 or 3 dollars, I may have been more forgiving, but it was not, in my opinion, priced low enough to justify the extremely shabby quality.If you need to read this play, or want to own it (it is a classic, and the story itself is worthwhile), FIND ANOTHER VERSION!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I baught this a couple of months ago, and after playingwell once, it stopped playing completely. Despite repeatedattempts, it would not turn on at all, though its red lightswould come on.I think that if one were to buy an inexpensive electronicitem, it is perhaps better to buy it from a store, this wayit would be easier to take it back to the store, rather thanmailing it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price.","review":"It is still too soon to really tell, as I have had it for only a month. If you are looking for an inexpensive DVD Player that plays store purchased and home burned DVDs this is the only one for you. It has a lot of features that the more expensive DVD Players have. Progressive Scan and 5.1 Channel Audio etc. Awesome picture and excellent sound. It is no bigger than a telephone book. If it lasts a year it would worth the price tag of $ 39.99.

It works maybe 50% of the time. You can sometimes spend 5 minutes opening/closing the tray before it'll accept the disk. It was also recommended as multi-region by some users. Well, it won't play any of my region 2 disks. I've tried all the hacks found online but nothing seems to work. I figure that there's probably a couple of different releases of this unit on the market with different firmware versions, one of which will allow multi-region. I just replaced it with a Philips DVP1013 which worked first time (after inputting the region hack). I will never buy anything from Coby again. I only give it 1 star because Amazon won't let me choose zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage cheapo not worth the money","review":"Sitting here trying to replace this piece of garbage, which was cheap--but started playing DVDs on odd tracks that we hadn't selected--I wonder why I paid as little as I paid.

It plays most (not all) of the CD/DVD types that it claims to, and does a pretty good job with them, with occasional skipping issues...But the remote control is the WORST. You have to press the keys incredibly hard to get them to work at all, and if you're not within three feet of the device you have to press the keys more than once.I would avoid this, unless you already have a programmable remote control. If so, throw away the remote that comes with it and use your own. You'll spare yourself strained fingers and muttered curses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe my Worst Purchase Ever!","review":"I received my DVD player in only three days and was very excited. But when I opened the box I saw that the unit had a large red and gold sticker on the top of it. It was a troubleshooting guide. The only problem was that it was attached to my player with a permanent type glue. I couldn't remove the eyesore, and eventually ended up scratching the unit as I scrubbed away with a sponge and butterknife (fingernails didn't work, by the way.) After about 30 frustrating minutes, I decided that, for $45, I wouldn't even try to send it back to the seller. I just tossed it and went to the store, where I got a nice Sony for $75. This was such a weird, stupid incident - I'll never but Coby again as long as I live.

This should NEVER happen in any publication sold to the public, but especially it shouldn't happen in a TEACHERS' STUDY GUIDE that cost $30!!And finally, the title page promised a bibliography and sources were cited throughout the book.

(It was winter time as well... cold weather and crystals in urine?? Not sure.) Anyhow, some of the puddles on the floor even contained some evidence of blood. We would watch him try to urinate outside and he would just strain. We have had cats with this issue in the past and have spent lots of $$$ at the vet. We thought we'd give this a try. We bought a few cases of Friskies wet cat food and sprinkled the PetAlive product onto his food for a few weeks. It took a little time, but he got better and he went back to using the litter box without a problem. We continued with all canned food until symptoms were gone.

I accidentally stumbled upon this brass polish in a grocery store and decided to try it. It is great for keeping cymbals clean! It is mildly and I mean MILDLY abrasive and will remove the logos after a few cleanings, so I avoid these areas. I have never used it on the smooth brilliant models just the spun models. Whats cool about it as it rinses of with water. If they are extremely tarnished it may take a few cleanings. Some cymbals have a protective clear coating and this polish will eventually remove it. This brass polish got hard to find in local stores so thanks to Amazon I can keep my cymbals looking great.

Poor editing, many mistakes, flopped pictures, wrong information, wrong death dates. These mistakes take away from the written information, but not the pictures. Done in black & white with keen eye of a photojournalist, and probably the last portraits of three who have died this year, Joe Foss, Ray Davis and Mitch Paige. Each full page portrait is done with a different approach, one reading this book will be captivated by each picture of these men, these heroes. This is a collection of the last living Medal of Honor recipients, starting in 2000.

A 16 year old that can make this kind of work is very talented. Her singing is beautiful in it. You can defiently see that she's grown in music when you listen to her new CD, Speak Now. She defiently put a lot of thought into this album when she made it. It's not as good as Speak Now but for her first album it's amazing. I would recommend this too anyone! Boy or girl! Her songs are just so catchy! Guys can't really relate to her songs, but because of how well she puts her songs anyone should be able to enjoy it.Enjoy the CD! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's really good at what she does","review":"Taylor is a good song writer and singer.

Taylor is a talented young woman and will go along way in the music industry if she keeps writing and performing like these 1st & 2nd collections!

If you had to place it in a category,perhaps new country.The album had some fine ballads and soft tempo pop. Picture To Burn,Teardrops On My Guitar,The Outside,Stay Beautiful,Our Song and I'm Only Me When I'm With You highlight this well-crafted soft pop album.Young Taylor Swift has one of the better voices out there and am sure you will agree,if you pick this one up.

She has both slow songs that make you think and fast songs that you want to sing and dance to. I can't wait to see her in concert this summer.

I had never heard of her, or her music but liked the songs they chose for the short show and enjoyed hearing about her (short!) life in music. She writes, sings and plays on her first CD release, and to me, she is more talented and has a better voice than many single female artists out there right now.So I bought the CD and was pleasantly surprised at her writing and singing talents. I believe it is a safe bet that she will be around for quite a while. Great 1st record!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylor Swift is wonderful!","review":"I saw Taylor live a couple of weeks ago and fell in love with her music.

I like her much better than the overhyped Carrie Underwood. While her voice may not be as impressive as Underwood, she does have good songwriting ability. I first heard of her when I heard \\"Tim McGraw\\" on froggy here in Pittsburgh. It was so good and original! I was waiting to hear more from this new talented country artist. Then I heard the 2007 single \\"Teardrops On My Guitar.\\" It was a nice surprsie! I decided to take a listen for the rest of this album. The rest wasn't bad either. If you like the radio singles then there's more to offer besides that. My favorite song is \\"Picture To Burn.\\" I wish she would have won Best New Artist for the Grammy's instead of the overrated Amy Winehouse and I'm sure I'm not the only one! I highly reccomend this to country and non-country fans alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A happy mom","review":"My daughter requested this CD as a gift, and after listening to it with her probably a dozen times, I'm really happy I bought it for her. So many of the country songs my daughter hears on the radio are about drinking or fighting, issues that aren't really very wholesome. However, the lyrics on this CD were written by Taylor, and they speak to the same kinds of issues that my daughter is going through---trying to fit in at school, boys that don't notice you, etc.---and the kind of insecurities that adults can relate to also. The lyrics are great, the tunes catchy, the arrangements simple and good, and Taylor has a sweet voice. On the downside, the bonus materials are not much, and the lyrics are harsher (with mild cuss words) than the version you may have heard on the radio. Still, I'm happy to have my daughter listening to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylor Swift's CE","review":"This CD is very good. Taylor Swift is a great singer, and person.

However, I might not get Fearless because I am a big fan of the jonas brothers, and a lot of of the songs are about joe jonas.She has a great voice. If you are a taylor swift fan, I seriously recommend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... something to listen too... I guess...","review":"There are few if any \\"sterling\\" cuts on this album. Mostly a collection of regional Funk/Soul acts that never made it to the big time. In the end you find out why too as none of these tunes make you wanna shout and shing a ling. As you'd expect, production values range from the passable to the criminal and everything in between.

I would recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Late and small","review":"This was originally due on September 1 and didn't ship until Oct 13, and when it finally did it was digest size as well instead of the usual larger prestige format that special comics like this get. Its a great length for a prestige, but as the digest size it just seems very very small.The presentation is nice however, even with the non-glossy paper. The story ties in well with the film as well as the established history of the characters in Dark Horse's prior titles, and still takes a unique stance on the entire thing as well.Its just too little too late, and too small.

It starts off good, put starts to lag and becomes a mess. The characters are two-dimensional,and the reader feels like they should be killed(I'm on that side).

Exciting, richly textured arrangements performed by Ferguson's exceptionally talented young musicians make this Farguson's' best peformance since 1970's \\"MF Horn\\". Maynard makes greater use of his lyrical skills on fluegelhorn here, especially on the haunting \\"Caruso\\", and tracks include everything from a jazz waltz (\\"Waltz for Nicole\\"), to a bluesy feauture for the wonderful scat singer and baritone saxophonist Denis Diblasio (\\"The Lip\\"). For long time Maynard fans, there are plenty of high notes; for potential new fans, though, this is an album with a nice balance of swingers and slower, romantic pieces. Worth a listen, then, for anyone who's either loved MF for years, or is curious about large group jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good example of late '90's Ferguson and band","review":"Nice arrangements and ensemble playing from Big Bop Noveau in this latest recording.

In very grounded, seemingly common sense language, it tells you how to manipulate people for your own ends rather than treating people fairly and as ends in themselves.

NOT to use or manipulate them as a means to your own selfish end, but rather to genuinely care about their interests, care about them, be a REAL friend, and what you put out will come back to you. The Key here is that your motive needs to be genuine. Carnegie stresses this in the book, which some negative reviewers seem to have glossed over.This is human nature in one of the greatest books ever written in the last century about this topic. The concepts are timeless, and they just might take you more out of self focus, to appreciate others authentically, and then you receive authentic results in return."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many imitators, here's the original","review":"Is this merely a machiavelian handbook for flatterers and manipulators or is it a breakthrough in the science of human relations?

It is based mainly on giving the appearance of being interested in others, solely in order to use them to attain some personal goal. There is some valuable advice (for example, how one gains nothing from contradicting others), but the general tone is completely self-centered.I suppose my many years in purchasing management flavour my assessment here, because the techniques Dale Carnegie recommends still are widely used in sales (though long-term customers are seldom deceived, it is an understood game). This book may be useful to those who have only business gain in mind. However, its total emphasis on furthering one's own interests, and basically insincere approach, rules out any value for those who have true friendship in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philosophically Great!","review":"Teaches how to live and treat others in order to make you a more understanding person which will improve and better your progress in life.

I have been following the techniques described in the book for about a year now, and it has worked for me tremendously, especially at work socializing with co-workers.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their communcation with people."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to win friends and influence people","review":"Great book reinforces and reminds us how to treat people and at the same time improves upon our lives. Dale was a visionary. It is a quick read with every chapter having pertinant information. I did not slow down like I do with so many other narcissistic self help books just trying to make a buck without providing any real value."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible edit job","review":"the book is worth reading but dont buy this kindle version. the formatting is horrible. Some sentances make absolutely no sense. Words are spelled correctly, they are just the wrong words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many anecdotes","review":"I purchased this book after reading several online praises for it. Unfortunately once I started reading through \\"How to Win Friends\\" I noticed a similar trend to each chapter: tell a bunch of random stories relating to the point, then summarize with a quaint principle or rule, such as \\"Be a good listener\\" or \\"Smile\\". While I do think Carnegie's principles are useful, too much of the text is spent reiterating the point through what I found to be very boring historical examples. This book could easily be condensed from 250 pages down to 25 while still maintaining its effectiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content is great - the print is horrible","review":"Content is great - the print is horrible!Small print, dark pages that woul not completely open. Did not read this edition - waste of $$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book turns you into a self righteous know it all.","review":"The book is told from a perspective that always believes that self is right. Sure it's got some truthful points, but it's all told from a perspective that treats all exterior forces as being in the wrong. This writer has no humility, and I'm afraid that anyone who reads this book will believe that the world is at fault, that self is always right, and that you have to be sly and manipulative in order to overcome the obstacles of all the dumb people out there. The truth is that everyone has a story, and at the root of that story is a non-malicious person. We all make decisions along the way that take us farther from our initial innocence, the book prescribes a \\"glass half empty\\" mentality when it comes to treating our fellow human. This book would almost be good if it weren't told from the perspective of self-righteous know-it-all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I took the course, it doesn't work","review":"As with the Dale Carnegie Course itself, lots of BS in my opinion.Heavens forbid we dare to criticize anyone or give an opinion that may be in opposition to another. Being human means there is black, white and many shades in between. We can agree to disagree, can't we?I took the stupid course and felt like a cheerleader, having to give applause after each speech. Could not give criticism......the course promised to change people, it doesn't. It is dillusional, it is brainwashing....much like the 12 step programs, it is cultish.I am sick of this stupid politically correct society and things that support it. This book is one of them. Keep it and all of the other foolish books that try to change you.Be yourself and enjoy being an individual. To hell with Dale Carnegie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unavailability","review":"Why the heck is this book \\"Not Currently Available\\" on Kindle version. This has been the second book I have wanted so far that has not been available in kindle version. Thought the point of me buying a kindle was so that I don't have to buy hard books and have them all stored in my Kindle. This is irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"This product was shipped on time and as requested. The product was in good order.I throughly enjoyed listening to the audio book. I had read the book, but wanted something to keep in my IPOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"old news","review":"really old news,,,to make a friend be a friend....huh? well its a basic, basic book on the Golden Rule treat others the way u want to be treated, only that basic message is flawed. Guy buys wife big screen TV, she will hate it, Wife buys man Make Up ? this misses most of the relationship issues, Men clean the house and garage and yard. Wife will love u for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book is very small","review":"must admit I was disappointed that the book is very small and the paper quality very low, I should have expected this because of the low price but I couldn't tell the paper print from the picture of it.

He then uses examples from famous people like Lincoln, Socrates, Napoleon, and Theodore Roosevelt as well as from ordinary folks who shared their experiences in his classes.Overall, a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for LIFE 101. Practice the principles and you will see your communication skills greatly improved.","review":"The funny thing is that I thought I had read this book years ago when I first started in sales; however, reading it now made me realize while I practice much of its common sense advice, I still found it refreshing as you can never focus too much on bettering your communications with others professionally or personally. I had not expected the actual fun of reading it. Besides being a foundational book for anyone who communicates with people (yes, that pretty much includes everyone!), it is also offers a glimpse into American History as Dale Carnegie utilizes politicians, businessmen and historical figures most relevant to his era to illustrate stories of effective and in some cases ineffective communications and their outcomes. I consider this book to be required reading for life. It is a classic for a reason. Read it, give it as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First and Best Relationship and Communication Book You Should Read","review":"The most essential skill to success is mastering the art of relationships. This classic book shows you how to create genuine relationships with people so that you may take power and responsibility of your life. Anyone who wants to succeed with people must master the strategies and techniques within this book.This is the first book of its kind. It's wise to learn from the original source that everyone else is just rewriting and regurgitating."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE AND READ BOOK FOR EVERY HUMAN IN THIS PLANET!!!!","review":"Life changing book, it makes you a better human being, makes you see the light at the end of the tunnel, life is before and after this book!!!You should have it, read it, copy and memorize it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!","review":"LOVE IT!! If you seriously go back to this thing every now and then of course, it will make a difference, because you'll be more cognizant of the wants and needs of others a little bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knowledge for life","review":"This is such a great book. It is an easy reader with great examples and stories. Dale Carnegie is truly talented. I have read this book over and over because each time you get something out of it.

The book on tape version is even better: listen to it over and over again for the techniques to sink in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enduring Lessons","review":"Timeless and important lessons on how to interact with others and yourself to be at peace and get results.

It's very good information. The trick is to apply it - especially with people you can't stand. It's up to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Can Help Almost Anyone","review":"I have always been taught to express my opinions, speak my mind and stand up for what I think is right. However, there is a right way and a wrong way to do things and the wrong way won't really get you very far. This book outlines what should be obvious to intelligent people but for the most part is not. Mainly this is how to modify your behavior in such a way as to breed \\"good will\\" from others - whether in the short term to get them to see your point of view and agree with you, or the long term and make friends and allies out of them. The advice is simple and makes sense. Although written in a bit of an outdated style, the author fills the text with examples of how the strategies could work. I did find it a bit too rosy and simplistic sometimes, but the basic lessons ring true. I have already instituted some of the advise and of course it works. I would give this to a kid who was having trouble getting along with the other kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Win Friends and Influence People: Dale Carnegie","review":"Here is a book that every person that has ever had trouble communicating, lacked confidence, low self-esteem, or just plain did not know how to start or participate in a conversation.I read this book as a young man of 18 years old entering the workforce as salesman. Before reading this book I could only have been described as shy and possessing no real people skills. This book changed my understanding of how to relate to people on a whole new level and allowed me to develop a communication skill that has stayed with me thru the years.This book will help you to discover how to avoid arguments, win new friends, meet and engage people of every type with absolute confidence, and how to carry on a conversation that will keep them interested, as well as how to influence others in a positive way.I highly recommend this book."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function R(o,e,n,u,r,s){const g=m("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,c)=>(a(),b(g,{key:c,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):p("",!0)])}const x=d(O,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-f44fa3f0"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/55.md","filePath":"drive/55.md"}'),W={name:"drive/55.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
