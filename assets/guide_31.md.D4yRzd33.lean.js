This movie was so disappointing, didn't even come close to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read - exciting and informative","review":"This book is very interesting because it provides insight into an area of the criminal justice system that is not as well known: the prosecution of crimes. The real life stories told by the author (a former prosecutor in the violent area of Bronx, NY) about child abuse, sex crimes, and homicide are gripping, and are equal parts horrifying and fascinating. They show that the reality of what many attorneys do is not glamorous, and that working in this job can be depressing. Each account will make you feel so sorry for the victims of these vicious crimes, but proud of the work that prosecutors and police are doing to fight for the rights of every person.If you enjoy true crime stories and are interested on a fresh take on the investigation/trial process, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious,boring and lots and lots of reiterating","review":"I expected a lot more detailed stories,but got so bored after several chapters.Sadly ,this is one book I raced through ,skipped & skipped ,hoping for juicier things to come.Alas it never happened and I gave up.One of the few books I deleted without going to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh. It was okay. A bit too dramatic and emotional.","review":"Not the best. This lady is pretty typical of female prosecutors (I was a prosecutor, I know) in that she absorbs everything emotionally and believes that every person who walks into the courtroom as a defendant should be exterminated immediately lest they breed. Seriously, I was worn out just reading about her day. The amount of baggage she carried around during her time spent as an ADA was just incredible.Anyway, if you want to prosecute then this might be an interesting read. It does go into some of the standard operating procedures of many decent sized offices. However, let me assure you that there is much more humor in this job than this lady experienced. Sure, we all take our jobs seriously - but the old adage about laughing and not crying applies to law enforcement work in general. This lady was just not cut out for the work. I'd guess her workmates were happy to see her go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"I really enjoyed the book and found it to be an honest account of a difficult job.

While I agree with the other reviewer that most of the actual projects shown are not fitting with my taste, the ideas and techniques presented have proven helpful to me. I also found myself wishing that the cover art was included in the how-to projects (which it is not). My only other criticism is that darting is not covered, but great examples of it are, so the reader never gets the explanation of how such forms are achieved.Overall, this is one of the best technique books I've come across. I would recommend it, especially for the hobby or beginning potter. If you have a formal education in the ceramic arts you will know most of these tips already and find the suggested projects lacking in sophistication.

In spite of the terrible odor, we played tug with him and that was okay. Later we decided to let him chew it. In very little time, he had little pieces chewed off, so we took the toy away from him. Not long after that our puppy vomited. And since we are not as smart as our Rat Terrier, we played tug with him again the next day, and again let him chew it. And again our poor little puppy threw up. I would stay clear of this toy!!!! For your dog's sake. It is not a chew toy, and what dog doesn't chew!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made dog sick","review":"As I sit here with my exhausted dog on my lap, I must say that this is a dangerous toy. He's exhausted because he's been throwing up all day after ingesting a tiny piece of the tire that he chewed off in under 5 minutes. Of course I took the toy away right away, but he's been throwing up every few minutes since then. This dog is tiny with a very weak bite, cannot imagine what kind of a chunk a larger dog would be able to bite off and swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dog toy","review":"I bought a handful of toys for my dog, figuring he'd like at least one.This was one of them, and the only one that's still left. He loves chewing on it, and it's easy to play tug-of-war with him using this toy. The rope does a great job of cleaning his teeth; I met someone who was a former dog trainer and she commented on how clean his teeth were without me realizing that's one of the things this toy is supposed to do.Great toy overall; 5 stars. I think mine may be a different size, as the rope is a different color (black, red, and white), but I noticed the only review here was 1 star and Tire biter paw track toy has *definitely* not made my dog sick in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels and functions like a real Thinkpad keyboard","review":"I have given up on Lenovo's new type of external Thinkpad keyboard. Too slow, poor feel, too many machine-induced typos. This keyboard from IBM costs more than the new-style Lenovo, but it's woth it because it's the real thing: it works and feels just like a real Thinkpad keyboard has felt for so long until Lenovo degraded the performance.

In particular, I wanted the Fn and Ctrl key placement to match - the good keyboards I already have are great, but have a standard keyboard layout, as opposed to the Lenovo / IBM Thinkpad layout, with Fn key in the lower left corner.It does NOT. It performs worse that the 10$ keyboard that it was replacing. It's keys bounce, it misses keystrokes when I am typing at speed. And I am not even a touch typist, although I am a fast 1-4 finger typist.Heck, I think that the best example of this keyboards problms will be a typing sample where I am typing on it rasonably fast. Oh, good grief... now I can't reproduc the problems. Oh, heck, wel, I guess that I can a bit, but only a few letrs are missing - in some other examples almost every 10th ltter is missing.

I bought this for the control key layout, but that benefit was outweighed by absent Windows key. The typing feel and touchpad accuracy were okay but nothing special. For half the price, I find the Solidtek KB-540 perfectly adequate and not fragile.

Songs like Newborn Grass and June bring tears to your eyes. Navasha's vocals are truly a gift from God. And James is a musical genius. If you call yourself a jazz lover, you have to check it out. You haven't heard real music until you've heard them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's tight!","review":"This second release by Fertile Ground is just incredible. You can't consider yourself a true lover of music and not own this CD. It seamlessly combines the sounds and rhythms of Africa, the Carribean, and Latin America with (a bit of) hip-hop, spoken word, and some serious jazz. The conscious message and tight rhythms and melodies of tracks like Spritual War, Broken Branches, Be Natural, and Misguided Warriors are incredible.

Phillips tells a compelling story that clearly has been researched thoroughly. The author examines tiny details that lend authenticity to the story as well as the aspects that lend clarity to the larger scope of Sunday's life. The book does not read like a historical textbook, but is told in a simple story style that pulls the reader into Billy's world. This brings the book to life. Even young people can understand the simple narrative style; it is an accessible book that would have greatly pleased Billy Sunday himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great guy, great story, BAD book","review":"This series is almost universally poorly written. Sad, because subject matter is excellent. I have struggled through so many from this series. The writing is disjointed and hard to follow.

This is a good slogan for the book. It is full of lovely graphs and charts of beading designs. As a beginning beader, it has not been useful to me for anything more than some eye candy. The patterns and designs are complex, yet beautiful, but I'm years away from trying any of the projects contained within.My four star rating is due to my inexperience and therefore the book's lack of use to me. However, if I were an experienced beader, I suspect this would be a five star review. There are hundreds of photos and color charts. The how-tos would be very useful to the beader who knows the basics. Don't let my four star rating scare you away. If you are advanced, this is a wonderful book.

It set me back 184.00 , and I'll never buy another Panasonic again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Terrible","review":"We purchased this phone thinking it would be an upgrade. Boy, were we wrong! The cordless has to be completely dead before you are supposed to recharge it, which means in the middle of a call, it starts beeping at you. If you don't have caller ID, you can't screen calls with this answering machine because you can't hear the message as it comes in. When someone is using the computer, the cordless phone dispays a message saying the phone line is in use which uses its battery life for that charge. That means if you have kids who are on the internet, your phone won't have much of a charge once you get to use the phone line. The screen is also hard to read. I wanted the base hung up on the wall so that it wouldn't take up desk space. I have to get down on my knees to see the screen. Over all, I can live with this phone, but next time I will be more carefull about my decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has it All.....Almost","review":"I recently purchased this Panasonic phone to replace a AT&T phone I owned for 14 Years.

It is so weak and tinny, callers don't recognize my voice. They think it's a wrong number. Next, the display brightness and contrast are too limited, making it difficult to read at an angle. You must be staring at it head on. Third, when dialing in from the outside and entering your code, there are no prompts for the system, other than playing messages. Not even one for deleting a message, going back one, skipping ahead, etc.. Unless you carry the 95 page instruction booklet around with you, you're helpless. And last, but not least, there are occasional bursts of low volume, high frequency noise on the line. Not enough to disrupt a conversation, but enough to be a nuisance.Even though you get a lot with this system, given its relatively high price, it leaves too much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid performer, good sound","review":"I recently bought this phone to replace a similar Sony corded/cordless answering machine combination. While the two look very similar, the Panasonic's sound quality is much higher -- on the corded phone, on the cordless and on the answering machine.The feature set is good -- it has most of the features I need in a phone. The 50-number memory is adequate, although 100 numbers would have been better.

Marine Sniper is an astonishing account of Carlos Hathcock's unique courage and dedication during his service in Vietnam. Anyone interested in the Marine Corps, the Vietnam War, sniping, or military heroes must read Marine Sniper. And if you read it, then you won't have to read Silent Warrior. Why? Because Silent Warrior is the exact same book, except not nearly as well done. The same exact stories - the Apache, the NVA general, the Frenchman, Burke's death, the VC sniper hunt, Hathcock's rehabilitation of his unit upon his return to Vietnam - are retold in Silent Warrior, except in sketchier form, and frequently intermingled with the author's fabricated conjectures about Hathcock's state of mind as he died of MS. Don't buy this book. It is a shameless ripoff, and a transparent money grab by Charles Henderson, who apparently couldn't think of anything new to write so he wrote the same book twice. This is a disappointing waste of money. Avoid, avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great companion to Marine Sniper but not a replacement","review":"This is a follow up to Marine Sniper by the same author and is about the subject. If you have read Marine Sniper this book is a good apendix in that it goes more into depth into some of the accounts in Marine Sniper. It also address Carlos Hathcock's life after he left Vietnam including some real tear jerking ceremonies in his honor. If both the books had been combined it would have been great but I guess most people don't like books that long. If you are looking for a pure sniping book this is not for you. If you are looking to learn more about Carlos than you read in Marine Sniper this is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"hathcock fans only","review":"after reading the book i would still buy it again, but only becuase it is about Carlos Hathcock. this book is just material that didn't make his first one. if you want to buy a good book buy the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read Marine Sniper, don't bother with this one...","review":"Henderson managed to rewrite the same book, give it two titles and sell it twice. If you read Marine Sniper, you've already read this book. Same stories all over again, only with fewer or different details, and some fantasy about the enemy characters.

The author does not completely avoid the controversial, and this is somewhat of a pleasant surprise. Though originally written in Swedish, it reads very well in translation.

I will come back and write a review after I receive them, but I am commenting now because I find something a bit peculiar when people comment about the ring that holds these together...I have ALWAYS removed the ring from my measuring cups as soon as I got them home. Who wants to wash all of the cups when you are only using one in particular?! I have always found it awkward to hold all when I am measuring out of a canister with one. I keep mine in a drawer as opposed to hanging, so I suppose this makes the ring unnecessary for me, but the cups themselves have holes so you can hang them individually if you place a ring on each. Those rings are simple enough to find and most of us most likely have some around.

The metal of the handles is thin, so the edges feel somewhat sharp against the fingers.They are impractical because of their shape. I hadn't realized how often I minimize dirty dishes by using just a one cup measuring cup when baking. I \\"eyeball\\" a half cup by using a one cup measure and filling it halfway. Because of the bowl shape of these cups, you can't do that. It's even harder to use it for a quarter or a third.

These are a sturdy stainless steal. A good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, except...","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. These are great measuring cups. The only reason I would ever buy another set is if I lost these. They're very hefty and the handles are not spot welded on. Each cup is a single piece of steel.

They are smooth and shiny and beautiful to look at, but besides that, they are nice and round inside, which means clean-up is snap with just one swipe of the dishrag, and I can't believe how easily a wipe gets everything off as compared to my old plastic measuring cups that had rough places made from manufacturing marks. Also, these cups are flattened on the bottoms to sit straight up on the counter, and they are the perfect weight, not too heavy and not too light!

Despite being dull, it produced a better cut than the new Oldham Signature blade. I returned the blade to the store.Since then, I have invested in a Forrest WWII blade.

This album is nowhere near as good as the first, or even any of the previous Wu efforts. It seems like with every new album, the Wu gets worse. Its starting to make me feel like they're conning us and selling us albums based on their past reputation.

Rae proved a great chef does not cook the same old plate all the time. He adds new ingredients and makes a different taste.

Even if there is no RZA production, he should of at least have some beats provided by Inspectah Deck, 4th Disciple or True Master. As for the lyrics what happened to the other Wu tang members, especially Ghost. I don't know what happened here. This album seems suspect to me.Reakwon is still one of my favorite Wu-tang MC's besides Inspectah Deck and GZA and others. Just that the album is kind of nervous.

The production is decent at times, but other times it sounds like Swizz Beats Casio beats, I have to give props to Raekwon's lyrics, and for trying something new, but if you want a raw, hardcore Wu album, cop GZA's, Ghostface Killah's or U-God's because they kept the Shaolin Style alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way underrated","review":"This album is near a classic, although it gets a bad rep.

I installed the chain rings with a new a Shimano chain, tuned the derailleurs, lube the drivetrain, and off for a neighborhood hilly ride. And guess what, while I was going up hill, I still got a chain suck as I down shift from the big chain ring to the middle chain ring. The chain scraped a deep scratch on the teeth of the middle chain ring. The rings were supposed to provide smooth shifting while riding under stress going up hill.

Second, Younha is one of the rare J-Pop/K-Pop artists that got by on talent alone since apparently (though I don't see why) she wasn't considered \\"attractive\\" enough, originally, to be a singer. Third, among the glut of similar J-Pop, Younha's work seems to stand out with a variety of sounds, styles, and tempos. Overall, this is one of the highest rated albums (based on the average of each song, which are in turn based on a 5-star rating scale) that I have every come into possession of, and though you don't know me and I don't you, know this: my audiophile pride prevents me from making concessions when critiquing music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Christian message bad storyline","review":"This book has a great message but the storyline was horrible.

But that is veneer. Really, this book is a diatribe against the stereotypical, mindless, bureaucratic institutions we all have dealt with at one time or another. And it's the story of a pathetic hero who is totally helpless against his institution, the \\"army.\\" Put him in armor and surround him with Ants, and he's brilliant. Put him back in the barracks, and he's a spineless victim, whining his way to oblivion. By the end of the book, the author absolutely beats these themes to death -- to a PULP! \\"Bureaucracies are stupid and evil! And the people who serve them are helpless victims who are powerless to change their fate!\\"Yeah-sure. I felt like the author spent more time ranting on his soap box than he did telling what could have been a really great story.

Everyone compares it to Starship Troopers because it's a pathetic rip-off of that classic novel.

Don't waste your time with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this mess...","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend who highly recommended it. I couldn't finish it. Between the horrible writing, cardboard characters, thin plot, and typos (did this book have an editor?) I found it impossible to get into.I was tempted to give it up during Part 1, where at times it felt like I was reading a high school kid's fan-fiction. As I progressed through Part 2, I decided to save myself some sanity and stop reading this mess.Apparently, it's a \\"classic\\" for people who don't know what a well-written, well-structured book is. And because there's sci-fi killing, that somehow makes it great. Not so.Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"I picked it up hoping for another Starship Troopers or Forever War. It tries to be these books but fails. The universe it is set in is absolutely ludicrous. The character interactions are ridiculous. Even some of the characters' names are laughable.The book opens well enough, with some big battle scenes in powered armor. But these battle scenes drag on forever with nothing meaningful actually happens. The middle of the book is just awful, droning on forever about some character named Jack Crow (guess what, he's a space pirate el oh el).Ultimately, I had to force myself to read as far as I did, hoping it would eventually get better. Alas, it didn't (quite the contrary of getting better actually) and I could not finish this mess. I cannot begin to understand why this book has such high reviews. It's terribly misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish \\"Armor.\\"","review":"\\"Armor\\" is poorly written.

Me, I threw it in the trash before I got that far. Shallow characters, dim-witted dialog. Nothing to draw me in. The only thing I can think that caused my reaction to be so different than the rest of you is that I had just finished reading the first four volumes of Peter Hamilton's Reality Disfunction series. Those books drew me in like nothing has for a long time. By comparison, Armor wasn't even in the same league."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to read or reread Starship Troopers","review":"This book was disorganized and poorly written. The plotline jumped all over the place with very little explanation. There was barely a complete sentence or thought in the book. I was sorely disappointed in this book and with the great Amazon reviews which it received. I had expected a novel along the lines of Starship Troopers, but instead was given a horribly unoriginal, predictable story. This book was an utter disappointment. From a military standpoint the novel was a joke. I have nothing good to say about this book. Do not let the other online reviews fool you, this book is not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great companion to Starship Troopers and Forever War","review":"This book is just awesome. I read Starship Troopers, before the movie, and loved it. Then I read Forever War, and loved it. Then I discovered Armor, well the rest is history. I have only one complaint about this book. Where the other two have a conclusive ending for their respective hero, this one doen't, and it is driving me batty. So, basically I am writing this review because of one burning question. Is there going to be a sequal, or not? There deserves to be one. Personally I feel Felix lived, I just want to know what happened after, and to learn more about Felix. These three books, that I have mentioned, make an outstanding trilogy. By three differnt authors, in three different decades. Whether it was intentional, or not. So, Mr. Steakley if you read this, please write a sequal, not a prequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other places not talked about in Starship Troopers.","review":"I did notice comparisons between Starship Troopers and Armor but whereas Starship Troopers is a regular soldier's rise in the ranks story, Armor is a viewpoint of someone else fighting somewhere else in the battles. ST is a broad recruitment book and Armor is giving a detailed description about one soldier battles. Both are excellent reading material and I have read both of them more than 5 times in less than 2 years. When I need a good read I pick one of these two up. Yes, Armor may have gotten ideas from ST but they were expanded on and shows us what else is happening when Rico is not around."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 actually, it started off well, became painful","review":"I thought this book was great when I started reading it but half way through Steakley starts writing a completely different book that has a horribly boring plot.

I was truly amazed. Before purchasing this book I read the reviews and I had to add my own comments in. The story telling is fantastic and the book gives you a \\"you are there\\" feeling during the battle scenes. I noticed alot of people didn't really like the Jack Crow section in the middle, and i'll admit it did get slow for a while but the whole story came together at the end! I don't wanna give too much of the book away but I must say the ending did surprise me! Well anyways this is a great book.. I even liked it more then The Forever War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blaze me its my favorite Book","review":"In my opinion there are many things wrong with this book, mostly unanswered question. But I loved the pacing, the action, the internal stuggles, the hopelesnness. I guess you could say its somewhat like Starship Troopers.

When I actually obtained a copy I could not put it down. I would have to say that the story matter is very similar to \\"Starship Troopers\\", however it is approaced very differently. While \\"Starship Troopers\\" dealt with more philosophical and political issues, the underlying story of \\"Armor\\" is that of a tragedy. The hero of the book is born and bred to lead. However, he does not want any of that but fate keeps throwing it in his face. Time and time again he is put in situations that mean certain death but somehow his skills allow him to survive. I was really interested in how he described his mind when it came time to fight, how the \\"Machine\\" took over and how his true personality was just an observer. I highly recommend this book. It is an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you read this book it plays in your mind like a movie","review":"If you liked Starship Troopers this book is BETTER!This book will wrap you up and keep you up all night!It's an outerspace war story following two characters the soldier is Felix and the infantry wears combat suits called ARMOR and they are fighting giant ants.This book is an absolute must for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

They are both great books and should be judged on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"A half way good book","review":"In reading all the other reviews that rave about this book, I'm struck by how many people focus on the \\"Felix section\\". I wonder if people stopped reading when the Jack Crow story started up.The Felix storyline is quite good. The Jack Crow storyline is dull, uninteresting and trite. It strikes me a purely filler to make the book take up more pages. If this book had been edited down to about half it size and exclusively focussed on Felix as a protagonist, it would have been great. The addition of Jack Crow to the book makes it bog down and a bit agonizing to read.Don't be fooled by the glowing reviews, they only cover a third of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Heinlein wannabe","review":"Armor is a somewhat disappointing attemp at a new Starship Troopers. All the basic elements are there, as well as a mysterious hero, but the author is just too cryptic, slow, and disjointed in the way he goes about the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"This is two different stories tacked together to make a novel. It doesn't work and is a great disappointment because we care about Felix. The center section lacks the power of the first and rings false. The writing in general is only fair, sacrificing as it does, clarity for brevity. Many times the reader is forced to give up trying to figure out what the dialog means and move on. I preferredSisters of Glassto this one for fast moving SF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated - Read Starship Troopers Instead","review":"This book was recommended to me highly but it turned into a real slog fest. It was a bit predictable, including the ending. The beginning was lifted from Starship Troopers in my opinion. The middle, maybe from Time Enough for Love. Not that there was anything wrong with derivative fiction but it has to be well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author just didn't understand Starship Troopers.","review":"The flaws in this book are incredible. In this military, soldiers don't rebel at repeated hopeless missions, (5 survivals makes a trusted hand, 10 a grizzled vetran, and 20 not believed). The officers seem to have no grasp that combat involves killing (possibly of themselves).This military doesn't seem to have any bombs, though a powered armor suit can be made to malfunction and explode like a baby nuke. Too bad that only suits with living occupants seem to have this ability, especially with all the dead troopers laying around at this point in the book.Running out of ammo is common, but nobody ever thinks to take swords, knives, or even a nightstick.The author should have read Starship Troopers a little more closely before writing this book. There was more to Heinlein's book than powered armor.I would have given this book zero stars, but it wasn't an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANTS APLENTY!!! A GREAT SCI-FI/WAR BOOK!!!","review":"I thought this was a terrific novel. My brother introduced this book to me and I recognized the name as the author of Vampire$. I normally don't read sci-fi, but my brother insisted. I was hooked with the non-stop action and thought it was written very well. Felix was a great character. My only complaint was that I would have liked to have seen more battle sequences. I would definitely recommend this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique!","review":"I started reading this book thinking it would be somewhat like Ender's game, and Forever war. (I loved both) It was. Yet it wasn't. It was different. It was filled with hopelessness. It was filled with how bad war is. Similar to the way Lya, Holly and Jack were drawn to the story, so was I. Waiting for any chance to read, and even though the story pained me, by the terrible sense of despair - I could not stop. Until the end. It is a beautiful tale. Strange. Compelling. It is a must for lovers of the genre. I only hope there will be a sequel. Or a prequel. Anything. Maybe even a short story - as long as the story could continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sci-fi sleeper ever","review":"Just let me start by saying I am an avid science fiction reader of at least one book per week, and this book is my all time favorite. John Steakley does a great job exploring the mind of a solider in an impossible situation"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite SF books, great action, real characters.","review":"I've read this book several times (a rarity for me to do) and it grips me every time.Felix, our hero, is believable, flawed, fighting for personal reasons, and yet superhuman (superlucky?). The action sequences are probably the best ever in SF for ground action.The Jack Crow story takes awhile to get going, but it works.The ending and climax are excellent, both pack a great emotional wallop.My favorite part about Steakley's writings is that he's not afraid to let his characters die. If they get into bad situations, bad things happen. There are no miraculous solutions. Survival, victory, etc. is paid for in blood.A great homage to Heinlein, as well as an overall improvement to ST (remove the \\"preachiness\\" and add some action).Great stuff! Write more John!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not about the battles","review":"...It's about the people you share the trench with and the invisible wounds that you'll always carry with you.Steakley's classic could not unseat my 2 ~similar genre faves: \\"Ender's Game\\", and \\"The Forever War\\", but it's a great story -- both well told, and memorable.\\"The thing about armor is that it can't protect you from what's inside\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This book may become a classic!","review":"I have a high opinion of this book, and have had this book come up in discussion with other S.F. fans, who like myself, thought it a great read, and said,\\"Who is John Steakley, and where are the other books he has written?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sci-Fi Military Action...","review":"I simply could not put down this book! I have always loved Heinlein's Starship Troopers, but wished it had more battles and less training. Steakley delivers! The action is intense and believable, pulling you into the character of Felix and \\"The Machine\\". I often find myself checking the aisles of the bookstores for a sequel. Also try David Drake's \\"Redliners\\" if you liked this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story","review":"This book put me in a daze for about a week after I finished it. I've read it 2 times since then and every time, it gets better. It is a moving look at the toll of war on the soldiers who fight it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read","review":"The most appealing facet was the intimate attention applied to detail. The emotion and reality of the horrors of war were vividly dipicted as well as how these wicked facets are managed by those immersed within it. Both of the main characters involved were well developed and beyond two dimensional. Reading the book was easy. Every chapter lured me on to read the next. A skill not easily applied when dealing with a novel of this size. It was an awesome read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cept for the whole Jack Crow part of the story","review":"Well I like this novel a lot. Well I liked all the parts that told about Felix and the ant war. They were really cool, and I couldn't stop reading. It was full of action, and emotional, and so on. But then they hard the part with Jack Crow bored me to tears. The only reason I kept reading was because there was more of Felix. The endings pretty cool. Don't get me wrong I did like the book, just not the parts with Jack Crow."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this ever get so many high ratings?","review":"Jaw dropping. Not just the amateurish sentence structure, cumbersome vocabulary, paper thin characters who act and talk like something out of a Mickey Spillane novel, nonsensical actions taken by those characters, and ridiculous structure to the book. No, the really stunning thing is how many people think this is good. What were those people thinking who gave this 5 out of 5? Have they ever read anything before? Or is it just people who normally don't read, and somehow they picked this up?I've read hundreds of science fiction books. I couldn't finish this one - making this the only sci-fi book I can say that about. This is absolutely horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"The first section about Felix was interesting, although kind of boring. The Jack Crow storyline made me trash the book. Maybe it got better after page 200, I wouldn't know and wouldn't care.DON'T BUY OR BORROW THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Poorly written pornographic fantasy trash.I bought this because it was likened to the Forever War by Joe Haldeman and because of all the positive reviews. After 25 or so agonizing pages, I chucked it.In one laugh out loud paragraph the author describes the lakes of Banshee (alien planet) as made of poison. Just poison? Why not acid? Or blood? Both of those would have been cool too."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah blah blah blah...","review":"tear out the Jack Crow chapters and it has a pule of life.... with those chapters, it induces narcolepsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidest book.Ever.","review":"If I wanted to read two completely different stories, I would buy two books instead of one or an anthology!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Pulp Powerarmor","review":"The controversy about this book on this site is amazing. All I can say is with a library of over a thousand science fiction books this is one of the very few I read over and over again. Yes, it is an 'unending numbers against one guy' book, but it does it so well that I was actually purchased Steakley's other book despite my extreme dislike of the entire vampire genre.If you like Weber, Drake, Ringo, Flint and the like you'll probably enjoy this. If you search for deep meaning in science fiction perhaps you should stick to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starship Troopers came first...","review":"To clarify something other reviewers have questioned, Starship Troopers did indeed come before Armor. 20 years or so before Armor. And Armor was indeed heavily influenced by Starship Troopers. John Steakley himself even said that he stole it outright. That said, what Armor is is emotional where Starship Troopers is intellectual. Starship Troopers used the pretext of a futuristic war to deliver the author's views of society and the military, whereas Armor barely sketches in details about it's society and military in order to tell the story of one man's struggle to survive in an unsurvivable situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"My #2 book...","review":"A lot of people trash this story as a knock off of Starship Troopers. Now Mr. Steakley does admit that as a muse \\"Starship Troopers\\" had strong influence on him, but this story stands alone in my eyes. I love the two discrete story lines and how Mr. Steakley ties them together in the end. And deep down inside me, something resonates with the idea of the Engine. Buy this book, because I won't lend you mine. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reply to guy from Texas","review":"This is just a reply to the guy from Texas. First off, Starship Troopers was published in 1959, Armor was published in 1984. Now, tell me, which one inspired which?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Military Classic\\"? I wonder...","review":"This book reminded me of a high school writing assignment. Great beginning, bad middle, worse ending. I haven't yet decided if its an homage to Starship Troopers, or a blatant rip-off. The beginning of the book, which details the intial combat drop and Felix's (the main character) attempt to survive, are the best parts of the entire read. The action sequences are fast paced and believeable, and the psychological changes in Felix are frightenly real.The middle/end has parts in it that are so boring, its an act of self-discipline to finish them. Several times I had to force myself to continue reading, hoping in vain that something would happen. Unfortunately, nothing ever did. If this book is a \\"classic\\", its a classic in disappointment only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literally leaves you waiting for more!!","review":"If you liked Haldeman's \\"The Forever War\\", and/or Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers\\", then you'll wonder why you've never read \\"Armor\\". Read it, re-read the others and read it again. And realize that in each book, although the battle-suits are flashy,they are but minor characters in remarkable stories. Steakely's \\"Armor\\" HAS to be mentioned whenever the other two are!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Think of Starship Troopers meets Ender's Game.","review":"I love this book. This and Ender's game (Orson Scott Card) really started got me into reading books. It has the techno savvy of Starship Troopers (the book not the movie) and the intense writting style of Ender's Game. The story is good, but it's the writting style that really hooks you. A MUST READ for all sci-fi fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is all the fuss?","review":"The description of combat in the beginning was a real hook. However, the Jack Crow section was like a completely different story thrown in to confuse me. The Felix story stops and then you have to play catch up for the last few pages. Forever War, for example, is a far more disciplined and structured narrative showing the effects of combat on individuals than this book. I was disappointed in ARMOR"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely too far-fetched for even a science-fiction novel.","review":"This book lacked the realty of \\"Starship Troopers\\" and \\"The Forever War\\". It was recommended to me because it was \\"supposed\\" to be like ST and FW, but it was very dissapointing. I mean, how could Felix and his comrades kill so much ants in so little time with just the butts of thier blazers, and the whole Jack Crow story was completely unnecessary, but, I must admit, it did have a very good ending and a very good set-up for a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Beginning, ok ending, TERRIBLE middle","review":"I'm kind of shocked by the number of 5 star reviews of this book. It really does get you into the action of fighting a war in the first section of the book. It's gripping, it's engaging, you want more!So Steakley throws you in with space pirates! on a back water planet for a few hundred pages. Let me tell you, you don't care about ANY of these characters. You just want to suffer through them to get back to the war stuff.So you slog through the stuff about murdering a puppy, and you get to the war stuff, and, it's pretty good. Rather predictable, but good.I bought it for a $1.06 at Goodwill. I don't feel I was ripped off, but I'm selling it at my next garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a TV book","review":"This is a story set in the future about a soldier and his experiences fighting an insurmountable alien force; you're thinking \\"so what, almost all sci-fi novels are like that.\\" So what makes the book special? Nothing, really.It's a rather dull book with no big twists that I bought completely off the reccommendations of others. Even Steakley's command of the English language is a little shaky throughout the book. Our protagonist, Felix, is a bit of a weird one and I had a hard time identifying with his character; and when that happens, it suddenly becomes a very hard novel to finish.This novel is good for nothing more than passing time; a \\"TV book\\" if you will. If I had the choice to read Ringworld (L Niven) for the 10th time, or this book for the first, I would go with the former."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steakley's a One-Hit Wonder","review":"Does anyone know if this is Steakley's first book? I can't find anything before it, and only Vampires that followed--what, about 20 years later? I think Armor is one of my favorite books. Sure, it's reused material from Starship Troopers and The Forever War, but a great book. Plenty of authors write about the same things. There are only so many original subjects left for plots. I love the Felix character. So tragic, but that's what makes him interesting. A man tortured by destiny. The Jack Crow plot-switch thing is also a fun diversion, and it ties in nicely at the end, though it's not a huge surprise. Now, can you say Captain Jack Sparrow ripoff? I think Pirates Of The Caribbean stole this guy right down to the lecherous swagger and aw-shucks evil hero persona. Anyway, it's too bad Steakley didn't do more books. I think Armor stands on its own as great sci-fi. A really fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Book.","review":"Most people set out comparing Armor with Starship Troopers. I have read both books, and I find comparing these two books to be like apples and oranges. They're both good, but they have different flavors. Yes, they are both books about people in powered armor fighting a race of giant insectoids, But there is were the comparison ends. Armor is the story of Felix, a warrior who is on the edge. Much grittier than Starship Troopers, Armor pulls no punches when it comes to describing the horrors of war, and the toll it takes on the human psyche. Perhaps the least desirable part of the book is the second part, that deals with another character called Jack Crow. It's the equivelent of running full tilt down a hallway, then hitting a sudden right turn. It throws off the continuity and pacing of the book, and leaves you asking \\"What about Feix?\\" But even this is worth reading, and don't worry, you'll get back to felix soon enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old story...but well told","review":"It's a story of a reluctant hero who, once again, is forced by circumstances beyond his control to be what he has run away from. It's a story that was told very well in Clint Eastwood's movie: UNFORGIVEN I've read and re-read this book a number of times over the past 15 years and will continue to read it periodically. Battle scene descriptions are some of the best ever, but you'll have to slog through the 2nd half of the book to get to the (by then) only somewhat surprising ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"Sorry guys but this is a dog.

No plot, no character development, nothing to grab andhold your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armor is much more than you think....","review":"If all you see when you read Armor is Starship Tropers, or Aliens, read it again :)This book is about something rare, the power of will, relentless determination not to fail, not to qquit. It is, in the end, about Honor.The parallel is not Starship Troopers, but the Bolo novels.A perfect book"},{"rating":"2","title":"The PERFECT sci-fi book","review":"Having read science fiction written by many different authors my entire life, Armor has to be the single best of the lot. I have read this book more times than I can count, and the single word that comes to mind to descibe it is 'WOW'. Steakley's style is unique, and reading it a person finds themself part of the action, humor, and horror of the hero's life. It is an absolute must read, time and again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I have read this book three times, and each tome the book gets better and better. When Felix is in combat, I feel that I am right there with him, maybe looking for a stray ant myself. the Jack Crow portions of the book fit very well with the overall plot as it gives a good contrast as to what happened and what is now hapening. The ending was great as everything seemed to meld together as if it was a sort of destiny that Felix made it through the ant wars to save the system at a later time. I highly recommend this novel for anyone who likes SF"},{"rating":"1","title":"Teach Me neither shows nor teaches anything","review":"In short this film is a waste of time and money. The plot is very thin and the simplistic dialog is stiff. For an \\"adult\\" film there is very little nudity, a few brief breast shots, nothing more. The reason why the producers didn't submit the film for rating is that it would have gotten a PG-13.

The drawer front had a glaring defect in the finish and there were several places where holes had been drilled, filled (poorly,) and re-drilled in a slightly different place. One shelf was so poorly constructed and finished that it had lumpy caulk that didn't quite hide the gaps and cracks.

Many of these songs exude creativity and emotion. They are also so believable where you can picture the lead singer David Gahan singing them to you. This is one of my favorite cds because when I first bought this cd I listened to it alot after work and its good for working out and making out. In my opinion what helps make this cd a masterpiece is many of these songs are creatively erotic and sensual but there are also some songs that appeal more to ones emotional side and spiritual side. In this cd there is something for everyone. Some of my favorites on this cd are just can't get enough, strangelove, dream on, personal jesus, people are people, walking in my shoes, and feel you.

The pieces are tiny...much smaller than other puzzles in this age category. Although they are durable, I would recommend the company making them bigger so they don't get lost. This seems very pricey for a paperback book and 3 mini puzzles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is aptly named","review":"The book is easy to read and the print is larger than one usually finds.The poems are pensive, marked by a sadness or melancholy but they are not hopeless.I especially liked the section entitled: Mother's Voice and Father's Voice.While I do not know Stafford's parents, they seem well worn in his writings, ridged but loved with a wisdom that comes from hard times and living close to the land.The images and words chosen bring back memories of my own parents especially my mother, so much so that I became one with the writings. I realize poems are for those that need them and not only for those who write them.I would recommend this book to those of you who like strong feelings expressed in stark words.Donald J.

The story bigins with the history of scientific novels as well as the history of the observation on Mars.

This argument is too deatiled to read the book with patience, but may be of considerable scientific importance.

It's divided into two parts. In part one, Arundhati Roy writes about dam-building in India. This heavily-footnoted chapter gets a longer treatment in her next book, Power Politics. Here she introduces the topic, adding a lot of context to the statistics. Her outrage is palpable. This leads into the second part, and angry essay about India and Pakistan becoming part of the nuclear fraternity (both countries publicly tested nuclear weapons in May of 1998). Both countries have so many problems --- and so much tension between them over Kashmir --- that this development can only be considered a disaster for the hundreds of millions of people in the region.Arundhati Roy is someone we should all listen to. She's an activist, novelist, and a great writer. This book is a good introduction to her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book adds to your cost of living","review":"For $11.99 it is an expensive ebook for $4.99 it would have been affordable. I am saying this as someone who read it and feel not have got the money's worth. There is little in it that cannot be ascertained from reading her other Book 'Walking with the Comrades'. That book is well written and more fact rich all be it the facts in her book are not likely to be independently verified. I wonder why she sticks to narratives which are full of Rhetoric and facts that are difficult to verify. But I suppose facts that cannot be independently verified is better than having no facts at all. In any case this book is not rich on facts about the events that are written about. And besides not everyone is interested in facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This is the first book by Roy that I read, and my favorite. In comparison to The God of Small Things, that's saying a lot. The first essay is the most powerful and clear explanation I have ever read anywhere about the failings of organisations such as the WTO; however, it is not only an attack on international financial institutions. It also discusses the abuses that occur on a national and local level in conjunction with the work of international groups. I suggest this book to anyone who is having trouble understanding the objections to globalization and the WTO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very naive","review":"Arundhati Roy's essays present a simplistic view of the issues involved in development and in defence. (You need to invest on security, India has some very dangerous neighbors.) Roy's analysis of why India's development has been slow is just plain wrong. Basically, she parrots the Marxist view, which refuses to recognizes that India's problem is its bureaucracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"mikepez sucks","review":"If you buy products from mikepez, please read his seller comments.

I love and respect the person that gave it to me...but it insulted my intelligence so much that I finally just put it in the heap (where it belongs).It is totally UN-informative on raising a young man in today's world, and instead filled with Dobson's perverse and vitriolic disgust with anyone who is a not a squeaky clean Christian (which of course we know Dobson must be!!!) It's basically a gay-bashing and/or single parenting-bashing treatise.Stay away from the fire and brimstone and seek out some real, intelligent dialogue on being a father, dad, mentor to today's young men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Dobson has never met my daughter!","review":"It seems like people look for generalities and stereotypes to compare themselves or their children to to convince themselves that they (or their children) are OK. So many qualities that Dr. Dobson reserves for boys are qualities that my daughter has; and she is Really Neat. I would be disappointed (and probably a little angry) if someone looked at my daughters qualifications for a leadership position and chose an equally qualified boy (just because he is a boy) so it wouldn't hurt his ego.

Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't reccomend","review":"I agree with a previous customer reviewer - this was not what I had in mind. My husband and I are very traditional, but we were both offended by the anti-homosexuality stuff and anti-working mother stuff. While there might be some sound advice in this book, I cannot in all good concious reccomend a book which proliferates an attitude of hate and intolerance towards people who think differently than oneself. The challenge to raising children, let alone boys, is to raise loving, accepting children with high self esteem, who do not feel threatened by people with differing beliefs. I didn't get anything like that from Dobson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really about how to raise young men","review":"While I don't disagree with Dr. Dobson on a few of his societal observations; however, referring to homosexuality as a \\"disorder\\"is not supported by current research. His fear-mongering diatribes are clearly out of place and irrelevant to the subject as defined by the title. I found certain of his views so off-track and polarizing that it distracted me from the premise of the book. If Dr. Dobson wants to rant and rave on his biblical and conservative view that being Christian means being intolerant and inflexible, that's fine, but then he should look in the mirror and start by being honest with the name of his own book and call it: \\"How the Religious Conservative Raises Sons to Act and Think\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Informed","review":"Before you buy this book, you should know who Dr. James Dobson is.

I do think Dr. Dobson spends a too much time on the feminist movement of the 70s and how it has impacted boys/men. He seems to go on and on about this rather than focusing on how to best raise our boys. As I said, I'm not done with the book, but got a little disinterested and set it aside because of the above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Great book for and daughter-in-law to read as the bring up my grandson.

An almost worthless read.Please note that I write this as a conservative, born-again Christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of problems, not many solutions","review":"Altho I've really enjoyed some of Dr. Dobson's books, this was a disappointment to both my husband and I. It seemed to touch on many discouraging scenarios hitting our sons in this day & age; from a lack of male scholastic incentives in public school, to softening the leadership traits in our sons, to sexual predators--but not very many solutions to combat the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title Misleading","review":"Certainly Dr. Dobson has done much good work in promoting the pro-family agenda. The problem with this book is that it does not directly address the responsibility of raising boys. Make no mistake, boys and girls are different and Dobson does a good job of pointing out this difference. But if you want to read about the research concerning the difference between the sexes, and the cultural assault on boys, then you are much better off consulting \\"The War Against Boys\\" by Sommers.There are indeed, numerous funny stories and pointed anecdotes mixed with helpful insight and advice in this book. But if you are a Christian looking for consistent Biblical wisdom to help you raise a boy into a man you can do no better than \\"Future Men\\", by Douglas Wilson. Wilson's book is so solidly Biblical that it will expose to many \\"Bible believing Christians\\" just how far from Biblical thinking most American Christians are. While Dobson wants us raise \\"good boys\\", Wilson tells us how to grow men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too faith-based oriented for me","review":"based on some good reviews I figured I'd give this a whirl, but even as a Christian I found he comes across to much as a pastor delivering a sermon.There is also considerable fluff and I ended up skimming it. Unless you're a pretty hard core Christian and enjoy being preached too, I'd suggest you read the excellent Raising Boys instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more................................","review":"I am about halfway through this book and really can't decide if I want to continue. I'm a single mom raising my 2 year old son. While I know my situation is not ideal, it sure is better than what it would have been if I stayed in my marraige. Dr. Dobson offers lots of facts but no solutions.

I thought my boys were out of control and deaf to my teachings. The wisdom that Dobson gives to us in the book is Heavenly. I learned so much about boys that I never knew. It gave me a wonderful basis for things about a male's makeup that I had no idea about. The one thing I learned that I did not know was that boys tend to tune things out, in order to focus on one thing. I thought my son was ignoring me, and bless his sweet heart if I was not spanking him for things I now realize he never even heard me say. It has made such a difference in the way I interact and rear our boys. I recommend this book to all my friends when I know they are having, or have had, a boy.

And most of that is very much in line with the republican, conservative political propaganda.I'm scared of the people I know who like this book and what they regularly do to their boys.Unfortunately only the \\"conservatives\\" get away with this type of abusive behavior. Look at the priest scandal, Mark Foley, Senator Craig, Ted Haggard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes. The Man Is A Walking Christian Stereotype","review":"Eeek. It's a real shame that a book like this has actually been published and put on the market and advertised as 'practical.' There are lots of words I'd use to describe this book and it's author, so called 'Dr.' James Dobson, but 'practical' is not one of them. Some words I would use would include: 'bigoted,' 'homophobic,' 'insane,' 'illogical,' 'silly,''sexist,' 'Nazi-ish,' and 'stupid.' Yeah, just plain stupid. If you're seriously thinking about purchasing this book, I advise you to travel to the book store and flip to chapter nine, 'The Origins of Homosexuality.' Now this chapter is just insane. It's books and people like this who give Christians a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading James GARBARINO would be much more valuable","review":"Dobson's approach is simplistic, dualistic and limited. He, like so many, yearns for the \\"good ole days\\" which never were for most people in this country, at least those who weren't white males or economically privileged. I've grown up with his kind and the world is far more complex than they wish it would be. They ascribe to all the shoulds of fairy tales and storybook religion, not enlightened, mindful, compassionate, thoughtful spirituality. Dobson, Falwell, Bennett, Robertson, Bauer -- all the same types and perspectives -- these are not the people Jesus would consider spiritual leaders or people to be emulated from my perspective. Any reader would be far better served by the works and insights of James Garabarino, Dan Millman, Geoffrey Africa, William S. Pollack, John Stoltenberg among others who are far more thoughtful and informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's going in the trash!","review":"How about we all just accept our boys for the beautiful, unique people they are! Don't waste your time or money with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bringing up boys","review":"I hoped to read this book and gain a better understanding of the emotional needs of raising a son. What I received was highly offensive material that probably had a place in our moralistic views over 50 years ago, but do not apply in today's age.While I understand that books are strictly opionions expressed on paper, I thought that I might find a more useful tool from this gentleman who holds a Ph.D. I am a mother and I found myself gasping several times during this book - I just could not believe that he had the audacity to write some of these idiacies. To papraphrase one quote, \\"boys should not act goofy. Woman will not follow a male who displays this characteristic\\".In closing, I highly sympathize with Dr. Dobson's wife and daughter. I cannot imagine living with someone who has such a narrow perspective. He should not claim to be an expert on the subject of child-rearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is deceiving!","review":"The book doesn't actually give any sound parenting advice for helping raise boys.

Once the book arrived, I excitedly read the jacket and realized there was a section on homosexuality. We live in an urban area and many of our friends and family are homosexual so one could say I am impartial....Anyhow, I thought it would be interesting to see what this author had to say about homosexuality. Evidently he thinks it is a mental illness and that one can be \\"changed\\". I did not read further and while my friend thought I should read the rest of the book to see what I could \\"get\\" from it...I begged to differ.

Don't parent out of love. Parent with fear. Before buying this book do some research on the author. What his views are on every imaginable topic. What he is a \\"dr.\\" of.

What can i tell about the author who thinks that homosexuality is a desease?? He also believes that it can be cured!!!! If the author had been gay he would've known better. What about tha people who have gay sons??? I tink that this book is completely outdated and reminds me in many places the books of the beginning of the century. A lot of religious stuff and no information. The next thing such authors would like to advise you to do is to put some kind of device to prevent the teenaged boys from masturbation like in 19-th century books. Well, in 2 words - back to 19 th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I read this book before my son was born and I will read it many more times through the years to come. I must warn you that if you don't first agree with Dr. Dobson's beliefs, you might find this book a little offensive. While he does generalize a bit he gives an unapologetic view of masculinity, something sorely needed today. While some people focus on the \\"blame game\\" in this book I think Dobson was trying to caution people on stifling the development of masculinity in many of our young men. This book can help mothers understand the reasoning behind much of what their sons and husbands do and will help fathers understand themselves better in order to equip both parents to raise a son who is not ashamed of who he is, as well as become the man he will want to be. I started to read this book to become a better dad and I became a better man. Thank you Dr. Dobson."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO, Dr. Dobson!","review":"Having degrees in psychology and theology I honestly didn't expect to encounter anything mindblowing. HOW I DID!! Dobson's book exposes how negatively influenced we have become by our culture regarding boys and men. He methodically outlines how prevasive and critical the attack is on them in a way that will offend lots of people - but that is the beauty of the book: He didn't write it to be popular, but to help our boys! His passion for the subject fuels him and makes his \\"discussions\\" (it reads like a lecture)unforgettable. This is not an objective manual on boys, it is a manifesto on the future of mankind. I am so greatful for the powerful and pragmatic insight it provided. Thank you so much, Dr. Dobson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book- a must read","review":"While I can understand that the book may be inflammatory to those without a Christian world view, it nonetheless contains outstanding wisdom on bringing up children in the modern era. I wish my parents had read it! It would have potentially saved me from serious strife in the teen years.Dr. Dobson presents his views on how society has mislead us when it comes to raising boys. I thought his arguments were provocative; however they were well-documented and logical. Some chapters I was patting myself on the back for how my wife and I are raising our two sons and others I had to seriously question Dr. Dobson or my though process on bringing them up. Despite a very critical nature, I could find nothing fundamentally wrong with his advice or instruction.This has been a very important book in my life, and I strongly recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last","review":"I only wish this book had been written sooner. Covers not only differences in raising boys and girls but also specific periods by age / development. It is well-organized, easily read and has been truly helpful to us and several friends we have loaned the book to. If you have specific questions in raising your son, or working with boys as a youth leader / teacher, this book will prove worth every penny spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutally honest reflection of society!","review":"This book is an honest look at how society has attempted to change the role of men from bible focused father's to secular, gender neutral wimps. Men and boys are manipulated by the media to believe that if we act as the bible teaches us we are somehow not sensitive to the needs of others in today's culture. This book in fact preaches God's love as Jesus lived it - without compromise. The compromising of God's word is why it is so difficult to distinguish many Christian's from the \\"world\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistitled...","review":"I read 'Bringing Up Boys' in the hopes of finding, as the subtitle promises, \\"practical advice and encouragement\\" for raising my son to be a man of purpose and character. While there certainly are nuggets of practical wisdom scattered throughout, 'Bringing Up Boys' seems to be more of a platform for Dr. Dobson to share his views on gender-related issues in society than a means to provide guidance to parents on specific boy-oriented parenting issues.While I don't necessarily disagree with Dr. Dobson on SOME of his societal observations, many seemed out of place and irrelevant to the subject as defined by the title. I found certain of his views so off-track as to distracted me from the premise of the book.Still, Dr. Dobson seemed to emphasize clearly throughout that our children need to be a priority during the season of their growing up years, and this is certainly a worthy message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth!","review":"This book rings true on so many levels. I have found this book to be an outstanding resource for raising my 7 year old boy. I spend a lot of time with my son, but it's not always easy to know how to mentor and teach a little boy. My work brings me into direct contact with great men, great leaders of industry (I am a corporate attorney) and I believe this book generally describes the method for rearing good men.I also believe any American male (the ones that haven't already been \\"metrosexualized\\") would benefit by reading this book. This book does much to explain and \\"debunk\\" emasculating influences in our modern society, such as thinly-veiled anti-male feminisim which led directly to certain pieces of legislation, the effects of which will be proven harmful to our family institutions.As a corporate attorney for a publicly traded company, former U.S. Army officer, and proud father, I wholeheartedly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"Great book, helpful in different areas, thanks for the fast shipment and packaging, would suggest for parents, thanks so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for women to read!","review":"This book has given me a better insight into how men/boys think. As a woman, I definitely think differently than a man (thank goodness)! I found this book helpful since I have two young boys at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"great good","review":"This book is a must read for parents of boys.

Great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring up Boys","review":"I'm a mother of two boys and after reading Dr. Dobson's book I feel I have a better understanding and appreciation of my boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"This book threw out alot of statistics, which I didn't care for and was very preachy. It trailed off on unrelated tangents from time to time just like a preacher on a pulpit who gets sidetracked from his original sermon. I was expecting more practical advice on raising my son and instead learned more than I wanted to know about how Nazi soldiers were desensitized to killing and other Nazi attrocities. Another book I read, \\"Raising Cain: Protecting the emotional life of boys\\" was so much better than this book, and actually changed my view of all the men in my life. I reccomend you read that book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely misleading....","review":"There was no mention to all the religious references in the Audio CD. I could not get through all of it due to the constant references to how you \\"cannot raise children without a strong faith in Jesus Christ.\\" This completely turned me off to the rest of the book and I feel that the descrition misrepresented what the book was about. It should have said that it is about raising children with the help of the Lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I am about to adopt 2 boys and a neighbor said that I just HAD to read this book. I have been reading a number of books that have given clear and positive advice and opinions, this book was not one of those books. I sat down with my highlighter ready to mark interesting passages and quickly realized that there were none. I feel that this book is more about the author's views on the state of the \\"traditional\\" family, feminism and homosexuality than the unique challenges of raising a boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Helpful","review":"I requested this book as a Christmas gift and was looking forward to reading it, hoping to get some parental insight.Only one chapter offered any of this. It was the chapter on discipline(The 2nd to the last chapter.)The rest of the book was aimed at telling me what all was wrong with the world and how the decks are stacked against my boy. Honestly,every time I read the book, I was angry and moody for the rest of the day. What mom needs that?!Firstly, I don't agree that the \\"ills\\" of culture are all pervasive in every segment of the country, much less a state or city. Further it seems as though Dr. Dobson, along with his Focus On the Family ministry are working very hard to sell a world view that is very much against modern culture. And the sad part is that he doesn't really even argue the point well.However, I hope to teach my son to see where God is in our culture and work to spread that light instead of shying away from the world around him for fear that it is all bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh... Disgusting.","review":"How can this man claim to be a doctor? If you want biased information from a homophobic, feminist-hating quack, buy this book.As a single mother, I was looking for specific information on how to help my son with male only issues, and all I got was a lecture on the importance of the bible and a rant about how traditional family values ought to be followed - WHICH ARE DANGEROUS!!!Fast-forward to the future \\"Mr.\\" Dobson, women are tired of domineering, repressing, men. Let's raise our boys with an appreciation of both genders, less violence, appreciation of different religions, and RESPECT FOR WOMEN!I cannot imagine how many people you have corrupted with this trash.If anyone out there wants some real information on family, buy a book that focuses on family - not one particular gender."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to do it right!","review":"I've read several books written by Dr. Dobson. I picked this title hoping to be enlightened. As a single mother of an almost teenage son, this book is a God send. It has given me scientific understanding of the intricate way my son thinks. It has shown me how to appreciate my child. This book has also shown me how important it is for me to celebrate my son's masculinity. Femininity may be more graceful, polite, and serene, but it is not BETTER than masculinity. Dr. Dobson has eloquently made it \\"OK\\" to be a masculine male in this society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth in Advertsing","review":"Title should say ... \\"according to the Bible\\" ...to explain why mothers should backoff at 18mo age. What people need is balance, and if mothers are 'observers' the boy will think that all women are to be passive. Be selective (obviously) how you take the suggestions ... its not the gospel truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for anyone with boys","review":"I have recently become a fan of Dr. Dobson. This was a very eye opening look into a boy's world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Disappointment","review":"This book totally failed to provide reliable direction, useful and dependable principles that work in raising boys today. Its views are an arrogant old right wing conservative propaganda which demonizes others who do not comply or agree with their own views. The author uses fear and hate to express his frustrations concerning women own decisions, absolutely hates homosexuals, advocates for negative thinking and demoralizes people in general that do not fit his perfect little square. It trully didn't offer much help at all.I had very high hopes for this book to offer me some Christian insight in raising my three little boys but as the author described himself in the book \\"I felt like the world's biggest hypocrite\\", I am certain, that he really must be one. Charles R. Swindoll has good books about parenting too and he is not as judgemental and rude as Dr. Dobson came acroos in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUT OF TOUCH","review":"James C. Dobson's book is sadly out of touch with the world. His affronts against homosexuals girls and women are outrageous. His book is littered with hypocrisy and his often mindless banter leads him down a dangerous path that is overtly hateful. The author hides behind the \\"Word of the Lord\\" as a political and liturgical shield against the criticism that his spiteful and antiquated words and ideals generate. The book does an excellent job of showing us how to raise our sons to be homophobic misogynists and is recommended only to those who seek these traits in their children."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO stars","review":"I mistakenly bought this book without doing enough research. I wish I'd never spent the money on this book that I ended up putting in the trash because there is no way I'm going to pass this book along so that others can think this is a worthy book. The author has an entire chapter dedicated to how to keep your sons from becoming homosexuals. I was sick to my stomach reading his hateful words. Do not buy this book. Homosexuality is not a choice. I love my son, I am better off no reading anything in this book, knowing that whatever my son chooses, my husband and I will support him and love him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless drivel - misleading title, biblical propaganda","review":"My wife bought this book without reviewing the synopsis here on Amazon. Big mistake. At first glance the book appears to be a genuine effort to educate parents on the subject of raising boys. However, this book is nothing more than typical Focus on the Family, Christian right rantings, packaged as something mainstream. It is written for people who already buy into this philosophy and will simply infuriate those who are anywhere left of Jerry Falwell. Utter self-righteous garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Disgusted!!!!!","review":"Too bad I didn't read the reviews before I bought this book. I was more and more disgusted with every page. I picked this up thinking there might be some good parenting advice. Boy was I wrong, it just teaches contempt of anyone who does not conform to a perfect standard of a male dominated family. These are certainly not the values that I intend to teach to my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Mom expecting a boy.","review":"My Mother gave me this book. I couldn't finish reading it I was so offended. This guy sounds really paranoided. Even as a Catholic I couldn't idenitfy with his preachings. This book was filled with negativity, fingerpointing and stereotyping. I was ashamed that my own Mother would have everygiven me this rubbish as a parenting tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely and disgustingly ignorant!!!!!","review":"This man, rather this ignorant biased bigot, is so offensive in his \\"advice\\" on rearing boys, that I literally wanted to spit in the book!!! I am a mother of a wonderful little preschool aged boy. Not having a father or brother, I am interested in advice on raising a son. I earned my undergraduate degree in biological anthropology and evolution with work in evolutionary psychology and human sexuality. I feel quite certain that I have a strong knowledge of human behavior and biology. This author claims that homosexuality is \\"abnormal\\" and capable of \\"treating\\"! I really shudder to think how many beautiful young men and boys have been harmed or worse by those callous enough to believe this verbal vomit. This book should be removed from book store shelves as a potential basis for child abuse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rhetorical Wish Wash","review":"I wanted to buy this book. After 10 minutes I saw way too many reasons to avoid it like the plague. Dobson's arguments regarding the nuclear family are inaccurately portrayed. He values marriage and biblical meanings over the ability for a parent to love their child and attempt to do the best they can.He bases his arguments on articles on the family that are a complete disconnect to the historiographical discussion going on about family since Ancient Rome. The nuclear family is nonsense, a family is what it is regardless of how many or combination of sexes."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the genius who exposed the Sponge Bob conspiracy...","review":"James Dobson is the same Rapture Right nut who told us that the cartoon character Sponge Bob was a tool of Satan designed to make your children gay. In this book, he draws more nonsensical conclusions about how society makes one gay, how distant fathers make one gay, etc., the ugly premise being that being gay--whatever the cause may be--is something to be condemned and avoided. So, if intolerance and superstitious pseudo-science are your thing, this is your book. But if you want to step up on the evolutionary ladder and start respecting human diversity, pass on this and all of Dobson's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass it up","review":"Mr. Dobson has some interesting insights into boys and how they think, but I feel he has anti-women and homo-phobic issues of his own. Reading this book initially caused me to doubt my own instincts as a mother. I would recommend reading The Discipline Book by Dr. Sears instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boys don't stand a chance","review":"This book should be named Boys don't stand a chance. This is the worst book I ever read. I didn't even finish it. The more I read the madder I got. This book had nothing to do with raising boys. It is a very negative book about how boys do not have a chance. I was very disappointed. I thought I was going to learn how to be a better father. If there was anything in the book about that, I must have missed it. I was very disappointed. I think Mr. Dobson should keep his opinions to himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dobson's teachings CONTRADICT Jesus's","review":"What I find interesting is that Dobson claims that we should let our sons play with guns, and do the 'harmless' bam, bam, you're dead routine. He claims this is a healthy male behavior. Dobson's teachings on this directly contradict Jesus's. If Jesus was on the earth now, do you think he would encourage people to have their sons play killing people? Shooting people is an act of murder, or does Dobson not see this? The fact that children are doing it in a role acting way does not make it any less insidious. Do you think if Jesus had a son while he was on earth, he would give him the Dobson advice, go ahead son, play the harmless game of bam bam, you're dead!???Dobson's teachings directly contradict Jesus's. Dobson pulled this one out of his own ego, and his imagination of what Jesus is. Or perhaps he didn't enter Jesus into the equation at all, but decided to speak for God himself.A disturbed concerned follower of Jesus"},{"rating":"1","title":"Archaic Christian Beliefs with a few facts thrown in","review":"This book is heavily focused on the author's opinions about Christian ideas of a family structure and archaic gender roles and has many interpretations correlating to the Bible and church. Extremely anti-femininst and spends a lot of time knocking feminist ideas, which doesnt' seem relative to the overall point of the book. Not very heavy on useful facts or practical applications. Is far more opinionated than I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias and conditional acceptance","review":"Sadly, James Dodson has continued to provide his biased and denegrading perspective toward people outside his narrow and 'conservative' perspective. It's too bad God's unconditional love he claims to call upon does not extend to his beliefs in raising, mentoring, and bring up healthy boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very socially conservative viewpoint","review":"This guy is very conservative. He believes women should stay at home to raise their boys, but boys need to decide whether they will grow up to be men or women, based on the examples from their fathers. If boys grow up to be gay, it's because they didn't have masculine role models, according to Dobson.His approach is very unscientific and relies too much on articles and editorials from the popular press (e.g., newspapers and magazines). For example, the references for his chapter on \\"The Origins of Homosexuality\\" are mostly from the popular press. He includes only one reference from a peer-reviewed journal and that is from 1968.If you agree with this guy's social agenda, then maybe you'll like what he has to say. Otherwise, I'd look for something based more on solid science."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's too bad we can't give negative stars","review":"My husband and I received this as a gift and were appalled at the anti-feminist, homophobic, religious morality rhetoric contained within this book. It is a dangerous misrepresentation of imperical psychological data to formulate correlations that are not only incorrect but also insulting. The level of chauvinism and bigotry are astounding. The author includes amusing antecdotes and a few remedial suggestions for raising boys. However, this only hides the fact that he wants you to raise homophobic, masogonistic children that will be more confused about themselves and the world that they live in. You will be better served choosing another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Closed minded","review":"It was a great book for half of the book - and then I hit the chapter describing how gay people just need to be 'cured', and I had to give up the book to someone else who'd not have a problem reading that kinda language!Guess that's the trouble with reading books from 'traditional religious' authors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't look for actual advice on raising a boy","review":"If you are looking for parenting advice on boys, do not choose this book.The bits and pieces of good advice you can find throughout the book are common sense and intuitive for any caring and educated parent.I am not even going to argue with James Dobson's opinions. Everybody is entitled to their own beliefs. But I do have to say I was appalled by the narrow-mindedness and overall negative world view. As a working mother I felt insulted to be told (more or less directly) that I am basically endangering my child by exposing him to daycare and public school teachings because I am a greedy overachiever who is not willing to make enough sacrifices for my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dobson followers prefer MALE children","review":"Unfortunately, many of the people I interact with daily are Dobson followers. A common trend among them is that when expecting their first child, most of them prefer male children. Some of them only want boys, never girls. Upon further inquiry, I realized they believe in Dobson's theory of sex based job division, where men with children can choose the career of their dreams, and women with children have to stay home the whole time to raise them. I thought this was an extreme view, and it certainly is not in the Bible. They keep saying the value of the sexes are equal, just the roles are different. Why then I wonder would they strongly prefer boys over girls? When I ask them that, they just blush and change the subject or give some lame excuse..Deep down inside, they know they would rather have a child who can grow up to be an astronaut, and not one who, according to their distorted thinking, can only be her astronaut husband's housewife."},{"rating":"1","title":"PREACHING OR TEACHING ?","review":"I bought this book thinking it was going to teach me something about raising my boys. Instead I got some right wing conservative preaching to me about the unravaling of society based on this obvious strong religious beliefs. If I want preaching I go to church. I want to learn about how to raise my boys. I also don't agree with the dicipline part. So in a nut shell it says spank your kids and send them to church. What a quack."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gospel According To Morons...","review":"I was pi**ed off after reading the first chapter. Hoping to get some good advice on raising my son, I found myself receiving moronic views on life, religion, and kids in general. A hardcore purveyor of \\"Spare the rod, spoil the child\\", this guy thinks you should kick your kids a** everyday. If you don't like beating your kids all the time, you probably won't like his point of veiw. I was raised in the church but don't warm up to hearing others skrewed up opinions. Just because some minister says it, dosen't mean it's true. Don't waste your $$. Another product of our lame society believing these so-called religious leaders who are getting rich off their stupid opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read not for information, but for humour.","review":"James Dobson has yet again attempted to use an \\"advice\\" book as a vessel for his religious dogma. He uses Bible verses to justify every bit of poor, or, in many cases, false information which form the core of this book. Clearly, Dobson refuses to believe any modern scientific evidence if it conflicts at all with the Bible, a very poor mindset to hold indeed. This is a predictable effort by him: Many of his other works are being used to achieve the same goal. I wouldn't buy this book under any circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting look into the worldview of a complete nut.","review":"Dobson is a dangerous theocrat with extreme paranoid fantasies about homosexuals.

There's really nothing new here.If you want to read a book that is both insightful and practical, try Robert Lewis' Raising a Modern Day Knight. This is an excellent book for those who have no \\"Manhood\\" plan at all for their sons. For those who do have a game plan for their sons, Lewis' book will be a great resource in the firming up of those plans. Raising a Modern Day Knight by Robert Lewis is definitely a \\"Five Star\\" book! Don't waste your time with Bringing Up Boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would make Jesus vomit","review":"I consider myself religious, and was horribly offended by the philosophical underpinnings of this book.These days \\"Focus on the Family\\" is all about \\"Focus on the Money\\" and it relies on hate-mongering to sell its products.

This book is what I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong with Dr. Dobson","review":"This is a great look into how and why boys and girls SHOULD be treated differently. They are wired differently and should be respected as such. Dr. Dobson hits another one out of the park.

If we make our boys react like girls, one of them won't be necessary....BALANCE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raising the bar for our boys.","review":"This book gives great advise to parents wanting to raise the bar for their son. If you want to be proactive about your son's development and not allow the world to have the bigger influence, then this book is for you. If you want to encourage your son to seek God's Way, then this book is for you. Dr. Dobson portrays the heart of boys in a joyful and exciting light.

It also helped me understand my 35 year old husband!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing Up Boys","review":"As a Single Mother I feel lost raising a boy.

What I got from this book was a lot of information about the state of the American culture and the American family. I found out about a lot of the problems in society that threaten masculinity, but Dobson's cure (the traditional, nuclear family) is already unavailable for me. Unfortunately, with the massive amount of societal commentary, I got very little parenting advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I found Bringing Up Boys very relevant and practical for guidelines that we, as parents, should instill in our children to prepare them for adulthood. I also gained insight that I know will be beneficial to my daughter as well.

Unfortunately the whole 300 + pages will mostly be useful to those who are interested in statistics and sophisticated language. It is just rambling about social issues. The author is defending conservative views throughout the book. There is no need to defend them, I already agree with them. There is nothing new, no details on bringing up boys. Waste of money, waste of time.As for working mom issue. He suggests that moms work from home. Work is work. Working from home and dealing with kids all day is even more chalenging than leaving them in day care for 8 hours. That way kids do not get the attention they need, work suffers and mom is struggling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is an amazing book. I could not put it down.

I had a boss flanger that was a few years old and when I bought this, I sold the boss. There's no reason for anyone to go pay 70-80 bucks for a pedal you get for 15 bucks that'll sound relatively the same. The only difference between this and the more expensive pedals is u get more range w/ the dials on the boss and digi's but personally I don't think it's worth the xtra 60 bucks. Also the more expensive ones are made of metal, but the Danelectro's not made of cheap plastic, although it is plastic.

They're very quiet and sound great. For someone who wants to explore effect processing, these are a great start. Same goes if you are just expanding your pedalboard like myself. The only cons are you can't see the setting of the knob from the top (but it does give you the experience of trusting your ears and not your eyes to create the right effects) and the footswitch is difficult to trigger if the box is sitting behind another pedal.And to the review whining about not getting a battery with the pedal...WWWAAHHH WWAAHH WWAAHH!!!!

I have been knitting for years and am very disappointed in the book. It does have very cute patterns, but that's about as far as it goes. The author instructions are vague even making reference to looking on the internet to learn a stitch. It's nice to know what's used for the pattern in the photo, however unless you have ready access to a large yarn shop you are pretty left on your own to figure ply and weight.

I cannot recommend this double square enough. Really quality product, heavy and well made. Absolutely perfect, great size because it fits in a apron pocket or coat pocket easily. You probably want to get a larger Starrett combo square too, but for checking tools or other measuring devices as well as taking small measurements, this tool cannot be surpassed. The price may seem a little steep, but there is probably no greater favor you can do yourself and your projects than having dead accurate measuring devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Red Sox?","review":"Are you kidding?

It has a great sound to it for rock, country, and classical music. Also with some Jazz and Blues music. The bass on the Zen Stone is good for the product. The cost is way better that what most people spend on a i-pod and I feel that the sound quality is just a bit better than that of apple's i-pod.

It's small, easy to work and at 7 he's not to concerned about seeing what he's playing. He just wants to listen to his favorite songs while he's doing homework, riding in the car, or someplace that's boring to him. It was one of my better ideas. Listening to his music keeps him happy and QUIET when we are traveling or waiting somewhere. Plus, it teaches him to build up responsiblity for the day he gets a bigger MP3 like and Ipod.

I would recommend the zen stone to anyone who is looking for a compact player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift for a technophobe music lover","review":"I bought this as a gift for my 74 year old father, who is completely untechnical but has a love for obscure music that nobody else wants to listen to.

All he has to remember how to do is to press the middle button to turn it on and off.I found the Creative Media Lite software to be easy and intuitive to use, and the Zen Stone is light, attractive, and SIMPLE for someone who would never be able to navigate screens. The sound quality is excellent (I replaced the earbuds with an inexpensive portable headset) and my father is thrilled with it. He \\"loves his Zen\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good so far","review":"I've had mine for about a month, and it seems great. I mostly listen to books while I clean, and it's loud and clear enough to listen to while vacuuming. One gig is a lot of space for the price, and it's small and lightweight enough to take with you always. The only conceivable downside is that it has no display, which can be troublesome when trying to find a specific place on a long track. This is made up for by the very low cost and the intuitive controls. So far, I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NAPSTER COMPATIBILITY","review":"I bought this item because I've owned several other creative zen products and never had trouble with them (plus i have a vendetta against apple, ugh) but this is the first creative device I've owned that DIDNT SYNC WITH NAPSTER!!!!

Gave it to my mother for Christmas and she's crazy about it. The 1GB is perfect for a few CDs worth of music and is very easy to load. Her only problem with it is that if it gets cold (like if she left it in the car overnight during cold weather) it needs to warm up before it will turn on. Not a huge deal but something to be aware of in case it happens to you. Don't panic! Just wait for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"We have four of these little stones in our family, mainly for use while exercising, and they are incredible. For about $20 you would expect a cheap product. But they have good sound, an ok battery life (~8 hours total use, lose very little charge when off, and they charge quite fast), decent sized memory, very small size, VERY light (you really don't even need an armband, just shove it in your shirt, the headphones are almost heavier than the stone itself), and virtually indestructible!We had one accidentally go through the clothes washer (check your pockets) and then drier and it still worked! About a month later, it took another whirl through the washing machine. This time it looked like it had had it, so we bought another inexpensive brand player to replace it.After a few weeks the new player fell apart. Decided to check the now very clean stone to see if the weeks of drying had done anything, and...worked great and is still going strong months later."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this little player!","review":"I justed needed something for the gym, but I got a whole lot more.All I had to do was connect it to my computer (with the USB cord that came with it), then drag and drop the files I wanted.

Additionally, it charges by being plugged into the computer (my old prehistoric iriver was battery powered).It's small enough that I keep it in my school pencil bag or, when not at the gym, it fits into my pocket for listening on the go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but battey life is disappointing","review":"This is a decent, low-priced product. It is so tiny and light that it is great for use when walking/jogging/cycling. My only complaint is the battery life. Using 192kbps WMAs, battery life was a disappointing 2.5-3 hours. Using 64kbps WMAs increased battery life to 8+ hours and allows for a LOT of songs in 1GB. With ear buds and street noise, sound quality isn't great, so trading lower bit rates for longer battery life is acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative Zen Stone MP3 Player","review":"I bought this to listen to audio books downloaded for Windows Media Player and Overdrive through the local library because their program does not work with i-pods. The Creative Zen Stone player is difficult to determine what chapter you are listening to and you have no visual. There may be several chapters located in the same folder and you can spend a lot of time trying to determine your \\"bookmark.\\" The music quality is good, just not good for audio books which was my only purpose for purchasing it. It would be nice if Apple products could be used with the library downloadable programs."},{"rating":"1","title":"i used to love all things pink, but this just sucks","review":"After charging all night, I attempted to turn this mp3 player on and no luck. I heard nothing. Since there is no screen or noise, I had no idea what was wrong.

Then I went to the creative zen website to try to find more information and nothing helped. Therefore I sent the player back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made cheap","review":"Came with ear buds that one wire to one was way longer than the other, luckily I had other sets.

I have had good luck with other Zen players so I thought this would be a good buy. I got from the people who reviewed the black stone that this was a great piece of equipment at a great value. Well, maybe it is if you buy the black one, but the pink one is a piece of junk. The first one (yes, I returned it for another one) would not charge at all, would not turn on and generally refused to work. I returned it to amazon thinking the one I received was defective, until I had the same problem with the second pink stone I received. At this point I do not want another stone and I will be looking for another mp3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Zen Srone is terrible","review":"Not only is the zen stone obsolete and old, it's hard to use and quits for no reason!

So I picked up a 1 GbCreative Zen Stone 1 GB MP3 Player (Pink)Stone for taking to the gym and all. It's way cool. I just loaded lots of my favorite songs from Windows Media Player and play away. I was heart-broken when it went through a full cycle in our washing machine, -I didn't know until I heard it clanging around in the dryer. But a few hours later I checked it out and, luckily, it still worked just fine! Pink wasn't my first choice but it was the least expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad little unit...","review":"I received this to replace a creative zen nano I had that someone smashed at work.. It's a nice little player, just like the nano, it's very easy to transfer files from pc to the player. This is a good, no frills type of unit, battery life (rechargable through usb) is pretty good lasting almost two days with practically continual play. It's great to not have to worry about batteries. If you have music in your car, music on your phone but want this as a beat around to carry your music, it's pretty good. No display, no speaker, no led. Pretty straight forward, does what it was intended to do, not bad.. I don't like what apple has done, This IMHO is just as good as the ipod shuffle and not as restricted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dies after 20 minutes","review":"The Zen Stone worked fine for the first two weeks. But then it started turning off after about 20 minutes of use. It could not be restarted immediately. I returned it to the store and got another. But the new one did the exact same thing on its first day of use. I think it may have to do with being out in the cold. When it worked for the first two weeks, temperatures were still in the 50's or above. The problem seems to occur when temperatures are below around 45 degrees. I would not recommend it if you plan to use it outside in cold weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it. . .","review":"However after a year the connection to my headphones got really weird.

I'll just be changing the songs a lot whenever my taste changes. The screen that comes with PLUS is useful, but I'm still glad I have the 1 GB one.

There's no heat between the two main leads. The 2 1/2 stars I grant it come from the charming secondary characters, and the plot line, which is better than average for a Harlequin. I appreciated the way the author varied to and from the heroine's and hero's viewpoints. Still, it was mostly the heroine's viewpoint and she's kind of weak. It had sweet moments but frankly this one could be passed over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band in a sea of mediocrity","review":"Back in the late eighties CKLC radio had a weekly top five from Britain and that is when I first heard \\"Crash\\". I was lucky enough to purchase the Crash album.I dindn't even think Kingston record stores would carry it since they were an obscure group to most listeneres. It turned out to be one of the best albums I ever bought. Sadly my sister \\"borrowed\\" it one day to lend to a friend and that was the last time I saw it (and heard from it). Fifteen years later, looking in used record stores in Kingston proved a fruitless task, the discovery of this best of disk was a great find. The music is even better after the long wait and puts to shame the noise that dominates the airwaves today. I can never understand why smaller, less known bands with great lyrics, melody, voice, and musicianship remain so obscure while the likes of Britney Spears make millions. There is no justice in the music world! Anyway, this collection is worth a million to me and is highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It!","review":"If you've stumbled accross this band and this page, I have one suggestion - buy this CD! The Primitives are a great little band from England that produced great, sharp and edgy music in the late 80's. Every song on this disc is worth listenting too. I got a chance to see The Primitives in person twice in the late 80's and they were very talented live as well. Catchy songs with great vocals make this band unique. You won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"greatgreatgreat","review":"Kudos to previous reviewer, as he has said all I want to say i.e. primitives being one of the truly great and underappreciated bands of the eighties.

There's no filler. I never found myself turning a page and asking, \`what the heck did I just read?' 2) The customer satisfaction concepts were presented in the most simple manner possible. Anybody at any level of a company can understand and use the book. Right now, my V.P. of Operations and one of my 18 year old co-op students are reading it, and they're both getting some good ideas. 3) The book includes a wide range of tools, along with instructions on how to use and how not to use each one.In summary, this is a good, practical book you can start using before you're even done reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a set of Pipes!","review":"I bought this cd for \\"Street where you live.\\" The man will bring tears to your eyes, I swear.

It's not even enjoyable in that bad movie kind of way. And Monique Parent keeps her clothes one throughout the entire movie. No T&A in this one. Save your time and money.

They remain caricatures but can sometimes be extremely successful. Foster has crafted an interesting and compelling story about how these people interact with their world and provides some insight into their motivations. They can be dangerous, but are also very easy to spot. Sometimes winning isn't worth it, and sometimes accomplishing a goal can jeopardize something more important.In addition to being a nice read this novel can serve to help a young professional consider their ethical/moral bearing. Foster knows real estate and loves LA and makes both inviting to the reader. I highly recommend this book to anyone starting a career in an aggressive and competitive field or to anyone who likes a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A no-go for all","review":"This figure is not what I expected.

A real pleasure reading about his adventure with humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oooo la la","review":"What a lovely visit to France. I enjoyed Goodman's honest appraoch to this book. It was like having a conversation. As a fairly advid gardener myself, I especially enjoyed the discussion of his garden. The people he encounters seem quite genuine and true to nature. Sometimes, it's inspiring to live in a foreign land--- even if for just a handful of hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"You don't have to be interested in gardening or France to enjoy Goodman's book. The most powerful theme, for me, was the conquest of the feelings of naiveté, self-doubt and cultural alienation that so often envelope travelers when they immerse themselves in a different setting. Goodman's garden is a conduit that allows him to abandon some of the high-paced hangups and anxieties of American life for a simpler, more pleasurable existence. Yes, this book is about nature, and Goodman cultivates a inspiring love for his garden and his work, but what moved me the most was the way he cut through his own self-consciousness, the way he dropped his guard on and off the page without worrying about failing as a gardener or a writer or in any other role. In my opinion, that's what gives this book its punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful read!","review":"Richard Goodman's year in France produced more than a beautiful garden, it also produced a wonderful book! Needing a break from the hustle and bustle of New York, Goodman and his girlfriend Iggy rent a house in a tiny village in France for a whole year to just get away. Wanting to connect with this town and its' people, Goodman offers his help to those who will take it. In doing so, he comes in close contact with the land itself which leads him to decide he will grow his own garden.What follows is this man's love affair with the people, the land and the simple act of creating and nurturing life in his small plot of earth. Wonderfully told in beautiful prose, Goodman's story will leave you feeling happy and content and, oddly enough, wanting to grow your own garden although perhaps in your own backyard."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"As an avid gardener, I was excited to read this book and then sorely disappointed. The author is clueless and not in a charming way, he seems to approach his garden as one with ADD would, later abandoning it entirely after much help and assist from others. His infatuation with a young frenchman is strange. The book does not give insight into the french not does it illicit any clear gardening instruction or technique. He and his girlfriend simply plop the plants they bought into the ground. With nothing else to do, he is at the garden twice a day weeding and watering. The author clearly has friends in publishing for this story to get binded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Experience","review":"Richard Goodman has a wonderful command of words.

I can say with 100% certainty that this is the biggest piece of crap ever committed to film. There is a reason that it made damn near nothing at the box office and only in theaters for a couple of weeks.This is not a modern day \\"Slap Shot\\", that was a good movie.

It seemed like it wanted to be as funny as an old school Happy Gilmore with the whole rough-guy hockey thing, but there was ZERO creativity with it. They also used the F word in nearly every sentence. The F word sounded forced, largely unnecessary, and in a desperate attempt to make something funnier than it was; add some shock value. It didn't work, and it just made the movie seem even more stupid.I would MAYBE have found it entertaining in Jr. High, but not high school or even college, unless I was inebriated somehow. But, even then my time would've been better spent seeing something else.There has only been two other movies that I have ever not watched all the way through in my 32 years on this Earth, this is now the third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really??!","review":"I don't understand how anyone liked this movie, let alone how it got such a high average rating. The writing and acting are atrocious. I love action movies, I love sports movies, but this one could barely be called a movie at all! I'm just stupefied by the reviews this has received. Was it because of the corny comedy? Was it because of the language and violence? I don't mind any of those things in a movie, but when you combine it with contrived dialogue that not only sounds scripted but is delivered with such a absence of acting, it just becomes something absurd.The only thing I liked about the movie was Liev Schreiber who, as usual, delivers a good performance, possibly one of the most underrated actors around. I'd have given the movie two stars because of him being in it, but the movie was so poorly made and acted that I couldn't do it!I'm happy for those of you that enjoyed the movie, I suppose, but for me, this movie is possibly one of the worst I've ever seen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given Goon negative stars if it was allowed","review":"Worst.

Boy, was I surprised. I laughed till I cried. This movie is the antidote to The View and Tom Hanks and Activia commercials. I honestly don't know how they worked a girl into it (the writer's squeeze, by the way). Coarse, crass and hilarious, it's like Adam Sandler with the gloves off and about a hundred extra IQ points. It's the script. Don't come looking for a story. There is one, but it doesn't matter. It's the things they say. I was expecting a hockey movie. Don't come looking for that, either. Come looking to wet your pants laughing at the brutal, incisive gags."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immensely enjoyable","review":"The best hockey movie since Slap Shot, Goon is an immensely enjoyable treat. Seann William Scott plays Doug, a dim-witted but kind-hearted bouncer that finds his true calling as an ice hockey enforcer. Soon enough he finds himself in Halifax making a name for himself, eventually earning the love of the crowd, fans, his teammates, and catching the attention of veteran league thug Ross Rhea (Liev Schreiber). In between all that is some hilarious moments and brutal hockey action, all of which gets captured almost perfectly. Jay Baruchel, who co-wrote and co-produced the film, is on board as well as Doug's foul-mouthed friend, who chews every scene he's in with gleeful abandon. For what it's worth it isn't perfect, but Goon delivers the goods for hockey and comedy fans alike. There aren't that many good hockey-related movies out there, which helps make Goon all the sweeter. Check it out, you'll be glad that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the best hockey movie ever!","review":"i am a huge hockey fan so when I saw this movie ad on facebook it caught my eye.

If you liked this movie you would also likeThe Hammer"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for his 2 fists","review":"Goon is a true story about Doug Glatt. Being a fan of hockey and a fan of all the main actors in this movie made me think I'd really enjoy this movie, but I didn't. The acting is very dry, but probably had to be because that's how the script was probably written. The movie is very slow also and keeps you wondering when it'll be over. If you're into hockey and like true stories then you might like it, but I doubt it. I had a better time googling and reading about him then the movie portrays him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Can't Skate and Has No Story","review":"If you're looking for a good movie to watch, don't be fooled by the high ratings given for this one. The movie looks like it's going to weave together some other back-stories (i.e. his parents dislike of his choice, his relationship with his gay brother, his wanna-be girlfriend history, his teammates, etc), but the movie spends absolutely no time in creating any story of any kind. The \\"Goon\\" is portrayed as an idiot, but the movie never goes beyond the basic information of an mentally \\"challenged\\" wanna-a-be hockey enforcer who can't skate and his unexplained loyalty to his team just because they gave him a job. It's clear why this movie didn't last in the theater, but it's not clear to me why so many others rated this movie so highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked","review":"not worth watching unless your 15 hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha well yeah i think that about says it dosent it? well i think so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical 2012 \\"comedy\\" - unfunny, lame, boring, drug & toilet humor","review":"Not at all fast moving.

I'm not a big hockey fan to say the least... but I can appreciate a movie that gives a little insight into aspects of the game that I'm familiar with, but have no real knowledge of.

If that's not your thing don't post a review about this movie. On to the movie: I watched the movie with my wife who is not a huge sports fan at all. Neither does she like blood much. This movie had pretty much everything a man loves about a movie - Action, Sports, Fights, Overcoming bull crap in your life. Then it throws in just enough of a romance to keep anyone else with a pulse interested in the rest of the movie.

One of the biggest false beliefs is that hockey players are all goons. This not true and this movie clearly shows this. Sean William Scott plays the role with understated humility and control. Yes, it is violent as the game is, but underneath is a love story. Very well done.

A clasp seems like a pretty simple thing, but the design here was too fancy by far. When I took it to my watchmaker, to have a few links dropped out, he too commented that it was a strange, poor design.Sure enough, it became unclasped 15 minutes later while I was driving (not exactly tough use).Unfortunately, Bulova isn't the same dependable watch it was ten or more years ago, this company is routinely churning out low quality products.Just in case you're in love with the face and thinking of changing the clasp on your own, you should know that the second hand is not in the traditional place (large sweeping hand) it's the little dial at the six o'clock possition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh!","review":"This is a nice watch. However, when it came to me it appeared to have been a returned watch. There was not even a typical clear safety tape to protect the face of the watch.

Because of that I almost would rate it with 2 stars but it just doesn't feel right. The sound quality is ok, so it deserves 3 stars for that.After only 2 weeks, the microphone jack broke. The dongle has a 90 day warranty, but you will have to pay for shipping yourself. Considering the extremely low durability of this product, I did not want to waste any more money on it and just dumped it.My recommendation: Find some other product or DONATE the money for some good cause and feel good about it rather than getting upset because you wasted money for a product that most likely breaks after a short period while Koss is not even willing to handle the replacement at no cost for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money - Don't Buy This","review":"I had high hopes for this dongle- planned to use it to reduce noise when recording vocals. It reduced the noise alright - TO ZERO! The microphone jack was dead on arrival - tried it with three different mikes including two types of condenser and one regular - NOTHING! No Sound! The headphone jack did work but it wasn't impressive - I have a Dell desktop with speaker attachment for my monitor and the sound was MUCH better through my speaker headphone jack then when headphones were plugged direct into the system via USB and this dongle.Save your money - this won't improve much of anything and probably doesn't work any better for boosting sound then the $5.00 versions everyone else is selling.

The sections in the past although interesting suffered from some material from the viewpoint of characters other than the woman who had been hypnotized and was living this twelfth century life. How could that be? I would also have liked to know that some of the characters besides King John were historical BEFORE I read the book.Besides that, the modern woman, Jo, suffered from monumental stupidity. If two men are plaguing you with violence, including rape for heaven's sake you CHANGE THE LOCKS! Especially when one of the men has a key to your flat!The book was also about 200 pages too long since multiple scenes accomplished the same purpose, especially the modern day sequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow but refreshing","review":"For me the book started off pretty slowly, I really didn't get into it till the 3th or 4th chapter. From then on though, I couldn't put it down, I liked the characters better in the past though. I was far more anxious to read about them then Jo and the rest from the 20th century.

The book is 700+ pages. The heroine is repeatedly raped (forceably and not) or otherwise abused by men who supposedly love her. She repeatedly makes stupid choices, leaving the reader to wonder how \\"smart\\" she really is. There are too many irrelevant characters. The ending is completely unsatisfying, given how long I spent to slog through the book. The author is not bad in terms of description, but the only real element of \\"suspense\\" will be figured out by a thinking reader by page 100 or so of the book and is not nearly enough to carry a reader happily through to page 700. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"After viewing the first video of Ernie Haase and Signature Sound, I had high hopes for this DVD, but my hopes were let down. The music is fine, and the entertainment value is fine, but therein lies the problem. The first video with Signature Sound had some good fun mixed in with genuine heart-felt singing. This follow-up video looks like a three-ring circus. I don't question their hearts, but it looks like more thought went into how flashy they could look on stage as opposed to sending a message. The dance moves, pretended frustration with each other, and forced humor just seem to taint the genuiness of the message. Sure, let them have fun while they're singing, let them do a little choreography every once in awhile, but don't make every song another opportunity to show off some catchy move. This was one DVD where the entertainment seemed to displace the message."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for everyone!","review":"If you look good music and fun too, this is a must have item!

A newcomer to the field of sociolinguistics, I found the book both fascinating and enticing; I now have no doubt that I will pursue linguistics in college next year. Dialectical differences within such nations as Switzerland, Luxembourg and Norway are delved into and discussed not exclusively in a linguistic context, but in social and political contexts as well. Trudgull's book is refreshingly absent of the ponderous esoteric jargon that so often detracts from \\"niche\\" works, and which effectively prevent \\"neophytes\\" from enjoying the subject. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Price Love","review":"I usually love everything Stephanie Laurens writes, and bought What Price Love in hardcover, anxious to have a new Laurens novel.

The characters were self effacing and so very gorgeous that I think they loved themselves more than each other. It is the first Laurens book I have not completed. I kept trying, and finally gave up. I'm still a big fan and this willnot stop me from getting her next book, as she is a wonderful writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This is the first book that I actually returned.

One word of note: Read them in order...I sugest reading \\"The Promise of a Kiss\\" first since it is about Sebastian and Helena (Devil Cynster's parents). The story of Devil kicks off the others. Addictive!!!**Dianne Gibbens**"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate Disappointment","review":"I loved the books of the Cynster series up until this one. When you compare with masterpieces like Devil's Bride, this was positively shallow and disappointing. This book got me reading the reviews for the Cynster books that followed this, and I don't think I'd buy any of them. In fact I will give away this book and just pretend that the Cynster series ended with Simon's story.So why didn't I like the story? The whole storyline felt like an altered and lackluster version of Demon and Flick's story (what a great story that was!), but with far less likable characters. I agree with the reviewer who called the characters \\"overly-narcissitic\\", and that was a big turn off. Too much sex (I too ended up skipping pages to get past it), too little integrity on the part of the main characters and just plain boring storytelling in my opinion.All in all, this was a book that I wish I never wasted my money on. Oh well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow characters","review":"Dillon compromised his morals for sex. The excuse didn't ring true that he had to show her the register just because she initiated sex.I also agree with the lack of cleanliness aspects as some other readers have noted. If she was a virgin, shouldn't there have been blood on Dillon's pants? No mention of cleaning up after fingers have been intimate. No means of birth control, which I believe there were some methods in those days. These people hardly bathe. The most they do is wash from a bowl of water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurens Cynster Novels are the best!","review":"I LOVE her Cynster novels and Bastion Club are fantastic. They catch you on the first page and make you want more!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Formulaic and dull","review":"I used to LOVE Stephanie Laurens' novels -- especially her Cynster books. Sadly, she's lost that special something that made one fall in love with her heroes and sigh with satisfaction when the novel ended.I reserved her latest book at the library, and am grateful I didn't spend more than the 75 cent reserve fee for it.In \\"What Price Love?\\" Laurens presents stiff cardboard characters without intriguing personalities. The details about horse racing and \\"the book\\" Dillon was protecting seemed like filler to meet her contract page quota. The mystery was flat, and the ending rushed. Even the traditionally exciting love scenes weren't as hot as usual, because who could care about these people?I am really, really sad to see a favorite author churn out such a lifeless tale. \\"What Price Love?\\" gets two stars instead of one only because Laurens at least gave us an update on some of the other Cynster families."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book yet - Don't bother","review":"I used to love Stephanie Laurens' books and purchased the entire Cynster series (1st generation). The Bastion series has not proven to be as good so I stopped purchasing and read library copies. This last series (2nd generation Cynster)is nothing short of painful. I struggled through Gerard Debbington's story (The Truth About Love) but at least I finished it. This book I stopped at chapter 6 as a waste of time. Ms. Laurens stories have gotten so formulaic and boring that only the character names seem changed from one book to the next. Ms. Laurens should really consider retiring the Cynster saga as these latest very mediocre (I'm being kind here) books denigrate the original series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potboiler","review":"Such a shame that Laurens is getting to be like Amanda Quick (AKA Jayne Ann Krentz). The contract calls for another book and so one is spewed off the computer. I agree with the reviewer who designated this title as BORING! I had to force myself to finish it. The hero and heroine are cardboard cut-outs a la Agatha Christie, the plot is laughable, and the anachronisms abound.And why is there so much sex? 20th century erotica in a victorian dress just does not work!I have to say that if there is one more book like this I will be giving up Stephanie Laurens for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Ditto Anne Fleming!","review":"Anne Fleming's 3/22 review is spot on! Nevermind that readers are supposed to sympathize with these two tortured, rich and devastatingly attractive people, this book's biggest failings are that it's overdone (Laurens has a horrible habit of saying things 4 and 5 times when once - maybe twice - would have sufficed), there is no plot (!), and it's horribly BORING! What's going on with the romance genre?!?! Everything is so BORING lately! After almost 6 years of buying everything she wrote, I stopped buying Laurens' books awhile ago, but took a chance on this one. What a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 pages too long!","review":"This is the first book I haven't read through to the end.

The entire population of England AND Ireland wants them and they are excessively bored by it all...until they meet each other, that is. At last, they've each found something stimulating, but the trade-off is that WE are the ones who have to be bored for the rest of the novel. There's a convoluted and stupid subplot about horse racing featuring a mysterious supervillain who doesn't actually make an appearance until the last fifty pages, just in time for him to threaten the well-being of our dramatically alluring heroine so our hero can save her. And, not to give it away or anything, but save her he does, although by that point you'll probably be wishing he'd been a fraction too late in your haste to be rid of these characters and their cliche psychoses.Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Cynsters","review":"I haven't read this Cynster novel yet.

She seems totally oblivious to the fact that fresh food is available in her regular supermarket and that its just as easy to use in recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied!","review":"Semi-Homemade Cooking 2 is only cookbook I can honestly say my husband and I both enjoy using. Not everybody has time or energy to make the various pieces and parts of a main course from scratch and Sandra Lee's book does a great job of showing you what you can do with ready made ingredients and a little creativity. There are no extra frou-frou steps (like adding vegetables, etc. to make it look like there's more food on the plate) and the recipes are straight forward-- if you want a flavorful beef, chicken or pork main dish there are plenty of unique ideas for rubs and marinades. This is a cookbook for people who want flavorful food and can make their own side dishes instead of having a one-stop plate full of everything mixed together. If you're looking to enhance your gourmet cooking repertoire then you'll be disappointed, but for the rest of us who just want something that tastes good, these recipes are a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Semi-Homemade cooking 2","review":"I've used this book soooooo many times, out of four cooking books I have - this is my number one.

If you reference Kip Fulbeck's Part Asian, 100% Hapa, you will find mixed-race people of all shapes and sizes. We're talking about photographs, which Mr. Ziv does not have in this book.

I felt I did not breath through the whole film. There are several plot twists that caught me off guard even though I had read many of the reviews. The surprises make for an exciting roller-coaster ride. The camera work and the set was sleek and clean in a way I had never seen before. Often the focus was on objects in the room or parts of actor's bodies or faces during dialog. These altered perspectives cause the viewer to hear the words more clearly. It is hard to describe the relationship that develops between the two men except to say it is the ultimate pissing contest. It is a relatively short film that packs a big punch. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"TWISTS AND TURNS...BUT MEDIOCRE","review":"The plot has been discussed by other evaluators, and also the various movies and plays with the same theme/title.

When I heard the film had been remade with Caine now in the role of the elderly Wyck, I had to see how he'd handle himself.

What are remakes good for anyway? I remember the original fondly, an endless mental fight between Olivier and Caine. The remake has Caine and Law. The new script is by Pinter, who proves again that he is another one who should definitely not have been awarded the Nobel prize for literature. Maybe for something else. Chemistry? Just kidding.The new version is essentially vulgar. Jude Law manages to let you forget that he is playing a part. One takes this bloke for the real man. Must be a sign of a good actor. Still.

This film was probably a deeply satisfying endeavor for the actors and director involved, but didn't deliver a very satisfying entertainment experience to me, a member of the audience. I wonder how other audience members felt.

They will scratch your new stainless pots, but I decided 45 years ago that I would personally rather have a squeaky clean pan than a blackened dirty one.

The structure of the film is the same that was to be found in later years in Bob Hope's television shows. Sight gags, slapstick, extremely lightweight \\"story\\", and a plot riddled with holes. But it isn't presented as art, it is simple-minded entertainment. The song by Hope \\"Buttons and Bows\\" actually won an Oscar -- who knew! I did not bother to view the other film (\\"Sorrowful Jones\\") as my only object in getting the DVD was to give it to my dentist to share with his family.

The first time making the slushees was fun and they tasted good, but then things went downhill fast. It was too hard for him to turn by himself, which meant that we got stuck making slushees while he did other things. And after the 6th time making slushees, it broke and couldn't turn out slushees any longer.

This is not a toy for unsupervised use. The ice/salt combination gets VERY cold; if it comes into contact with skin it will freeze to the skin (kind of like licking the flag pole, for those of you that remember the movie).2. It takes some time to figure out how to put it together the first time, but is a breeze after that.3. Quantities are small, but enough to satisfy a kid.4. Hmmm....this could be used to make margaritas, too. :-) But, see note 3.5. Cranking typically takes a few minutes longer than the instructions say -- but that's part of the group fun involved.6. I gave this a \\"3\\" in educational, because this gives kids a little science lesson on how salted ice can be used to freeze water.Mostly, I'm just amazed that a $... product actually does what it says it will do.

There are no special added ingredients necessary--simply add the ice, some salt, sugar (if desired), and your beverage of choice.

First of all, it does not require a degree in mechanical engineering to assemble this toy, as my 11 year old was able to do it with no help from any adult. Contrary to what many of these folks say, if you follow the instructions and crush the ice it works perfectly. It takes 4 minutes, as stated in the directions, and is easy enough for any child over 5 to crank. So why all the negative reviews? Quite frankly, some people are morons, period. One guy even questioned this toy's ability to crush the ice for margauritas! The only complaint I have is that the instructions should have warned the user to always clean the ice container out promptly.

We cleaned it out and tried another liquid, nothing happened. After an evening of turning, we drank the same liquid that we put into the machine. The next day we returned it to the store and found the Rival automatic plug in snow cone maker. It is in the kitchen appliance area. It works wonders in just seconds and we all enjoyed a delicious snow cone.After reading some good reviews on this, we made the purchase. Now we believe that those bad reviews were correct (...)

I assumed he must be doing something wrong, so I tried it next. Then we both tried it again at separate times. We used non-diet drinks(as stated), both soda and fruit juice, none of the attempts produced an icee, not even a bit of slush.Our children only get 3 items from Santa(we want to cut down on commercialism, plus Jesus only got 3 right?...the wise men) Anyway, this was one of her 3 items.

It was nothing like what one can buy at Target. I vowed never to touch the beast again. Because our daughter pleaded, my husband then tried, again following the directions, and (much to my mixed emotions) the same amount of stupendous effort led to two thimble-fuls of murky juice.

Instead of an Icee Maker, it should be called a Mess Maker or Arthritis Aggravator. You crank and crank and crank and crank...repeat infinitely...and you get very little icee made. And you're supposed to paddle the unit every 30 seconds, but that runs a risk of spilling the drink you're mixing in. After all that work, what you end up with is a very cold drink and little in the way of an icee. A butter churn might have made a better gift - at least it's a time-honored and proven process.About the only lesson this teaches, other than the interesting science surrounding the way the ice is created on the metal canister, is one in futility. A certain snow-cone machine named for a certain famous dog would probably be a better choice than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"my daughter received the icee maker as a gift and i think its awfull my daughter couldn't even use it it was to hard for her to crank the handle plus everything was sticking to the sides we had to use a spoon to get everything out it would not even come out of the spout i recommend this to know one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design Ruins It","review":"Note to Spinmaster: You need more than a 1/8\\" deep octagonal hole, or the weak plastic part that is supposed to fit into this shallow depression will quickly fail to fit properly, leading to rounded corners and an icee machine that will never work correctly.This piece of junk is design to work about once, maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use your blender","review":"One star for fun since \\"zero\\" was not an option.

At that point, my husband and I thought not a bad toy. We could have fun when the neices and nephews come over. WRONG!!!! The next time we tried to make an icee we had 4 very disappointed kids waiting for an icee. While turning the crank, the liquid froze the auger to the metal canister. This in turn left plastic shavings inside the liquid because we kept trying to crank the thing. After 5 more attempts (using less salt, less ice, crushed ice, not crushed ice, chilled the liquid, etc.) we gave up and put the darn thing away.

The directions say that it takes 4-6 minutes to crank to make the icee but it took us 20 minutes to get juice with a little ice in it. My son got fed up and went to the other room before we finished. The ice melted before we were finished so we had to refill the ice, when we had enough and took it apart, the whole top (blue piece) was all scraped up. It took my brother to hold it down while I cranked it (not easy for a little kid to do). Overall, it was a waste of money by the time you set it up, cranked it and didn't even get an icee from it.

None of the problems were ever really solved, you don't even know if one of the characters even lived, and you never even know how things worked out in the end for the character(s), too many things were left untold to make it even close to a solid ending.

Concepts for testing serial devices, ram, rom, and disks, are all presented.Don't expect to be able to copy the example code in the book verbatim.The reader will have to develop their own code for testing items like flash memory, and eeprom memory, as well as testing common buses like I2C bus, and SPI bus.Nice to have would be better code for ethernet diagnostics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic, beginner level info","review":"The info provided in this book is strictly for beginners to the world of diagnostic coding. The data is very out-of-date and applies mostly to basic computer systems of the 70's. The coding styles are also very elementary and is written in the style of an introductory level course in programming. The examples will have very limited use in any contemporary software development effort. The author apparently does not have a solid grasp of C or with code re-use.If you want current and in-depth info about contemporary computer systems and diagnostics - look elsewhere. If you don't know anything at all about computer diagnostics, this book might be able to get you started. I would recommend that you buy it used, however, and save yourself some dough.

At the age of 64, Engelbert's voice is still silky smooth & strong. This Cd blends 8 new songs with 12 classic Humperdinck songs. Humper even covers the latin flavoured \\"Dance The night Away\\" from The Mavericks. The cover of Sinatra's \\"Strangers in the Night\\" breathes new life to this excellent track. The title song of this cd is uptempo and not the slow ballad expected from Humperdinck. This Cd is a definite must for fans of all ages, even my wife who is 24 loves it. Actually she never knew Humper's songs before this release, however she now adores the KING OF ROMANCE! Which goes to prove that Humper's fans are not all over 60.

If you are looking for a book that will lay out precise proofs of theorems and get down to the nity-gritty, this book is not for you. However, if you are new to A.T. as I am, and want a book that will give you a nice easy to follow introduction to a topic before wading into your thicker text, then this book will help you tremendously. For instance, reading the chapters regarding CW-complexes and Homotopy in Sato, although thin and easy to follow (you will have to do a little bit of lifting, but not too much), helped me to more easily digest what was to come in Chapters 0 and 1 of Hatcher (which I also highly recommend, incidentally).

It's compact size make it convenient to store in a closet or cupboard so it is always handy. The maximum weight I've moved is under 100 lbs. It is such a great tool I bought one for my sister, and just searched for it again for a friend.

I replaced them all at my local hardware store for a couple of bucks. That did the trick, but the fact that it happened at all shows that Safco doesn't really care about making quality products.But then, after about a year, the aluminum actually started to bend and even tear. I've never lifted more than 125lbs with this thing at once (half of what it's supposedly rated for)! It's mostly sitting in a closet when I don't need to travel.I definitely can't recommend this hand truck for anyone who needs to move around more than 50lbs at a time, maybe, and I will be steering clear of Safco in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well.

It has a very solid latch to hold it in either position.This model does not have the safety problem that the some other Safco models have. The \\"StowAway\\" model folds the wheels in, making the truck somewhat more compact to store, but swats you in the face when you load it. Very painful.This \\"Hide-Away\\" model is designed properly so that when the toe plate is flat on the floor, the wheels also rest on the floor. You can see the difference if you compare the photos of the two models.This model takes a little more room to store, but is safe. The wheels don't cause a problem when the truck is folded and in the car trunk anyhow.It also opens with much less effort than the other models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as heavy duty as I'd hoped","review":"I ordered the Safco economy hide-a-way hand truck but was disappointed when I received it.

And opposite the solid and well-played Yeates is Bryan Murray in the role of Florence McCarthy Knox, an impudent and troublesome leprechaun of a man who is used to getting what he wants. Together with a whole host of other characters, they lead a trouble-filled and yet entirely hilarious life on the Emerald Isle.This is a very funny television show, filled with lots of good humor and drama - excellently produced and acted.

I am not sure why she appears in all the movies and Gourry does not. Nahga isn't the least bit interesting. There was very little interesting character interaction, which I think makes Slayers such a great series to watch. Another disappointment was the introduction of computer generated images to illustrate magical effects. While the computer rendered images were nice, I don't think they have a place in Slayers. The combat scenes were not quite as cool as they were in the series volumes 1-8, and were basically these bizarre musical interludes. Lastly, they took a great plot concept and didn't work it at all. I will admit, the ending was somewhat amusing, but all in all Explosion Array wasn't worth sitting down for.

The fact that there is a certain amount of repetition (not enough to be bothersome, in my opinion) through the different chapters means that 1) I could understand a chapter without having read all the previous ones and 2) I memorized as I went, insead of spending hours doing it after reading.

She did mention some people I didn't know, but more importantly she finally made me understand clearly where the Shah went wrong and why and made me truly understand the importance of Islam. In spite of 3 1/2 years immersed in Persian culture under the Shah I had failed to fully grasp either of these concepts. I wish I could go back and apologize to the Mullah I once shared a bus seat with who I undoubtedly offended grievously offended by flippantly commenting that I thought of all religions Zen Buddhism appealed to me the most.

It's more a quick handbook to a dimplomat taking a crash course on Iranian history, as opposed to a neutral scholarly work. For example, the author's portray of Bahais as religious heretics who, \\"..called for heads to be cut off\\", shows her failure in inquiriing with many sources. The few paragraphs she dedicates to this very significant religious movement in 19th century-the Bahai Faith- are based on accounts by Muslims antagonists to this religion. If someone pursues such a project, they must consult all possible sources and views. Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Intended/Poorly Informed","review":"Though the intention was there the facts failed this work. Early in the book when discussing the literary tradition of Iran she lists famed poets. As an indication of the poor research we notice that she lists Molana and Rumi as seperate poets when in fact they are the same person. A glaring error of that magnitude, considering Rumi is second only to Khayam in his worldly fame as a Persian poet, leads one to doubt the level of accuracy in the overall work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misunderstood notions of a complex culture","review":"At first, this book is great to read. When Mackey is re-iterating ancient history, as anyone can, it's fine. However, her interpretations of Islam, causes for the revolution, and what Iranian people truly feel is misplaced and not accurate. She does not represent popular opinion but merely regurgitates propogandized western surface idealogy and gives the horrible regime credibility. It's almost as if her impressions were taken from the mullahs themselves.For those wishing to gain an insight into Iran, this book will only give you false impressions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid work, marred by a simplistic thesis","review":"MacKey's main thesis, that Persia has always combined charismatic kingship with a religious foundation of Zoroastianism or Islam, is well-argued and well-documented. However, the thesis is too slender a reed to really explain Iran. MacKey gets repetitive as she argues for her thesis too much.Even so, she gives a good overview of Iranian history, both modern and ancient. It is solid work, though clearly from a person who is trying to get a handle on a new information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific overview","review":"This is a wonderful overview of and introduction to Iranian history. As previous reviewers have noted, it leaves out many details. And that is the point - it is an overview of two and a half millenia. For this beginner student of Iranian history and language, the book wonderfully highlighted key periods, events, people, places, and beliefs. I am now eager to read more, and feel I will have a point of reference as I encounter more detailed presentations of various aspects of Iranian history and culture. For the previous reviewers who did not agree with the thesis either in its simplicity or philosophy, I say they are missing the point. Ms. Mackey obviously has a deep understanding of Iran that she has shared in a comprehensible way for those of us unfamiliar with this fascinating country. Take what you like of her thesis or none of it at all; this does not diminish her accomplishment in providing solid information in a highly readable format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied Reading","review":"Like many reviewers I have only been able to read 2/3's of the book. I like how she covered the History up to 1900. But beyond that she is not too informative. She has turned Mossadeq into the only politician, and Shaikh Khazal into the only seperatist of the 20th Century. She has no mention of other politicians like Vossough ol Dowleh, Qavam ol Saltana, Mostofi, or Sepahsalar. She doesn't cover the Revolutions in Gilan, Azerbaijan, Kurdistan. Like many authors she doesn't give the Qajar/Kadjar Dynasty any good light. Her book was the first book that I read on Persian History, and since then I have had to read over 5 more to get a real picture of Iran. I recommend Massoume Price's book \\"Iran's Diverse Peoples A Reference Sourcebook.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"So fascinating yet manic","review":"This book is filled with an immense amount of historical information in regards to Iran and the country's history. I find Iranian history fascinating on its own. Sandra Mackey has written the most unorganized and poorly structured book I have ever picked up. It jumps around so much that it makes it very difficult for the reader to gain a clear understanding of the history and influential personalities mentioned. If you have to read this for class and a research paper or test is required, I don't see it possible to not spend hours flipping back and forth from the index to marked page. I would find this book incredibly enjoyable if it were better structured. There is no doubt in my mind that she is an expert on middle eastern studies, but the book really does read terribly. Could have been so great. The history of Iran is an amazing story on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool!","review":"Cool! that is what everyone says when you turn this on. it's a bit louder than i would prefer but not a deal-breaker. i bought if for my nephew but i like it so much, i might have to have one too! pretty cool decor and conversation piece for a dark room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Awesome visual effect with an ever changing LCD lighting system and mesmerizing presentation.

Douglas is a mortician with no interpersonal skills, making lists on his computer, and approaching each task in life analytically. Physically abused as a child, he finally moves out of his mother's house as an adult and slowly unravels mentally, turning into a quiet homicidal maniac. Marjorie is an asthmatic, overmothered wallflower who craves attention. Her timid involvement with a fish owner's club brings her into contact with Douglas. The book is convincing in showing how minor personality problems can either mask a dangerous psyche or get one in a lot of trouble. Could make a very good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution - gets hot!","review":"I had a similar lamp very similar to this a few years ago. The lamp only hinges in two places, which makes only the height and \`head' adjustable. The halogen bulb does give off a nice bright light without the yellow tinge of incandescent, but the \`head' of the lamp gets extremely hot. After an hour of use, the \`head' is too hot to touch to adjust the angle, and the round piece of glass \\"protecting\\" the bulb is hot enough to melt objects and burn skin -- even the table where the light is shining gets noticeably warm. The lamp does have a nice style and would work well in a location where it would only be used for short periods of time, but it should not be used where curious little hands can reach it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Comping book available","review":"As a professor of music at a university in New York, I consider JazzGuitar Comping to be a must have for all my guitar students.

Starting with simplevoice leading illustrations using basic jazz voicings all the way tocomplex chord construction using both traditional and modernapproaches, this book covers a lot of ground.

He crafts an exciting, intense tale of men in conflict with the world, with destiny and with their own natures. All of the characters are involved to greater or lesser degrees with a struggle for power. Many of the characters don't even realize the role they are playing until everything comes together in a grand explosion of conflicting goals and deceits.I believe Raven is one of the most intriguing characters in modern fantasy. A man with a natural tendency towards darkness, he attempts to redeem himself by serving the Light, and ends up falling into an even greater darkness. This is the theme of this entire series. What is Evil? And once you've served Evil, can you ever be free?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the first","review":"Better than the first.My second adventure with the Black Company was better than the first; centered around the reprehensible barkeep, Marron Shed, a weak man in heavy debt to money-lender gangs.

Slthough I initially liked the Rotring, each one failed at about 5 months due to a design flaw. The clip, when you press the top of it, retracts the point of the penlet. The clip's hinge is so flimsily made and poorly deisgned that it wears out and breaks and the clip falls off.Advice: don't get this pen. Instead, get what I finally got: the Lamy 4pen. Same idea, more comfortable, longer lasting, and the pen refills are better (they skip less). Though the Rotring is cheaper than the Lamy, it's a false economy.

Well there's quite a bit of fighting, but it's spread out and each fight last no longer than 20 or 30 seconds. It seems every fight is cut shor by something or other, until you get to the last fight which is a real bummer. Also in the movie, a certain Tekken 3 character (I'm trying not to spoil it) is cloned and released, but just makes the movie look all the more cheesier, which is the most crucial thing to step away from when making a video game movie. This movie should not be purchased, if you're a real fan just go to Blockbuster, this is something not even a mother could love. This movie is just a copy off of Mortal Kombat, which was adapted from Enter the Dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your a fan of Tekken, do not see this movie","review":"Aside from some of the music, I can't see anything good about this title. The characters were all overly dramatic, and aside from their professions, were almost nothing like the characters from the game. None of them did many, if any, of their signature moves, and the plot (robotic dinosaurs, heheh, come on) is so bad, it's hard to link this anime to the game. The fights scenes are terrible as well, leaving with absolutely no reason to watch this anime, that is, unless you need a good laugh. If your going to go with fight anime, rent/buy Fatal Fury or Battle Arena Toshinden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tekken awsome movie.","review":"It was a good movie. It answered alot of questions that you would have about the game. Hopefully they will come out with a second movie. Kazuya was awesome and Heihachi was ruthless.The fight scenes were good too.I didn't like the ending because it doesn't say what happened to Kazuya. Kazuya was my favorite character on the game and Jun comes next as my choice. But Jin will be awesome on the next movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Enter The Tekken!","review":"First of all, play the games before you see the movie. You will have no idea what's going on if you don't. If you have played the games before, you will understand it but I must warn you it's not all that great. It had its good points of course, for example the part where Nina drops down to attack Kazuya in his room was pretty cool. Other than that though, I found this movie to be somewhat boring. It is only an hour long but it seemed much longer. The action scenes could have been animated better also. This movie makes a good rental if you want to see what happens to some of your favorite Tekken characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't care what everyone else thinks...","review":"I thought this was a pretty good movie. Previous reviewers can just kiss my...well, you know. The storyline was good. They didn't start up abruptly and they didn't end abruptly. The characters featured were well explained. I also thought they were drawn pretty well, overlooking the fact that Kazuya and Heihachi's eyebrows looked like they would eat them at any moment. And the music, oh the music. I have heard so many complaints about the music. So it's not the normal Japanimation music. So they didn't keep the original music as so many other dubs have done. When you think about, at least the music is in English. How many dubs can say that? All in all, I liked it.

The action scenes were some of the worst I've ever seen in animation. The Dialogues were poorly written and the film was short. This movie simply tries to catch a few bucks by riding on the popularity wave of the tekken game series. The game series may be decent, but don't waste your money on this video/dvd. There are much better animated movies/series to be watching than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should of have been.","review":"My main gripe is from the lack of plot given to some of the characters- I felt they didn't give enough attention to Yoshimitsu, Paul, King, etc. Some of the characters don't even make an appearance and the story doesnt seem accurate- (When did dinosaurs ever have anything to do with the ending in Tekken 1?)

If you so dearly need to watch this lousy movie, borrow it from a friend. Better yet, buy it and give it to someone you hate. Street Fighter II: The Movie has superior animation and fighting sequences while Tekken resembles an attempt to throw something together, hoping it will turn out all right. The best bet here is to watch South Park--it has better animation and will make you laugh (at the jokes, NOT the animation)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!","review":"Whoa! I was truely expecting more from this, seeing as how it evolved from one of the greatest fighting series in the world. After I saw this and Toshinden, I made sure I rented the anime before I bought it. Lets see...bad points: Poor art...lousy animation...character development too fast...rushed into an hour...bad action sequences...Good Points: The credits at the end. People who call this \\"good high quality animation,\\" should be beaten violently, along with the makers of this film. I have seen some bad anime in my life(Aika, Battle Arena Toshinden), and this ranks on up there in the junk heap. Hey, it even smells like garbage! This anime is best used as a gag gift. Don't buy it unless you are a hardcore Tekken fan, and don't care about how pathetic it is. I recommend Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture, or Street Fighter The Movie.

You should get the album, Offspring, because there's a \\"Meaning of Life\\" song and other songs that you could like. You should get this movie and enjoy with it.

This movie would have soooo made it if only it was longer. Indeed I felt it was moving in the right direction in building the select few characters, but 60 minutes just isn't enough to tell the epic that Tekken is. So many characters were left out, and my idol Baek was squashed in mere seconds. The movie had good elements and flow, but each stage was rushed. Again, all due to the shortness of the movie. Even ever popular Paul was overlooked, and Kuma had a cameo appearance climbing down a tree. I mean, c'mon! Fight scenes are only half as good as SF2, with many still frame animation used. Not much fluidity and motion. Sigh. Still, my love for the game keeps me thinking that I still love this anime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent the movie, but do not buy it.","review":"Tekken was okay, but the story in the movie was very unclear. Was it talking about Tekken 1 or Tekken 2. The movie should have been longer. I think someone should make another animated movie of Tekken and a nonanimated one. Why were the other characters such as Paul, King, and the others not describe well? There should have been more fighting scenes with them and what ever happen to Kazuya in the end of the movie? All these questions left me to think what is the movie trying to point out. The movie was not as good as I thought it would be. I recommend you rent the movie, but if you are truly a Tekken fan like me, you would be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome movie","review":"I had just read reviews for this video a few days ago, and I couldn't believe the bad rep. it was getting.

The plot in tekken was better than i thought it would be. Also it was creative and thoughtful unlike most animes. Plus the dialogue and effects were perfect for the movie.

Excessively boring character designs, nonexistent \\"plot\\", scant and boring \\"fight scenes\\" (which is really bad as it's supposed to be based off a fighting game) and a faulty decision to replace the original soundtrack, which is ADV trying to emulate the Street Fighter movie release in the worst way possible. You get the idea that they funneled the eniote budget for this film into the two CGI sequences that do NOTHING. I felt my IQ drop as I sat through this thing with hopes that it would somehow redeem itself and was ultimately disappointed. Only the word limit prevents me from fully expressing how bad this anime was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disgrace to the world of Tekken.","review":"Being a huge fan of Tekken games, I reserved a copy of \\"Tekken: The Motion Picture\\" literally months in advance. Only to be roundhouse kicked in the head with disappointment. The drawing quality is nowhere near that of other fighting game based Anime's. Fight sequences doesn't even come close to doing the game justice, which is known for spectacular moves and combos. The plot itself is decent, but presented so poorly that it leaves bad aftertaste. In comparison, \\"Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie\\" or \\"Fatal Fury: The Motion picture\\" are more refined and enjoyable to watch, despite the fact that I've always considered Tekken to be the superior and far more entertaining game. So if you are looking for an Anime based on Tekken, forget this one. You'll only feel disgraced by the shameful effort by the people representing the name Tekken. You'll have more fun watching the ending movie sequences in PlayStation Tekken games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have, and should have, been so much more.","review":"I have seen this twice on cable and I tried so hard to like it, but I just couldn't.

To start with the animation is below standard, (Even Guyver animation was better than this, but that was exuuseable as it had a great storyline and loads of action) the storyline is keek, there are only one or two fights and it only focouses on a few of Tekken's characters, Jack, June, Lei Wou Long,...so on. So for any fans who expected to see all the characters from the Tekken world.....sorry you won't. Another flaw is that it only lasts 60 mins. Save your money and buy Street Fighter 2....And this is coming from a #1 Tekken fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"Tekken: The Motion picture was the over-all best movie based on a video game I've ever seen. It had a GREAT soundtrack and the characters were portrayed with personalities the fit in well with the the Tekken game series.

Not on the level of Armitage III or Ghost in the Shell, but it's certainly a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time...","review":"Warning. Do not even rent this anime. Sure, the writing in the beginning is cool and there are a few good monoloughes, but it gets soooo repetitive! It's the same thing over and over.

Woodworkers at any level will find the information useful, and the examples of Tibbetts' designs are beautiful, inspirational and unparalled in this field. It's a bit humbling, really. I am personally grateful to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"want to learn segmented turning? get the book","review":"This book is extremely well written and easy to understand with its great attention to detail. The photos and writings in this book are very detailed from beginning to end. Its truly like taking a course having an instructor explaining to you its that well written. Read the book, the guy is a natural born teacher. The book is printed on high quality sturdy pages. the photos are great. The book is so well detailed that every doubt or question i had was always answered within a page and a half. no questions were unanswered. He tells you how to turn with minimal tools and without complex formulas. If your just starting out get this book it could save you lots of money time and heartache. this book could be used by intermediate turners as well. This is the most detailed and best written instructional book i have ever read with exception of an html book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Text","review":"Everything in this book says Malcolm Tibbetts is a professional.

Acoustic blues at its best!","review":"If you get a chance to see Bryan perform, DO SO! He doesn't just play the music, he tells you about it and draws you in. He's been doing the VH1 Storytellers type thing long before they thought of it. I've had my copy of this CD for some time and while it isn't the experience of a live performance, it is the next best thing! As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the original instrumental Grace is my favorite.It's great to see it in wider distribution with Amazon. Buy the CD and I guarantee you'll HAVE to go see him at the next opportunity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of songs, performed in traditional styles.","review":"I've had this CD quite a while, glad to see it's getting some broad distribution on Amazon. Great collection of blues guitar instrumentals, and guitar songs with vocals. Like a \\"best of\\" compilation of essential guitar based blues. Wonderful slide work, vocals, and some great guitar sounds. As good as the traditional tunes are, I'm particularly fond of Bryan's solo instrumental \\"Grace\\", it speaks right to my heart. This CD is a great \\"road trip\\" CD, it's been my choice for many trips now. Well worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album took many listens for me to elevate it to five stars...","review":"I only liked this album when I first heard it, I wasn't sure how to compare it to the rest of Drang's albums, but now I can say after many listens it is definitely their best and not only their best but possibly the best album thus far in 2006. There are so many layers of gorgeous instrumentation going on it takes many listens for the brain to assimilate it all. They lyrics are delivered with such emotion and yet seem to integrate almost as another instrument into the music. McCallister's drumming is compelling as aways and the outros to a Hooker With a Heart of Gold and Come Back Alive will take your breath away. 10/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect record","review":"This record is Ester Drang's third full length, and the second for Jade Tree. If you haven't heard Ester Drang before, any of their albums is a great place to start, because they are all so different, yet all so good. If you have listened to them, do not compare this to their other records. They all need a few listens to realize how good they are. Goldenwest is indie goodness, Infinte Keys is very chill, and a bit more experinmental, this is a great mix of the two, but some sounds you surely won't recognize. This band is maturing very nicely. Do yourself a favor and sample this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I brought this movie after doing a search on movies with Callum Keith Rennie in it...I watched it from start to finish trying to keep up with the subtitles and Callum wasn't in this version.

It is an easy to hold design, pleasant ring tone, and numerous other features. But, there is a tendency for static to be heard by both parties of the conversation.

Channel scanning didn't help at all. I could have lived with the static except that my own voice comes through rather loudly. Thus, when I have the volume turned up high enough to hear the other party's fuzzy little voice, I'm practically whispering so I don't blow my ear out.We finally replaced this phone and I'm not even going to give it away.

Too short, not enough examples, not enough explanation. As a teacher there was simply not much there to rely on and I had to come up with my own explanations, ideas, and so on.I taught out of the eighth edition. The statement of Taylor's theorem (one of the major theorems of calculus) was WRONG. But, maybe I should be fair, they only had eight tries to get it right. I haven't looked at this edition, perhaps the ninth time is the charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, systematic presentation","review":"The book consistently presents calculus as a series of variations on a theme, which are returned to again and again. The emphasis is clearly on applying underlying concepts rather than memorization of a 'cookbook' of rote methods. There is a wide variety of problems, of varying difficulty, including several different areas of application. The book does assume that the student has thoroughly mastered college algebra; sometimes, in the interest of brevity, methods of solution are explained only briefly. The solutions manual is much more thorough and complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST TEXTBOOK EVER!!","review":"I have just recently finished the Calculus II course at the University of Utah. Varberg, Calculus with Differential Equations (9th ed.) is the required textbook for both Calculus I and Calculus II, so I've become very familiarized with the textbook and I can honestly say that this is the worst textbook I've ever had!.. The examples are extremely difficult to follow, as they skip many crucial steps (simply to save on print - hence, money) and the explanations are not written in a way that's easy to understand. Throughout both of my calculus I and calculus II courses I have had to use every available resource other than my textbook. If you can purchase any other textbook for your math class I would highly advise that you do so! This TEXTBOOK IS HORRIBLE!!! Do NOT waste your time or money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but solutions manual is a must have","review":"This is a good book for calculus. I usually go to class and do not undestand the professor because he speaks a different language then come home and figure it out from the book.

Two calls to tech support did not resolve the matter, with the technician telling me to return the unit. So, I'm off to do that, now. The first call to tech support landed me somewhere around the other side of the planet, where the connection was awful and I could not understand the heavily accented voice on the other end.I also have a D-Link Internet camera, which works flawlessly.

Howver, the heart of this film is more American than Filipino.If you do not speak or understand Tagalog it would not matter but the alternating English and Filipino dialouge between the kidnapper and main character was very awkward to listen to.

This is all processed guitar and horns and disco beats and CRAP, with Johnny's 'cockney Tiny Tim' vocals and his trademark (extremely stupid) trailing his voice upward at the end of every line.

It seems like the scenes between them have been shot without any retakes. There is a scene when all of them are drunk and cursing Asrani and he is standing right behind them, which is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. Shreyas and Javed are natural actors and occupy more screen time than the other two.The other characters in the movie give a decent performance too. Chunky Pandey plays a stuttering goon, Johnny Lever as his sardar brother and Dilnaz as Jhonny's gujarati wife. Dilnaz's dialogues have been nicely written and superbly delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"not cello","review":"I was disappointed - these are not clear cello bags, but some sort of plastic bag.

It is thick and sticky and tugs at my skin. Hard to get the right amount and impossible to blend, making it very obvious. I know it is a corrector, but even with foundation or other concealer over it, the end result is not good. The tub also dried out really quickly making it even harder to use. I was blending the darker color in with my previous concealer which did help brighten it up a bit, but definitely not worth the purchase. For me the quality was just not there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prices of Amazon's International Magazines are Overpriced","review":"British Glamour is great, so is British Vogue. However I find it funny how amazon's subscription rate to glamour is more expensive than just buying it off the newsstand (it's only $4.99/issue on the newstand). Other international magazine subscriptions such as British Vogue and French Vogue, even Nylon from the US is more expensive if you order it off amazon than on the site. Aren't we supposed to be getting better deals here?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous in *EVERY* way!","review":"From the perfect sizing of this magazine (you can easily carry it with you) to the no nonsense articles, this magazine has been a favourite of mine for years! This magazine is filled with substance, unlike it's American counterpart. British society has so many different (read: accepting) views on things from culture, to nudity, to sensuality and even with relating to others.I find this at my local bookstore, but there would be no better gift to yourself than a subscription to this so it's delivered to your doorstep each month. Every page of this little morsel is well worth the extra spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More \\"metal\\" than \\"black\\"","review":"Metal Black is a poor imitation of Venom's seminal album Black Metal. The reason why Black Metal worked so well is because the band put themselves out there in such an original way that it was hard not to notice the audacity of three guys from England who dared place on an LP jacket an overwhelmingly evil, menacing anthropomorphized goat's head in front of a pure black background that signified the beginning of the end of humanity.To try to recapture that one magical moment, when everything fell into place and no one else was doing what they were doing, in 2006, is futile.I'm the type of fan who expects his favorite band to try something different, change things up, and yet keep the same intensity, drive and passion for their style of music. It's a sad state of affairs when a band feels they have to copy their old selves in order to re-invent their new selves."},{"rating":"2","title":"","review":"Not a bad album from these Metal veterans. It's got that dirty production that pissed off a lot of people in the \`80s, and it's got that simplicity factor that makes Venom songs catchy, raw, and headbanging. I've never had a problem with Venom's somewhat average drumming on early records (according to some people), but the execution here is handled effortlessly here by Antton. Reliable double-bass patterns add a new dimension to the music. Cronos' hymns to Lucifer, death and hell are still effectively amusing in a good way. Of course, we all know none of this is real and that's exactly what's fun about it. The gimmick has always worked, and it obviously does here. Songs like \\"Anti-Christ\\", \\"Rege Satanas\\" and \\"House of Death\\" are simply crushing, and you can ever hear some glorious guitar playing on a number of songs (a rarity on Venom's music to a degree). It's great to see Venom is still spewing forth great black metal as only they can do best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opposite, Yes","review":"Fitting that they reversed the title, because this album bears no resemblance to the masterpiece to which it alludes. There is some redeeming value here -- like Darkest Realm -- but not much. Trying to strip down modern recording just for the sake of re-capturing something is an admission (to me) that Cronos just doesn't have it anymore. Re-hashed lyrics, re-hashed riffs, put to sub-standard recording adds up to a mess of an album...go back and re-visit the original and see if you don't agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great release","review":"I have been a Venom fan from the start and this is the best Venom release without the original band. I know I'm a little late on reviewing this cd but I just downloaded it again and \\"WOW\\" this is great sounding stuff. A little rawer guitar sound that the earlier stuff (Believe it or not) but Cronos sounds as good as he did on the oppisite \\"Black Metal\\" classic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep on steppin Kerri","review":"Kerri Chandler truly shows his metal on this CD. After purchasing his previous release, \\"Movin-Non Stop\\", I really could not see how he could improve on perfection. He did! This CD is wonderful!

Chaiken's characters come alive on the written page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read","review":"Thos is an incomplete four part series where the last book was never written - and ends on a cliffhanger.

I finally gave up after 200 pages. It was just too much work to follow the story with the French dictionary, a map of France so you could follow their travels, three family trees, and a two-page list of the characters. If I wanted history, I would just get a history book. I really was looking for historical fiction, emphasis on the fiction. Two stars for all the research that had to have gone into this book. Just no flow to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Punk!","review":"For young guys, this band is awesome!! Their lyrics are good, not all new ideas but they are good ideas.

Although chronological, I found the book's structure inconsistent, not much in the way of transitions, background or lead-ins for the reader to really get a total flavor of the MMA. Overall, as a cold reader, I think this is not such a good read and generally a very fragmented book and not a good writing effort. It has some updated entries in 1998, so its reprinted from the original 50s version. What is confusing is the inclusion of another student's extensive diary entries in italics interjected with the author's and this doesn't add much to the effort. Photo quality is poor. There are emails in the back of the book that just don't appear to be meaningful, its just thrown out there. Perhaps I was expecting a bit more professionally pulled together or polished story, even from diary entries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre. Very, very mediocre","review":"A rather indifferent mystery. There really aren't any likeable characters, and it takes forever for one of them to die. It was the revelation of whodunnit that irritated me extremely. To go into further detail would be to ruin the plot. It... well, while not unplausible, it was inadequately telegraphed for my taste.This story was all wrong in the details; the numerous \\"news clippings\\" sounded nothing like actual articles. And furthermore, rather than ending at the point which would have provided a certain degree of spookiness (guilty... or are they? and will they ever be brought to justice?), the author ends the whole thing with another stupid news article that makes everything Painfully Crystal Clear.In short: don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"The book was in good condition when I got it, even though it was used and someone maybe before me highlighted some of the reading in it those also helped me to find what I needed for my assignment as well, I think renting books will be what I do from now on.

It arrived after 3 days and was easy to install (to an already opened pool mind you!). This pump is GREAT!! We replaced a 7 year old pump that really had no umphh.

PiL did appear on American Bandstand, but performed \\"Poptones\\" from Second Edition rather than something from this album. It was a wild performance. While we could hear Lydon singing the lyrics, we could read his lips (face pushed up close to a camera) saying, \\"How's my hair?\\"I can't give this first PiL album much credit musically. It's a slapdash, iritating affair. Second Edition I give 4 stars; Flowers of Romance I give 4. The individual song \\"Public Image\\" from this album I give 5 stars -- it's a collosal showcase for Wobble and Levine, and a riveting statement of purpose. Thematically, its something like R.E.M.'s \\"King of Comedy,\\" but a lot more meaningful given its historical context. Its also simply a more powerful song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got to be a die hard fan to listen to this!","review":"Listen, on the surface this pretty much stinks.Sex Pistols was rock music. This is noisy, in your face, purposefully abrasive.However, at the time, it was definitely ground breaking. The guitar playing was avante garde/Sonic Youth before that type of music came into vogue. The bass playing was also innovative.\\"Public Image\\" is a decent song, \\"Anastasia\\" is all right, the rest of the album is headache inducing.The band reached its zenith on 2nd Edition with the cool dub sounds and screaching guitar.In real life, John Lydon is a jerky and abrasive person. This record was not only to isolate himself from the pistols but, it was also giving a middle finger to the public.I saw him live circa 1979. He was terrible, performed behind a screen, and never acknowledged the audience.I do not think that this album was a serious artistic endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"We don't write Pop, we write Motion Picture Soundtracks","review":"I'll always remember seeing American Bandstand, with PIL performing the only danceable song off this.

It's a bunch of people sitting around with Lucinda chit chatting about their anxiety. The concepts in the books are pretty good, but this whole set is incredibly overpriced for what you get. I feel like Lucinda and her company prey on the vulnerable. If it were really about helping people, the materials wouldn't be nearly so high-priced. And then they try to sell you a bunch of extras, like $30/bottle herbal supplements and crazy pricey phone therapy sessions.

However, you must recognize the fact that you suffer from panic and anxiety attacks and desire change. This is KEY. Working my way through this program took a lot of dedication and daily hard work but I knew I needed it and at that point, it was really my only hope. When my panic attacks and physical symptoms were finally under control I told my husband that going through this program was one of the hardest things I'd ever done but it was worth it.

If they wanted to help people they wouldnt charge that much for short cds w jibber jabber and a workbook w stuff we already know if you are a long time anxiety sufferer. I have ptsd and it doesnt even touch that. They are so nice when you call but when you cancel they are hateful people who say you will never get better and thats after I said I had a psycologist and therapist.

I am now a old man, coming up to my 86th birthday. I have read up on many interesting topics on twentieth century history, mostly on wars like the Boer war, WW1 and WW2 which I participated in. I decided several months ago to read up on the UN, well seeing as I am confined to a wheelchair there are not many other activities to do except reading or watching television. By a cruel twist of fate I ended up reading Norrie MacQueen's UN peacekeeping book.

Landreth takes over for \\"Illinois Blues\\" featuring his guitar and Stanley Behrens on vocals and harmonica.

I started with Williams, Heinlein, Asimov, and Clark, and have almost completely been a fan of \\"thud and blunder\\" space opera (Hamilton) and \\"rivets\\" hard science fiction (the aforementioned \\"big three\\").The Foreigner Universe series has caused the completion of my acceptance of sociological s.f., as well as my previously enjoyed types.I won't try to analyze the books; that has already been done quite well, but I MUST recommend this series to those of you who haven't tried this category of s.f. before. You may not find it an easy read, but if you stick with it, I believe you will be well rewarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I love Cherryh's books. Hunter of Worlds is still one of my favorites, along with the Mri sagas. I've re-read Foreigner so many times that the binding is wearing loose. (...) Now, after a long wait, and eagerly pre-ordering from Amazon so I would get it as soon as possible, I received Defender. I read it in two days (had to go to work--it arrived on a weekday) and was incredibly disappointed. The human-atevi interface complexities, the growing depth of atevi and human characters revealed in the first three books, the warm humor and stern duty of Jago and Banichi, the wry tyranny of Ilisidi, the intrigues of Tabini and the delicious missteps of a human amid the atevi and their subsequent confoundment at times with a human to whom they owe manchi, are all missing. This book reads like a rough draft instead of the highly polished work Cherryh usually brings, especially to this series of dearly beloved characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defender","review":"This is the fifth book in her \\"trilogy\\", and the poorest of the series. The author takes forever to develop what turns out to be an elementary plot. She even repeats an approach taken in an earlier novel (involving poison). The author manages to crowd fifty pages of content into 314 pages. Even worse, the space ship barely begins its journey by the end of the novel. I hope that the next novel in the series has more content and less agonizing by the central character - Bren Cameron. If he will spend less time worrying about his disfunctional family, perhaps he can do his job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"non defender","review":"Cherryh's strength has been her characters, as much as her plots. In the Foreigner universe, she has created some of her strongest.But the latest release, Defender, both plot and characters have received short shrift. In fact, at the end of this short book (it has 314 pages, Precursor had 438), the characters and the situation are almost identical. There is little interaction between Bren and Banichi, Jago, and Ilisidi. With a little editing, this book could have been 2 or 3 chapters of the next book. If you miss this one, don't worry. Nothing happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback","review":"I gave this book 2 stars just because I love this series. However he book alone was not the author's best work.

You could probably skip this one all together and just buy bok #6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but not the best in the series.","review":"The publisher really [messed]... up by blowing what should have been the big secret of the novel on the cover blurb and letting the reader know that there are still humans alive on the 2nd Station. Starting the book already knowing that fact put the reader in an akward position reguarding the plot.Defender is not up to the high standards of the previous books in the Foreigner series. There is a feeling here that the Characters, and maybe the author, are treading water. Still Cherryh treading water is better that a lot of other writers on their best day. I hope this does not mean that Ms. Cherryh is loosing interest in this universe. I'll be interested to see where the story goes from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Shiznit!","review":"I stumbled onto \\"Under the Influences\\" and thought that was a great album.

I suppose it's from the last comeback tour where all 4 original members toured together.This is a good buy... you get great concert footage of Kiss's greatest songs with the original members. So if you didn't buy this because you thought I don't like the new Kiss songs, or I only like the original Kiss members...think again and buy it.While you're here at Amazon, relive your youth and blame it on your kid.

I don't think I've used my own colon as much. It makes reading the text a chore. Another annoying factor is the sentences that made me ask, \\"What???\\" Here are two: \\"The monk took off his glasses like some patients remove their trousers,\\" \\"Charles looked up from an armchair as if he'd seen a well-loved moth.\\" There's more like that but I had to give you at least two examples.

However, this album is still a very interesting piece of music. Very well written, produced and conducted from a to z, it is a must have for anyone who has enjoyed \\"Passion\\" from the same artist. Some title, if produced with another intention, could become hits. The only downside to the album is that Peter included bits of cultural inflences that are sometimes not compatible with each other.

I have a version with the rap \\"Story of OVO\\", which is by far the worst written and worst performed rap of all time. The rest of the CD is just elevator Muzak, though done in PG-style, which is to say with sitars and African drums and whispery singers.

He and his mother spent much of their free time watching and watching. They just HAS to see what came next. It tooks weeks and weeks, but they made it from beginning to end - their '24' marathon.

I mean I know the body count for 24 is off the charts, but at this point, with less than a full day-shift to go, it's like they have to kill off someone important EVERY HOUR.

The extras that are there are decent, though (although the EXTRA Chloe arrest scene after the events of the last episode was puzzling and needed some sort of resolution to it).The only comment I have about the quality of the season is that it starts out formulaic, but the final third of the season is outstanding....especially if you love to hate Charles Logan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thee best","review":"As far as spy movies and tv shows I've been a big fan. the Bourne series was my favorite.

Just when the massager would feel like it was doing it's job, the program would go on to another mode. Very jumpy. A good point is there are many choices of sensations that are not automatic programs, but for me, most of them felt like \\"almost but not quite\\". I think the housing of the unit would not last very long; it felt a bit flimsy. So with some sturdier construction and some control of the sensations of the automatic program; this could be a great massager.

This is the replacement. It's just a sad shadow of the 1995 product which I still use and it can get the pressure points in ways this thing can't. The heads and power just are too broad and too weak. I think maybe(?) the ev278w massager was too powerful and they have down powered the thing to this level for legal reasons??? It's just not enough if you know what it use to be. This one is the only one in the Panasonic arsenal that compares at all with the ev278w. My old one is starting to rattle after 15 years of use.

The awkward shape is very uncomfortable to massage back, neck, shoulder, or anywhere. I thought the tapping massage would be good for my shoulders, but after trying this with so many different angle or direction, I never could find it comfortable, or effective. To give enough tapping effect to shoulders (or anywhere), I have to give some amount of pressure, but this awkward design just makes it so hard and its so cheap-ish light weight doesn't help it too.Don't waste your hard earned money for this. I think I made a mistake but you don't need to make another.

The new model has an awkward shape, the programmed settings deliver only a superficial massage, and pressing harder leads to lesser rather than more penetration. There was only one setting that did not do that but the selection switch in the handle allowed for too-easy accidental switching of programs during use and the necessity of starting all over again to find the one I wanted. The housing also felt shoddy--like it might not last long. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is terrible","review":"That this is called a massage is an outrage.We bought it as a gift, especially for the trapezoid area - thinking its curved design would be a good choice.

I thought for the price tag, I'd be sure to be getting my teeth rattled at the high settings...but no such luck, worst it was a gift and had to be delayed/returned...AND the seller never picks up the phone.Bad, bad, bad...horrible.

Much heavier, and more for spot treatment than over all massaging.I used to use the old one on my arthritic joints - palms of my hands, feet, everything. The vibration would bring a nice blood flow to the area that really helped my joints and would only take a few minutes.This one is so heavy and unbalanced and awkward, it hurts my hands to try to hold and maneuver it. I don't use it. It's so different from the earlier version. I wish they'd bring the old one back, and people could just buy whichever one they wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"My 20 year old cordless Panosonic massager finally gave out and with no parts available for that model I needed a replacement. This seemed the same type of design as my old one but as I found out they are like night and day. The old one used quality plastic that is still perfect but this one is cheap in every way. The worst part are the programed controls, they seemed designed to anoy you rather than give you relief. The type of action the head delivers is very strange compared to my old Panasonic. I would suggest someone in need of a massager try a few to see what works for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle massager","review":"I bought this item for my mother. She's got rheumatic arthritis.

It did not disappoint at all, whether you read the book or not. It plays with your expectations of the standard Western right from the start, and you are clued in quickly that this one may not play out like a typical tale.Kirk Douglas is Jack Burns, oh how he brings it. He hides somewhat behind his smiling exterior, but is truly himself and at home out on the range. The movie packs All Stars- Walter Matthou always makes the character more deep and wry than likely was in the script, a young George Kennedy as a tough cop, Carroll O'Connor driving the truck, and apparently (according to IMDb) Bill Bixby gets no film credit for being one of the helicopter co-pilots.The real star is Whiskey, the horse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bagdad murder","review":"If you enjoy watching American boys being shot, killed and maimed this is the movie for you.

If you could only see one film about the war, this would be it. Great archive footage and remarkably candid interviews with leading players from both sides: eg Lucien Conien, William Colby, MacNamara (I think, it's years since I've seen it) as well as Vietnamese generals and diplomats, north and south.

Pity the DVD isn't more reasonably priced!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unbalanced point of view","review":"This documentary is overwhelmingly pro-war, anti-Vietnamese.

It is thorough - at times a tiny bit repetitive - and whilst understandably centered on the American experience there, it also describes the French debacle and puts the whole episode in context.

If your main goal is to get off the couch and get on your feet, this dvd will keep you motivated and meet your needs.But if you're looking for an intense cardiovascular workout, you won't find it here.The instructor irked me with her chirpy carb and calorie eliminating mantra. Her style of instruction will keep you focused on working off the spaghetti you had last night, rather than taking your fitness to the next level.The movements were shallow and overly simple-- they didn't even get up my heart rate!Although the 10 minute sessions are convenient for any schedule, this dvd is not for everyone. This is a mild work out best suited for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very effective","review":"I'm a 41 year old mom of two. I work out 6 days a week, run 5 m 4 of the 6 days, so I consider myself in good shape. This DVD has big problem: every segment has a few minutes of warm up and i think it should have a segment for warm up (5 min.) and then the 10 min. segments which I think are not that bad but when I'm already warm up and working out it is a little annoying to have to start again every 10 min. I will not use this DVD again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and effective!","review":"I just bought this one recently and tried it today for the first time. I did the first two segments for a total workout of 20 minutes.It's quick, effective and gets your heart rate right up there. There is very little warm-up and no cool-down to speak of (of course, with only 10 minutes per workout, you can't be cooling off half of that time), so just reminding everybody here (especially if you are new to working out) to make sure to take the time to bring down your heart rate after you're done, by walking in place and moving around. Do not stop moving until your heart rate has come back down to normal.It's great and effective. I really enjoyed this DVD and I will be using it regularly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD is a good no-nonsense burn and tone option. 5 10-minute segments to mix your own workout.","review":"I like this instructor. I remember her from years ago in the \\"Buns of Steel Total Body Fat Burner\\" video. She still has the same motivational teaching style. No skimpy or flashy attire. She gets right to the heart of burning and toning. The movements are challenging, but not frustrating to learn.The one down-side to this DVD is the same as in the other 10 minute solution DVDs... No count-down clock on the screen to keep you pushing to the end. Still, I love that you can pre-program your workout before you get started. This instructor keeps you moving. If you really work it, you'll sweat. My buns are definitely feeling it.If you enjoy this instructor, and want to try the \\"Buns of Steel\\" video, here is a link. I believe you can only get it on VHS. The moves are more challenging, but it is a lot of fun.Buns of Steel: Total Body Fat Burner [VHS]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a quick workout","review":"This is a good DVD for a quick workout.

This is definitely not for the beginner. I am significantly overweight, but young and pretty healthy otherwise. I ordered a balance ball kit---LOVE IT, and a pedal exerciser to use at work---another good choice. I got this DVD to mix it up and get a good cardio workout a couple times a week. Well, it's going to be awhile before I even attempt these workouts. It's very discouraging, and sometimes dangerous to try and work beyond your fitness level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cardio","review":"Each 10 minute segment worked up a sweat; giving the option to be done after one segment and feeling like the workout was worth it. It was also simple to continue to the next segment when time allowed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous workout!!!","review":"This is an awesome workout, time flies, you work up a good sweat and feel very challenged. The instructor is energetic and her cueing is excellent. The set is bright and the music is upbeat, very good production quality.

I highly recommend this as well as the 10 Minute Solution Pilates dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burn Baby Burn","review":"This video will get your heart rate up for sure. First make sure you have the right shoes. You need a good pair of cross-trainers to do this aerobic dvd. The first two segments are pretty weak, but are a good routine if you want something on the lighter side. Her kick boxing is awful though. Her technique in that segment is almost dangerous so be careful. The remaining three segments are hard core. You'll feel the burn and a little pain. I also like her toning section with hand weights. As for the instructor she defiantly isn't my favorite, but she is enthusiastic without being bubbly and most people seem to like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing to see a modestly dressed workout leader","review":"This may seem superficial but I love this video first because the instructor is modestly dressed. I don't like the skinny b's flaunting all their goods.. abs all exposed, boobs pouring out.. sorry that doesn't motivate me. This woman is obviously fit but doesn't need to flaunt it to me. Makes me feel like she's human and not manufactured :) On a fitness perspective, this is probably my favorite. The exercises don't kill me but are still very challenging. I break a serious sweat during each segment. I love that there are the 10 minute segments. Gives me a break if needed but also keeps the routine from being monotonous and its great that each segment gets a little more challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I often do higher intensity DVDs so this is great for 'the day after' when I can be a little sore but still want to get some exercise. The fast paced switching to different moves can be a plus so you don't get bored, but seems to move too fast in this one sometimes (maybe it's because I work out early in the morning :-) ). There are some higher impact jumps so it might not be good for people with hip or knee problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite workouts","review":"This is a great workout all around. Very easy to follow in choreography, and a lot of fun! The cardio blasts are killer, but a beginner could easily do the other segments. An advanced exerciser might find it fun for easier days. One of my \\"go-to\\" workouts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple choreography - tough workout!","review":"It's rare that one can find an aerobics video with a hard workout, very simple choreography, and that isn't boring. I suppose it's not boring because the basic workout changes with each 10-minute segment. The choreography is easy to follow (I'm a dunce and I can do it), and I was sweating HARD! You also don't need a lot of space. I'm very picky about aerobics, and this is one of the best DVDs I've found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cardio for Small Spaces!!!","review":"I bought this dvd on a recommendation and I love it! The 10 minute work-outs make it easy to do 30 minutes or more without feeling like it! I live in a small one bedroom and I can do it all easily without limiting my movements! I've already lost inches and improved my asthma. A must have for those who lack motivation to exercise like me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cardio workout!","review":"I'm not a huge fan of cardio - I am more into toning and body sculpting. But cardio is always important to get your heart pumping. This DVD is great - I love how it is divided into 5 segments and you can pick which programs you want, and even the sequence. Michelle is a great instructor - motivating and friendly, but not silly. Each segment truly gets your heart pumping and because each segment is only 10 minutes, there is no time to get bored. I do think you have to do at least 3 or 4 segments to get in a good workout - but they are fun and go by fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHACK SOUDTRACK WITH 3 PHAT SONGS ON IT","review":"OZ THE SOUNDTRACK IS WHACK AND THE SHOW ON HBO IS WAY BETTER.

It's not even fun, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll admit... I didn't finish it","review":"Ok so I really only got through the first 70 pages or so but I couldn't take anymore. Obvious fluff, idiotic allegories \\"this hit was his baby and it had all the signs of a miscarriage\\", use of \\"bad guys\\" to describe criminals and suspected perps, and a blatant biased view of the city that he so wonderfully addresses as vomit-like and a magnet for all insane and dangerous people. Hey, I live in NY and while it has it's moments, it's my home and it's not that bad. Last time I checked, plenty of crime occurred in other places as well. The ESU is an extremely valuable force that does some amazing things. It's a shame this book didn't focus more on telling the tales of the job WITHOUT the feel of an over-hyped accident/car-crash/shoot-em-up FOX series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera bag","review":"I got the bag fairly quickly.

Although she loved being a wife and a mom, somewhere inside of her she knew there was more to her existence and purged forward to discover this new side of herself. At first with much apprehensiveness she took baby steps, but through what she feels was spiritual insight she forged forward and walked into her full existence and one that brought great meaning to her life.Embracing her spiritual gifts our author encourages others to seek answers to such questions as: Who you are; Why you're here and What you're going to do about it. If you are interested in reincarnation and discovering past lives, dream interpretation and how to access your higher mind this book is for you. Written in an honest down-to-earth way this book will be easy for you to understand and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Little Guide Book","review":"This summer is spent several days in London.

My friend left Iraq because he is a Christian and in constant fear for his well-being.The video footage on this is all amateur and can be a little shaky and choppy at times, but the essence of what people are saying while sharing their experiences - sometimes even while chaos is breaking out around them - is very telling and sometimes very poignant. I can only imagine what direction the stability of country has headed towards in the nearly nine years since the video footage was created. I hope that the people there are able to find peace and rebuild their lives.The war in Iraq has been a mixed blessing for the people there and I liked that this documentary touched on so many different emotions and even has lighter moments of humor among the many tales of hardship and loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast delivery","review":"I have not used this yet, but the shipping was free and fast!

And you don't have to be a total LOTL fan to \\"get it\\" ... Eminently readable and biblical without being heavy handed ... I loved it. Even those who don't consider themselves Christians can enjoy the thought-provoking and well realized chapters. Those who are \\"Bible-shy\\" can understand the author's points by following her references to The Lord of the Rings. Well done! I can't wait to see what Sarah Arthur does next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and make a place on your keeper shelf!","review":"You don't have to be a LOTR fan to enjoy this book. This book can appeal and speak to teenagers and adults alike. In fact, I recommend it for everyone! Sarah Arthur does of marvelous job of using the lush backdrop of Tolkien's fairy tale to speak truth of character from a Christ-like perspective with scriptures as support. It's an easy read, yet deep - leading to thought provoking questions for discussions at the end of each chapter. I love the chapter on Integrity! Hats off and well done Sarah Arthur - truth in character without ever sounding trite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is one of the most inspiring Christian books I have ever read! Having both lessons and scriptures from the bible, and comparing those lessons with The Lord of the Rings and real life, this book helped me unravel confusing relationships with friends and family members, and helped me find honesty within myself. For you Christians that are The Lord of the Rings fans who need a little spiritual boost or just a great read, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walking with Frodo","review":"This could have been a very interesting read. It took us along with Frodo with many bible references. This is fine but unfortunately the author also tended to pontificate rather too much.

Just as Freud said \\"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar\\"...Sometimes a good story is just a good story! Most of the time in fact. Now stop picking it apart and ruining it for the rest of us. You put this garbage out there and now instead of having a lively discussion about a great story, there is the Christian stigma stuck to it and it turns into a religious debate. Forget walking with Frodo, just walk with jesus..and keep right on walking past all the good things in life before you taint them too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"Never in my life have I heard of such rubbish. The Word of God is to be the only basic source for the study of God's Word--not a trilogy of fantasy novels. Many Christians are becoming so wrapped up in pop culture that they have trouble differentiating the difference between the fictional events found within The Lord of the Rings and the true, inerrant Word of God.We need to get out of Middle-Earth and into the real world. You cannot find strength, guidance, and spiritual power in a fictional collection of stories, regardless of whether or not they are allegories of the Christian's journey.\\"Walking With Frodo\\"?! Is this meant to equate Frodo with Jesus Christ? Reality check: Frodo was never real, Middle-Earth was never real, and all the events which took place within Tolkien's world never happened. Christ was real, however. The battles He faced and the battles we face are very real, and we therefore should not waste our time in thinking that this garbage will assist us in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the standard","review":"I bought this as a second controller to the wireless one that comes bundled with the GH3 PS2 package.This is a far better guitar than the standard one that comes with the game. The response is a lot better and it feels more solid. I don't even use the standard guitar and I'll probably get another one of these so other people can play along with me.Cons: star power can be a pain. Even going vertical, sometimes it doesn't engage. The neck is indeed a LITTLE shorter than the standard guitar which is already short as-is. Also the cord could be a little longer, but it's about the same length as any PS2 controller's cord.

The fret buttons are farther apart and the curved sides are backwards compared to the official guitar that comes with the game. If all you ever use is this one guitar, you'll probably be fine (although the distance between the fret buttons does make them a bit harder to use), but if you are used to the old controller or if you plan to switch back and forth between the original guitar and this, you'll run into problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow....I can't believe this.","review":"I was completely tricked into thinking that I was purchasing 2 decent controllers that were quoted in the Sellers description as \\"Packaging shows some wear, but item is guaranteed to work like new\\".BOTH controllers I received don't work at all, & I feel my money was stolen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"I have gone through two of these guitars within two days...both times the guitar worked fine, then it stopped working during actual gameplay.

It is short, the buttons are spaced far apart, and they stick. The fret bar goes down ok but if you want to strum up and down for quicker and closer notes it won't go up and down. Sometimes it does not respond to you strumming the notes. Also it does not respond well when you pull up on the guitar for your star power and it messes up your notes you are trying to play.

I thought I could get over that fact, but then after owning it for two days it just suddenly stopped working! I had just finished playing a song and went back to the main menu, and found that none of the fret buttons responded anymore, and the \\"strummer\\" (not sure of what the correct term is) wasn't working either.

The spacing between the buttons isn't exactly the same and the opposite side is rounded. That being said, this has worked great for me. I didn't want to pay full price for another official guitar after having already spent so much to get the game with my first guitar, so I went with this and I am satisfied with my purchase. It has allowed me to play with two people and I have not had any problems with it. If you and all your friends are hardcore guitar hero players, then go for the official, but if you are a casual gamer or don't play on expert, this is a great way to allow two people to play without spending too much extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a few plays","review":"Bought the controller from Best Buy. My wife and I would occasionally get shocked from the guitar and it would temporarily stop working, but would work again after unplugging it from the console and replugging it. After maybe 5 sessions of playing the game, we got one final shock and now the thing is completely broken. We were not knocking it around or anything... we take good care of our things. I have owned a Red Octane Dance Dance Revolution pad for 6 years and it still works. The React GH controller is a total piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GUITAR!","review":"Like many others, I bought this guitar thinking I could save a couple of bucks. Now I'm stuck with a guitar that no one wants to use- it's the \\"bad\\" guitar. The green button sticks, and the fret buttons are upside down compared to the original guitar, making them harder to press down. Now I have to go out and spend MORE money on a better guitar. So in the long run, this guitar actually cost me more, rather than saving me money. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it 1/2 a star if I could, it breaks easily","review":"This thing broke pretty much as soon as I bought it.It worked for roughly one hour, then nothing.

The album in its entirety is a varied and solid mix of styles, both tender and firey, with accomplished guitar and haunting vocals. Between spicy flamenco numbers like Aires de Cuba or the more exotic textures of Farewell to Baghdad, there are some beautiful and tender moments (like Far Away or Prelude to Grace) making the album carefully considered and solid.The great musical instincts on Love's Philosophy do not always deliver songs with the passion or flair of other new flamenco stylists, but there are no dissapointments. Flamenco Caravan's first release is worldly and full of warmth.

When I received it and he tried to put it on he couldn't get the neck opening over his head without stretching it out. When he did get it on it was something akin to a second skin.

The difference: although Richie's work is actually very complete, compared to Satos's book, Richie's is almost \\"for dummies\\". I explain: Sato's \\"Currents\\" is not just an inventory of Japanese directors, films, synopsis and opinions, but also a first hand approach to the historic and cultural context and implications of those directors and films. Both are useful maps, but Sato's resembles more the territory.Now, it doesn't cover the last 20 or 25 years, because, strangely enough, it hasn't been reprinted since the 80s. So, I actually bought a second hand copy from a very good seller, and although he said it had some minor wear, the book is in incredible shape after more than two decades: No underlines, no marks, no missing pages.

And that's what's so shocking about \\"Bones of the Earth\\" -- that it's such a typical, moldy piece of sci-fi. I only made it through the first 4 chapters before losing interest completely, which is UNTHINKABLE in a Swanwick story!

The same character was able to be in the same place at the same time & yet it was not a paradox. (How do you like your older self telling your younger self what to do?) It didn't seem to be leading anywhere. The only plot I understood was the creationist spy subplot.

The whole time travel issue becomes so twisted and there are so many jumps both forward and back that it's difficult to keep track of who is who and where. The fact that the author allows his characters to meet themselves as well as intearact provided they do not pass sensitive information and cause a paradox does not help. Not to mention that at least one paradox is allowed but never really explained.There are some interesting theories tossed about as to dino evolution as well as their lives but it is really too little to save this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Not up to the literary standards of \\"Iron Dragon's Daughter.\\" Was really excited after reading the latter to discover a newish book by Swanwick with what I consider interesting subject matter.

This was an exception.The opening and first chapter seemed so promising! Then, in the second chapter, it fell apart with weirdness. Not one of the characters was is any way normal or likeable. The \\"action\\" was nonexistant. Worst of all, it started introducing lesbian characters, atheism and other unsavory content.I can honestly say I found nothing redeeming in this book. If it was supposed to have a message, it totally escaped me. I read several hundred books a year, and was bitterly disappointed in this lemon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep it by your computer!","review":"A handy resource for those thousand-and-one things you're pretty sure you knew how to do once.

My sense is most of the tips come from the authors' custom consulting jobs. Which is fine, but for those who are not VFP experts, it's not very useful.Apparently a good introductory/intermediate book on Foxpro hasn't been written yet.

Just for information ,the first track on this cd is single version of The Wild One."},{"rating":"2","title":"boxy but good","review":"This book is intended primarily for serious students of history. It discusses the foundations of historical research--what kinds of questions do historians ask, what constitutes evidence, what makes a source reliable, and the epistomology that underguards historical inquiry. The language is somewhat dense at times and examples are frequently pulled from European history, a not always felicitous choice for students of American history. Still, the reader leaves the book with an arsenal of questions that he can use in tackling his own research questions or in critiquing the work of others. I am still searching for the brief handbook that will provide the amateur historian with a guide towards writing honest, vital, and accurate local histories. To the best of my knowledge, it does not exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remedial Historiography 101","review":"This book would work well for an undergraduate Historical Methods class, but is fairly remedial and omits much in covering a broad swath while including superfluous chapters. Assessing validity of source material is such a basic enterprise that I was shocked to see a chapter on it, but nothing on the Frankfurt School. No book can please everyone, but this is REALLY a basic primer into source analysis and themes in historiography. Adding insult to injury, the book is structured in outline form, which makes it as engaging as a staff meeting or a lecture, but at least you can skim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Financial Realism in Retirement","review":"This is what happens when a highly qualified person writes a book to help others understand their retirement finances so that they can realistically plan and feel as comfortable as is possible with their present and future financial well-being.It is based on realistic historical and mathematical facts.

More wasted time spent cleaning the printer. The old Dell OEM cartridge works perfectly.

Why limit yourself to just a handpicked 6 stories when there are 2500 out there? Hmmm?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty marginal work","review":"I didn't dislike it and I didn't like it. There's a lot the author tries to cram in a limited amount of pages--that's part of the problem. Another problem that I had with book is that it that the interaction between characters was a touch contrived. While the exisentence of God, faith, etc. are all interesting issues, I'm not sure why there is a need to repeat the same philosphical arguments over and over, just with different characters. Further, Kerebos is presented as the ultimate evil, a killer of children, men and women alike, and yet he takes the time out to engage in a philosophical debate about God, faith, etc.?I had higher expectations for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely worth the read","review":"Although the reader is given a slight insite to the life of a woman inside a refugee camp and insight to how being victimized by the war affected her emotionally, it is a difficult and dry read. The translation is poor and I found some parts difficult to follow. Although the author's writing style did not appeal to me, after reading the book, I can now understand how a woman could reject her newborn child. Since the author begins and ends the story with the birth, that understanding may have been her objective. If so, she suceeded in my case. However, I think there are better books on this subject to spend your money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw Her at Perfect Wedding Guide Event - I LOVE THIS DVD","review":"I was at the Perfect Wedding Guide event in Orlando and bought her DVD there (I just bought another to give to my cousin for her wedding).

It moves smoothly and without difficulty. On both the swiveling and fixed versions, wheels rotate on their axle without bearings but on the nylon or plastic wheel center.

Don't overload, but should be fine for carrying weights of up to, perhaps, 30 lbs and perhaps a bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grizley 3\\" Caster with brake","review":"I searched high and low for a set of quality casters with brakes at a reasonable price. These casters far exceeded my expectations. The brake mechanism is superior to the type of brake that is like a teeter tooter on the side. This mechanism is easy to operate to free and stop the wheels. I have the other type of brake which frequently engages itself. The ball bearings are great in the casters, and in the wheels. I am replacing existing wheels on my table saw, and adding them to new tool stands as I acquire new machines! I can't imagine finding better value and quality in one brand! I am also going to keep an extra set on hand...just in case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casting Call","review":"I recently purchased a steel HDTV stand from a well known company. The optional set of four caster wheels, only two of which locked, was priced exceedingly high. The casters from Grizzly were perfect for this application. I installed four locking swivel casters and saved myself 80% by doing so. The locks engage and disengage so smoothly and easily, that I can do this in bare feet. Great deal, quality item. Grizzly saved me a real good chunk of change."},{"rating":"2","title":"review: dust to dust","review":"I loved this movie! We watched it in my spanish class, and I had to go home and buy it.

Griffith or his persistent substantial reputation. Obviously, no one has bothered to look at his films, otherwise their ridiculous 19th-centuiry theater mentality would be universally reviled. Birth of a Nation couldn't be shown to a modern audience without several provisos. Otherwise it would quickly provoke a race riot. And it's interesting how quickly the much-touted accomplishments of Griffith were surpassed by his contemporaries.

Finally, however, he realizes that the small ranchers must fence off the range to protect themselves from the massive herds of a greedy rancher and her ruthless foreman and helps string and protect the wire that he hates so thoroughly.

Nimzowitsch is difficult to comprehend, but his vision and his principles can take you to the promised land where you have a sense of really understanding chess. Absorb this book, and your chess will become more interesting and rational. You will have reasons for your moves. This book, and Nimzo's vision of chess, is mostly about pawn play in the final analysis. Pawns ARE the soul of chess, and I have never seen books that really get at the heart of pawn play like Nimzo's. This book contains heavily annoated games by this chess genius. Plus, there are many narrative discussions where he further elucidates the principles of pawn play in chess.

They have other alternatives. Even fans who strongly encourage going through \\"My System\\" have difficulty in recommending this book.This is not to say that Nimzowitsch is not a great player and theoretician.

The so-called leather sure didn't feel like leather and I was too disgusted to even try them on. I've owned more than several pairs of Engineer boots over the last 30 years and these are the worst I've ever seen, although by today's low, low standards with everything made in China I'm sure you could do worse than these boots from Carolina.

I wanted to stray away from the popular branded stuff that had \\"by-product\\" in the ingredient list, but she also doesn't have a strong bite so I could get the Greenies brand.This is the perfect breath freshener treat that my little dog can actually chew through. She's only 14 pounds, so I break each bone in half, which helps make the bag last alot longer. All in all, a great treat that picky dogs will love and tiny dogs can bite into (if you're dog can bite a carrot, they'll be fine with this.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - Enough review reading already!

It had everything I needed to mount my speakers to the ceiling. Let me tell you, these mounts are very sturdy and have shown no indication of slipping at all. I am very happy with these mounts and actually purchased a second set for my rear surround speakers. One personal note about the amount of weight they hold: I would reduce by 50% the actual amount of weight the speaker mount will hold in place without any slippage or extra wear, when compared to the manufactures maximum weight (i.e. published max. holding weight of 20 lbs, I would suggest that a speaker no more than 10 lbs). This has been my personal experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speaker Mount","review":"I used this mount to suspend rear speakers in my home theater system.

I attempted to use these with a pair of KEF Q100 speakers weighing 13 pounds. The entire weight of the speaker is supported by a soft plastic ball about an inch in diameter, held in place (theoretically) by a metal clamp with blunt teeth on the inside. The amount of friction offered by this design is insufficient to hold these speakers in place. One speaker slipped down overnight from a 15 degree angle to about a 45 degree angle, and once the plastic ball is deformed it slips almost immediately to a 45 degree angle.The frustrating thing is that the other speaker of the pair remained in place. I suspect poor quality control along with the flawed design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality with material of chemical fiber","review":"Three weeks ago, I ordered the 100% Alpaca Wool Poncho Coat Cape sold and shipped by Great Gift idea Etc from Amazon.

The harsh sound isn't there any more, it works silently now, but it definitely works!I think the speed and the \\"ever lasting\\" flatness are the big advantages of diamond stones and the DMT appears to be one of the best ones of that kind.It's nice, too, not to have to mess around with water or oil.

However, if the problem was with my drivers or my computer, I was SOL and left with no recourse. You don't really know how important good product support is until you need it, and I will personally never buy another gigabeat, and possibly never buy another Toshiba product.

Since it was still under warranty, I sent the player in. I think Toshiba just sent me a refurbished player that they swapped the serial number on. When I got the player back the serial number sticker wasn't even completely stuck on the player. I had to put a piece of tape on it just so it wouldn't fall off. I reloaded the player and went right on using it. Another 9 months later, same thing happened. Same error message and everything. Only now, the warranty had expired. I called to see how much it would cost to repair. $200 just to send it in with no guarantee that they could/would fix it for that price.

The software is well designed and pretty intutive . Though it doesn't have the click wheel like iPod , but I didnt find any problem using it and going through the various menus. They are all well designed and are visually much more better than the i-pod or other similar players. It takes some time to get use to the buttons and other controls , but once you get accustomed then its a zip .Cons : I returned this player after one week , because the biggest killer to it is the battery life, it hardly lasts for 6 hours. You cant expect a mp3 player to last just 6 hour. If I am outta my house , I should be able to play it for at least 12 hours...thats the only problem which i find with this, which undid all its goodness.Overall a good player , if you can live with a short battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, terrible performance","review":"First, let me start with the things I really DO like about the GB30. The user's interface is simple, the graphics are crisp, and it is ridiculously intuitive to manage and transfer music as a Napster Ready-to-Go device.However, the battery performance is pitiful. After 10 days (painfully aware that I am outside the window to return this for a refund from my seller), the battery would drain despite the fact that the unit was turned off.

If you want to capture Pitchshifter at their core sound, check out \\"Submit\\" or, better yet, \\"Desensitized\\". PS, in my less-than-humble opinion, was one of the first bands to perfect the balance between \\"metal\\" and \\"techno\\". \\"Desensitized\\" remains of the penultimate blends of these styles.

Unlike their last albums, \\"www.pitchshifter.com\\" is much faster, and it favors more electronica than the rest. Pitchshifter is still a thrash band though, becase the only thing favoring electronica is the awesome drums pumping and speeding throughout the album, but the drums are not the only thing that makes the album great. It is a team effort of flaming, throbbing bass, the ear drum butchering guitar, and the harsh vocals much better in this album that their last albums.Buy this CD!

Or if you haven't, then I'd recommend Bashar's Blueprint For Humanity, or Seth Speaks, instead of this lightweight feel-good garbage. You could get even more than the whole of the gist of this book's message by simply spending ten minutes reading about the Lemurian City of Telos online for free. I would expect the Lemurian's violet flame of enlightenment to shine a little brighter than this. The two stars are for the chapter about the final war with one-world government elitists and how humanity will experience a time of peace afterwards.

I'd have loved more puzzles with symbol/picture answers or answers where you have to squeeze an entire word into one box. There are a few of those here, but mostly straightforward puzzles.

Her cueing is difficult to follow, doesn't stay on beat, and comes at the last possible second.The workout itself provides a good level of intensity.

Not so the DVD: I could have burned it myself from the original tape I own and chaptered it up properly. With this DVD you have to fast-forward to even just get to the beginning of the workout as the chapters are not set properly. No nice menu, just a standard DVD-recorder setup.

The moves are easy enough to keep up with and the set is very cool. Gin Miller keeps a great count. I never wonder where I am at because her count is always right on. There are isolations at the end, just enough for a well rounded workout. Intensity can be upped by upping your step. For me, if the foot work is too complicated I never feel confidant enough to raise the step( I'm kind of a clutz). I have gotten several other step tapes from the Reebok series but this is still my fav.

Nix creates a believable fantasy world and populates it with compelling characters in the Castle. Then, he switches gears to create an equally complex environment and set of characters for our hero to find when he leaves the confines of the Castle. The story has fine twists and turns, and great action on both an individual scale and on a more epic scale.The problem is, this is not a six book worthy story. If you are really a fan of these characters and this story, it's certainly fine to read all six books. If time or money is at a premium, you can actually read book one, (\\"The Fall\\"), book two, (\\"Castle\\"), and book six, (\\"The Violet Keystone\\"), and follow everything perfectly well.

The idea itself isn't a bad one: a sheltered wizard boy tries to save his family, but winds up being shown the outside world.

The plot is disjointed, and there is nothing about the protagonist Tal that makes you care about him one way or another. The only female character that isn't hard, cold or downright malicious is Tal's mother, and she spends the majority of the book suffering from a mysterious illness that keeps her at death's door. Good science fiction/fantasy is well written and suspenseful (one chapter actually ends with \\"Let the battle begin!\\"), not just a version of a \\"Star Wars\\" film put into words on a page.

The atlas is divided into three major parts focusing on physical and cultural landscapes as well as world regions. If viewed as a \\"quick reference,\\" the atlas is excellent for providing some fast facts about each country. Included with each country reference are basic demographic statistics, a small map that shows the relative location of each country, maps of each country, the national flag, a written narrative on the history and economy, and for some of the larger countries, a timeline of historical events. The atlas is also loaded with nice color photos. The atlas doesn't contain a lot of fine detail on individual countries, but at 600+ pages and about 10 pounds, more depth would have required sacrificing photos or breadth of coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite, but close","review":"This review is for the european edition (revised, finnish).There is a mention of a globe population of 6 billion, but in the next chapter it says 5,5.

Suitable for young people and for those who are selecting travelling destinations. May act as a starting point in getting to know foreign cultures, but at least in the finnish edition some of the names of the near-by cities are taken from war-time maps, cities which have never in peace-time been part of Finland.

There is little if any detail, very few case-study example, and some significant holes in the instructions.Example: in the \\"Using Cues\\" section - there is a section \\"to list and edit your cues,\\" to \\"move cues\\" and to \\"delete cues\\"...but it says nothing about creating a cue to start with. These types of omissions can drive beginners insane, and signals some pretty bad editing.Further, abstract explanations of sounds (or worse, how sounds work) are nearly useless.

Then I started to adjust the position of the speakers. The first time I positioned them, everything thing seemed ok, but once I started fine tuning the placement, the nuts started to come out of the mount and I couldn't tighten them any longer.

Each course is tailored to one of seven types of systemic imbalance - what the authors call the Serious Seven. I followed two courses.

I remember at the time thinking how much better those were than anything I had before. A year ago (2011), I had bought the ZX-100 and had that same feeling all over again. I felt everything just had a lot more punch to it with deeper bass and higher highs.The first time I used these was at a friend's graduation party in June of 2012 where he was showing off a game his team had made at Digipen. I put these on and was instantly taken aback by how well the 7506's sealed out the outside world. I fired up the game, and knew right away these headphones were something special. Deep, heart-jolting base... crystal clear highs... simply beautiful. I can't recommend these highly enough. If you're in the market for a decent pair of higher end cans, these NEED to be on your list of considerations.

The response seems quick and accurate, and the highs are fairly crisp. Overall you can still tell it is a pair of headphones, and inherently can't give the same range and response that a full-range system can, but for what they are and the price they are, it's hard to go wrong.Oh, and if you ever have watched the TV show Frasier, he wears the same headphones in his 'studio'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bargain","review":"The sony MDR 7506 is the best headphone for this price.

What I am trying to say is that I have a lot of weight on these wheels and they work great. I can move the cabinet all around my garage with ease and then tuck it away and park my truck in there when I am done. Wheels work great, I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult, but worth it","review":"This stock was difficult to fit into my carver one, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I had to use some sandpaper to adjust the fitting of the grooves so I could get it into the marker. I then cranked the marker case together to secure it, and it was solid. There is absolutely no movement between the stock and the marker, no matter how hard I shake/bump/run headlong into trees that I swear weren't there a minute before. I have long arms, so I use it fully extended, at 11.5\\" past the end of the marker. For those of you with shorter arms, it has stops at 10.75\\", 10\\", 9\\", 8.25\\", and finally 7.5\\", which is a length selection that should suit all needs. It is relatively lightweight and has a nice high-friction back to the stock so it won't slip off your arm when you run and gun. Overall a very good stock and well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Stock But Bad Machines","review":"This stock is great i just got it in the mail today. However! It sucks so badly because it does not fit my tippmann 98 custom platinum series marker. I was careless enough to not fully read the reviews since the rating was this high. it does not fit what so ever. Hopefully i can file down the edges of it so it will fit the marker. if not i am going to return it because the idiots who made this dont look at there reviews just a little tweek and they can fix it. I suggest if you want to get a good stock but not that expensive get this but you will have to probably alter it for a while to get it to work. 2 stars just because i have to fix it."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy installment with one flaw","review":"i bought this stock for 15 bucks, it shipped fast and i had no problem installing it into my 98 custom.the stock provides quick and steady aiming, and looks pretty cool. the only thing i had a problem withis that if you aim down the sight with a mask on, my mask bumps into the stock and makes it hard to aimdown the sight. if you dont use your sight to much then definately go for it.im looking into attaching a raised sight so i can aim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got a RAP4 CAR stock instead","review":"Got the RAP4 CAR stock instead.

After using the gun for awhile this resolved itself. The big con is that the stoke is not sturdy and jiggles a lot and I expected more for what I paid for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stock, hinders precise aiming, though....","review":"I PERSONALLY believe this is a great stock, it adds great stability to your aiming for MUCH more consistent shooting. It does, however, hinder your ability to aim precisely with the iron sights, as the stock will not allow you to lower your face to it with a mask on, hence the 4 stars. However, I just practice shooting long distances without it and the tradeoff was WAY worth it, my shots are more consistent and has helped me on the field greatly. Also, it looks pretty sweet, looks more like an assault rifle than a paintball marker after you install it!Bottom: Great buy, highly recommended, hinders aiming a little, but learn to shoot without sights. Paintball markers aren't rifles. It saves time and will improve your game. BUY IT! As a side note, this barrel works great, and can read my review on it; Tippmann Sniper Barrel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected","review":"It is a very nice stock, very easy to adjust. The main problem i had with it was the end was too big to fit into the custom 98. I had to drill it down so that the gun would close properly when the stock was inserted. Then again i do get what i paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I have a Platinum series Custom 98 ACT from Tippmann and knowing that this stock worked with the ACT models I ordered it. I took my marker apart and went to install it only to find that it doesn't fit right. The drive spring doesn't even fit the hole. Actually the ACT spring was the only thing that fit right. So I went ahead and drilled the drive spring hole a little wider and dremeled the sides of the stock so it would fit better. I put my marker back together and I have to say that thing is not going anywhere. Mainly because it doesn't the way it should. However, the butt of the stock wobbles from side to side. The butt isn't coming off from the wobbling, it is just a minor nuisance.In all it does what it is meant to do though. What should be a 2-3 min install, depending on how good you are at taking the marker apart, took me 30+ mins. If you are on a budget and don't mind having to do some tool work on it, then get this one. Other wise I suggest looking into other models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly made stock.","review":"When I first tried to install this stock, the hole for the main guide rod/spring was too small, so I had to basically drill it to be larger. Then the next time I tried to install it, the guide rod fit, however, it would not fit into the receiver on the gun! The Tippmann receiver has two slots, with two corresponding rings on the stock to fit in. However, the part of the stock right after the rings is too close, and so gets in the way of any attempt to install the stock. I'm going to have to fix that as well.It's unacceptable that such a common item, for such a common gun, would have such clear errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"My boyfriend and I have recently bought Tippmann 98 Custom Platinum Edition.

It makes it more difficult, depending on the size of your mask, to look down the barrel of the gun. Paintball guns really dont have a whole lot of kick, and i usually just use the tank to help steady my aim if i need it anyway.Overall: looks cool, but impractical."},{"rating":"1","title":"rap4 stock sucks","review":"they sent me a rap4 stock that doesnt fit right. the hole for the spring was too small so i had to make the hole bigger. the gun shell would not close properly because the stock was a little too big. i had to bang my marker halves together till the plastic on the stock starts to shave and mold to the shell. i have a few rap4 products and let me tell yah, the quality is not there. i would give this a one star but since i end up being able to put the stock in i give it two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit Tippmann 98 custom","review":"This doesnt fit into the back of my tippmann 98 custom properly.

IT SAYS IT IS FOR TIPPMANN 98 CUSTOM tell me WHY IT DOES NOT FIT !?!? also i had to add duct work tape as well as electrical tape so it doesn't wobble and make noise all over the place lol... So if you want a fixer upper and take some time putting it on your gun this is for you.. i bought it because it was cheaper.. probably still would buy it again but it seems to have false advertisement saying it is made for the gun considering it does not fit out of the box... noobs... also it says RAP4 on the side if that makes a difference to anyone its black not very noticeable.... might be a knock off or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"We have purchased the Wind 'n Go flashlights in the past and have found them to work quite well, so this lantern was a big disappointment.

However, I'd only taken it on 2 trips (for a combined total of less than 2 weeks' use) in 2 years, and was at home re-winding it to recharge it when the handle simply stopped working-- specifically it seemed to disconnect from the charging mechanism on the inside and the handle became sluggish and ineffective. Peeking inside, I could see that whatever had broken was beyond my basic handyman's ability to fix.This WOULD be a great product, and it actually looks & feels durable, but for the hand crank to break while CHARGING normally seems to be a pretty bad design flaw.

Mr. Sears is obviously not a music teacher, he's a music maker and that's what he's attempting to instill in the viewer. He provided a basic skeleton or structure with the chords, scales, modes, etc., and then he shows you HOW TO MAKE MUSIC! You have to know three things: 1) what to do, 2) how to do it, and then 3) do it. Pete gives you the first two, the third is up to you.I loved his expression, \\"let the music breathe\\".

Now with an insight into note intervals and chord structures and Pete Sears' obvious passion for the instrument I'm motivated.

When I saw this, my initial thought was that it must just be a defective tire. However, all of the other tires followed soon after. I have saw dust on the floor of my shop. Not sure if the polyurethane dried up and that is why it cracked, but these tires will not hold up in the long run if you are using them in a workshop. You might have better luck if you use them indoors. I have switched to heavy duty rubber casters for all of my workstations.

However, I did feel like they were a tad small for my face, and I wouldn't say I have an abnormally large face.

It is a terrible design. Instead of a water tank that holds enough water for several cups of coffee, you have to pour a mug of water into the tank right before you brew. Then the machine brews until it is out of water! This is really goofy. Most mugs will not pour without dripping all over, so it is very messy. Then as far at brewing, sometimes the coffee comes out looking like water, other times it looks like coffee but tastes terrible. This is besides the plastic taste from the plastic pod holder. Target stores have these on clearance for $12.00. Even with the cheap price I took mine back. It is terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing design","review":"I have to agree with the previous review. I got my Simple Brew at Target on clearance, too. Brought it home and tried it.

I have only one substantive criticism, but it's a doozie: this book encourages the use of Excel for serious data analysis. But doing this kind of analysis in Excel/VBA is slow, computationally inaccurate, and very prone to both human and computer error. To his credit, the author does describe some of these issues.However, free tools like R and Octave and proprietary tools like Matlab and SAS will provide more accurate results and tremendously better reproducibility with less complex code. Excel is almost never the right tool for the job when it comes to scientific data analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Specialized but useful","review":"The title of the book is slightly misleading. This book covers numerical methods for Chemistry in great details and shows how to implement them in Excel. It could be the foundation of an undergraduate numerical anaysis course for chemistry students or chemical engineering students.I'm a physicist, so I can't comment on the chemical models presented in the book. Still, I learned a lot of things about Excel that I didn't know and it helped me implement customized VBA functions in some of my spreadsheets. In that respect, Chapter 8: Write your own macros, proved very useful. I got something else from the book: use Excel at your own perils. It is great for quickly whipping together a plot, a quick calculation, but it is not a robust numerical calcuation engine. The book advises to declare all variables as double precision - it is one way to alleviate the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why pay this much when you can get Mathematica 7?","review":"I don't understand why anybody would do serious scientific calculations using Excel of all software.

I did not buy these to be a Harley dude.They offer a fairly clear field of vision, although I could see slight waves in the lenses when viewed from a side angle. Also, there's a Harley logo that's molded into the lower left corner of the lenses, which is disappointing and bewildering because I don't want anything printed on the lenses of something I'm supposed to look clearly through! Plus, I personally don't like to pay someone to advertise their brand.After wearing for about two weeks, one of the screws holding the lenses fell out. The glasses were not roughly handled, so that shouldn't have happened. I reinstalled all screws with some thread locking compound, so all should be good there.The metal frame offers more durability than the standard plastic molded jobbers, so that's a bonus.

I quickly replaced it for a detachable strap (J. Crew to be specific, from the Timex Military Watch Strap collection) and now I can't live without this watch. Comfort increased 100 fold. Also, I agree with the earlier review that stated this watch is loud. It WAS loud until I replaced the strap. I think when the casing is resting directly on your arm it amplifies the \\"ticking\\" sound. Now that I have replaced the strap, I don't have this problem anymore.As far as the functionality and cosmetics of this watch, I have no complaints. In the two weeks I have been using it, it has fallen behind the Official U.S. Time (website) by only 1 second.In short, it keeps amazing time and once you replace the strap, it's a 5-star watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch, Wrong Color","review":"Nothing wrong with the watch but I noticed that another reviewer also didn't get the color he ordered.

Some of the reviews said that the face was grey. I would have been happy with grey. It is not black or grey it is a kaki green. I am very dissapointed. I bought it for a valentines gift because my boyfriend likes black much more than he likes brown. But unfortunatley I don't have time to return it so he will just have to be happy with this one.

I was wrong. The first time I mounted this combination of casters my cart was very unlevel! When I turned my cabinet upside down again I realized that the fixed base casters need an extra 3/8\\" or so of shimming to be level with the swivel base casters.All in all, I highly recommend these as quality products that will allow you to make immobile things mobile, which is always a good thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad...","review":"Decent caster for the money. Excellent if you aren't working near the weight limit. I bought them because of the value to mount on a router bench that needs to be solid but not too mobile so I got what I wanted.

In particular, details about the role of the Old Father Tree, Tracker and Toadkiller Dog, and the final battle with the Dominator all could have used greater development. Each of these offered interesting twists but the details were too few and potentially worthwhile tangents were touched on all too briefly and largely left unexplored.Despite these issues, it was good to finish the trilogy and Cook has won me over.

That's when the problems started -- The printer will no longer scoop up paper from its tray... it tries a couple of times, then starts flashing like a paper jam.

After two attempts, the printer stops and signals paper jam, which requires pulling the paper out and putting it back in to try again. Very frustrating. I've tried several different papers.

The print quality is just as good as my first bonafide Samsung cartridge.My theory is Samsung screwed up the quality control on the cartridge, or outsourced them, because the fuse (the shiny green roller) is blue on the newer ones that don't work.

The metal part of these come across as fairly well made and heavy duty, the locks seem to work quite well, and my fish cooker is now easily movable without throwing my back out trying to lift one end of it.The only thing I could see that might be an issue in the long run is the wheel is just dry bare plastic riding on a dry bare metal shaft.. Might want to take the wheel off and pack it with grease, just to keep the friction down to make it last longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Wheels","review":"Great wheels for my work tables and they worked well except two of the caster's threaded stems were mared and required work to clear the threads.

These not only lock the wheel from rolling when engaged, but also lock the swivel mechanism in place. This makes the mounted unit completely stable when all 4 wheels are engaged. I had to go to Lowes and buy matching metric nuts (found in the custom hardware bins, not on pegs on the wall), since none were included with the wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent heavy-duty caster","review":"I put these on the base of my old Craftsman table saw, which has a cast iron top and is plenty heavy. The casters work great---very smooth rolling, given the heavy load. Thanks to reviewer John Z. for the info regarding the hex nuts (though they are 12mm-1.75, not 12mm-1.175).Another reviewer commented that the locking mechanism is not as pictured, and this is true (it looks more like the one pictured for the Steelex D2608). However, it seems to be working fine on all four wheels and doesn't seem flimsy to me. When locked, the saw was solid during operation, though I admit I made only a few test cuts so far and nothing too demanding. The quality of the casters was impressive overall. I won't hesitate buying these again should the need arise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"These casters do not come with a nut to install for use. That's because the problem is the size of the thread is not standard or metric!!! I cannot find a nut anywhere to screw on to these pieces of crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ok but need to be supplied with nuts.","review":"The swivel post was a a little too big for my scroll saw table and jet lathe so i had to enlarge the holes in stand.

Two persons gave five stars, one gave one and I am giving two just because of the funny faces of the author on the back cover of the book. She might be an excellent presenter of stories. The stories reflect life and maybe true, but I did not find them funny. The book has positive values and gives some good lessons, but my review reflects the wrong promises of the front cover. The couple on the cover is just about exhausted about laughter. They may have their own jokes to laugh, but not those from the book. This review makes me sad, because it is terribly difficult to write a really funny book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardware and Package inspection is terrible!!","review":"The Bad---I gave this a low rating because i was shorted more than half the spacers, and the screws suck, 5 of them either stripped or broke off. I expected a little better products from an american company and that was the main reason i bought Bushwacker, you can get copies of these off ebay for half the price and i should have went that route. I was out a lot of time and gas running around town trying to find replacement screws and something i could use for spacers. Never found any screws and had to cut fuel line hose to make spacers...The Good---The flares fit fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way ahead of it's time.","review":"The Gigabeat's slick design and beautiful display are what first attracted me to purchase this device. I have had it for two and a half years and it is still working like a charm. Granted I do not use it as much as my other audio devices. Sound playback is accurate except for a minor static sound right before each new song. Video playback on the gigabeat's screen is truly jaw dropping. Problems: battery life is non existent. After the first month the battery just would not stay for more than two hours. As for media for the device it is hard to find anything to buy, and conversion software is few and far between. The good thing about this device though is I can still use it as an external hard drive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No need for any other MP3 player!","review":"I purchased this wonderful little device on February 10th of 2007. It is now May 5th of 2008 and so far I have not had a SINGLE problem. My Gigabeat currently houses 5500 songs 48 movies and 3300 photos. I use Amazon Unbox so a good majority of those movies are TV shows but I have never once had trouble transferring songs or movies to the device. I have owned 13 other MP3 players ranging from a Zen Nano to Ipods and this one I have found to be the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad choice","review":"We also did the research and thought this was the best from all reviews read. I bought it in january and it worked for a couple of weeks and then died work--screen froze. amazon sent a replacement. it worked for well for two months (except we couldn't download tv shows recorded on our PC in Media Center XP), then screen froze and it would only turn on if plugged into the ac adapter. By this time, we had to return it to Toshiba. When we got it back, it was not fixed. Just sent it back to toshiba again. we'll see. It's a lot of money to spend on something that doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat and easily breakable","review":"At first I really liked this Gigabeat. It lasted about three months though as one small drop broke the player, disallowing it to play music. The Gigabeat is a very thick media device and by now I don't really suggest you buy it as there are plenty of other mp3 devices for the same price that are much more advanced than this one. The only thing I really liked about this Gigabeat was its loud sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRASH","review":"I bought mine for $200 but even that was overpriced when you consider that it only worked for around 6 months. One day it just froze for no reason and all my songs disappered only to reappear a few days later. Now the unit only works is if it's plugged in which renders it pretty much usless. Don't buy this piece of trash. Now I'll just have to break down and buy an iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 - 2 hr. battery life","review":"Battery is awful, I had to send it back to be repaired.Customer Service said if it fails again,I will have to send it out again.A real LEMON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toshiba MESVK Gigabeat 60GB","review":"It should've been great, but wasn't.1) Doesn't keep your music on it very long after you've transferred to it.2) Doesn't transfer all of the music you tell it to transfer to it.3) Talked to one of my colleagues; the player itself cut out after having served for less than a year.Solve problems with what seem to be hard drive/memory errors, and design a program other than Windows Media Player (because it's buggy) to transfer music to it, give it what it needs to last for multiple years on end, and you'd have a 5 star product.Don't know where Toshiba's going to get the money for the R&D;, considering that no one really wants to buy anything other than those flippin' just-as-defective iPods these days, though.Until Toshiba can get it together, go for a Creative MP3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gigabeat 60 GB - Lots of Room in here","review":"With so much room it swallowed up my entire catalog of 513 albums, and over 2,300 songs in no time flat and still had over 45 GB to spare! That's including over 1,000 high quality photos!Easy to use with Windows Media Player (though I'd rather use Real Player). Simple drag and drop adds any files you want.The video playback is as good as any other media players on the market with a slightly bigger screen to boot.My only complaint is the volume level is too low. It may be to protect my own ears, but I like my sound loud, and it only gets a 5 on a scale of 11 for loudness.Overall, excellent product for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after only 3 weeks!","review":"I thought the MES60VK was absolutely great for the first 3 weeks - good features, excellent sound and easy to use. Then suddenly overnight, the battery went from 80% power to completely dead and would not recharge. The unit is now back at Toshiba for repair. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Working Great in 2013","review":"This has been a great music player for me and my music collection. I used this for a few years and then stopped as I did not listen to music for 2-3 years. I took is out of the drawer I was storing it in and charged it.

If you have an interest in Windows Media Center 2005/Vista Ultimate/XBOX 360 then this is the product for you as it is fully compatible with all and offers synchronisation of music, pictures, recorded TV and video. The display is very bright and clear and the sound quality from the head phones is great. This product would have got five stars if the USB connector was better and if it shipped with a protective case! Wonder what the Zune will be based on??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in 5 days","review":"During the first four days of its life I liked my Gigabeat 60. Its interface is intuitive, and the sound is good. In fact, I ordered a second unit for my wife. I don't play videos so whatever problems there are there is of no concern to me. The only problem during this honeymoon was that the battery was dead every morning. I assumed this was due to operator incompetency and wowed to plug it in every night.However now, on day five the unit is dead. Toshiba service does not answer the phone, I cannot find any helpful information on the web. They are both going back.at in Florida"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toshiba MES60VK Gigabeat 60 GB Portable Media Player (Black)","review":"This portable media player from Toshiba is pretty cool. It's very easy to use. In fact, I figured out how to use it right after I took it out from the box. The only thing that I don't like about it is that some of the video that I have on it, seems to glitch sometimes... otherwise I would have given this product 5 stars...I like this better than the Ipod personally..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unhappy with product","review":"I was interested in the gigabeat, since I did not want to have to conform to IPOD. The reviews were good. First problem is the battery life is advertised at 12 hours...try 6. I saw an article that said that 12 would be optimal conditions...my battery drains in 24 hrs if not plugged in.Next problem...one day, I plugged in and started and all memory seemed to get wiped out...after discussing with Toshiba phone support (very friendly and helpful), the firmware was no longer valid. Sent back to Toshiba and all was working. Less than a week later now, I just started up again and now all my info is removed again...this is all within a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gigabeat Rocks","review":"I have never had a different MP3 player but I have tried my friends I-Pod and this item GIGABEAT is just so awesome. It is user friendly and the controls are easier to use. I do not know HOW I ever lived without it. It is so cool to play songs from different artists, switching quickly from album to album and the quicklist feature for fav songs is so cool. I love the sound. I am going to invest in other headhones because earbuds let in too much noise. But I recommend this product highly!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent In Every Way","review":"This is an excellent mp3/pmp with a very simple user friendly interface, lots of hard drive space, amazing screen resolution, and extremely versatile file conversion...it uses Windows Media Player. I am sick of the Zune and IPod proprietary file conversion and wanted something that will play nearly anything...and this is it. Battery life is somewhat subpar when watching flicks, but other than that....absolutely perfect for what i need =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck with WMP for transfering music files","review":"I bought a 60 gb Toshiba player a few months ago, and returned it to Amazon. I listen mostly to classical music and WMP makes absolute hash out of classical albums. (Not really their fault; most classical albums have info on them that us completely messed up.)This is not a probem with my Creative player; I just plug it in to a USB port and drag 'n drop the folders I want to the player, then create a playlist. You can't do this with the Toshiba; you MUST use WMP. Microsoft strkes again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Besides low battery life, no flaws","review":"So I turned my ipod on one day and got a frowny face on the screen, signifying hard drive failure, which costs about $250 to fix. Thats why I grabbed this bad boy, great format, large drive for the heavy collection...but do be warned the battery life is not the claimed \\"10-12\\" hrs. When occasionally using the screen (only to switch songs/albums) it lasts about 4 hours, maybe 5 max. Ive had the gigabeat for a little over a month so I dont know if the battery life will gain over time and that this is just the battery getting \\"broke in\\" or whatnot. Volume could go a lil louder than capacity, but i guess its objective to each's own hearing. Drop the ipod, this things bigger and a very suitable alternative.

It uses Windows Media Player.. another waste of space. It is inflexible, renames files randomly, and mysteriously erases files. It is a nightmare if you are trying to change mp3 players. If you are a new to mp3 players, GOOD LUCK, this will have you tearing your hair out in about 10 minutes. My job is in the audio/visual field, and I wanted to throw the thing through the window after a couple of HOURS of frustrating \\"syncing\\" of files. DO NOT buy this product. If it gave the option of using other software.. then maybe. It is a nice looking paperweight, I have to say. You are not able to rename, delete, or sort your media on the machine, and trying to do so after it is loaded (in Media Player), HA! I gave it one star for looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return It","review":"The switch from ipod to this came only because my ipod broke. I wanted to try something new and I heard this was good. I was wrong. I used it for one day and it broke my computer. I installed the update to media player and it corrupted my system. So I reinstalled windows and tried installing this again, same thing happened. I did like the screen and the whole set up of the item, but the software needs some major help. I think Microsoft needs some help with there coding and Toshiba should make there own transfer software so this problem wont happened to anyone else. So far I have found nothing that compares to the ipod, so if you need a new mp3 player wait for the next gen ipod and I think you will have a better experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mp3 Player","review":"to me, music is the very thing that drives my life. So, when i started to look for a Mp3 player, I wanted something that was simple, different and capable. and that product was the Gigabeat MES60Vk. in my reasearch i found that the player was a nice alternative to the ipod. the player is very sleek and functional, it can sync pictures from a digital camera, and can download recorded video from tivo. the screen is larger than that of an ipod video and clearer too while maintaining the same size of a 60 gig video ipod.some downsides to this product are- short battery life.- equlizer presets kinda suck- integration with WMP 11 is a little laggeybut after owning the player for a while, it is really a great player and is deserving of consideration when buying a mp3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"battery life sucks!!!!!","review":"guys one thing is for sure the playback time is really low .....it dies down exactly when i need it and whats more pathetic is it erratic playback time ....sometimes lasts for 4 hours or even 3 hours .......PLEASE dont be misled by any reviews about battery life ........."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst player ever","review":"battery 1 starsupport 1 staraccessories 1 starerases library frequently -5 starsI loved it at first, then it broke my heart"},{"rating":"1","title":"The gigabeat S is just a prototype for zune","review":"This is a good product, the only thing is that it will delete all the stuff that's on it even if you look at it funny. I have had it delete my all my music and videos and pictures on it that took hours to put on in an instant. And what's worse is it happened more than once, 7 times is to many. So in the end would i recommend this product. To someone I don't like yes. Otherwise I highly recommend getting a microsoft zune. And it is just a really really bad prototype for the microsoft zune anyway, trust me I sold this player and bought a zune. The interface is the same, bigger screen, more color variety. What do you have to lose with the zune, memory? If that is the case you can just wait until the zune 2.0 comes out later this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice on the surface, corrupt underneath.","review":"I have had one for six months and have had to send it back for replacement four times. It has very poor software and no documentation. It has trouble playing protected files, and the hard drive gets corrupted at the drop of a hat. Once corrupted, there is no fix except returning it for replacement because there is no mechanism for totally erasing the hard drive and restoring the player to a virgin condition. There are virtually no accessories and it appears to me that Toshiba may abandon the product very soon, especially now that Microsoft has decided to make Zunes with another company. (In case you didn't know, the Zune so far has been a Gigabeat in disguise.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned this item","review":"Item did not feel as solid as my ipod did.

The Gigabeat automatically copied all my music, photos, and videos from my computers. The album covers are displayed when when selecting and playing the music. The digital photos of my children, even on the smaller screen size, look great.I have taken it jogging, biking and in the car and never has it skipped or given me any problems. It has even been dropped twice onto tile floors, denting the corners of the gigabeat, and it still works great.

I actually got this in the mail a day or two early so I was even more excited because I got to use earlier than I thought. I opened up the package and started using it after I charged it to full. The next day I had to teach a martial arts class and I had all the connections to connect it to the radio and I made sure it was fully charged before leaving. After teaching an hour class before leaving I put the player to my ears to find that only after an hour the battery was dead. For the next week the player continued to die during my classes even though it was fully charged. I love the way this player looks, but the fact that it keeps screwing up on me pisses me off. Until finally I returned it and bought the new zune player in brown. Trust me, the toshiba is not worth the money, get the zune player, it's less gigabytes, but at least the battery won't die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long term use stinks","review":"I have had my 60 GB for almost 18 months with very few problems. Recently however the unit just stopped working for no reason. I tried to reformat the device with no success. Toshiba's website says to use the directions as outlined in the owners manual (which there are no directions for fixing the device). I then called customer service and they said that it would be $165 to repair the device regardless if it was a major fix or not. The unit has been very well cared for and is only 18 months old!!!I WILL NOT get another Toshiba product as my experience, and from I can see the Toshiba customer service experience for others, has been really poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds good, bad battery life","review":"If you use a subscription service, stay away.

As a Ernest fan, I really enjoyed seeing content I have never seen before. I mentioned in the title that the packaging is poor.

There are some really amazing songs on the album, my favorites are Keeping me awake, Tristan and Iseult, Sister Nebraska, Neapolitan Bridesmaid, and If I had more time. His songwriting skills are unbelievable, weaving in literary references to Camus along with lyrical imagery like a shy pigeon toe'd state of Nebraska smiling at you. The only real problem with the collection is that the musical style can get a little repetitive. If you like guitar and violin heavy musical stories you'll love this album. Take the Decemberists and dial back the experimentation and dial up the country/bluegrass elements.Many Tarkio songs are on my regular playlist and are among my all time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after one month","review":"I need a quick release keychain to separate my work keys from house keys.

I obviously don't know nearly enough about \\"art\\" to make an informed judgment on this book, but it did a world of good for me.

There is a good introduction to the basic tools and materials of painting, presented in user-friendly non-technical language. The whole idea of the book is to get you started without a lot of fuss. After a brief intorduction, you just jump in and paint! The author focuses on acrylic paint and pastels, which are easy to use and readily available. But you could transfer these ideas to any medium once you understand the thought process. I'm an experienced painter with formal education and years of practice, and I had fun working through this book. I would definitely recommend it for complete beginners. But also for more experienced artists or advanced students who are feeling stale or blocked in their creativity.

What the film lacks in production values it more than makes up for with the acting of the cast, notably Dame Margaret Rutherford as Miranda's devoted and delightfully daffy nurse. The film presents a satirical take on the British class system as Miranda enchants and manipulates men from all classes of society. An interesting note, David Tomlinson, who plays the enraptured chauffer, later starred as Johns' husband in Disney's Mary Poppins. A sign of things to come, as soon as Glynis Johns Miranda changes scenes from water to land her hair is luxuriously coiffed and curled automatically, much like Daryl Hannah's Madison in Spalsh!

In this story, ridiculous situations arise again and again (perhaps situations that are a bit too ridiculous and a bit too frequent) and the main character seemed to become caught up in the flow and have no reaction.

Our hero, Tye, was so handsome, studly and perfect it was difficult to see why the heroine didn't just fall for him right away like I did.

He examines dometic, regional, and international factors as determinants of Syrian foreign policy, which, according to his anaylsis, is driven by realism. Using an 'omnibalancing model', he argues that Syria has been consistent in its search for a comprehensive settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. He presents Syria's role in the Second Gulf War, and the peace process (of which he provides a succinct account until 1997) as two examples of Syria's adjustment to the changes in the international arena since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the advent of the New World Order. The author's contribution lies in his sound understanding of theories of international relations which he applies skillfuly to the Syrian case in order to prove his argument."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"This book is from 1998.

The first volume covers the first few centuries of the church. The discipline of penance is covered in great detail. The Apostle Paul is described as exercising binding and loosing when he delivers one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh so that the sinner's soul can still be saved. One striking feature of the early post-Apostolic church was its severity in dealing with serious sinners and apostates. At first such individuals were summarily excommunicated from the church and thought to have almost no chance of reconciliation even with God Himself. Later on, one penance became available after baptism, and it sometimes involved years of self-humiliation. In time, the practice of regular and private confession to a priest had developed, and penances became more symbolic than austere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pride Final Conflict 2004","review":"Very good Pride DVD.

For example, he points out that the English Bible is about 3,000 pages long and there will be 2 or 3 questions (out of 230) about it on the test. Good thinking. He also does a pretty good job breaking down the various schools of literary criticism and theory (as the testmakers tend to see them) and his sample test with explanations is a lot more helpful than the sample tests you can buy from ETS.All in all, this book is well worth [the price] since you already have to pay $150 to take the test!"},{"rating":"2","title":"oh yes.","review":"Not only did I find this book infinitely useful, I loved its comical and patronizing tone towards the test.

The film, never anything special to begin with, is dated, and aside from bare breast shots seems like a sub-par television movie. As for the Blu-ray transfer, it's terrible. Background lacks clarity and definition, dark scenes are murky, and blue sky, like at the beach-side opening, seems to have smog particles dancing in the air, it's THAT grainy. It looks as if the VHS version was slapped onto disc and the production company said, \\"That's good enough.\\" I bought this DVD at a local resale shop for $5.00 and I still feel ripped off.

Additionally, the constant advice that enemas are the cure to all cures irritated me to no end.On the bright side, however, the constant use of enemas and lemons did supply a couple of (probably unintentional) lighter moments.

Set on the home planet of the only other sentient species ever found, the characters in this book are anthropologists who are trying to understand this new kind of intelligent life. In the process, they discover more about themselves than the objects of their studies. Listed as a Utopian novel in many reviews, it is not. However, it does include a distinct future Earth (in the human anthropologist's memories, actions, and attitudes) that could be described as a Utopia of sorts. This is a book for those of us who like to think, and it's one of the best books of this kind I have ever read. Do try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply AMAZING!","review":"I have waited for a long time for this cd to come to mp3. This cd was Far-Less' first album and was independently released, but was never released in mp3. It's finally out and is literally THE BEST ALBUM that ANYONE has EVER RELEASED! The style of Far-Less is simply amazing! Their musicianship and mastery of their instruments was incredible and definitely easy on the ears.Broken Hearts Unite is the best song on the album, along with others like \\"A Virus On My Mind.\\" This whole CD is emo to the roots, but is also incredibly diverse in the styles that they grab from in each song and you can easily hear the harder, metal inspirations in A Virus On My Mind.I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the bands Emery, Dead Poetic, Before Their Eyes, and other post-hardcore/emo acts.

The setting in the poor, bleak working-class neighbourhood of Fifteen Streets, in turn-of-the-century Newcastle, is wonderfully good, but especially, the acting is superb (do they all really speak that way?). The conflicts that these characters live through in the story change them forever, and you actually can see this in the expression on their faces, from hopeful to hopeless, and in the inflection of their voices. This is really ACTING at its best. After watching the film we are left with a feeling of respect for these hard workers and their families, who get over misery and bad times thanks to their sense of dignity and (in the case of the main character -who is NOT Sean Bean-) love. Not to miss, even if you are not a romance buff (which I am not)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful tale with a powerful hero!!!","review":"The version I saw of this story was on stage in the late 1980's in London at the Playhouse Theatre (I think) with Owen Teale in the lead role. It is a powerful story well written and acted just as well by the superb cast. I have remembered this show since I saw it on stage 15+ years ago and the mesmerizing performance Owen Teale gave. It highlights what the class system meant in England in the days gone by. I hope this show comes out on DVD as it would become a welcome addition to my collection of good drama. I strongly recommend this story to fans of good drama, stage or film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a treasure at all...","review":"After three books showing such steady improvement in this series, this fourth installment in the Dragon Nimbus series was a particular disappointment. It definitely was the lowest point of the series. I had a difficult time even forcing myself to finish it. The plot dragged on and on, the characters completely ceased displaying any individual traits, and the dialogue became totally cliched and interchangeable between characters as they each lost their own voice.The book also ends quite abruptly - particularly since this is the last book in the series. Radford has left her created kingdom in a complete disarray with nothing resolved whatsoever. Although, to be honest, after this travesty of a novel, I don't know that I would have any interest whatsoever in picking up a fifth volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music, mediocre recording","review":"I love the songs on the CD.

For other potential converts it might be the way he describes the logic and intelligence of the Qur'an which would do it, or his obvious sincerity and honesty in telling why and how he converted, with many of the emotional components of his experience.In my opinion this book is better than his other book, Struggling to Surrender, and I'm glad I read this one first. I wonder if those who have been Muslims all their lives have any idea how many converts this book is likely to produce. It is too bad it is not better known."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wake up Call!","review":"A wonderful Book! A must-read!.It put me to tears.I could not put this book down.I highly recommend it. Beautifully written. It is a wake up call for all of us immigrant muslims,who do much disservice in the spread of Islam in North America. For new converts,and non-muslims who are are interested in reverting to Islam, this book lays the ground to what you would expect in your journey.Stay steadfast and God will guide you.As a muslim immigrant, I was ashamed to see that a convert muslim was more jealous, and understood Islam better than myself, and others I know, who were born and raised as such. Dr Lang, may God bless you with his mercy.Not only will I recommend this book to my muslim friends, but God willing I will be more involved in my community mosque and Islamic Center."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book; get it now","review":"This was a pleasure to read; Lang shows that he can really seperate the culture of some Eastern societies from the religion of Islam.

Further questions on Islam can be directed to me at any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLating Men at their best","review":"This, the fourth Floating Men studio effort, is once again a phenonemal CD.

It would also benefit from removal of the sketchier flights of fancy toward the end (why did he veer off into such irrelevancies as a denunciation of pasteurized milk?!).That said, it still provides some value in laying out (in purple prose) a case against statins and in providing many potentially useful leads to more information.Malcolm Kendrick's The Great Cholesterol Con is a far, far, FAR better book, and I recommend it instead. The chapter on Statins in The Overdosed American, by John Abramson, is also a very good alternative, among others.I gave two stars for the author's enthusiasm, and for the considerable research he has reported on.

I have numerous other 2-AA flashlights and have never had a problem with them, even for the last 10 years. But with the 3-AA model, the batteries corroded within probably 6 months or so. In fact with both my Maglite and Streamlight, I kept them only indoors, one at work and one at home, one used Energizers, one used Duracells, and yet they both did the same thing.

You would think that it is about formatting resumes and other business documents, as the title would imply. But the book is really a very basic introduction to Word that walks you through the menus and dialogs. Business documents are created but little or not time is spent on the form of the documents. Which is sad because all too often the form of resumes speak more about the technical competency of the individual than the content of the resume itself.The book covers Word from the basics of using the mouse through to creating, formatting, and printing documents. There is some relatively advanced coverage of templates, which is surprising in this context.

It was also dominantly Christian, which was not what I was looking for. I was disappointed.

Guess that's why it's been around the longest."},{"rating":"1","title":"USELESS: God God God - very dramatically Christian!","review":"I was appalled when I flipped through this book to find that just about every sample vow uses the words \\"God,\\" \\"His,\\" and \\"Holy Spirit.\\" There is no room for other faiths, or for secularism, in this book - quite incomplete! I bought the book for the chapter on Second Marriages, which is my situation. Unfortunately, this book assumes that if you are getting married you must have been through a tragedy that left you near suicidal. The second marriage vows are sickeningly co-dependent, very dramatic ('you put an end to my torment, heal the wounds, dash the flames of punishment;' sheesh!), not joyous at all. How about those of us that had a healthy divorce, or moved on after widowhood? Also note: there are no guidelines for building your own vows, merely tons of example vows for you to plagiarize. I found this to be a completely useless book of wedding vows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional Vows","review":"This book offers many \\"traditional vows\\".

I was pretty shocked when I got it because the book has been almost useless for me. Virtually none of the designs in this book are historically accurate or reference actual manuscripts, they seem to be 'inspired' by history instead. The aesthetic of almost every single illumination is the same - floral motifs with pastel colors that look like cheap designs off thrift store China plates. There isn't one page in this book that shows historical examples or attempts to recreate them, most of the designs look like 1800's Neoclassical interpretations of illumination. A lot of the designs are heavily inspired by French Books of Hours from the 15th century but none of the designs in the book are as delicate or impressive as the real deal. If you're looking for historical accuracy or a detailed guide for how to create illumination then you should definitely skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better","review":"This book is useful for the amateur.

Unlike Zyklon's 2nd album Aeon, this is a straight up new school Black/Death Metal album in the veins of newer Emperor and Myrkskog. This is fast volatile music and there's some surprises thrown in for a change of pace (Industrial segments). I like this album, but it really can't be compared to Aeon. This is a completely different BEAST. W.O.W has all the elements to stand above most all Death/Black metal groups. If you don't listen to groups like Belphegor or Myrkskog, the intensity may rip right pass you. Only for the Die Hards who can break down the really fast metal and enjoy the violence!! Check this out and you will not be displeased. How can you with members from Emperor, Limbonic Art, and Myrkskog?"},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE DEBUT BY AN ALL-STAR LINEUP.","review":"So now that Emperor are no more, what do you have to listen to? The answer lies in this cd, Zyklon. Zamoth aka Samoth and Trym have formed with members of Lymbonic Art and Myrkskog. Now what does this cd sound like u may ask? well it is an extremely fast mix of brutal death/black metal. Although most of the songs are really fast there are some slower parts which sound really good. There is also some experimenting with a synthesizer on here. Overall, the album is very different and very original. However, the negative is that the production isnt too good (low vocals). The lyrics for this album are really good too, dealing with religon(against it of course) and the demise of mankind. The best tracks on here are Hammer Revelation, Storm Detonation, Worm World, and Transcedal War. I am definately looking forward to their next release and I recommend this to any black or death metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powreful and Apocalyptic","review":".... Now, onto the music. It rips. It is very brutal. Trym does what he does best. The combination of Zamoth and Destru...(oh, forget it) just tears the painting off the wall. Daemon's vocals truly shine hear as he combines black metal screeches with death metal growls. Guest artists include Garm of Ulver, Arcturus, and ex-Borknagar. Also, ... Persephone makes an appearance. And if that is not enough for you. Bard \\"Faust\\" Eithun is the lyricist for the entire album. His lyrics are mostly about being anti-Christian with some songs dealing with the Apocalypse.Overall, I enjoyed this album immensely. It is neither too long or short and it never gets boring. Also, no song sounds the same as is the problem with many albums today. Get this album and enter Zyklon's world of worms."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible.","review":"man i thought this computer was good times when my father first bought one... for about 4 months. then i became technicaly competent and discovered that the power supply is a TURD, the graphics card was an easy replacement (on the grounds that it blows), and the dvd-rw is god awful. save a few hundred and buy sonys 21\\" crt and make a custom from tigerdirect...i wish i could rate 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"FIRE!!!!!!!!","review":"This computer started burning out of the power box!

It is centered on women and that is good, because these women are not bitter and revengeful against some male world. And I love the way the Christian supernatural element came into the picture halfway between fantastique or horror stories, and any religious righteous blabla. Satan is a real being because he comes from the deepest layers of our evil side.

The unlikely pair of protaganists are much more than action heroes, though: they manage to be quirky, philosophical, and prone to late-night conversations that ring of true friendship. The secondary characters are well-drawn as well, particularly the elderly neighbor and a pair of policemen who provide something of a mirror-image to the main duo. The nature of the characters and their relationships yield blunt yet astute commentary on matters of race, sex, and justice.The only real weakness here is the central mystery, which is a bit telegraphed and overwrought. One gets the feeling that Lansdale might have done better with a straight storyline, which these characters could easily carry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Great book to start the series.

I have read many books and I must say that the Hap and Leonard stories are the best ever. Joe Lansdale doesn't mess around. If you aren't engrossed, laughing or wanting more after the first page then you should check your pulse. Joe Lansdale is a true storyteller with his own unique crop of adjectives and the most hilarious group of metaphors I've ever read. I can't tell you how many times I have suggested this book to someone. Even non-readers get hooked. Since that first introduction I read everything I can find. He has other stories that are equally entertaining.

The book is also loaded with plenty of non-Glock images. Mr. Sweeney, I bought this book because I like the Glock, not because I wanted to see plenty of photos of 1911's... ad nauseam. Perhaps Mr. Sweeney should stick to books writing books like his \\"Gun Digest Book of the 1911\\", as he has done Glock more than a bit of injustice.You know, I recently purchased Massad Ayoob's excellent book \\"The Gun Digest Book of Sig-Sauer\\".

It was light, entertaining and captured the true essence of Hans Christian Anderson's classic storybook version.Sid Caesar portrays the eccentric Emperor with sheer brilliance. The mumbling, bumbling Emperor's desire to wed off his daughter Gilda is only surpassed by his constant desire to look and feel... well.. like an Emperor!An added bonus to the original tale is the burgeoning love between Gilda and one of the tailors (i.e. not Gilda's intended spouse) who is making the Emperor's wonderous new clothes... or should we say NOT making the Emperor's new clothes.Of course, no one is as surprised about the ending as the Emperor but, in this movie, luckily you don't have to be a child to enjoy this tailor-made tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the others","review":"I have all the cannon movies that are available on DVD and I can honestly say that this one is my least favorite.

The love relationship between the thief and the princess was so lame and without chemistry. Cheesy sound effects like springs and slide whistles were used throughout the film which made it all appear so unprofessional.

It got so that it would no longer hold the lock.If you intend to mount the lock on your frame, don't buy this lock, period.

There's the slutty doctor who sleeps with the geeky doctor. Dave Foley plays a less witty, less likeable Dr. Cox. Dave Thomas and Dan Akroyd's characters are pretty much both different sides of Dr.Kelso. The only thing that's missing is a creepy janitor and some of the more absurd fantasy sequences from Scrubs. The humor never gets any more intelligent than jokes like, \\"How did a sperm cell get in your mouth?\\" and \\"Sexually active?

It's a fairly punked-up Cure before they latched on to the gloomy sounds they became famous for later in their careers. Even at this early stage of the band's life it is evident that Bob Smith has a natural talent for writing catchy pop songs, as is apparent in the title track Boys Don't Cry. Other highlights include 10:15 Saturday Night, Fire In Cairo, the controversial Killing an Arab, and still one of my all-time fave Cure tracks - Three Imaginary Boys, with its heavy atmosphere and alienated lyrics, a forewarning of the bands future musical direction.There are a few duds (So What, Grinding Halt) but overall the album is certainly worth owning for all Cure fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda like warsaw...","review":"This album reminds me of Warsaw, before they were Joy Division. Sometimes playful and sometimes experimental, but always emotional. If you give someone this album and 'Disintergration,' they would know they were The Cure by some key telltales (mostly Robert's voice), but the music is entirely different. Much the same as if you give someone 'Permanent' by Joy division, and then have them listen to some of the earlier stuff off the 'Substance' album. Think 'Passover' vs 'no love lost.' Its that sort of difference. I was initially a little dissapointed by this album. it wasn't as creepy and fluid as I would have liked, but its still very enjoyable.

How can these boys tackle a Jimi Hendrix track with limited guitar ability and make it sound far better than the original!

I couldn't stand them.All of the other songs with lead singer John Rzeznik are great, easy to listen to and typical Goo Goo Doll style. Its a shame Robby got 2 songs on here. I don't think he'd even make it on American Idol, he's that bad.There are ONLY 11 songs on this cd. With 2 of them sucking, thats not a good average. I hope he stays in the background for future releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and Better,Unbelievable","review":"Johnny Rzeznik again, can do no wrong. As an artist he is unsurpassed in his writing , blending and acoustic skills.After almost 15 years writing and recording and touring, nothing has wavered his intent and musical excellence on every album , including this one.Its been a wait , but it has been worth it, if your a Goo fan or not this is a must have. Very clean. Every song on this album is great, the best song in my opinion is \\"Become\\"\\"There's so much more about you that you never let them seeYou turn awayBut not to meAnd I know how they tried to take youHeld you up and meant to break you downBut you can't beFor so long I tried to reach youI know I'm almost thereI'm close enough for you to see\\"What a great lyricist, keep it coming Johnny!If you do not have Gutterflower buy them both today, you will not be dissappointed, if you have never seen the Goos in concert, make it this time, you will not be disapointed, see you at the shows, Woo hoo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Amazing. One of their best albums. I already own Let Love In but wanted the CD for my bedroom stereo and was curious to see what was on the DVD. I wasn't disappointed, the performance was intimate and perfection. If you're a die hard Goo Goo Dolls fan or just getting into them, I highly recommend adding this to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't tell if it's good or not it's so compressed & distorted!!!!!","review":"Is it me, or is album compressed way beyond being listenable? I know there has been a battle to make albums as loud as possible so they can compete on radio. Come on though, this is unlistenable,grainy and distorted beyond anything I've heard commercially. I love the Goo Goo Dolls, but the mastering on this album has ruined what is probably a great album. I can't even listen to it. It's not that I do sound for a living and have mastered many things myself. I think any fan can hear something is very wrong here.It's too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four years and this is the best they can do?","review":"Where to start? The length has been mentioned by other reviewers... only nine truly new songs.The album isn't awful or painful to listen to, but it's so boring. The majority of it sounds extremely similar, and almost none of the songs are memorable. \\"Better Days\\" is a fairly good song, as is the cover \\"Give A Little Bit\\", but the rest is just... dull. It all sounds like filler material, or B-sides. It's sad... I usually dread Robby's songs, but his \\"Listen\\" is one of the higher points on the album, mostly because it's a break from the repetitive sound of John's songs.Four years, and the Goo Goo Dolls couldn't put out something better than this? Superstar Car Wash, A Boy Named Goo, and Dizzy Up The Girl were all amazing albums, with catchy, memorable songs, and variety. Gutterflower, while not up to the level of the previous three, had several great songs and was still worth listening to. This album just isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome!!","review":"This album is amazing!! Johnny's songwriting just gets better and better. I have been a Goo fan for over 12 years now and this album really reflects how the band has matured and evolved. The lyrics are deep and meaningful and the music is phenominal. Yes, it is a little more toned down for them....but it's still awesome! A must-have for any fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let love in = let boredom in","review":"I cannot agree more with the few reviewers who gave this lame album one star. Unfortunately, I paid for this, and knew once I saw Glen Ballard had produced the album that it would probably suck. Sure enough, it does. More acoustic based, mid-tempo crap - in fact other than the opening track, the whole album is a snoozer!! I remember when these guys actually used to rock (see Hold Me Up, or Superstar Car Wash). At least Dizzy Up the Girl, and Gutterflower had at least a couple rockers. Let Love Rule has none. This is the last release I will ever buy of these guys. They should change their name to the Goo Goo Dulls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The GGDs - Good God its Dreary!!! I didnt like it...","review":"Well downunder here in Sydney Australia, the sounds from this proprock group sounds vastly similar to what we have appearing on Australian Idol (same as American Idol!) reality TV. If only these people were to wake up and realise that they are not doing their voices any justice by recording them! They would be better off keeping their lips sealed. The music is bland, the voices of the two fellows is a strain on the ears (I have since developed tinnitus in my left drum). Even Kylie Minogue produces a better album - and she cant even sing!! Dont buy it save your hard earned money or give it to a busker in the subway! The album cover is superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"Does anyone else find it amazing how this band has evolved? When they first started out (well over 10 years ago), they were a hardcore/metal band on \\"Metal Blade\\" records, releaseing albums alongside the likes of Cannibal Corpse, Armored Saint, and GWAR.Now, they are an Adult Contemporary Act produced by Glen Ballard!It's pretty fascinating.Their new style ain't my cup of tea, though. I Prefer heavier stuff, like bon jovi, def leppard, or slayer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definition of the word \\"Sellout\\"","review":"This album blows! This band blows now! How does a great band like this end up doing these types of albums? Last great album is Superstar Carwash. I would hate to love money as much as these guys obviously do! Can you believe they cover a supertramp song? They are not in a \\"tough position\\" as another reviewer states,they simply want to write songs for soccer moms now. They make a sh*tload of money doing what they do now,fine.It is called selling out nothing else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"goo goo Pleasant","review":"Music is good and follows too long after the last cd. Handling the sale and dealing with payments caused me and several others so much grief and hassel that you should pay more and buy this music at a real store with customer service and people you can talk to. this staff is non existant and totally unhelpful. Pay double and you will still get a better deal and support doing business in a friendly way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed feelings","review":"There are things I like and don't like about this cd. I feel like this is a very solid cd. They did a great job making this whole cd very radio friendly. Almost every song sounds like something that would be on the radio. But thats exactly what I didn't like about the cd. So if your one who only likes their songs that are popular, then THIS CD IS FOR YOU. But I am a musician, and it almost seems like they made this cd by throwing their popular songs into a blender and wrote new songs. Originality is lacking on this album, but overall its easy to listen to and well produced. I give this album a B."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I felt compelled to add my voice to disillusioned Goo Goo Dolls fans who have watched a gradual decline from the explosive, innovative rock we once enjoyed. No previous GGD CD has been so lacking in intensity. Languid, mournful numbers from the talented Rzeznik are barely passable, a shadow of the greatness evidenced on previous CDs. The chord progressions are anything but inventive. I actually found myself enjoying Robbie Takac's raspy \\"Listen\\"--if only because it sticks to what Goo Goo Dolls have always done best: Bright Rock.I hate myself for feeling this way. I really wanted to love this album, but the lack of depth and the triteness of the lyrics force me to cast a vote of disapproval. I'm willing to wait another 4 years, if somehow the next album can recapture the emotion and vibrance of Boy Named Goo and Dizzy Up the Girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor effort","review":"First let me say that I am a long-time Goo Goo Dolls fan, however, this is their weakest effort yet. Lyrically, it's not bad but I'm afraid the melodies all sound the same. Glen Ballard has not added any value that I can find to the production. Additionally, while Rzeznik is certainly not the strongest vocalist in the world I find his vocals on this CD to be positively lackluster. I really have to wonder if he still has passion for music anymore. I'll continue to listen to past releases and hope for a stronger release next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safe","review":"I'm not crazy about this album. All the songs sound the same. It's \\"safety rock\\". The band really isn't coming up with anything new or inspiring on this album. Gutterflower gave me hope, but this one sure doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I've loved GGD ever since I heard \\"Iris\\" in City of Angels. That and \\"Acoustic #3\\" are my favorite songs ever. This album has an amazing assortment of ballads and faster-paced songs. One of the best, but doesn't surpass Dizzy. \\"Without you\\" is absolutely great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great as Usual","review":"Johnny is a great singer. He has such emotion in his voice when he sings. My favorite on this is Let Love In. It has a great chorus that is a typical catchy Goo Goo Dolls song!"},{"rating":"1","title":"excruciatingly boring","review":"These guys could hardly write a bad song in their heyday of the late '90s. Apparently, those days are gone. A Boy Named Goo and Dizzy Up The Girl are essentials in anyone's music library. Gutterflower was rather unimpressive and disappointing (except for \\"Big Machine\\"), but I was hoping that it was just an isolated incident and that the next album would be better. It was not to be. Let Love In is even worse than Gutterflower. It's just sensationally dull. The John Rzeznik ballad formula (alternate tunings, lush open chords, and lyrics containing the words \\"truth\\" \\"fear\\" \\"lies\\" \\"anger\\" etc.) has run its course. I haven't been this disappointed since the first time I heard Van Halen III."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the Goo Goo Dolls?","review":"This cd sucks! I recommend you to not waste your money buying it. I've been a Goo Goo Dolls fan for years and years. I own every album...been lucky to meet them backstage...get my picture taken with them...the whole nine yards. This album truely disappoints me. Are the Goo Goo Dolls getting \\"tired\\" or are they just making music to suit the radio people? I hang my head in shame for this album...all the songs sound the same and do not impress me whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goo Goo Dolls RIP","review":"I bought this album knowing that it was going to be a cheesy, insipid adult contemporary slop album filled with forgettable ballads. The only reason I bought it is because I wanted to support John, Robby, and Mike. Alas, this is going to be my last Goo album since this once beloved band of mine has proven beyond a doubt that they have been mentally and creatively castrated due to their desire to peddle more money by appealing to the American Top 40 audience.It was great while it lasted but all good bands come to an end when seeing green becomes more important than pleasing their diehard fans and continuously pushing themselves creatively.I recommend buying some of the Goos older albums Hold Me Up, Superstar Carwash, A Boy Named Goo, and All I learned about Ego, Opinion, Art, and Commerce. Dizzy Up the Girl is a pretty good album but it was an insidious sign of the impeding artistic demise of the Buffalo rockers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never delivered","review":"I patiently awaited this CD for over 3 1/2 weeks. When I finally got a inqury from Amazon, I emailed the vendor immediately. He was supposed to refund my money and I still haven't seen it. Bad customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"sharp but fragile","review":"Blade is sharp but very fragile and brittle. Fell off counter two weeks in and tip broke off and blade bent. Never had that happen with any other knife. Expensive lesson learned"},{"rating":"1","title":"sharp but WEAK","review":"The 10 degree angle to the handle and the incredibly sharp blade make for great slicing. However, within a week of use, the blade got a chip in it and started to rust around the damage. We never dropped it but did put it in the sink with other dishes to hand wash. So be warned this knife is incredibly fragile. If you treat your knives like delicate artwork, this knife is for you. If you expect your knife to be a tool that holds up to mild use, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the definitive edition!","review":"I am a die-hard \\"Birdman\\" fan, and this is the best this album's ever sounded! Redeye Records did an awesome remastering job with this one. This one's out of print now, but if you see a copy of it buy it immediately. The 2002 Citadel Records copy sounds horrible in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great late-seventies action","review":"Satisfying album for a fan of the late-seventies punk sound. Lots of great guitar leads. The band sounds like surfers at times; at others like the Buzzcocks. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing \\"classic\\" punk album","review":"After years of hearing how great and aggressive this particular \\"classic\\" punk rock album was, I plunked down 20 bucks and bought the thing. All I can say is while the band's heart is in the right place (nice lads trying to approximate an Aussie Iggy and the Stooges/Doors hybrid), their music doesn't quite cut the mustard. The playing is speedy enough, but it lacks the pure, nasty crunch of classic Ig. In fact, it's a little too cleanly played (like college kids trying to ape Robert Johnson on expensive guitars). \\"Radios Appear\\" isn't bad, but there's not anything here that hasn't been done better elsewhere (i.e. Pink Fairies). For true Aussie raunch and roll, check out Rose Tattoo's \\"Assault and Battery\\" or the Saints' \\"(I'm) Stranded\\" and bypass this sincere, but toothless effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gory horror","review":"It's really my fault that I haven't done more research before deciding to read this book right after the Book of Lost Things. They are very different. The Book of Lost Things is a gentle, dark yet hopeful and touching retelling of old fairytales interposed onto a boy's life. Nocturnes is a series of gory, gutty, gritty horror tales. It may be your thing but it definitely isn't mine. I confess I didn't finish the book but the first three stories turned me off completely. The Cancer Cowboy Rides seemed an attempt at copying works by H.G. Wells and Stephen King. Cancer is a horrible thing and I don't need a story to horrify me about it even further without a positive redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"The adventure I go on when i sleep are amazing","review":"I bought this book before april of this year and started reading it after i found ,on accident,The book of lost things. I adore that book and i was very excited to read this one. I couldn't stop .I just had to see what the next story had in store for me. That was until the same night i read about the 5th story. I had a crazy dream and i was literally in the book in my dreams..with such a vivid imagination this book could keep you in dream land for months. I personnally prefer that. I cant wait to read more and more. This is the best author i have found in many many years. I cant believe someone could give below a 5. But hey everyone has diffrent tastes..but if you day dream on occasion then pick this book up and give it alittle flip threw you wont regret it i promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this and buy a Lovecraft short story collection","review":"I picked this one up on the $3.99 table at Borders. It's not the worst where writing is concerned, but the plots are predictable and overall about as chilling as DC in September. The author seems to rely on the ick-factor that comes with using children in these sorts of stories, instead of crafting anything truly macabre. If you're into this sort of fiction you would do well to pick up some H.P. Lovecraft, who was a master of this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"great set of short stories","review":"The stories were all fast paced and very eerie. I couldn't wait to pick it up at the end of each day. Reminded me of the Tales of the Crypt style of stories.

So I bought it for my Kindle and took a chance on the text-to-voice feature. Not bad.Incidently, the stories are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This volume was a disappointment. His novels are far better. The most successful pieces are pastiche of Stephen King and in these cases he manages to produce something which is pretty much as good as the original - given that King's output is uneven to say the least. However, his attempts to cover the great English ghost story writers like MR James are not up to scratch. He is far more comfortable with Americana than with the world of repressed Oxbridge dons being plagued by strange visions while on brass-rubbing holidays in East Anglia. I don't have the book handy, but in one of the stories a tomb is found with an early date on it - something like 976 AD. Anyone with even a basic knowledge of these matters would realise that AD time wasn't widely used until centuries later - I feel the ghost of MR James tutting loudly from beyond the grave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome mechanical pencil!","review":"I have always tried to buy the best of the best with pens and mechanical pencils for school use. Finally I have found a mechanical pencil worth every penny. I bought my first one from an art store, then I immediately bought a couple more of different lead thicknesses.

This album is essential rock & roll from power ballads such as \\"You don't love me, anymore,\\" to all out rockers such as \\"Sex Party.\\" It's all the strengths of a 70's Classic Rock band with a modern rock edge.

The PC game, Sierra's Casino Empire, which was released in 2000, uses an early version of the song, \\"Oh Yeah\\" as background music. I thought it was just a really cool song in a PC game (and, er, the demo, at that!) when I heard it again during the October 11, 2004 episode of the NBC TV show, LAS VEGAS. It made me more curious about the song, so I looked up the lyrics, and found that the song was actually by this truly cool band.

Their swing sound is fun, energetic, and toe tapping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two for Too Slow","review":"The musical ability is still here in this album, and there's really nothing wrong with any of the songs. It's just that they all seem much too slow. I actually like to dance to my swing music, and this CD just doesn't have enough energetic fast songs to be much fun dance-wise. I'm also not too keen on the strong Southern blues influence. This is all just personal preference. The music itself is quite skillful, but stick to their first album if you really want to be inspired to get onto the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Understand Previous Reviews","review":"I have three previous BBVD CD's - Loved them all. As a good Amazoner, I check out CD's that pop up on \\"Your Recommendations\\" and then look at the reviews that others have written. I eagerly popped for the CD based on all five stars from all of the previous reviews. I was VERY dissapointed.The things that I have enjoyed about BBVD are their witty lyrics and the up tempo beat. These are some of the worst lyrics I have ever heard from a CD. As an example, listen to \\"Feel my Leg\\". Very unimaginative.The melody is juvenile. Successive notes as though someone were playing scales.The brass instruments are crisp and wailing as background. As a former trumpet/trombone player, I appreciate a good brass section.My recommendation is on this one NOT to read the Amazon reviews - listen to the clips provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired Retread of Americana Deluxe","review":"I like many had high hopes for BBVD's third mass release, surely this one could not be as bad as their last release? Well...This album will be unable to save BBVD's souls. The lyrics are completely uninspired and the melodies are clearly retreaded from their first Coolsville release. It's sad - really!!The only way to save BBVD is for Scotty Morris to stop producing the albums. Let a professional produce the songs, Scotty should spend his time rethinking his lyric writing and coming up with some better bridges for his songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring New Orleans funk and shallow pop, with horns...","review":"This is very annynamous sounding music, which actually sounds more liek an ametuer marching high school band. The music is very repetitive, whcih is what funk music is all about. It is nowhere near as entertaining as thier last two releases which are very good. This is the last BBVD cd I'll ever buy, and it's a throwaway! Skip this one unless you actually liked Harry Connick Jr.,'s funk New Orleans cd's like She. Or if you like repetitive rhythms and high school marching bands, but if you are looking for hot New Orleans jazz or swing, look elsewhere or buy thier other cd's!

So many 80's (and other decade) movies get lumped together and are unfairly compared and panned. First, this has what a great, lasting comedy should have. It is FUNNY. Sure it's somewhat juvenile humor, but in a good way. This is hilarious comedy with real heart. The Vietnam back-story and the angst of the Jim character really seem real and not just an add on to the movie. The characters played by Penn (cool actor, laugh just thinking about him in the movie), Thompson, and Stolz really seemed like actual people, not just some unbelievable party animal/uptight geek cartoon characters. I find many so called \\"classic\\" and \\"iconic\\" movies lack any heart or real comedy. Kind of like how the Grammies and the Oscars give awards to shart movies that everyone forgets about after a year.

There are some very catchy tunes on here, and some excellent guitar work. I saw him tour to support this CD and most of the songs on XYZ translated quite well to a live setting. To compare this CD to The Police denies Andy an identity. The songs on XYZ could be Police tracks I suppose, but they're not. Part of The Police's power was the individual strengths each member brought to that group. This release showed the world, maybe for the first time, that Andy is a terrific song writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice album","review":"There isn't anything particularly phenomenal or adventurous about this album. However, it is quite good for pop music, and gives Summers a chance to show of his amazing fluency with \\"neutral\\" chords. Fans of the Police will recognize in this album a certain textural, minimalist philosophy that has been a hallmark of his since early on (no doubt greatly influenced by his work with Robert Fripp, e.g. \\"I Advance Masked\\"). While not the greatest singer, Summers' voice has an honest, real quality that is actually quite endearing.As to the reviewer who states that the album could have been better had it not been for Summmers lack of enrolling a plethora of other musicians to contribute their instrumental skills because of his ego, this reviewer has completely missed the mark. The reason for some of the electronic accompaniment and so forth is was purely economical.And Andy Summers is truly one of the most humble, self-effacing musicians I have ever had the pleasure to meet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Gloves.","review":"Absolutely do not buy these gloves.

It's one of the few books from my youth that I'll pick up and re-read every now and again. This book is the first one that introduced me to fantasy. But it's also mystery, supernatural, and historical as well as a great horse story. When I think of the top ten books that influenced me to become a writer, this is one of them that always comes to mind. I really think they should do a reprint. If you can find it, I highly recommend it for horse crazy girls aged 8-14, but it's still a nice story regardless of age."},{"rating":"2","title":"a treasure to read","review":"I found this book at a thrift store and I still consider it one of my most valuable \\"finds.\\" Three years later, it is still fresh in my mind. A story of time travel and how hard it is to start your life over in a new place. It tells of how hard it is to let go of something very dear to you, but how sometimes, you have to.

Thought it was a replaceable blade but couldnt figure out how to replace the blade. neither could anyone else in our camping party.so needless to say i am sending it back to Gerber but have already bought its replacement.

I was really impressed! I even managed to saw through a larger piece of dried oak - about 6 or 7 inches wide. I did manage to put a bit too much pressure on the blade on the push stroke, and it the tip bent slightly, but I bent it back, so this wasn't a problem. The saw's only supposed to cut on the pull stroke anyway. If the blade ever goes dull on me, for the price I'll definitely just buy another! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the first time I used it","review":"The I saw I got broke the first time I used it, very disappointing for sure.

I thought that it was more about maintenance issues, but instead it tries to cover the basics of \\"how a motorcycle works\\". I can think of MUCH better books on this topic, such as Kevin Cameron's \\"Sportbike Performance Handbook\\", which despite its title, really is more about motorcycle technology. Another great book on the topic would be Gaetano Cocco's \\"Motorcycle Design and Technology\\".The maintenance sections in this book suffer from being squeezed into the margins, with fairly small photographs, so that it is sometimes difficult to see what the author is really talking about. Of course, one cannot really fault this book alone, since most books on mechanics appear to suffer this fault.Bottom line: It's mostly about \\"how a bike works\\", and there are much better books out there on that subject. Too bad it doesn't cover maintenance in greater detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great & helpful","review":"I have done a significant amount of maintenance on my bike.

Instead, you'll find tiny guesthouses run by tiny women overflowing with personality and good advice -- who can paint your hands with hemp, teach you the fine points of Bollywood cinema or take you sari-shopping.I used Let's Go throughout Rajastan and Gujurat as well as in Bombay/Mumbai.

Especially strong is the evil Doctor at the hospital and his wonderful uncle in New York City. (Edmund White) These characters and moments really stand out.However most of this book just rambles about and then ends with no purpose whatsoever. At the end I wondered \\"why did he write it\\" and \\"why did I read it?\\". I would not recommend this book because it just meanders and ends with no explanation. I need more of a story arc even from a biography.The other thing that puzzled me was why he would paint such a wonderful loving tribute to his uncle and then ruin it by mentioning an offhand sexual advance by his uncle. It seemed out of place never explored his feelings behind it or why it was even mentioned. It was kind of unsavory without a reason for it.Keith needed a good editor on this book and some guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets to the heart","review":"I was going to buy this book as an anniversary present, but caught myself reading bits and pieces, until I had finished the whole thing.

I recommend it for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"What was the point of this book? Reading about Keith Flemming's life is like reading about your next door neighbor, Bob.

They have apparently abandoned their more melodic, interesting songs in favor of simple, boring dance-pop. To make matters worse, they aren't even really very good at dance-pop. Maybe the popularity of bands like Bloc Party has influenced them too much.The album could have been saved if it had been recorded better and performed with any amount of energy and enthusiasm. It sounds like it was recorded in a closet. This is probably one of the most disappointing releases that I've ever purchased, I'm sorry to say.Anyone looking for good Pretty Girls Make Graves records should purchase either \\"Good Health\\" or \\"The New Romance\\" because they are both great records.

Man, what a fricken waste of money...First off, they seem very fragile while you are running around with them. Secondly, it takes so much time to pull the pin and rip the top off that you can get blasted by your opponent a million times by the time you throw it. Finally, when I first threw this \\"grenade\\" at my friend Scott it actually bounced off the floor without going off. When I retrieved it, I figured the leaves on the floor might have lessened the blow, so in the next round I threw it hard at my friend Vinny, it hit a tree and only a little spurt of paint came out..Basically, from my experience this grenade as well as theTippmann Big Boy Paintball Grenade - Blueare completely useless and an utter waste of money.

I really don't know anyone who wears scarves, overalls, or blouses to school. The language and general writing style of the author also seems outdated. I actually checked the publishing date to see if this was a 90's book; it's a 2000 book. Ms. Youngs even uses the 80's spring/summer/autumn/winter system of choosing clothing and makeup colors. It's also annoying that the book encourages confidence in one's looks and \\"beauty diversity\\", yet has photos mostly of stereotypical blonde-haired-blue-eyed all-american-girls.

The poor selection of filming locations might be over-looked, but the incredibly banal music was just unforgivable! I talked to a couple of young kids after they'd watched this movie and they very adamantly insisted that it was a terrible movie. In general I'd say that this movie was on the verge of being amateurish (despite the presense of well-known actors) except that someone did a nice job building the gingerbread house. If it weren't for that element of the movie, I'd rate it at zero stars instead of one star! (NOTE: The child actors did a fine job performing their roles and it is not at all their fault that the movie is so lame!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"This is a GREAT movie.

This is a book to keep in your collection for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great read!","review":"Bloom is an absolutely enjoyable read. Linda Dominique Grosvenor is the kind of craftsman that weaves her story so well you forget the world she takes you to isn't the real one. I loved this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"This book was an enjoyable story. From the moment that Lily expressed her hestiation to Alex because of his age, I was yelling, \\"Go on, girl. Get yours!\\", but that's just me. Bloom takes you inside the mind of Lily as she struggles to control her feelings for a much younger man. You learn and experience her insecurities and view her concerns that stem from her surrounding environment.Linda Dominique Grovenor's writing style is engaging as usual, and she pulls you into the story with her words. The flow is smooth and the tone is mellow. It was great and refreshing to read a calm novel that offered an alternative to all the high drama novels that are available.I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend this one for those cold winter nights in front of the fireplace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best quality","review":"Very strong, yet soft and does not fall apart on the face after wiping off cleansers.

Read this book","review":"This is an important book for men who are interested in a commited realationship with a woman. The author sets up guidelines to use when trying to choose the right woman for you. With 50% of marriges ending in divorce, it seems that we need to take a little time and figure out if this is really \\"the one\\". This book is based on personal experience as well as sound scientific reasoning. My favorite chapter of the book deals with setting up a crisis situation with your prospective mate to break down the fascade of her personality and to see how she might handle the hard aspects of a marrige. This book contains practical information for men who want to find out what their getting into before they jump into a long term realationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buying my second one","review":"I bought one of these to play my iPod nano.

Hiromi does play with a fair degree of virtuosity, but the music as a whole seems tepid at best. The rhythm section is weak, seemingly lacking a sense of dynamics. The electronic parts seemed to have been tacked on as some afterthought, kitsch rather than interesting. Given the fact that electronic beats are so malleable, the electronic parts here seem particularly banal.It's difficult for me to understand how the editorial review puts this music in the same league as The Bad Plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my desk reference","review":"I own two large shelves of the top project management books and this is the one that I grab for first when I want to reference something.

The PMI PMBOK is a better reference for studying for the exam in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Control","review":"This mounting system skid adapter for my Warn ATV snow plow looked great and initially fit well - but the hole for the snow skid on one of the adapters was too small.

It should fit perfectly out of the box as this is a model specific skid adapter system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the Kindle edition!!","review":"As is becoming depressingly evident, Penguin publishers show utter contempt for the Kindle. This is the third defective Penguin e-book that I have purchased for the Kindle, and it is clear that nobody has bothered to proof-read or format these works properly. Font sizes change randomly; words, sometimes 5 at a time, run into each other; and notes are often intrusive in the poetic texts, altering the line lengths. This edition of the Prelude, however, is the worst: as it is a parallel text edition, one would expect to be able to distinguish between the two versions, but no, it is as if it is one massive poem, with nothing to orient you to the differences except when the occasional line number recurs. Hopefully Oxford Classics will bring out more Kindle editions, as they seem to care about their readership.Also avoid the Penguin versions of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, and Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov."},{"rating":"1","title":"KINDLE EDITION only","review":"Disclaimer: This review is specific to the Penguin digital edition for the Kindle, which offers a side-by-side comparison of the texts from two different editions of THE PRELUDE. Sounds like a lovely idea, but apparently digital reading technology isn't quite up to the task. The Kindle reading app, at least on my Asus Transformer tablet, doesn't know how to handle the dual texts, so turning pages becomes a big ordeal, whether you read vertically (1-page spread) or horizontally (2-page spread).

I also don't have room for a regular sized pack-n-play. I have 2 weeks until my due date, so I have not tested it with our baby girl yet, and that is the reason I did not give it 5 stars. I will say that it was fairly simple for me to assemble while being nine months pregnant. The wheels make it very easy to move from room to room and it fits perfectly through any doorway.

Sure, if you leave a pinch collar on a dog's neck all of the time, there will be reddened areas--but the same will happen if you leave any collar on for long periods. Pinch collars aren't intended to hurt (and if it hurts the dog, the trainer is using it incorrectly); rather, they exert even pressure around the dog's neck. Ordinary buckle ollars do more damage to a dog's trachea due to pulling than pinch collars do--and harnesses actually *encourage* pulling! (Why do you think they are used for sled dogs?!) I agree with the author's rejection of head harnesses, but only because they are *dangerous*, not because they leave dogs depressed. I'm sure the booklet is useful to some people, but I just couldn't get past those statements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A concise guide to getting your dog to walk politely on a leash with kind methods.

We had a great time playing this game. The girls wanted to play and play. Fun for parents too because it is a pretty quick game. Also the fruit is wooden, durable and so cute. Only complain is the baskets, they are very cheap and are already breaking, but I don't think this is a big deal because I am sure I can find some different small baskets to use. It is a little pricey but I think it will last a very long time, it is very well made besides the baskets. It has 10 pears, 10 apples, 10 cherrys and 10 plums.

If you are looking for a seminal reference text on African steam this is it. Naturally South Africa, Zimbabwe and the former EAR (Kenya, Uganda & Tanzanya) receive the majority of the coverage, but if you wish to find out about steam in Eritrea or Seirra Leone this is the ONLY book that can help you. The photgraphic content of the book is also superb. Few books from this era have such good colour reproduction. Some current books aren't as good as this one !

Unfortunately nothing else in the book even came close to competing with those first wonderful words.The main character was a whiney drama queen that gives a bad name to women throughout history, even keeping in mind this book was published in 1924, which is pretty bad. In fact she remains my last reason for never wanting to pick up another book written by a woman (I've just never had any luck with them!)Needless to say I only lasted 84 pages before I just got too plain annoyed to continue on.

It is nice to be able to actually SEE the routine, so I'm glad I got the DVD.

Michael Myers could have been done better but it's always been regarded as the worst in the franchise along side Resurrection.The killings are even stupider, stemming from how he killed Tina and the ones in the barn.

Most of the eating options that were featured were simply noodle fill-up joints. What happens when you had ramen yesterday? The fawning over their favorite ryokan in Tokyo (the ONLY unfriendly place in my trip) is unjustified. I found LP much more useful in getting around the cities I visited, although neither book offered much help in the How to Get Cash at Night in Japan category.

Uppity Women of Ancient Times defies all sterotypes, though. With over two hundred women in this book, she dosn't get much room to talk about the individuals, but her wording is brief, modern, and perfectly hilarious.

Never ever in my life had I left the book unfinished. But with this one, I simply couldn't afford to waste my time. I hoped to find a decent scholarly work on some of the most important women of old. But the criterion for the author seemed to be ANY mentioning of ANY woman in ancient documents. And needless to say, most of them are just a little bit more (or not even that) than your regular \\"street girl\\". I kept asking myself who did she write this book for? Who was her target audience? Her language is mediocre, vulgar and tedious. Did she want to be funny?! As someone has already said, it's a shame that she conducted such a serious research only to publish something that no historian will ever consider worth studying. Simply, it was an ordeal to read.

If anyone who wrote the other reviews actually read the writing of women in history. In particular, travel literature by Isabelle Eberhardt, Flora Tristan, Isabelle Bird, Francis Trollope etc. You and they might see that women in history wrote about themselves in an exuberant, lively, fun and impassioned manner.

Problems ensued when the studio bill could not be met and Syar were forced to use these sessions purely in demo form. These demos attracted the attention of CBS Records, but interest soon cooled. At this juncture, independant Future Earth Records offered the band a deal, which in turn led to a European deal with Mausoleum Records.

The built in gauge is very convenient as you can see how much pressure is in the tire while it's being inflated.The emergency light may come in handy if you're inflating the tire in the dark or if you're stranded.The only drawback may be the speed at which it fills up the tire.Even in my sedan it took about 300 seconds per tire to fill it from a pressure of less than 10 pounds to over 30 pounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"It sure works but a little slower","review":"This is a good accessory to keep the car tires properly inflated.

Imagine if you have to inflate 4 tires, it would take about 15 mins. But i think this is still worth it just for maintenance purposes. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to maintain tire inflation, especially if you have multiple cars.

Any biologist worth his/her salt can point out, with research that trumps all of Duke's eugenic nonsense, that breeding within one's \\"own race\\" dramatically heightens the risk of genetic disorders in the next generation. Ironically, a tragic example is provided by the Jews, whose population must now deal with the horrors of Tay-Sachs syndrome, truly a fate worse than death. Interestingly enough, Jews who breed with a non-Hebrew partner effectively remove the danger of Tay-Sachs, and a whole host of other disorders to boot. Similar situations hold true for every other ethnicity on the planet.

I would not have read it, but someone recommend I read it in keeping with my publications on eugenics. Duke advocates both eugenics and evolutionary science in his analysis of how race impacts every American. I was pleasantly surprised to so a person with even his reputation having such and firm grasp of science and history. This is probably the best book to give to someone who needs a one-stop education on all the racial and multiculturalism issues facing white Americans. A must read for any white person that cares about their people's survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Information about the Truth","review":"I read this book in high school before I joined the Army.

After reading this book, I'd not only vote for him for President, I'd help campaign and make a contribution. This is one of the most important books I have read in my adult life (I read about fifty each year and I am 54 years old). This is one conservative tome written for other than members of the choir, and what a tour de force it is! I have traced a number of the footnotes and he literally tells it like it is. As an attorney, I know how difficult it is to write simply, crisply and convincingly - I hope someday to be half the writer that Duke is. Buy this book now. Buy two copies...you'll be loaning it out a LOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational reading","review":"I found this book very inspiring. Duke has researched it very well andhe seems to have touched on a number of pertinent issues that mostpeople are not exposed to in the mass media. The fact that so much ofhis book is devoted to issues that are not in the media, bring homethe idea that the mass media is in fact manipulative and grosslymissrepresentative. Duke's book is very enlightening in thisrespect. The race issues in the book are sometimes rather extreme andI cannot agree on all of the points raised, although most of thefactual information is true.

It is the story of a liberal egalitarian whose mind was changed because of he stumbled upon some curious facts, such as the fact that Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson were in favor of shipping Black people back to Africa. Don't be blinded by magazine articles and Oprah. Read the book if you want objective facts. I give this only four stars because because sometimes he makes emotional conclusions and there's a lot of grammatical errors. But ignore these things and try a new perspective, even if only to learn the REAL reasons why so many people are concerned about the rights of White people.

Duke solidifying here opinions shared by tens of thousands of Americans afraid to engage them in discourse. I think that if Duke's most ardent critics sit down, keep an open mind, and read this they might find themselves concuring with it.

Not exactly my idea of revolution. I think of Duke as being sincere on one level, and a con man on another level. All in all a very conflicted individual.But anyway the book itself, some of the biographical stuff is very self aggrandizing, the historical stuff is good and Duke makes valid points, he beats you over the head with \\"statistics\\" a bit much for my tastes though. Hey I don't need to read the Bell Curve to figure out that most blacks are idiots.

The day care workers kept the children strictly controlled by terrorizing them with a fair amount of empty threats and plenty of corporal corporal punishment. It's hard to believe that this kind of emotional and physical abuse is happening in 2011 in day care centers here in the U.S.A. I reported the incidents to all the Powers-That-Be, but nothing has changed. This school and day care continues to keep their students controlled using these heavy-handed, emotionally abuse methods.

I feel like I know Christine and Paul and I would like them as friends. He also changed my perception of South America. He made an adventure there seem real and not as scary as I thought it would be. He made me want to sign up for the same trip Christine and Jessica took. The events that brought Christine and Paul to Peru felt so real, I experienced it right along with them.

The first song I ever sang in church was a hymn that the pastors wife requested and I loved singing it. There is nothing like an old hymn to touch the deepest parts of my spirit. I have really enjoyed this cd and recommend it to every person that likes gospel music. Something that I have always said is \\" You cant know where you are going unless you know where you have come from\\" I think even those that may not particularly enjoy the hymns should churchase this cd because they are foundational to the church and have brought us through many hard trials and kept us untill we got the victory.

If you're a Rafferty fan, then this should be the last album to buy in your research or listening enjoyment on the musician. Track after track is rife with over production traits like heavy drum machines, and keyboard/synthesizer riffs. The only standout was the hard rocker \\"Does He Know What He's Taken On\\" A solid song is \\"The Light of Love\\" but that's only because it's a soft tune sans the hard over-bearing drum machine. Throughout the album are the typical pessimistic views of the rock industry as a whole. This is especially clear on the opening track \\"Time's Caught Up On You\\". The low price on the album is the best thing about the work, so if you do choose to get this one, just chalk the seven dollar loss up to a venture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing swan song","review":"I have listened to this album a half dozen times and there is just nothing here that matches anything on \\"Sleepwalking\\" or \\"North and South\\".

The one exception is \\"Don't Speak of My Heart\\". But again, this barely makes an impression. Too bad. Now that's he's gone, we'll never have a chance to hear anything new from a great songwriter and singer. So, instead of buying this grade \\"C\\" album, put on \\"City to City\\" or \\"Sleepwalking\\" or \\"North and South\\" (my personal favorite as a solid album of Rafferty songs) and hear the man at his best.

The controls aren't as smooth and when you get back to town you have to wonder all over to accomplish basically getting new quests and selling loot. I didn't find anything particularly worth while about the game, the pet is a twist but big whoop. Just another dungeon game.The graphics are fine. The game seemed to run fine. I suppose if you liked Diablo but didn't care for the dark aspect of it, you may like Fate better. Seems more cheerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"My son got this game as a demo on the computer he got for CHRISTmas. He liked it so much he had to buy the program right away. Great role playing, multi level, great characters. We could not find it at the local stores (Wal Mart, Circuit City etc) so we ordered it online. It was cheaper than unlocking it but certainly not faster. We had to wait almost a week. If I had it to do over again I would have just unlocked the program and bought the back up disk for a couple more dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get yourself a soda...it's gonna be a long night!","review":"This game has it all: hundreds of weapons, armor, monsters, a pet who can change into some of the monsters, quests, great 3d graphics, and very easy to get into gameplay.

Not difficult to master, mostly about building your character, no story line to speak of, but still strangely fun. It will never be up there with Diablo II or Warcraft, but sometimes you just want to play a game that doesn't matter so much, you know?

I don't consider myself a serous gamer but do play some (this' Dawn of War, WOW, and Guildwars). I play this game a few times a month and find it a great time killer. I have a few characters and find this mixes things up a bit. For the price you can't beat Fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say repetetive?","review":"Alright, the game started out really fun and interesting, but after realizing that the levels to the dungeons were so numerous, I got peeved with it. I ended up keeping up with the game long enough to beat it, which wasn't that difficult and anti-climatic. The whole pet sidekick was cool at first, but the fact that you can transform your pet into the strongest form the game has to offer within the first 15 minutes was a letdown as well, regardless of leveling. I simply couldn't believe that a game as fun as this would turn out to be so repetitive. That's why I gave it 2 stars.If you like the idea of unending dungeons without any new kind of material throughout the game, go ahead and buy it and enjoy it while your patience lasts, but don't buy a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO Cool","review":"My son is having so much fun with this game... and better... it is not violent!!

The tests are newer; moreover, it seems to me that the \\"games and \\"logic\\" sections of the current LSAT, though ostensibly the same as when first introduced in 1994, have been made slightly easier. If you just read the first book, you may be needlessly scared and discouraged. With this book and to a lesser extent the second book, you will at least not have unjustified anxiety.

The only song that has a chance on this \\"tribute\\" album is \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" It has nothing to do with the absence of Dennis DeYoung, I certainly don't miss the power ballads, but I think it's time to put this band out of it's misery, the only thing keeping this band afloat is the fact that they are still one of the greatest live bands ever, but obviously they are having trouble writing new material, maybe it's time to call it quits while they still have a little dignity left, if any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven effort from a great band","review":"This album has its moments. Summer in the City, Locomotive Breath, and Manic Depression are particularly good, but they aren't any better than the originals, in my opinion. Styx does a great job with great songs.However, some of the songs on this album weren't good to begin with, and are even worse when performed by such a good band. \\"It Don't Make Sense\\" and \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" are particularly heinous, but they aren't alone.As a result, I can't listen to the whole album from beginning to end. It is alternately too painful and too boring. I have instead ripped the 5 good tracks on my computer, and simply don't listen to the bad stuff.

Either Tommy and JY stop throwing a temper tantrum and acting like babies and rejoin with Dennis and be Styx as it should be or Tommy And JY should retire and quit the music business and stop ripping the fans off.

The man whose melodies and pure vocals mixed with the hard riffs to produce something magical and different? Yes, he was. And wasn't Come Sail Away THE kick-ass stadium/rock/melody track of all time? Yes, it was.And 30 years on neither he nor the tattered remnants of his band have produced anything remotely near as spine-tinglingly thrilling. Instead, he's sulking in his mansion in LA somewhere, while JY and Tommy and a bunch of sub-standard hangers-on stagger on into their twilight years, grinding out the riffs at ever-smaller venues, getting more mundane and mediocre with every passing album.And here's their latest effort - an album of covers even more embarrassing than de Young's haircut and trousers on the Rock The Paradise tour.A more apt title for this hopeless lash-up would be The Last Thrashings Of A Beached Whale.

They still have the singing ability, I will have to admit, with the exception of JY. He never had much of a voice to begin with and it is now completely gone.

I Would!","review":"Being a lifelong Styx fan I was eagerly awaiting this CD. After the first listen I can honestly say it's one of the WORST albums I have EVER heard! What were these guys thinking? I'm fine with bands doing cover albums, but for God's sake pick some songs that are a good fit for your style! \\"I am The Walrus\\", etc.? UGH! Only the updated version of \\"Blue Collar Man\\" is even listenable.I understand that there's a rift between Dennis DeYoung and the remainder of the group, which is truly a shame. Maybe Dennis could have talked a very talented Tommy Shaw from being involved in such a wasted effort.Tommy, PLEASE make ammends with Dennis and write some new material that gives the true fans at least one more sampling of the TRUE Styx!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of bands this year have been covering songs from the 70s, but...","review":"A lot of bands this year have been covering songs from the 70s or making albums that sound like they were made in that era, but Styx takes some of the most mundane and boring songs of the seventies and injects tremendous energy and appeal into them. Never did songs like \\"Summer in the City\\", I Can See For Miles\\". and \\"I Am the Walrus\\" sound so good. Styx also show their flair for heavy metal by covering two songs that were covered by W.A.S.P., \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\" and \\"Locomotive Breath\\". Of course the Styx versions win hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"a FUN CD","review":"If you're favorite Styx song of all time is \\"Babe\\", don't buy this CDThis is rock! So what if it's all cover songs? they rock!I agree there are 1 or 2 that aren't to my taste, but the musicianship is killer! And the sound is right on target.The original recordings of these songs sound muddy, because of the poor recording techniques back in the 60's and 70's. It's awesome to hear \\"I can see for miles\\" with crystal clear pounding drums.I didn't buy this CD expecting \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", I bought it to hear a revamping of some great classic tunes.I too can't wait for Styx's next CD of originals, but this disc stands on it's own as quality stuff.I saw them do I Am The Walrus in concert and it brought the house down. Listen to this version of Manic Depression , then listen to Hendrix's. The sound quality difference is staggering, and Styx has done these songs justice"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Styx album in years","review":"An all cover album. It's been done many times before. Naysayers will have you believe that the newest offering from Styx is relatively poor...which simply isn't true. Think about it; Styx has all the tools to make a fantastic cover album - vocals that range from brash to beautiful falsettos, superb lead guitar, theatrical leanings that can accommodate any setting, and above all - experience. Styx shines like they haven't in the past 8 years with the release of \\"Big Bang Theory\\". Standouts include the Beatles' \\"I Am the Walrus\\", The Who's \\"I Can See for Miles\\", Blind Faith's gorgeous \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\", the hard rocking of Powerglide's \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\", Lovin' Spoonful's \\"Summer in the City\\" and my personal favorite, Jimi Hendrix's \\"Manic Depression\\". Overall, Styx fans should find this to be a fun a playful ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably bad","review":"I am extremely thankful that this album is in my music collection. After all, if you can't have one of the worst albums ever made, then what is life. Fortunately, I only had to pay a dollar for this (I think I overpaid). This CD had me laughing hysterically with every new track. It reminds me of some high school cover bands: they get the words right, the notes are close, but their is no fire or passion. Actually, I take that back, I remember high school cover bands play some of these songs better than Styx. Overall, this may rival Self Portrait as the worst covers album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Styx - 'Big Bang Theory' (New Door Records)","review":"Review no.98.Wanted to be sure to mention that this fourteen track disc worth of Styx playing covers of bands that majorly influenced them is better than what I had expected.Most of the cuts here are really good,maybe a few are below average.Tunes I was more than casually impressed with were the Beatle's \\"I Am The Walrus\\",Blind Faith's gem \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\"(must be a difficult song to cover properly),Lovin' Spoonful's \\"Summer In The City\\",Hendrix's \\"Manic Depression\\",Jethro Tull's \\"Locomotive Breath\\" and Free's \\"Wishing Well\\".If you're a Styx fan,with somewhat of an open mind about their music in general,you should get as much out of this CD as I did.A should-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"cookie cutter","review":"They seem to have a good grasp on the different styles.

It's not that they suck without Dennis DeYoung-- It's how MUCH they suck without Dennis DeYoung. OMYGAWD! At least Rush is STILL RUSH!~~~ How about this idea: I know someone who saw Triumph in concert back in the day, and I DO PLAY GUITAR, so I think I'll just hit road and call my band Triumph, play some Triumph songs and record new material with the name too! ~~~I'm gonna spend some $$ for the Wooden Nickel collection instead. I'm from Illinois, and remember STYX before most of the so called fans of today actually heard of them. I remember when it was a good feeling.. a Rock and Roll Feeling!!!

Their \\"new\\" version of Blue Collar Man is just about the worst thing I have ever heard!

In the concerts I've seen, they played mostly the old stuff, and I like the old stuff. However, I did wonder why they didn't have any good new stuff.About a month ago, my wife and I saw Dennis DeYoung in concert, and my wondering was answered. Styx doesn't have any good new stuff because their heart and soul is gone (Dennis). There's no one left in Styx with any original music talent.This album clearly illustrates the lack of originality. I couldn't imagine that Dennis would have ever put his name to something this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Styx Reeeeeeeally Stynx.","review":"God, who needs another cover album, especially by these cruise ship/state fair retards. Oh, the world's just been clamoring for their \\"great\\" cover of \\"I Don't Need No Doctor.\\" That's a matter of opinion, by the way. Two minutes into that screamfest, and I was in desperate search of the Tylenol. It's seriously time for these guys to consider retirement before they end up playing worse gigs like biker bars. Oh, I love these high star reviews: \\"Great for what it is.\\" No, it's not great for what it is. It's another sucky cover album by an old band who've run out of sales potential with their own horrible material, and so they have resorted to even covering one of their worst and most overplayed hits, \\"Blue Collar Man.\\" My dog wears a blue collar, and he howls out our car window with a better range than Tommy Shaw. If you like this, people, all I can say is OWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's just call it a day and pull the plug...","review":"There's no need to keep this band on life support.They've become a novelty act. A self parody.The only thing worse, would be either another Mr. Roboto album or a Dennis \\"Liberace/Barry Manilow\\" DeYoung album full of schmaltzy showtunes. Even those albums would have some redeemable value just out of campiness and cheap laughs.This album just shows an aging (albeit, not gracefully) band grasping at straws.Face it: Stynx's \\"appeal\\" is waning faster than J.Y.'s receding hairline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch...that's painful","review":"I think rather than get into the pre Dennis vs Post Dennis discussions I'll just share my thoughts on this CD on it's own merits (or lack thereof)I really tried to approach this with an open mind.. putting aside that this is a Styx release.That being said, It's just awful.. not because it's covers, but it isnt even good covers.It's pretty obvious, at least to me that they just mailed this in. Too bad, there is a lot of musical/songwriting talent in the group and they, and us, deserve much better than this.If you're looking for highlights, Blue Collar Man at 2120 is a nice acoustic version of the original. If you use any legal downloading service, that track is well worth the 99 cents.My advice, dont bother. You'll find yourself longing for the original versions of these songs...or longing for the days of Such great songs as Angry Young Man/Suite Madame Blue..Oops, I said I would do that.. sorry. Im old. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Styx I Know","review":"Who is this group and why have they hijacked the Styx name? This is such a sad comedown for a once great progressive rock band.This collection of songs, while having a few decent renditions, \\"I Can See for Miles\\" and \\"Can't Find My Way Back Home\\", is mostly simply adequate and not very good.I was a huge fan of Styx, but this group of performers, bearing little resemblance to the original group, has done the name of Styx very wrong.My recommendation: Don't buy this. Buy the Wooden Nickel collection.
