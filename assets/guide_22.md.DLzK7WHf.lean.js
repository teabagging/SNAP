Although digital, the sound quality is almost as good as a tape, though it does sound a bit tinny at times.The 2 digital answering machines I've had before this (one Bell South, the other GE) both gave me the problem of hanging up on people in the middle of their messages. It seemed like half my messages were people saying, \\"Hi Ben, I'm calling back because your machine cut me off...\\". I've never had that problem with this AT&T, it's very reliable.It also does a good job of cutting out messages that are nothing but dialtones (although one does slip in there every now and then) while also giving you time to screen the call. It's a nice gadget, very compact, and well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best macine yet","review":"This is the best answering machine I have ever owned so far. Digital is the way to go.

Maybe it thrilled me so much because my dream is to become a beauty editor just like Billie, the main character. This book was great because it showed the side of many black people that we don't get to understand, the sista or brother living a \\"white\\" life. Billie does struggle being in a world where lots of sistas don't like the fact that she writes about hair, makeup and skincare, because many sistas are into being natural all the time. She takes us on an inside look of the beauty scene, with its promotional parties and luncheons, and the glamour of dressing city chic all the time. Let's not forget that the love story is so down to earth, it feels comforting to read. I recommend this book to sistas and brothas alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"At first, I wasn't sure how I was going to like this book.

Not only did I enjoy Tia Williams' writing style, but I totally fell in love w/ Billie and Jay's relationship. It was pretty cute how sprung they both were. I've been there, so it was nice to be able to read those emotions. I'm totally looking forward to Ms. Williams' next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"fun\\" read, believe it or not","review":"As improbable as it might be, this book makes what many people consider the dullest period of American history come alive.

I needed a block so, I purchased J.A. Henckels' 8-slot Block. I was excited to get it, though it was smaller than I would have thought, but had a nice shape and design. I put my knives in and my worst fear was relized. The knives in the first two bottom slots stuck through about a 1/4 inch or less. Enough so that if the little rubber glued on coasters (for lack of a better word) fell off the tips would it the counter top.Also, one slot was closed and could not fit a knife into to it. Very disappointed. I may have recieved a lemon, but will return it and try the 8-slot Steak Knife Blockby Wusthof.If your knives will fit and you want to take a chance on a product made in China it is a nice design and shape and the foot print was also nice it would have fit nicly beside my knife block.Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife Set","review":"This set is a great knife set.

Aside from having, in my opinion, the requisite 8 slots (who has place settings for 6???), the block has a nice angled design, is solid, and has a small footprint on my crowded counter space. The only thing that I think that can be improved is to widen the base so that there is less chance of tipping (left or right), but that would come at the expense of the smaller footprint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid value","review":"If you bought your steak knives loose, the way I did, then this block comes in very handy.

It's hard to believe. This book is a complete waste of time. Most of the sources are old and useless. There's no new technology sourced. Nothing on newer stuff like frequency hopping/spread spectrum or SAW oscillators. Nothing even remotely interesting. It reads like a catalog and is one to some extent because some of the devices are sold by (Lapins?) company.Save your money. Get a copy of How to Get Anything on Anybody (book II) or Now Hear This by Winston Arrington, or (maybe) the Basement Buggers Bible. There isn't any new info on this topic.

The book is strictly cut & paste with a few \\"pithy remarks\\" thrown in for good measure. The layout is junior-high level, the pictures are like a photograph that is on its seventh generation through the copy machine. (in most you can't even tell what you're looking at.), and the index lists only the companies without any reference to the subject or object that you are looking for, which renders it totally useless. This book is solely an exercise in greed. Lapin is capitalizing off his past works by putting out a book that must have taken all of a weekend to throw together.

I thought I would have to scrub more of them on my hands and knees, but the Atlantis did most of the work for me.

Glad I bought it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute junk!","review":"After only a month after purchasing this, the spray pump stopped working. I exchanged it where I bought it. Not even a year later, it completely stopped working out of the clear blue - no indication whatsoever besides the horrible leaking. The gaskets fell off. The foot pedal broke internally. It is assembled poorly. It is a pain to maintain - clogs easily. Keep in mind I baby'd it the whole time. My only positive comment about this unit is that it folds up very conveniently.

The soap that went with it left a horrible residue on the carpets that attracted dirt only a day or so after. The tanks LEAK!! EVERYWHERE!! They leave huge puddles on the floor.

Each composition gets its own track, they're all explained in the booklet, and the whole recital plays out like one long performance yet with the sections clearly separated. If you're not a pakhawaj player, this is exactly what you need in a solo album. And this is the only album on the market where you get it.Why tabla solo is more popular is beyond me.

We love to play with them and she can easily practice all her single digit addition and subtraction problems.The great thing about these dominoes is that my 3 year old can also play because they are color-coded. How cool is that? He is learning his colors and she is learning her math. A double duty teaching toy.Also, they are a lot of fun just to handle and look at because of the fun colors and the sturdiness of their design.

This book is fun for my students because they like saying hello in different languages to me when they enter into my classroom.

I used it for recording live music, interviews, MP3, old vinyl records. But, unfortunately in two years mine has broken twice. It no longer records, and it is getting kind of touchy about ejecting the discs. More work on the design of this thing needs to be done. It's not a durable piece of equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, but...","review":"I've had my MD player for about 2 and a half years. It has been mostly reliable throughout these years. The remote clip broke off about 6 months ago, which is no big deal, and the jog dial has been working on and off for the past year. Two unnecessary but very helpful functions. Recently, I went to switch discs, and it would not come out. The front part seems to be caved in. I am going to try to fix it, but I'm not sure if I can. I've used it quite a bit, and I have been extremely happy with it. However, it is quite large and is kind of annoying to record from the internet and anywhere else. I suggest this product if you do not mind the heavier and bigger player, but other wise it's great. I would maybe suggest a newer MDLP recorder that can record much more onto a disc. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use","review":"This minidisc player is very simple with a lot of easy to use functions. The two best things about it are the price and the jog dial.

The dial is easily moved accidently, inorder to record a song, you have to play the entire song. UNliKE ! the sony mini disc, it is big and cant compress files. THe sony can compress files and make the mini disc hold up to 80 songs!!! while the sharp holds 15. Im not saying this isnt a good mini disc, im saying that for the price, look around to see what else you can get that is smaller,lighter, and more functtions.

But I decided to take a trip to Circuit City and actually listen for myself. Now I really wanted to buy the Aiwa, it is so much prettier design-wise than its competition. But after listening, I have to say the Sharp sounds so much better than the Sony and the Aiwa! I was amazed at the obvious difference. I am not thrilled with the interface on the Sharps, or their thickness or headphones, but all the plusses of this unit definitely outweigh the negatives. And as far as sound quality (loudness, clarity, bass), the others don't compare. I just wish they would improve the physical design and include better quality headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I have had my 722 for about 6 months when I got the UTOC error. This error is ussually fatal. It means that the lens will not read the disc. I went to get it repaired and i cauld not find a place that would fix it. It turns out that Sharp made a bad batch of minidisc players and will not admit it. Beyond that it is way to heavy and way to big. Also about a month after I had it the jog dile broke. I ended buying the sony r90 and it is great. So do not buy the 722.p.s. sarry about the mispelled words.

When I tried it in a different MD player, it worked fine, but the 722 just showed a TOC error.I have no idea how good the product is in general, but it gets only one star for how it worked for me.

They are expensive, can held just a couple of songs compared to MD, and you need a computer to change the music you have on it. What can you do if you go travelling for a week. Listen to the same two hours of music?The Sharp 722 is great. I started to look for an MP3 player but thank god found the MDs on the way. They are cheaper, you can carry all the music you want, and blanks are very cheap. I got the memorex 20 pack for 30 dollars, that will be more than 20 hours of music. How much would it cost to get 20 hours of MP3 music.Go for the MD with your eyes closed, you would never regret. And if you decide to go for the MD, go for this Sharp, it is really cool, very, very portable and the most affordable, just a few good reasons to buy this one instead of a Sony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Product!","review":"I Just got this it's great!It's so easy to record off cd's and off the internet.It's a pretty convineint size.it's a really good minidisc player for the price.You don't have to be a electronic wizard to figure this one out.It's probrably the best Minidisc player on the market.Don't even look at it.Just buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop dead awesome","review":"I got this Sharp 722 about 3 months ago.....

I've had it for almost a year now and it's worked great. I don't care for the remote much I think that's a silly idea and not very useful. It's also very tough, i've dropped hard enough to get dents and it still works. It had a glitch reading an MD one time, but i haven't been able to get it to repeat. I've gotten in a wreck with this thing and it didn't even skip. The sound reproduction is.. well, what you'd expect from any minidisc player, awesome. The batteries last a long time, i've take it on long trips and never had them run out on me. I've gone weeks without recharging it. The jog dial is sooo useful.The thing i like best about it though is the expressions on peopels' faces when they see it. It's a very novel design, very different and interesting. I've been very happy with mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"MD-MS722","review":"This is a really good minidisc recorder/player. It is very easy to use and has awesome Bass. It is expensive compared to portable CD players but it is a million times better. It is smaller, lighter and much easier to carry all of your favorite songs. With a portable CD player you need to carry the player and your collection of CDs. With the MD-MS722 you just carry the small player and two or three minidiscs. I only give this MiniDisc player 4 stars because it comes with cables that you cannot hook up to many music sources. I had to buy an additional cable.

His plight seems to me to represent the plight of many middle income Australian men. After reading the book I found that I viewed my country's prevailing 'myths'- that we're the 'Lucky Country' and are 'MultiCultural and Egalitarian' - from a very different perspective. I was especially interested in the way everyday life is compromised by the way that we're encouraged to submit to and live within a globalised corporate view of life. These days this worldview is sold to us with a thin veneer of Australiana. Scratching the veneer - as this book does - leaves a lasting impression on the reader's psyche. A disturbing but ultimately liberating book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"QUITE AN AFFORDABLE ASSET!","review":"Of course, no single book can claim to have completely dealt with all the common mistakes English learners and speakers make, but this one did a good job in that light. It is effective in tackling grammatical errors: whether subject-verb agreement or complex tense use. It also prescribes when to use active or passive report.Students can use this book as a self-study companion. It provided rich and varied approach to grammatical applications. Generous focus was given to all the parts-of-speech, as well as to a variety of phrasal verbs.In a nutshell, this is a useful book for both learners and advanced native speakers. Its low price and emphases on contemporary vocabulary would be welcomed by all.

Mr. Quirk has a charmingly personable way of speaking about his and his wife's experience throughout the adoption process.

The original 1976 theme is rescored for the SECOND half of the end credits -- which brings chills to my spine.Its TOO bad that by the time the Jerry Goldsmith theme is heard, most people not expecting it have all ready walked out of the theater.

My first choice was to look at the ipods and see what they had to offer. I liked the ipod shuffle because of its size, but it was lacking. What is great about the Sansa m240 is that it has the same memory, BUT it has a display, FM tuner, and a voice recorder. These were not the main features that caught my attention though. The nice thing about the Sansa m240 is that it takes a AAA battery that lasts about 17-18 hours, and doesn't need the fruity itunes format. I have a ton of MP3's on my PC and I don't want to spend my time converting them in any way. All one needs to do is plug in the usb port and drag the tracks you want. Simple as that. It's a small player and is lightweight. I'm glad they were sold out of the 1gb ipod shuffles because I'm not a big fan of Apple products. Apple is like the metric system in the computer world, it's simple to convert but everyone else is standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"SeraJinn","review":"I have had 3 Sandisk mp3 players, 2 of them were this model.

The immersive sense of the fantasy VR plays well in opposition to the real world and the threats that cross over.Anyone who enjoys fantasy escapes, whether in the Society for Creative Anachronism, wherein the author is a prominent figure, or in MMORPG games such as Everquest or Dark Age of Camelot, will experience a thrill of recognition reading this book. As a historian, I appreciated that the way Heydt worked in tidbits of medieval (and SCA) customs into her virtual world. Sure, the mystery wears a little thin two-thirds of the way through the book (and the heroine's newfound partnership accelerates unconvincingly) but the magic of the worlds-crossings worked their wonders right through the conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting view of future, combination of SCA and MUD's","review":"This was an enjoyable read.

Terms I hadn't heard since I was 16 playing Dungeons and Dragons; hit points, lawful good, etc. I was expecting a mystery/adventure plot, but got a fantasy adventure. Because the main action takes place in virtual reality, I failed to see the urgency of the characters situation. Couldn't they make their world whatever they wanted? Unlike other VR novels where people could die if you died in VR. Not the case here. The main characters spend there time killing virtual dragons, trolls, loch ness monsters, evil elves and harpies.

Without much invested in research and development, Sharp can afford to sell their recorders so cheap.

If you record a CD straight through, without interruption, it works great. Try to mix your own, and it just chokes. The result? I returned to the store again, and to avoid losing a customer, they agreed to replace my defunct Sharp players for a comparable Sony, even if a comparable Sony is more than $50 more! My recommendation, stick with the original until the rest catch up, even if you have to pay more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"A little over a year after purchasing this unit, it simply stopped playing, giving only a \\"TOC errorA\\" message.

Went to Best Buy and bought a Maxell MD cleaner (after taking the silly thing apart, etc. trying to \\"fix\\" it). Ran the cleaner three times, and everything was fine. I can still record, but I have to clean it more often now (every couple of months), or I get the errors (or skipping disks) again. I run my 702 between 8 and 48 hours per week.All I can say is: if you have a cleaner for your CD player, and your DVD player, and your VCR, and a cleaner for your cassette player, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE ONE FOR YOUR MD?

I just upgraded to the sharp MT877 which has much better D/A and A/D(digital to analogue, analogue to digital)converters.

I decided to go with the MD format for its non-linear recording (random access like CD's, unlike DAT & cassettes-\\"linear recording\\"), titling the disc and track w/ names, very compact size, which also helps in preventing skips, and it's relatively long battery life. After careful consideration, I found that MP3's were too expensive per minute of music. While the price of RAM flash cards are dropping they're no where close to the price of blank MDs. 1 MD-74min($4) + MD player($200)=$220 for 300min or near CD quality, however MP3 player ($140) + 32MB RAM ($80)=$220 for 100min of better than FM stereo quality.

Another thing, I had this unit for over a year in the car now, and it works perfectly. Meanwhile my friend had a Sony MD-player in his car, and broke within a year. I can tell you that this little thing might not look as fancy as it is, and maybe a bit too thick, but it's great in and out(except writing names).

Thompson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great feeder, but one big design flaw...","review":"For the first month or so, I really liked this feeder. It holds a lot of seed and the birds accepted it immediately.The problem lies in the refilling mechanism. There is a plastic-covered braided steel wire that runs through the center of the feeder. The 'top plate' slides up and down on this wire, and is secured in the 'down' position by a spring-loaded clamp that pinches the wire to hold the top plate in place. To refill the feeder, you squeeze this clamp to release it, and slide the top plate up so you can pour seed into the feeder.Within a month of use, this spring-loaded clamp had cut through the plastic sheath around the steel wire, and the plastic shreds are apparently jammed in the clamp. I can no longer slide the top plate up on the wire, so I can no longer open the feeder to refill it. Either the steel wire should not be covered in plastic, or the clamping mechanism should be 'gentler' so it does not cut through the plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeds don't dispense","review":"Even with the smallest seeds (millet), the seeds don't dispense into the tray and I have to jiggle the feeder throughout the day to get the seeds out.

Well made, easy clean, easy fill, feeds lots of birds (doesn't have thistle seed or mix option). Going on third year with this feeder and I don't have any complaints.

Also, during several heavier (but not downpour-type) rains, the seeds became wet and started to clump together, becoming spoiled and unable to decend into the feeder. So the seeds were kind of a tease to the birds. After about 18 months, squirrels (who would regularly jump on to raid the feeder) managed to knock it off of the shepherd's crook that was staked into the ground. That's not easy to do, but squirrels have super powers when it comes to bird feeders. The feeder cracked and broke. While it's still usable, given the other problems, I'm going for another Squirrel proof feeder that I've found to be much better and longer lasting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I'd say that of the over 300 pages of words filling Mitchell's book, there are maybe 10 or 15 pages that are worth reading. The rest is soporific material to be injested as a sleeping aid right before bedtime.Mitchell managed to make an intrinsically exciting story dull in the mere act of reporting on it. Still, I give her credit for making a go of it. Better to try and fail than not try at all. The people I disrespect the most are those who provided the blurbs to the powers-that-be at Hyperion. While it's a common thing to do, I think if any of these book-jacket-name-lenders had actually read Mitchell's book, they would have politely declined to deposit favors in the editor's/publisher's favor bank this time around.

It had been in existence for five years prior to 1940.I stopped reading after that, but a friend tells me that she switches either jockeys or horses in a single race.

It was somewhat informative and had its interesting moments-hard not to when such fascinating characters are involved. But, put it this way, I felt like the writing detracted from the story rather than added to it. The author took a piece of horseracing history that should quicken the heart and instead made it drag on and on. It's as if she couldn't distinguish between the totally uninteresting details and those that should have been in the spotlight. The result was finding boredom while looking for and expecting entertainment. Totally anticlimactic. I'd recommend passing on this. If you want a magnificent story that's eloquently rendered, check out Ruffian: Burning from the Start by Jane Schwartz."},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes but disappoints in the stretch","review":"Nothing is left out of this book, no matter how relevant or germaine.

I just got too tired.I don't blame the author. She wanted to tell us everything about racing, the origin of race tracks, gambling, mysterious signs and religious symbols, personal lives of jockies, and for some baffling reason, the overwrought story of this guy she met once who came down with cancer.I blame the editor. I can find dozens of sentences that I just wanted to take a red pen to. \\"Misplaced modifier,\\" or \\"run-on sentence,\\" or \\"Does not make sense.\\" Didn't Toby tell the author that the best part, the hardest part of writing is knowing what to leave out?Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful-zero stars","review":"This book is awfully dull.

The author's account of Chris Antley and the 1999 Triple Crown lacks focus and is poorly researched. This book has many factual mistakes that even the most causal horse racing fan will catch. This book does not even come close to Laura Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit. The author's own story of a dying boyfriend is not as effective as it should be.

As a horse racing, history, and literature buff, I was hoping this would be an informative and entertaining read. Instead I trudged through a schmaltzy, unremarkable memoir/biography. Most of the book is obvious and boring. There are redeeming parts, but I'd really only recommend it to die-hard Charismatic fans. There are much better tales out there for those looking for a good slice of horse history, some humor, and beautiful language (e.g. Seabiscuit, Stud, Horse of a Different Color).The title is also inappropriate. The book should have simply been called \\"Charismatic.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An authentic look at racings backside","review":"If you hang out on the backside of the racetrack, you have extra bits of time to just sit on an overturned bucket and read. You would think of all of the stories that happen on the racetrack just in one day, there would be a lot more books on the subject. The connections for the 70+ horses that race each day at any given track are worth at least one novel each.Three Strides Before the Wire. by Elizabeth Mitchell is a compelling read about the backside of racing in this century. It is the book to read after you've read Seabiscuit for the umteenth time. The book tells the story behind the scenes of Charismatic's run for the 1999 Roses. It also tells a bit about trainer D. Wayne Lucas, jockey Chris Antley, and the Ramsey's owners of Charismatic.The book is authentic. It is a compelling read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassingly Bad","review":"I can't honestly review this entire book because I only made it half-way through before I decided to give up. It's an excruciating journey, where amateurish writing and dull information and platitudes are forced down the reader's throat like cough medicine. A lot of research obviously went into this book, and in more capable hands I'm convinced could have made for a great story. Mitchell drops the ball, though, and makes a mess of it all, patching her research and her various story-lines together with all the stitches showing.Two great books I'd recommend instead (if you haven't already read them) are Kevin Conley's Stud, and of course the young Hillenbrand's unbeatable Seabiscuit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Horse Tale","review":"This just doesn't have the spark that good books do. For starters, it's way over-researched. What's more, it isn't particularly well written. The words are all function, and the sentences, paragraphs and chapters are unfocused and poorly organized. Mitchell tends to alternately dart around aimlessly from topic to topic, and then get encumbered by extended and uninteresting digressions that are difficult to get through. I'm someone who appreciates skillful use of language, even in sports books, and unfortunately Mitchell's writing is sterile; perfect for reference books, perhaps, and possibly even some political writing (which she seems to specialize in based on her bio), but incapable of doing justice to the dramatic story of Chris Antley and Charismatic. Mitchell includes her own personal story as well in this book in a way that, in my personal opinion, seems gratuitous. I found Three Strides Before the Wire to be a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Condition and On Time!!","review":"The book arrived on time and in great condition.

Using it is another matter. First, as many other reviewers have mentioned, it really can't extract the juice from anything other than a small orange, a lime, or a small lemon. The next problem is that once you've squeezed your 8 oranges to get a glassful, and you remove the glass, it continues to drip on the counter. Finally, cleaning the thing completely is pretty-near impossible - you end up with bits of orange inside, outside, in the gear mechanism, etc. So while I love to look at it, I can't recommend that anyone else spend their money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best way to make OJ","review":"Very simple way to make great fresh OJ.

Dave is awesome LIVE and this show doesn't disappoint. I remember listening to Dave Matthews bootleg cassette tapes in 1988 in our college dorms, being told, \\"This guy in Virginia is really good. We gotta go check him out sometime!\\" Many of his followers have no idea that he's been pumping out great live shows for that long. This Central Park show is a perfect example of what he has to offer - which is pure bliss for a jam band fan. This show has the old saxophone player (who is killer in this show and every other show he ever played) and it also contains the one and only Mr. Warren MothaF*k*ng Haynes!!! The hardest working guitarist in the world today. He really shines on Cortez the Killer, as even Dave is even caught on camera looking back at the drummer, saying, \\"He's f*king good\\". I highly recommend this show, as the sound is full and crisp from beginning to end and the video doesn't flip around too much like many other shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"great concert","review":"Ive seen DMB live a time or two and they put on a great show.

I have also seen the other live DVD's and heard all the albums, BUT THIS DVD BLEW ME AWAY!!!!The set list was UNBELIEVABLE, and the band was FULL of ENERGY!!And Dave was unlike anything I've seen before.

WE had to use our ice scraper on a warm vehicle to keep our windshield clean. We had bought 2 sets 1 for our son's truck and the other for ours. We returned the un opened ones and bought 2 sets of Michelin Winter blades.

For instance the song listed as In Memoriam is given the sample for Alone in The World, which is another track on this album. The sample at least matches with the actual song you get when you download but it makes everything very confusing.

The only problem I really had with it was the fact that Stevie didn't speak as much as I would have liked. I am more than a little intrigued by him and would have enjoyed listening to him talk about his ideas and views on the issues he expressed in the songs more. I was aware of his sense of humor which was touched on a bit throughout the film. He's an interesting character and I really was expecting a bit more from him actually (Berry Gordy and Quincy Jones' comments minimalized would have been great). They didn't cover all the songs which would I was surprised about. A couple of my favorites, Joy inside my Tears and All Day Sucka were not mentioned AT ALL and these are not classics, as singles, but worthwhile to talk about, I thought. Anyway, if one is a fan of Stevie, a true fan, and owns the album, having this documentary is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs in the Key of life","review":"Stevie is wonderful in any format.

The book is largely a giant compendium of reprinted testimony -- often reprinted verbatim -- from the government's own trial record. Its tone is unapologetically hostile and belligerent. Curiously, nowhere in the book does Chipman produce any direct evidence linking Wirz to the crimes the ill-fated defendant was tried and executed for; Chipman's entire case is based on thoroughly circumstantial evidence. In the end, Chipman's book is a great collectible, and a \\"must-have\\" for Civil War buffs -- but readers should only approach Chipman's work as a piece reflecting the \\"Bloody Shirt\\" of the post-Civil War era...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written relevant arguments,,,,","review":"Well, I borrowed this book from a friend not long ago and I must say, this book hit home..hard.

One of the songs was even featured on \\"Starsky and Hutch\\". \\"Don't give up on us baby\\" was a great go to song for couples and I really liked the rest of the songs as they have a nice layed back feel to them and a sort of Southern flavor or New Orleans flavor. It's hard to explain. Each song can hold it's own. Even though David Soul is best known as an Actor/Director he did a great job with \\"Playing to an Audience of One\\". I don't believe you will be disappointed with this selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Watch; Has Held Up Well","review":"Currently the wristwatch I wear on a daily basis.

The Denon will blow your mind; it has that WOW factor when you wear it and don't want to take them off.YOU WILL NEED AN AMPLIFIER FOR SURE!!! without an AMP you are not getting the full potential. If you're thinking of buying this, then don't wait. worth the $ for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy if you don't want to purchase a preamp","review":"First I want to say, these Headphones only get better the more you listen to them. The music is CRISP and CLEAN. Bass is deep and clean and impressive, not boomy at all. When I listen to a song, I can hear EVERYTHING very clearly. Very comfortable on my ears and head. The Cord is long and not easy to tangle. I would definitely burn them in for at least 70 hours. A good buy.The only bad thing I have to say about these headphones is that now when I listen to MP3s, I can really hear what that format is lacking and I have had to just starting listening to FLAC.I highly recommend this product. Works great and your don't necessary need a preamp for these headphones at all. I would not wear these to the gym or move around too much while wearing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for the long haul","review":"The high quality sound of these phones has been well attested to and I have no disputes there. However after having owned the Denon's for 2 years I can say that the build quality is unacceptably awful. In the last six months both the right and left cups have literally fallen off the headband, (due to very inadequate screws) and the left pad has detached from it's cup. If you buy this product I would recommend industrial grade super glue as well, if not I urge you to look elswhere for a quality pair of headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China!","review":"I don't know what's wrong with all of you people. The sound from these is very blah and boomy. Yes, even when amped. Plus they're made in China and there's no serial number! Do yourself a favor and get some HD600's. Way better all around sound and you can get them at a killer price right now. One more thing, if you're looking at these for recording, get you a pair of senn's 280's! Built like a tank and $cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Great, Durability Poor","review":"These headphones sound amazing...I mean, really good. But just beware they need to be treated with care. After a year, the pin that connected the left headphone has broken, and so now the headphones are completely unwearable. And of course this happens after the warranty expires. I expected a bit more from a high-end manufacturer like Denon. I doubt I'll be buying Denon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound but they don't even last a year","review":"The sound is all you could want but these literally fell apart in nine months. They are only connected by a flimsy nut and bolt into plastic that holds the full weight of very heavy phones. That bolt comes loose, off comes the headphone. Repair the left side for $100 in two weeks and then the right side falls off because the phones need to both be bolted down tight to hold together. After I spent $225 fixing them they just fell apart yet again a week later. Folks saying these are well built are either lying through their teeth or haven't had them long enough. Do not waste your money. Four star sound, no star construction. Ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"These cans sound great but I wish I had done more research to discover their major design flaw.The cups are held on with really cheap plastic screws.

They have a beautiful sound and you can crank them up. Great job Denon!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not like its daddy","review":"I rated them a 2 but they are not really that bad - I just wanted to indicate that my expectations were higher and give people a head's up.I bought these as a budget alternative to the 7000s, which totally blew me away. ON the 2000s the bass is phenomenal, but there is a big dip in the midrange between 1 - 4 khz. Then there is a big rise up to 10 khz (which seems to be standard for modern designs trying project a soundstage). But the overall effect is unnatural and edgey, even after burning in for over 50 hours.So they went back and I got some beyer 990's instead (good bass , less edgey).I am also considering AKG 701 / 702 for my recording studio (they may not have as strong bass, but otherwise they are as neutral as what's out there)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made In China Bass Heavy Junk For $350!","review":"First off, if you are releasing $350 headphones, don't make them in China, its just not a good marketing decision. And on top of that they sound like junk, you all need to do yourselves a favor and look for a good deal on a pair of Sennheiser HD650s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to read Bill Dunham","review":"This had such promise...but never materialized. Havil is obviously enchanted with Euler--who wouldn't be?--but he fails to explain the material, and seems to have failed to proofread his book.In Dunham's Journey Through Genius, the explanations are clear and step-wise. I read it with a thick pad of paper and a pen--I don't really trust anyone--but it was all workable. Havil states things unclearly, so it's far from obvious just what he's trying to show. The discussions are unfollowable, at least to me.Reading as much of this as I was able to stand is a lot like finding out that there's no Santa Claus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfriendly","review":"There is no shortage of good material in this book. The problem is Havil's writing style is very unfriendly it's as if he thinks you already know the material. There are many section that are written badly and are after re-reading several times I still don't understand them. Also this is written for folks who know math very well and I'm one of those folks, yet I find many sections hard to understand. Genius is in taking something complicated and breaking it down and making it simple, which Havil doesn't do. He's no William Dunning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over intellectualized something trivial","review":"Summation of series is statistical and entropical in nature. In fact summtion is rather superposition. When f(x) = 1/x, integral do not exist but only summation. Are there a profound relations between the constants pi, i, e , and gamma? This book had not answer that for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - highly recomended","review":"Gamma seemed like an unusual subject for a book, but the author really makes it hang together. There is so much mathematics in here that I didn't know, that the author presents clearly and with enthusiasm. His enthusiasm is infectious and I really enjoyed it. The book assumes you are prepared to put in some effort, but the reward is worth it. The material on the harmonic series and logs was particularly good. I even understood the Riemann Hypothesis sections!. I don't know the author (I think it's his first book) but I'll be at the front of the queue for his next. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody's perfect","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who has learned calculus. The book is full of mathematical gems set in historical context. For example, one of the Bernoullis showed that the integral of 1/x^x from x=0 to 1 is the sum of 1/n^n from n=1 to infinity. If you appreciate that result, then this book is for you. I have found only one error in the first 45 pages (which is as far as I have read). On page 13 the author is trying to compute the average distance of a planet from the sun, assuming an elliptical trajectory, and tacitly assuming a uniform distribution in the angle that astronomers call true anomaly. For this distribution, despite the assertion at the top of page 13, it is easy to show that if the ellipse is not a circle, then the average distance from the sun is less than the semimajor axis of the ellipse. So the author is human after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is!","review":"It's a guitar cable. It's 10 feet. It works. What more do you want?

After the kid scares everyone into passing out, he takes their bags of candy, but he doesn't stop there. He actually goes into someone's house and takes all the candy on the table, but he doesn't stop there either. He goes to their refrigerator and takes everything from it too. Not only does the book condone stealing, but it wasn't even funny either. I expected it to be amusing, but really it was just plain stupid. If you were considering buying this book, don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the message?","review":"I bought this book because it was featured in the take home flyer from school. The story has a little boy dressing up so scarily that people pass out. Then he steals all their candy and in one case raids the refridgerator. He has so much candy that he can eat all he wants everday until next halloween. I think it teaches greed and glutony. Not really themes I want to reinforce in my preschooler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good RFID Primmer","review":"This book is well written and takes the reader through the basics of RFID, the technology. and historical background. The author shows various forms of RFID sending devices and their uses. It also goes through some basic construction techniques.

And do you really need 100 pages to define these terms for you? I certainly hope not!My advice for screenwriters who truly want to understand story is to read \\"The hero's journey, the mythological structure of storytelling\\" and Robert McKee's \\"story.\\" Go to McKee's seminar.

It gives you an excellent idea of what it was like on the Titanic. There are many reasons why I liked it, maybe it's because the Titanic amazes me, or because there is one adventure after another. Titanic Crossing is such a good book, I can't think of one thing I didn't like! I definitely recommend this for all ages. But if you don't like sad stories, don't read it. You can imagine how sad a horrible disaster like the sinking of the floating palace Titanic would be. Out of 2,200 people on board, only 700 and some survived you know (there were only 20 life boats, people didn't think Titanic could sink.) Anyway, on a scale of 1-100 I would give it 100 plus two thumbs up! Great work Barbara Williams!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Titanic Crossing","review":"VERY BORING!!!!I advise you NOT to buy this book if you haven't read it yet.The plot is boring , and it has nothing about the sinking(maybe just about 1 paragraph)which is the whole point!!Who cares about Alberts stupid family life?The book is supposed to be about the TITANIC.I think that I wasted my money.I request buying a better book, such as \\"TITANIC,THE LONG NIGHT\\" by Diane Hoh. That was a GOOD book. This book is not worth your money,trust me!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the ship??????","review":"This book Has almost nothing to do with the Titanic!!!!!!All Albert (the main character) is EVER doing is either thinking about his dead dad or, talking with His simple mother, his horribly spoiled and bratty sister, or Alice, a boring caracter from another family. Plus he's in SECOND CLASS!!!!!!!!!!! YAWN!!!!!!Why couldn't he be in a cooler class like first or third? the only almost GOOD part of the story is the sinking, witch is like TWO PARAGRAPHS LONG!!!!!!!!!! This book is REALLY stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"book - Titanic Crossing","review":"was so easy to order. came quick and fast no hassels.

If you liked the movie, then you will really enjoy the book. It reinacts Albert's trip across the ocean, from buying the tickets to being rescued by a boat. Albert's family gets lost when the Titanic is sinking, and he is alone with his little sister in the lifeboat. Making it to safety is just one of the many obstacles Albert and his family face on the Titanic.I would recommend this to grades 7-9 because it is an easy read but it is also a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS CABLE","review":"You will be extremely dis-satisfied with this product, it is complete and utter garbage.

The real cable works."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE CHEAP CABLES DO NOT BUY","review":"This cable is terrible. I kept on getting 2 refresh rate lines, coming down my screen, I tried a high end LCD and a CRT monitor and both had the same refresh rate lines coming down, the image quality was terrible (grainy). The price was appealing, but they are terrible cables.I ended up going to the local store and buying the Microsoft VGA HD cables and have never been happier.Intec is not responding to e-mails (apparently these cables have a lifetime warranty..HA!!)I would sugged buying the Microsoft VGA cables instead and don't waste your time (as others have suggested)"},{"rating":"1","title":"unexceptional performance...","review":"Do not buy this product.

I bought this cable only because I know that VGA is the only way to get 1080p output unless you have a newer Xbox with an HDMI port. I originally was using the component cables that came with the Xbox and the picture looked wonderful, but I thought it might be even better. I was aghast when I hooked this VGA cable up.To say it displays a little ghosting would be a gross understatement. Several other reviewers have described it perfectly. The picture is horrible above 640x480 and there is a ghost image of everything about an inch to the right. On my 47\\" LCD, the image is disgraceful. I will take their good advice and exchange this for the official Microsoft version."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cable, fairly reasonable price","review":"with my 32\\" lcd tv being vintage 2005, there were no HDMI inputs - this handled the VGA input on the tv well and the display looked great."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible experience","review":"waited forever to have the item shipped, it never managed to get to my mailbox, horrible experience But im not going to bother with a customer service complaint to fight over a 15 dollar item. ill get it from somewhere else from someone whom will make sure it gets to me. thanks for taking my money and not delivering."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Pacific in Concert from Cargegie Hall","review":"A beautyful soundtrack and on of my favorites to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help! I need to wash this noise right out of my ears: Reba murders Nellie!","review":"Sorry, Reba, but Nellie Forbush is a young, educated nurse from Little Rock, Arkansas, with a pleasant, southern accent...and far from the ignorant, annoying, vulgar sounding, grunting backwoods hick with a hillbilly accent that you portray on this recording! Reba KILLS this entire concert, and, besides the outlandish, out-of-character and out-of-place accent...just doesn't have the singing and acting capabilities to do justice to this role! Both McEntire and the director of this concert need to be arrested for the murder of Nellie Forbush, American Nurse! Perhaps, MS McEntire is simply playing herself, instead of attempting to become the character of Nellie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"South Pacific CD","review":"After seeing this concert performance on PBS recently, we quickly ordered the CD. Super! Great quality and wonderful voices and acting, even if one couldn't see them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Gift","review":"This recording is a wonderful gift to all of us that love musical theatre. At first Reba sounded a bit too country for me on this album but after a couple of numbers you realize there is no way Reba can do it anyway but hers. And you fall under her enchantment. Brian Stokes Mitchell's Emil is every bit as powerful as you can imagine. Lilias White is a rich, spirited Bloody Mary. Alec Baldwin steals every scene he appears in. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reba steals the show","review":"Reba Mcentire has done it again. She has won over the New York theater critics. Everything this woman touches turns to gold. Is there anything this woman cannot do. It is worth watching or buying the CD for just McEntire's performance alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martin and Pinza still have it all.","review":"As far as this recording goes, it seems the performers are more concerned with how \\"South Pacific\\" is going to serve them rather than how best they can serve the material. Reba is delightful, sweet, etc., but she is far too country and takes \\"hick\\" far too seriously vocally. Brian Stokes Mitchell does not have enough lyrical, resonant quality showing in the voice -- it all seems pushed as a means of showing the \\"dramatic.\\" The masses will buy it, but not me. I am giving the CD away. I am quite content with the Original cast, even though the sound quality is, regrettably, inferior. It all seems to be intended for \\"crowd-pleasing\\" and not done out of respect for one of the Musical Theatre's greatest treasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Reba","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with Steve from DC.Everyone else on the recording is adequate, but when Reba began to sing, I cringed. She has no business singing an early Broadway show. With her twangy nasal sound, she is as appropriate as Mickey Mouse. To the young adults today, I say if you are interested in early Broadway, and can think for yourself, then buy the original cast recording or even the movie version which has some interesting orchestrations. I saw South Pacific on Broadway which dates me. But please not Reba."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cornballed & Hokey Trivilialization of South Pacific","review":"Maybe I am too old (56) and have too fond memories of the earlier, classic recordings of this wonderful musical (the 1949 Enzio Pinza/Mary Martin recording or 1958 Rossano Brazzi/Mitzi Gaynor recording), but I found that its recent Carnegie Hall rendition with Reba McEntire awful. McEntire has a wonderful voice but she sure corn-balled up the Nellie Forbush role beyond belief -- both vocally and visually (crossing her eyes to look the country bumpkin) -- to the point where I found that it was almost unwatchable. Listening to the CD wasn't much better. I know that I'm in the minority, but I'm afraid that the point of this 2006 South Pacific was to attract new listeners to South Pacific through the popularity of McEntire, instead of by assemling a cast that was up to one of Richard Rodgers' best musicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO on inappropriate casting!","review":"I understand opportunities in musical theater are limited for black/African-American actors, but they are as limited, if not more, for Asian actors as well.Though her talent is great, to cast Lilias White as Bloody Mary and THEN another black actress as the mute daughter, is such a nasty slap in the face for Asian actresses who could have easily filled those spots!With all the talent from Miss Saigon, King and I, Avenue Q, Pacific Overtures, THERE ARE ASIAN ACTORS OUT THERE!!!!BOO on the casting for this concert!Not only did it miss by a long shot, it has gone and offended a distinct culture and its people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Washingto D.C. done over","review":"Michael Hanson is a political bagman for the Democratic partyin the 2000 election.

But, to even lift the feet to step out, they feel like they're falling off the feet. The strap only covers the really front part near the toes that it doesnt cover enough of the dorsum of the foot for the shoes to stay on when you lift your feet. Also, they are not true to size. They run about 1/2 size larger, so it contributes to the above problem. In addition, after wearing it out to a new years party once, the bow on one foot popped off!

First off, Sony always fails to mention that their product is only 16 bit ATRAC, where as the Sharp's is 24 bit. What this simply means is that this product has better sound quality (especially in the mega bass). Also, the Sony's products run not on Lithium-Ion rechargable batteries, which the Sharp does. this means a much longer battery life (Sharp goes about 12 hours with the rechargable battery alone -->Sony's goes about 5 hours). To sum it all up, Sony should be given credit for introducing MD to the world, but they have lost on the competition to many other companies."},{"rating":"2","title":"It costs a lot because you save a lot","review":"I just got the 821, and it is the best gadget I have ever bought. It is so much better than a mp3 player because the sound quality is better and each minidisc is about $2.00 to $5.00, for 74 min. A memory card for 32MB is at least $50. Once you know how to use the 821 it's so easy. With a digital output the sound quality is AWESOME! And it does not skip at all.

Ours works great and my wife loves the tea options. It has a bigger footprint than I imagined, but we are 4+ happy. We have enjoyed every product tasted to date. Also, we like to be able to fill it using a gallon jug of spring/bottled water and not take off the water tank and instructed.

But for the life of me I can't find any that I like. The coffees and teas are week and very bitter. I have tried all the settings and all the flavors. It's too bad cause the machine is designed well. I also have a Tassimo machine, it makes MUCH better hot coco, coffees and teas (but offers too little variety). My kids won't even drink the coco out of the Flavia machine. So if you have one at your work and you like the taste, go for it!

There are competing systems which make just as good and hot a cup of coffee without wasting this much plastic per cup and for much less money (Senseo, Melitta and others). Some other systems such as the Nespresso are just as pricey, but make significantly better coffee.That leaves us with this in-between system, way overpriced for the mediocre coffee it produces.

The Hummel Variations was recorded in 1968, while the rest was recording in 1975.The Molique Concertino features some adventureous and virtuosic writings -- modulation through remote keys as well as numerous trills as well as touching the high G a couple of times. Holliger makes everything sound easy. Moschelles features Holliger regular partner Aurele Nicolet on the flute. The Rietz piece is a nice piece deep into the Romantic vein. Holliger switches to the English horn for the Concerto by Fiala, an oboe player himself. The pieces by Bellini and Hummel should be familiar to a wider population of oboists.All in all, excellent playing (untouchable really) from Holliger. These rare romantic gems are hard-to-find on CDs. If you want an alternative version, you can check out a recent recording by the great Australian oboist Diana Doherty:Romantic Oboe Concertos"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent movie for the whole family","review":"Tim Allen, Martin Short and others shine in \\"Jungle 2 Jungle\\", one of the greatest Disney family films ever.

There are plenty of other books that can teach ethics, if that's what it's trying to do, in a less sensationalistic and much more realistic, nuanced and interesting way.

Things go wrong, Madec shoots a man and Ben is blamed for it. Suddenly, the tables are turned. Ben is chased like the sheep he helped hunt with Madec. He ran from the armed men running and climbing giant rocks. Finding out if he got away kept me interested in the book.I recommend this book because it's very suspenseful.

Actually in the book Deathwatch by Robb White this happened. Ben, the main character, was paid to guide a guy around the desert on a hunting trip and everything went wrong. A man was killed and now Ben was chased in the desert without food, water, or anything. The book can get sort of boring sometimes, but you just have to wait until the last one hundred pages come and then the book is amazing. There are a lot of unexpected events that come up. The genre of this book is mystery because near the end of the book the cops have to figure out what happened and who did what. I would recommend this book to a thirteen or fourteen year old because the book is sort of violent with all the guns and shooting people. This book is an easy book to read, but the events are very interesting and that's what makes it a good book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death of Low Rating, Watch the Stars Rise","review":"\\"DEATHWATCH\\" IS AN AWSOME BOOK!

The book takes place in the desert around the late 1960's. Ben is a college kid that is going out hunting with a guy named Madec, to pay for college. Ben does not have much money. The problem in this story is that Madec frames Ben in such a way that Ben either doesn't tell anyone or dies! Madec has stripped Ben of everything, leaving him in his underwear in the middle of a desert. Think this is tough, try surviving with a man trying to hunt you down with a gun!

Since I play MtG, this is very interesting, and card for Chainer fits well with the powers in the story. However, I do have a gripe that the ending is too sloopy. When I finished the book, I get the feeling \\"what? this is it?\\". It's like the author reached the limit of his book and had to end it quickly. Other than this gripe, this book is the best among the Odyssey Cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good sequal","review":"The book is about a man named Chainer who we met briefly in Odessy, this book goes over a bit of the history of the Mirari that everyone wanted in the first book(and still wants in this book), The Cabul that runs the pit fights, and the powers and way of becoming a dementia caster. The book is kind of slow in the beginning It goes through what happoned in Odessy only this time its from Chainers point of view. After that it gets more interesting as more people and groups fight for the Mirari and for control of everything from Otaria to the Mer Empire.

The word \\"Keeping\\" should be removed from the title, since if you are already fit, these workouts will not keep you there.

Doesn't look like this has anything to do with the movie, except two songs from musicians who are on the offical soundtrack (Frou Frou, Remy Zero). And \\"Three Times a Lady\\" from The Commodores??

I look forward to reading more of Ronin's work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for TRUE Rap, Hip Hop and Run-DMC fans","review":"If you are a TRUE Run-DMC FAN as opposed to a listener;if you are a TRUE student of Rap's beginnings;if you are a TRUE student of HIP-HOP;THIS BOOK NEEDS TO BE IN YOUR LIBRARY. Id go as far to say the lessons learned in regards to the music industry, and its treatment of rising or new artist could serve as a knowledge foundation for those aspiring to be in the music industry.WALK THIS WAY and GET THIS BOOK"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent pre-exam review","review":"This is an excellent study guide for the AP Exam. Remember, I say that this is a good STUDY GUIDE. It's not a substitute for the textbook or the class. But if you get every concept from this book, you'll have no problem on the AP. If you're someone who relies on the essays more than the Multiple Choice, getting this book will be a great help. You'll really get all the ideas organized in your head and will remember the great mnemonics during the AP exam. If you want to do well on the AP or the SAT II, this is the book to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Princeton Review not very helpful","review":"The first thing that struck me about this publication was its attitude toward the AP test. In a nutshell, Magloire says \\"The AP test is stupid and biology is stupid, but I guess I'll teach you about it. . .\\" Not only that, but at least 30 to 40% of the material on the AP test was not in this book. The diagnostics in the back were the only helpful thing in this book, as they are real AP test questions, though they are not presented in a representative rastio to the real test. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague...at best","review":"This book would be great as a skin-deep refresher for an already accomplished Biology student. Used as a test-prep guide...you got nothin'. This book won't help. Barron's Biology guide is longer and boring, but will get you ready to go for the big test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high hope for a satisfying read; they were dashed less than halfway through the book. Learner's book is packed with fascinating bits of Jewish mysticism and historical events however she does both the reader and the storyline a great disservice by failing to allow what she has started to reach its full potential. It's lazy writing and leaves the reader frustrated for having wasted their time. Gratuitous sex, unnecessarily graphic and violent torture scenes, and deaths that dishonored a cast of characters deserving much, much better. She lets the villan off easily while villifying a goddess; the research of which might have led this story to a much better and more accurate place. Too bad. This could have been so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise in a Modern Literature","review":"I really liked this book. It's bit dark, so you have to be a fan of darker stories. I bought this book on an impulse because it was a new release, I love unique stories and this one fit the bill.I'm not a certifiable critic but few books really make an impact on me enough to recommend to others and this book had a very unique storyline and for a casual reader like myself I could hardly put to book down 1/2-way into it... which is key for me. If a book doesn't keep my interest after page 200, I give up.I found the story to be very difficult to follow in the early part of the book, a lot of characters and weird language that I found hard to understand... but after getting immersed in the story, I found it very intriguing.This was one of the best books I've read in a while. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it and try Diana Gabaldon","review":"I purchased this on the recommendation of a friend.

Terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLEAH-- absolutely awful!","review":"Sheesh! How do books this bad get published, much less wind up with rapturous comments on the covers? The writing is TERRIBLE: wooden, inexpressive, full of cliches and boring, boring BORING! All the steamy sex in the world becomes ludicrous when it's presented to the reader in such uniformly awful writing. I almost never fail to complete a book, even one I don't particularly like, so I struggled through most of this book, but I just couldn't finish it.Somebody who actually knows how to write should take on this potentially interesting subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"cologne won't stop the stink","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read--and believe me, I've read many! It features terrible writing, an unbelievable plot and stereotyped characters, gratuitous sex scenes, (of course a rabbi and his wife would have sex in the synagogue!) and on and on and on. There might be a smidgen of historical interest in the idea of the superstition of medieval Europe giving way to the Renaissance, but the author has buried it in sensationalism, cliches, and just plain junk. In this case, if you judge the book by the ridiculous trashy cover, you're on the right track. (Why did I read it? For my book group, whose unanimous opinion was the same as mine. Stay away!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost interest","review":"I lost interest about half-way though the book. The idea overall is interesting.

Everyone who saw me reading it was also slightly disturbed and had lots of questions. I enjoyed the historical aspect of the book and being an OB/GYN nurse, the midwifery parts, too. The details of the torture scenes and the sadistic personality of the Inquisitor were too graphic and upsetting to me to allow me to relax and enjoy the story.

I've never been able to engage in a story when it is written like a stage direction.

Ruth falls on the food and Rosa, stroking her matted hair watches her eat.\\"It doesn't allow the reader to sympathize with the characters at all. You get no real sense of their emotions by watching from a distance unless there are actors portraying the characters in a movie where you can get the visual sense by their expressions.I found my self attempting to translate the directorial style in my head to something more readable and, sadly, that spoiled the whole experience for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried ...and I tried....and I tried...","review":"but I just couldn't get through it. A mish mash of mile long, hyphenated names, and it is difficult to tell what character is speaking. I read a passage, went back and re-read it again and again...ughhh! a very tedious read. Not even the cast of characters in the beginning of the book could help me out. I gave up around page 200. Just not my style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This book was so disappointing, I felt cheated. The book is supposed to be about a young Jewess at the time of the Inquisition. A woman who is a midwife and who practices the kabbala. A beautiful concept! A young woman living in dangerous times, who can get herself in trouble in so many ways! But, the book is not really about Ruth. It is about the men who swirled around her, controlling her life: The Archbishop, the canon for the Archbishop,and the Spanish Inquisitor, whose eye has been on this Jewish woman for a while. It is THEIR politics we get involved with,not Ruth's challenges.When the book focused on Ruth it was interesting, but that was far too infrequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your New House","review":"This book contains a lot of worthwhile detailed information for anyone who is thinking of building a custom, semi-custom or production home. I do feel that the authors are somewhat biased toward homes in the $200,000. and up price range. The book will initally open your eyes to EVERYTHING that might go wrong. It is important to realize that many of these things may not occur.

I was hooked, wrote down the name of the artist and found out he was in Chicago playing Lollapalooza that next day and a late show at House of Blues. Tried to see him at HOB, but couldn't make it. When I returned to California, I went onto iTunes and bought the release. Amazing! I love his gospel, original Motown sound. Went and saw him last weekend in Truckee, CA and was not disappointed. He band is solid and \\"Tiny\\" rocks the bass.His covers have emotion and energy; \\"Do the 45\\" is lovely.

Well, I cannot speak for the Microsoft cable yet, but I will end up buying it, as this cable is functional but not that good.What do I mean, well there is moire--lots of moire, anywhere it could exist it does. I didn't even realize that it could be that bad. It is distracting, even on the dashboard. In addition, there is a lot of dot crawl. It makes everything, games, videos, dvds, etc look rather bad. To be honest both issues make the composite signal (on the component adapter that came 360) seem quite a bit better. I guess I got what I paid for. At least the audio seems OK. I'd avoid this if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for use as a soup/stew bowl","review":"Bowls are expensive and look nice - they would be fine for cereal or a side salad.

The Metal Mind re-release sounds excellent, and the album has tons of punch with each instrument being incredibly audible. The bass in Happy Cats always puts a smile on my face, and the \\"Duke\\" extended play included contains more excellent music, I especially enjoy \\"Dave's Song\\" and \\"Sleep Sister, Sleep.\\" If you enjoy funk metal, buy this.

It's hard to find Audio-Technica cables everywhere. They aren't sold on Musician's Friend, Guitar Center, or Sweetwater. Amazon offers a great cable at a ridiculously low price. Where else can you find a high quality 50 ft. cable for $20? The best part is that they look like those really expensive monster cables, so people think you spent a fortune on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of static","review":"I purchased a 50 ft cable from guitar center for a performance we were having at our yoga studio... the cheapest cables were pricey so I came home and figured i'd look on amazon and order next day if there was a big price difference. These cables were less than half the price (including one day shipping). Awesome, right? No... we plugged in the cable to mike and the mixer and got lots of static. Swapped it out for the one I got from guitar center and the static was gone. These cables did not work for us. Maybe it was just a bad cable... but not worth the hassle for me. I would not recomment these. BTW... the cable/jacket was a lot thinner than the ones from guitar center. Not sure if they are well shielded and that was what caused the static."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steinski at his best","review":"This album features Steinski and his mixing skills. If you liked Lessons 1 and 2 featuring Steinski and Double Dee, you will love this album. It's one of those albums that you can listen to all the way through.

The ending was empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left hanging","review":"After reading this book I realized there was a previous book in this series and I'm going to read that one next. I enjoyed the book for the paranormal and time travel story. I had a slight problem with the main male character, Rourke. He was described as a hardened warrior but always seemed to come up short in his encounters with the very evil Fachan who seemed to be invincable with a whip of all things. Something about that just didn't ring true. Also, Fachan was way over the top as evil...he almost became a joke. All in all this was an enjoyable read and the love scenes were very caring. The ending left open the need for another book to resolve many issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Sucking Sound Commenceth","review":"Don't read this book! It says on the front cover that it won some award for paranormal romances, so if this is the best I pity anyone who has to read the worst. The characters are cardboard, the sex scenes are as predictable as you can get, the storyline is confusing and hard to follow as it jumps back and forth between the future and the past as people from the future try to go into the past to stop their future from occurring. Did it occur to anyone with the tiniest education in physics that if the people in the future change the past, then their future will not exist and they will not have changed the past after all? Paradox anyone? I sludged my way through nearly half of this pile of rotten cheese before I gave up and threw it across the room.

Christ died so that we could have a chance to go to Heaven. It does not guarantee that we will end up there. We have to live a holy life. And if we don't, we will answer for it.This book is not accurate when compared to scriptures. If you want to know what Heaven is going to be like, read Revelation. It's in there. God has revealed to us through His word what He wants us to know. We should be satisfied with that and not look to books like these to tell us what we want to hear. Because they aren't always true.

My sons comment was that he and his friends have found a lot of errors like this throughout this book.I recommend you do not buy this book. It also calls into question the editorial skills of Houghton Mifflin's division called McDougal Littell.It also says to me that the five star reviews for this book are either very generous or perhaps they have not really used this textbook.The reason I am marking the score so low (2 star) is because it is a textbook for math and the errors are math answers.

So why only 4 stars?This book is a great one stop shop for approximately 30 shotgun reviews. The author is objective with wonderful prose.The only thing I found lacking was the photography. One close up shot of the receiver of each gun under less than ideal light conditions. Shotgunning is as much a visual emotion as mechanical. I wanted to know how the gun performed but equally I wanted to see the fine lines, the texture of the wood, the proportions.

Service center technician said that there have been a number of units with the same problem. They could not explain why this happens but it seems that most users/owners with this problem were using this kind of form fit case. Maybe, pressing hard on the screen caused it.

But I bought another case, this time without the clear plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended...","review":"Although this product did not cause damage to my Treo as other reviewers have noted, I can certainly vouch for its shortcomings. The plastic screen cover sits a fraction of an inch above the Treo screen, rendering the stylus virtually useless and even if you are lucky enough to get it to work, you literally poke holes in the plastic cover with the tip of the stylus because you must press so hard. The holder often popped out of it's clip when I would kneel or bend. This lead to many near-death experiences for my Treo. Although I must note that the Leather is of very high quality and actually has a cushioning effect when the Treo falls. This holder's snap closing frequently popped out my SD memory card since the strap lies perpendicular across the top of the phone right on top of the SD slot. I gave up on this holder after two months and got the stationary side clip holder which is working out a bit better, albeit with a few notable annoyances itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deesn't work as expected","review":"WHen trying to use the phone feature you can not hear.

Nothing that we havent known already. But little did I know that there was soo much more information I havent known before. The book tells how Tom and Loki where pracitcally NORMAL loving twin brothers, but what caused Loki to go off the edge, and even the first time Tom and Katia first layed eyes on eathother. And even Gaia is in the book!This book is filled with sooo much betrayal and love at the same time. So dont hesitate to buy this one. Worth it for any fearless fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"That best part of the series yet!","review":"This book was so WONDERFUL! I told the whole history behind Oliver,Tom and Katia. Also finally Gaia knows and understands why her father can't be with her and she knows for sure who is Loki.

I love this book and I refer it to any fearless fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best book","review":"This book can be read even if you haven't finished the series.

I tells you everything that happened with her Dad, her mom, and Oliver. It's really awesome how they design the entire book. And to top it off at the end they introduce a new enemy of Gaia. This book definately diserves 5 stars and is worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS TONER!!!!","review":"The seller with this product picture tries to make you think you are getting an HP product!!

Most of their other Strauss recordings are considered definitive. So, like many, I was looking forward to this issue, which turned out to be a disappointing train wreck. Like all of Erato's recordings with Barenboim and the CSO, the recording levels are frustratingly low and the sound has a thin, shrill quality. It sounds as though most of this recording was made when the orchestra (especially the brass) was very tired. Gone is the power and breadth of the Chicago sound, replaced by poor intonation, feeble tone quality, and sloppy ensemble. It's amazing that anyone--Barenboim, the CSO, or Erato's producers--allowed this horror show onto the market. I recommend the Cleveland Orchestra's powerful Alpine Symphony performance on the Decca label with Vladimir Ashkenazy conducting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beneath These Western Skies by Judy James --Five Stars Plus!!","review":"The arrangements are brilliantly representative of a sometimes-forgotten genre and the range and subtleties of Judy James's consistently rich and resonant rendering of the songs encode them in one's mind forever!

Once they received the product, they would send a replacement (after a week or so for processing) - though they could not promise it would be the same color. Shipping might take a little while, too.

I was probably down 40 to 45 feet and it started to leak from the seals of the face-plate. That and the cross bar that rides on the bridge of the nose felt like someone was hitting me with a shovel handle. The snorkel is a good idea in theory, but I found myself suprised and breathless many times because the valve locks up if you dont have your head tilted to the right. The fins... While not being too uncomfortable, they were entirely too flexible for someone to use who knows what a pair of good rigid fins feel like. I was hardly moving in the calm waters of west bay.

To try and solve this problim, I took it to my local T.V. repairman and he said that it could not be fixed. His words were \\"Its just the result of lazy workmanship.

The subtlety with which the issues that really dog women is addressed - that's one of the wonders. The feeling of genuineness - that's another wonder. And the trip to Beirut is the last gift for which I wish to thank the director. As often happens, the compelling score has an impact - but that's true of so many contemporary films that, upon considering the issue, I realized that, instead of discounting or questioning the music's influence, I wanted to simply accept the fact that a film is basically a multi-media artwork.

This is not just another fluffed-up, hanger-on-tells-his-five-stories Stones books: it's refreshingly free of the usual self-aggrandizement seeping out from these projects; it doesn't insult anyone's intelligence by trying to infuse the goings-on with metaphysical significance and pathos; and it's a devastatingly funny read to boot.

If you are interested in the early beginings of the Stones there are 3 books I strongly recommend: \\"Nankering With the Rolling Stones,\\" \\"Our Own Story\\" by the Stones themselves, published in 1965--I believe this is the FIRST book ever written about the group and by the group (out of print for years but well worth the effort in attempting to find it)and \\"Stone Alone.\\" If you have these books you have a wealth of knowledge as to the inner workings of the Rolling Stones from the very begining (when Brian was deffinitely THE leader)."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've always wondered...WHO THE HELL IS NANKER PHELGE?","review":"Excellent! If you love the Stones....this book is for you! Extremely funny and honest portrayal of what life was like in England during the beginnings of what is now refered to as the British Invation. A must have for collectors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a Stones fan you gotta get this one!","review":"It may sound like a cliche, but this is an insider account in the truest sense. James Phelge lived with Mick, Keith and Brian in the infamous Edith Grove flat, and became part of Stones folklore. He relates endless anecdotes of what it was like to live with them before the superstar days, when they were literally starving artists. At the end of the book I got the sense that I really knew the four flatmates, a rare experience when reading a biography. A fascinating subplot is the formation of the Jagger-Richards-Jones triad, the driving force behind the early Stones, and the seeds of its destruction, all witnessed close-up by Phelge. The account is honest without being muck-raking; nor is Phelge a sycophant. Definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a working mom of 2","review":"This was the first cookbook I'd found that had really good recipes that everyone in the family enjoys and uses ingredients that I usually have in my pantry. And if I don't have an ingredient already, there are convenient shopping lists and even a guide that pairs up main dishes with sides and desserts. I've actually had this cookbook for years and was looking to see if the author had anything new out and was stunned that no one had written anything about this book yet. Big favorites are the Sherry marinated pork chops and the oven deviled chicken. Even my mother wanted to know where I'd gotten the recipes for these two!

This leads naturally into a bifurcation, yielding Finite Impulse Response and Infinite Impulse Response filters.The theory is presented in concise fashion. And with no problem sets in the chapters. Seems more like a summary of material you perhaps should have learnt in a more leisurely text. Example codes are given in C++. Short subroutines. There is very little need or usage of the object oriented nature of C++. If you need to code from the formulae in the book, the example codes can be used to get you started. But for most engineers, this may not even be necessary. A modicum of acquaintance with whatever language you write in should suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont understand spanish","review":"cannot say i like this film because i was not aware that it was in a spanish movie with Eglish caption"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, quirky comedy/thriller (more comedy) worthy of Almodovar fans!","review":"This Spanish film, set in Madrid, is a very dark (and, at times, very funny) comedy set in Madrid, where an unscrupulous real estate agent named Victor decides to start killing off little old ladies in the Chueca neighborhood of Madrid, who refuse to sell their apartments to him, then flips their apartments and sells them to affluent gay couples in the up-and-coming neighborhood. When gay couple Rey and Leo inherit the apartment next to theirs from one of Victor's victims - and Rey decides to move his mother into it, instead of selling it to Victor - things go from bad to worse, in a comedy with some bizarre characters and situations, that somehow is also a lot of fun to watch.

OK can I go back to the 32 inch waist...are you kidding???So I bought a pair in black and a pair in blue. the black ones still don't fit my waist and I have to keep pulling them up. These i never put in the dryer. The blue ones fit like sausage casing and I can't wait to take them off in the middle of the day because I can't stand to wear them the whole day.I don't mind the natural waist, if they worked they would pull in the belly.

I can only hold around 60 DVD's and not the 74 it is supposed to. These are normal DVDs, and not box sets either. It was easy to put together just 4 screws on the bottom which were tricky to get in. You cannot move the stand much because it is hard to when there are DVD's on it. It falls apart at the mid-section where the 2 metal pieces are Jointed together with no clip or anything to hold it in place. The balls on the top for decoration were very hard to put on and some did not fit at all. It is somewhat wobbly but not too bad. I will be returning this product because I am very upset with it.

For something that supposedly costs $100+, I expected better craftmanship. Maybe I'm the odd one out. I look at all these other reviews and see \\"assmebly was easy, only took me 15 minutes\\" and I can't help but feel irritated that I got the bum one. Whatever. Can't win em all.

I didn't know they had such a great history so I'm glad that information was there because now I really get it. It was like a bonus that added to the book for me.

The pen was a decent quality, but not the best. The paper though is good too, but there is hardly any screen tone to really cover up all of the pieces of paper that it comes with. The pencils are nothing special, they're just normal pencils with \\"how to draw manga\\" printed on them.But all in all, it's a good start if you're wanting to create your own manga.The cons about it is that it's WAY too expensive now.

The ending left me laughing out loud as I could not figure out who the stalker could be and the big reveal was sheer perfection.

But, boy did I start to feel for her when the stalker started coming after her with a vengeance. As the other reviewer of this book mentioned, I could not put the book down, I just had to find out who wanted Marissa dead so badly. I thought the potential killer was everybody EXCEPT who it really was!

This is, however, more than a little self-serving for his entire political projection is predicated upon the fact that his views are important and relevant because he is just a young, \\"average guy\\" and as such is just like everyone else in the under 30 demographic. However, the fact that he butresses such neocon issues as school prayer (and never attended public school), gun ownership (despite never mentioning a single statistic), and supports the war in Iraq (though apparently not so much that he's ready to volunteer for duty quite yet) is more than enough to offset such supposedly \\"fresh\\" and novel ideas as informed criticism of the republican party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ferguson: Too young to know, too stupid to care","review":"Reading this book is to pick up what Howard Stern famously called \\"idiot-savant pearls of wisdom.\\" Except in young Ferguson's case, it's flecks of chicken McNugget on some idiot's sweater vest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another 20-something, know-it-all, ditto-head, chickenhawk!","review":"All one needs to know about Mr. Ferguson is his enthusiasm for the war in Iraq and his unwillingness to join the fight.

If I could, I'd give the item 2.5 stars, but 2 will have to suffice as I'm in the process of returning the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing's better than \\"sweats\\"","review":"Everything was exactly as promised.

Murder, supense, a beautiful homicidal supermodel, what else do you need? Also, Claudia Christian is a \\"Must See!\\" Rather than just serving as eye candy, she proves her acting as well as comedic talent. She really should be in more comedies, and this film is proof. Just as her, the other actors do a fine job with their roles also. So see it or get hexed!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get over the Ivanova","review":"The new release of HEXED on DVD is a delightful treat. Most comedies in theaters these days aren't funny - they tend to be moderately amusing formula comedies with predictable plots and lame jokes. Not this brilliant gem.Alan Spencer, the producer of that great TV series SLEDGE HAMMER!, wrote and directed this hilarious romp. Ayre Gross and Claudia Christian starred as the star-crossed madcap lovers. Many fans will recognize Claudia Christian from her role as Commander Susan Ivanova on TV's BABYLON FIVE, and she steals the show with a great comic performance.The extras should not be skipped. Alan Spencer's audio commentary is a masterpiece of intelligent, witty narration. His background information on the filming is like taking a course on filmmaking.If you enjoy movies that a really funny and extras that rival the movie in entertainment value, you should buy HEXED on DVD. You'll be charmed by this magic Christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"If you want to see a good natured adult comedy, this is your movie. Claudia Christian is uber hot and at her comedic best in this film, and watching R. Lee Ermey as a veteran cop with nothing left to lose is comedy gold.

It lacks suspense, the characters are poorly developed and the whole idea of this book is kind of ridiculous. I seem to get the impression that the author hastily wrote this book to make a quick buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Herbert, Sepulchre","review":"\\"There is a house that holds a dreadful secret. \\"The Keeper\\", the psychic and thesecret serve a force which threatens mankind itself.\\" This is a breif descriptionof Sepulchre by James Herbert. This is the ninth novel of Herbert's that I've read,and this was my least favorite. I liked it, and respect it for it's story and complexity,but I just didn't get into it that much. I would find my mind wandering while tryingto read it. I kept getting confused by certain things in the novel and had to keeprereading things because I felt like I was missing things. Still, I think it is agood novel and worth the read, especially for the ending. It didn't really have thefeel of a Herbert book to me though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only horror here is the bad writing","review":"When you consider how good Herbert can be: Haunted, The Magic Cottage, Moon - this book is a real disappointment. The story begins quite well but starts to drag halfway through, so that by the time you reach the denouement, you are beyond caring. Part of the problem lies with the characterisation, which is wooden and lifeless. The characters are archetypes, never individuals, and so you care neither one way nor the other about them... Herbert's descriptive powers seem to have deserted him. The house of Neath never vividly comes to life. It is like a set on an empty film lot. Yet, the house is central to the story. The horror, despite its gaudiness (which is a lamentable feature of most of Herbert's works), never really horrifies, which for a horror book, is pretty damning. When Herbert writes well, he writes very well: When he writes badly, he writes books like Sepulchre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depraved Oscar Wilde","review":"Not my usual read- first James Herbert I've read- a fairly fast-moving thriller which gives the author a chance to explore the seedier side of human nature. Shades of a depraved Oscar Wilde and Voldemorte from Harry Potter with a mild bit of anti-semitism, misguided mysticism and IRA thrown in for good measure. Odd sentences abound but I think written for masculine appeal- depraved sex and violence!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The book kept my attention from the first page.

We made the mistake of turning it on in the car on a trip without previewing it and had to turn it off when both the 3 and 5 year old started crying when the frog was attacked. They found it so scary they don't even want to touch the DVD case. This video is probably fine for kids that are older or who don't get flustered by scary things."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Return of the Piano","review":"I had the pleasure of seeing Miss Amos perform in NYC during this Original Sinsuality tour. I was mesmerized by how immense Amos' ability was at playing the piano. At times, she would straddle the piano bench, playing the organ with one hand and the piano with the other. Truly inspiring.These albums capture Tori solo with her piano, and the improvs and intros have never been more intricate nor beautiful. Her voice has matured, becoming more husky than what she produced in the early 90's. This produces a great contast in sound, allowing for a truly cathartic listening experience as Amos goes from the gutteral to the sublime. A must have for Tori fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic but...","review":"Like O Zahr, whose criticisms about these bootlegs are accurate and thoughtful, I am a huge Tori Fan and of course I bought these 6 double cds. I even attended the London one which was great.Anyway, though we all love Tori for her intimate music, I often get bored when listening to a whole CD of these. I confess I have to change sometimes because it is too calm, funeral-like, sorry but I don't really like the instrument she uses when she performs \\"Beekeeper\\" and \\"Jamaica Inn\\".I prefer when the whole band accompanies her.Anyway, I love making my own compilations of Tori's music and I do listen to the bootlegs but I pick the ones I wanna hear; not the entire cd all the way through.The stand-out tracks : \\"Like a Prayer\\", \\"Carbon\\", \\"Suede\\" (because it has never appeared on any previous live recordings).As O Zahr said, if you're a true fan, buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, witty, a real page turner!","review":"This novel is a great find! From the first page, I could not put it down. It's hysterically funny, yet there's also a certain myterious element (will the bride to be's mother derail the entire wedding by her awful behavior--and yes, you will care), as well as unpredictable occurrences and fascinating people, such as a New Age-ish roommate recovering from being badly jilted.The characters are well drawn and believable and the dialogue crackles."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure dissapointment","review":"All I was looking for was a fun read and this book still managed to disappoint me. It just wasn't funny.The humour was annoyingly simple. The main character Emilie kept saying how funny something was, all the time. If a joke or a story is supposed to be funny it's not necessary to point it out, because if it is your audience will laugh.The author failed to make the main character interesting. She seemed to have no depth at all and was completely unrelatable. In the end I found myself rooting against her happy-end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably poor!","review":"Actually NO star would be the choice. What a disappointment!!

I always add extra water to her food and make it soupy to increase her fluid intake, and this food is well blended and adding water is easy.

They make a point of stealing from the best: Stones, Zep, Bowie, Iggy, Dead, Velvets ... and this time around they've fashioned some brilliant rock songs from their booty. Get Off, Bohemian Like You, Horse Pills, Mohammed ... these are quite simply fantastically great riffs, with choruses that stick to your ear like poop to a blanket. As for the Dandys themselves, they ARE rock and roll.

Of course everyone will recognize \\"Bohemian like You\\". A catchy and unapologetic witty pop song. To me the only weak songs are solid and shakin'. The production of the album is a bit too clean on some songs. Apparently the band has decided to recruit the same prducer for their new album and I'm confident that the results may exceed this album.

Wow, those two albums are excellent. This album has had to grow on me. It's a bit more radio friendly than the other two but no matter how much you try, you just can't help grooving and moving to these songs. The dandy's do a damn fine job of rolling a lot of musical influences into a magical sound-- and here's to whatever drugs, liquors, self-help manuals, whatever, they resort to to make great music.

There is something about this ablum that's a little bold, a little in your face, and a lot of fun to listen to. And they accomplish this not through anything fancy or complex: the lyrics are simple and clever, the music is not overbearing, but when its all thrown together not only works, but it works great. You can tell that the Dandy Warhols ended up with the album they set out to make: a straight up rock n roll album. In the overmarketed, overhyped, world of rock music the Dandy Warhols are a breath of fresh air. I can't recommend this ablum enough.

Perhaps it's because the other books have more recognizable characters from the Anne series, but I also think the writing style of this book is not as sophisticated and captivating as the others.

It showcases her amazing ability to make a character live and breath...even across 70 years. The only thing I did not like was the almost forced inclusion of the Blythe family. I bought this book BECAUSE it had further references to beloved Anne, however the insertion of a Blythe into every story was a bit of a drawback at times because the stories were not about the Blythes and just gave enough information to make you wish they were.

They were not intended to be published in book form anyway. However 'The Road to Yesterday' was. The stories are well up to Montgomery's standard and are very varied - some romantic, some sad - but all very good. Especially worthy of mention is 'Here Comes the Bride' which very cleverly builds up a story from many different viewpoints. 'Penelope Struts her Theories' has to be read just because of the title.As another reviewer has noted, the inclusion of the Blythes into every story does seem somewhat forced in parts, but provides a common link which truns the book more into a book rather than just a random selection of stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very enjoyable","review":"As a big fan of the 20 or so L. M. Montgomery books I've read and re-read, I was so excited to finally find a copy of this book. But when I started reading it I was really disappointed. I know this book was published posthumously and wondered if maybe she hadn't had time to polish the stories in it. Basically, I found it boring; one or two stories I couldn't even bother to finish, and others I've never re-read. None of the stories were wholly satisfying; each lacked something of the charm and entertainment of her previous short stories; those that started well ended flat.Another reviewer mentioned that they didn't find L.M. Montgomery's previous short stories satisfying, but I enjoyed the style of those earlier ones, which is perhaps why I didn't like these; they really have a different flavour to her other stories, although she still includes a number of her common themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book, watch the movies...(repeat as necessary)","review":"Great in all aspects (source material, trivia not previously covered in other books/articles, etc.), except that Parts II and III kind of get short shrift!I know that just getting Brando, Coppola and everybody else on board was a huge undertaking and that's why the launch of the \\"franchise\\" gets so much ink, but many of us (including me) are partial to Part II and wanted a bit more on Pacino/Michael's continued character development, as well as more on DeNiro/Young Vito Corleone.

While it need not be this clan, and could be any clan, the effects upon the lives of women subjected to the emotional deprivation of secular groups is substantial, and might be viewed under the parameters of those who live with narcissistic males, of any group, any ethnicity, and at any age. Because we don't tend to view action thrillers like this one as anything but entertainment, the real underlying important questions rarely get discussed, but could be, and might be of great benefit to those who witness the problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent entry level DVD player","review":"I haven't had any problems with this player at all. It's performs well at what I bought it to do. Give me high quality audio and video. The only reason I give the review a 4 star rating instead of a 5 is because of the extremely small remote. Not a big deal but it is kinda hard to memorize button positions when your single finger covers 2-3 buttons. If you can stand that, then I suggest you buy. I don't see how you could lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Buy - Connection to TV","review":"Excellent player for the price.

I have watched several movies and have been very impressed. It is a basic player but it has everything I needed. I have it hooked up using the standard a/v stereo plugs but it also features Dolby out and ColorStream video out. I guess I'll have to wait until I upgrade the rest of my system before I can use those features. Playback is great and the picture is far better than VCR or digital cable.The one problem I found with this player is the remote. The buttons are tiny and not intuitively laid out.

Sure, the remote has tiny buttons, but the navigation arrow buttons are easy to find, and once I hit the play button, I put the remote down for the rest of the movie anyway.

It makes so much sense: just look at some of the background art in this collection and you can see it. (Actually, look at the background cover art, and it looks like Japanese watercolor.) Whatever his pursuits today, Watterson has left us a decade's worth of joy. This collection is just one of several. It doesn't really matter which one you pick up: you will always be guaranteed a few hours' worth of laughter and even a couple of warm tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sad parting to a wonderful Comic","review":"I have been a loyal Calvin and Hobbes reader since I first heard about the strip, about 4 years ago.

I have read every single comic that had been put in a book collection, and this book is one of his best. I still wish he was writing Calvin and Hobbes, even if he just put out book collections and didn't do newspapers, so he wouldn't have to worry about deadlines. Anyway, for any Calvin and Hobbes fan, this book is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never a Moment Short of Joy","review":"Calvin and Hobbes is one of those series that is Thouroughly word-for-word entertaining. I always warmed up while reading this, because it's so charming and humorous. There's never a joke that doesn't hit me in my funny bones.It's a Magical World is a book with episodes from Calvin and Hobbes that span over a year. As we read, the seasons change along with the topics and moods. It's hard to pinpoint a favorite part of the book, because it's all hilarious.

It is a book made to be loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bittersweet ending...","review":"This is (I think) the last book in the Calvin & Hobbes series.

Calvin being the young boy intrigued by all which is around him, and Hobbes being the stuffed tiger toy which calvin is obbsesed with. But in all the scenes Hobbes is seen through calvins eyes as a real tiger, who he can talk too and play with. Magical World is easy to read, and therefore a good comic book to buy, after reading it once, you should not read it again for a while then come back too it, and all the comic strips seem different.

A mother, who literally, in strip after strip, throws him out the door. Throws, as in \\"child flying through the air\\".

This is the only comic strip of which I have felt compelled to purchase every single compilation book. These books are treasures.

Now thats the spirit of a good cartoonist and it comes out beautifully in all the Calvin and Hobbes books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best comic strip ever","review":"If you have never read Calvin and Hobbes you are a deprived person. Bill Waterson's imagination and twisted humor are endlessly creative. It seems like every single strip is good, and that's rare in comic strips. Really rare.

Short lines and regionals are the back bone of the rail industry and this book does a good job of documenting those lines - some of which are fallen flags. If you like railroad history, classic train equipment and photos of trains and towns in a bygone era, then you'll enjoy this book. While I prefer color photos, the all black and white shots provide a mood that fits the iron ore movements of these lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds really good","review":"I read through Amazon's reviews and on other sites and most people liked these speakers and they are higher quality than the bottom line type. They have a long warranty which says something about the quality - IMO. I'm using as stereo speakers with a 2 channel Onkyo receiver and an Onkyo CD player and also for TV and DVDs. For small speakers the sound is very good. They have a very wide frequency range and I compared with more expensive speakers and these had the same type of specs. I don't know if that actually means anything but it is a way to gauge. I used on the floor and now they are perched on 30\\" stands. Either way sound good but I prefer the stands.Bottom line is if you are looking for an upgraded smaller speaker and don't want to spend a fortune these are the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"While not the ultimate in sound (Like my thousand dollar KEF's) these little speakers are just fine for home theater use. I believe you would have spend a lot more money to get anything better. I have to disagree with the negative comment about the finish. Mine arrived just fine and the finish quality is excellent. Would I have prefered the Paradigm 7's? Sure but they are four times the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good speaker for sure!","review":"I am using these as the rear of a 5.1 system.

I get amazing depth of clarity from the music I play, though I don't think the speakers would be adequate for a more extensive system. I found the system easy to assemble. The only problem I had in selecting adequate speakers is that the actual size of the speaker boxes was not given with the Amazon speaker ads, and I had to return a larger, heavier set of speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant beat em","review":"I bought these to replace smaller Infinity satellites and after their burn in, they are perfect. After upgrading to a Yamaha RX-V765 reciever, 12awg speaker wires with banana plugs, updating my front speakers with a Dayton 3-way crossover which are run by an Audiosource AMP110, all I can say is beautiful. The clarity and fullness from these speakers enhance all my music and Blu-rays.

In this price and size range I do not think you will find a better value. The bass is very good, the mid and highs are also good but a little on the bright side. I use them on front channels for music and movies. Recommended for good price and sound quality with nice appearance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised!","review":"I read every one of the more than 200 Amazon reviews of these speakers. Apparently, there is \\"safety in numbers\\"! I bought these to replace 9 year old Energy C-3's, now deceased. The Energys' cost about four times as much as these \\"unknowns\\". But dollar for dollar and pound for pound, these little things totally blow away their predecesors! Right out of the box these are phenomenal! I do a lot of movies,mostly on Blu Ray. I have an Onkyo SR-TX 805. On movies like \\"Master and Commander\\", \\"Pearl Harbor\\" and concerts like The Eagles, Farewell One Tour from Melbourne Aust., these produce sounds I didn't know were there. Forget the so-called break-in period. These are terrific right out of the box! Buy them. You won't regret it!

It was, in fact, the tweeter, which had come off of its mounting plate and was loose inside the speaker enclosure. I couldn't see any way to reassemble this without tearing the speaker apart, so I returned the pair for a refund. I was going to order a replacement set, but now that I look through the reviews, I see that two other purchasers have reported the same problem. Seems like this is a repeated manufacturing defect. I'll look for a different brand of speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best use of a hundred dollars you could find!","review":"The BIC America DV62si bookshelf speakers are, without any doubt in my mind, the best use of a hundred (or so) dollars that you could possible find. I've owned Totems, Castles, Focals, Energy's, Soliloquy's and a host of others, but all of those are quadruple (plus) the cost of these BIC wonders. High end resolution in excellent, low end punch is also there (without getting in your face with artificial bang) and the midrange perfomrance on vocals, pianos, etc. is excellent. Basically, the overall sonic qualities exuded by these inexpensive monitors is amazing despite the price point. Binding post connections are an added plus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickin' Little Speakers","review":"I was looking for a set of speakers for my bedroom system for around $100 and took a chance on these. These little wonders far exceed their price tag. I have them hooked up to a decent Yamaha receiver and use them primarily for jazz and they are great for that. They produce a nice open sound with decent clear seperation.The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because one of the tweeters blew out (with no abuse by me). I called BIC, they told me to send the tweeter. They fixed it no charge in a few days with no questions asked.

These things are good. The soundstage is just as wide, if not wider, than I got with my Bose speakers and not only did I spend half the money, I got ten times the sound quality! The bass is good (I'm assuming you have a subwoofer) and the mids and highs are crystal clear, allowing me to hear subtleties in my music that I'd never noticed with any of my previous speakers. The BIC DV62si sound as good or better than some of my friends' high-end speakers, and when they try to show off, I can laugh at them while pointing toward the laptop I bought with the money I saved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exceeds expectations","review":"I'm no audiophile, but I definitely am a music lover and listen to a wide and diverse selection.

So as far as I am concerned, these definitely exceeded my expectations. They're solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Update on These Great Speakers","review":"I've had these for 3 days now breaking them in and they sound terrific. It's too bad they are made in China now but the quality is still there. Obviously the QC was carried over to China. Can't believe how good these sound out of the box, very detailed, and I don't see a reason to upgrade the crossovers like others have done. Can't beat this deal. Here's an update...I've had these for a good amount of time, I did modify the crossovers, and I did hear a difference as soon as I plugged them back in. They weren't as bright and the vocals seem to stand out more. The reason could also be the break in time they've had. In any case these are a great deal and sound better than more expensive brands like the Klipsch KSB 3.1's I used to own. Those cost almost 400.00 when new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design/workmanship on Lid","review":"This was on sale at my local kitchen store in a discontinued color.

I like the way it fits into the sheath and it comes out easily enough when needed. I would not use this as a primary knife in extreme conditions [survival or military]unless there was simply no other option. However, It is great for cutting rope or shaping wood items for camping or survival needs [as a last resort, when a larger knife is not available].The other good feature about this knife is that the blade is fairly straight and not curved like some Tanto knives are.

The original carafe did not have this problem, and I wish I could afford the ten day turnaround time it would likely take to return this one. But I don't, so I just keep a towel handy every time I pour coffee. If only there was a way to get an advance replacement, and some assurance that the new unit would perform as it should, but there is not. So I'm stuck with a dribbling carafe.

I've been pretty frustrated with the coffee maker itself (Cuisinart DCC-1200) and now the carafe has broken and I need to get a new one. However, how can I feel good about paying this much for a cheaply made, thin gauge glass carafe when I can buy an entirely new coffee maker for 50% more? Ultimately that's what I decided to do. I picked up theMr. Coffee FTTX95at Lowes for under $45! The carafe that came with that maker is superior to this on in every way--it has much thicker banding around the top and bottom to reinforce the glass, a better designed lid, and a more balanced feel. For those wondering, the Mr. Coffee unit makes coffee that is just as good as the more expensive Cuisinart model, and it's just as aesthetically pleasing.I used to think of Cuisinart as 'top of the line' for kitchen appliances. Not so any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaaaaaaaaay too expensive","review":"This is an excellent example of soaking the consumer. You can buy an entire coffee maker for the price of this carafe, but once you've committed to the Cuisinart coffee maker, you've got to buy their replacement carafe only because nothing else will fit.

I did not drop it or abuse it in any way. I was putting it back in the coffee maker after pouring myself a cup of coffee and viola! it cracked! All I can say is that I will never buy another Cuisinart product again EVER! I believe as others do that the glass is too thin on the replacement model. PIECE OF JUNK!!! Don't waste your money.

I'm very disappointed that Cuisnart would produce such a poorly made product. A coffee carafe designed to hold hot coffee should not break while hand washing.

We contacted the Cuisinart customer service, and they refused to acknowledge any problem, offer any apologies, or any credit to my wife who had been a loyal Cuisinart customer.

Weird.Also, the DVD faithfully reproduces all the Masterpiece crud that PBS added to its presentation, including the introductions, the \\"thanks to viewers like you\\", and the interruption of the conclusion of the show from the credits. Whereas the original had a nice musical segue into the end titles, PBS interrupts that for a commercial for the DVD.PBS did a real disservice to the show.

The scrambling of the time line is a bit confusing and the precision of the early reconstruction of the accident is hard to credit, but everything else is well done. It is easy to recognize and identify most of the characters - both the pleasant and unpleasant ones. The romance between the tycoon and the waitress is especially poignant.I am not sure I could have enjoyed it quite as much if it had been spread out over multiple episodes. It would have made it much harder to follow and would have detracted from the overall story.

Fiona seemed too selfish, I really tried to like her, but she just annoyed me (the way she was mad at Jack for not changing for her after shes forced him to marry her). The family curse seemed interesting but it got tiresome and Fiona's brothers just seemed to get in the way too much. I thought maybe the curse would play a bigger role towards the end of the book and it started to, but it all just died out. I didn't buy Fiona and Jack's love for each other either. I was more interested in Lucinda than any of the other characters. The end of the book is the worst, there was hardly any resolve, it all seemed rushed and ended too abruptly. Some people really liked this book, I just expect more from a historic romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Sound Card conflicts","review":"I bought this Modem for the name and price. I figured Creative Labs would have no problems. When I installed the modem, I immediately had trouble with my sound card. After two days of playing around with the install, I called their tech support and got in quickly. I downloaded a new driver from their web site, but it did not fix the problem only made it worse. With the old driver I was able to back out of the install. Not so with the new one. Tech Support suggested I reload Windows(95) or try to find the references to the modem in the registry and clear them out.I reloaded Windows no luck. The sound card was an ESS1868, so I put in an Ensoniq Sound Scape and still had issues. It is going back Monday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for windows, but does not work on Linux","review":"I bought this modem thinking that it was compatible with Linux since it is an ISA modem. However, I wasn't able to make it work on Linux. The reason for this is that the modem is a \\"winmodem\\". This is a modem that only works with windows 95/98/NT, etc. The drivers that come with the modem could cause problems with some sound cards so you might need to download the latest drivers form Digicom. The modem performance under windows is satisfactory. It has all the typical features of a 56K modem. So if you want a cheap but good modem and you do not care if does not work in Linux, then this modem is ok, but I you are one that has multiple operating systems in your computer I suggest you buy a modem that is not OS dependent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true PnP and horrible technical support","review":"This modem is not true PnP. After installing in a Win 98 environment, found out that the drivers are not in Win 98 and were on a CD-rom with it only (no floppy disk driver disk). So I had to install a CD-rom in the computer, loaded in the drivers, and the computer wouldn't recognize the modem. After going through the poor technical support options in the manual, I called the technical support # and after going through \\"option # hell\\", ended up being transferred to a busy signal. Today, tried twice, busy signal twice. Have never talked to a live human being at \\"Digicom\\". I'm returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: controller-less modem!","review":"Beware!

As an aspiring video maker it was a product I should have bought a long time ago.Mine is the 9v-powered model, not the AA. But it has proven well-made, light and easy to use.There's something neat about micing people with a lavaliere unit. I find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the mic and the professional touch that it brings to the taping.Being able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good audio is a remarkable experience. Another benefit of micing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise. The din of voices surrounding your interview is a typical intrusion; using the lavaliere cuts out a great deal of the unwanted sonic information."},{"rating":"2","title":"great system once adjusted","review":"I was nervous at first recording because the audio volume was too low, and I lost quality by boosting with software. I'm sure I voided my warrenty, but I opened both the receiver and tranmitter to see if I could make adjustments... there is a tiny screw labeled VR101 (trans) and VR2 (rec) that adjust pick up. I basically maxed both of them out because I'm soft spoken, but it works like a charm now. Works to reduce pickup as well, if needed. Just be careful of cheap plastic housing when opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the Price","review":"I bought this to work with my camcorder. It is not a stereo microphone, so the sound is on only one side, but since I'm usingSony Vegas 7 + DVD Production Suiteto do my video editing, it hardly matters.

I have a Sony HDR-FX1. the shoe is placed way above and to the edge of the camera so I didn't worry about camera sound getting picket up by the mic. The mic that comes with the camera never picks up zoom sound or hand movement on the camera. The ECZ-990 barely picks up the target sound. And the sound it does pick up is tinny. It DOES however pick up every little sound of the camera. You get a huge buzz when using auto zoom. And every little movement of your fingers against the camera body is picked up as a booming sound.The only use i can see for this mic is to get an extension cord and let someone hold the mic up to the target sound source. Strangely enough, the mic didn't pick up too much sound from the hand holding it.The price is low but I honestly feel like I threw away my money. Lesson learned: Only buy a mic you have personally tested yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for.","review":"I purchased this mic for my Cannon GL1 to cut out the background noise when I'm shooting my projects.

In post I have to raise the dbs to a least +10 to hear clearly what people are saying clearly. Right now I am saving my money to buy and xlr adapter and a rode ntg1.

This was the cheapest one at the time I was looking for a meat grinder, so I decided to give it a try, in spite of some of the low ratings. My mistake. There's a reason it has low ratings. I didn't mind that it took quite a bit of force to turn it, but the lead angle and thread profile of the extrusion screw is so poorly finished, about a third of the meat simply fed backwards and turned to mush instead of extruding out the front knife mechanism. Unfortunately, I threw the packaging away and therefore can't return it, but will give it away at work (the fate of many home products I no longer want) and will go get a more expensive version. Or perhaps I'll simply have the meat departments at the grocery stores do the grinding for me (probably easiest approach)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product!","review":"If I had known this product could not be returned, I wouldn't have purchased it. It is next to impossible to get it to work properly unless you are extremely strong! It would not stay fastened to the table my husband attempted to affix it to.

She thrives boundlessly on studio recordings, without the of confines and stiffness that spontaniety can sometimes bring. However, what gives this particular recording four stars is Summer's ever strong and powerful voice, never showing fatigue throughout the entire disc. And every song is instantly recognizable, even with slightly altered arrangements. The best is saved for the end with her 100% rocking version of \\"Hot Stuff\\". Donna still completely has it and even more...Hey, if anybody can add to this page what the three additional tracks on the import version of this are, I would muchly appreciate it.

My district now tells me these federal regulations are what our state uses to make determinations on their own regulations. So while this book does give information about the law (and as another reviewer stated, it can be found on the Internet for free), it does not directly address federal or state regulations, since they have not yet been created.

Sennheiser runs on uhf, I was told, and that the possibility of interference was minimal. So as soon as I can afford a Senheiser I'll go to Ebay and try to find a used one.

One of my little concerns about this mic, is that the clip to attach the microphone to people's belts or other clothes seems flimsy and I think is going to break really fast.The handheld is also made cheaply and has the feeling of a toy, but it still does the job well enough.Good purchase for the price and to have as a back up (just in case)BUT I wish I have more money to buy a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected.","review":"This wireless mic works as I expected it to.

I went with a DV camera with an external mic.I decided to purchase the Azden wireless mics after I saw a video review of the mics on YouTube. I've been using the mics for over a year now, and am very impressed with their quality. Most of my videos are shot inside in the same location, so I don't have a lot of environmental considerations to account for.I recommend these mics to anybody doing video.

Sharp sound, no interference, can be placed behind a closed door and still get through!

We needed an urgent lavalier for a project, and because for us it was uncertain just how much we'd use this type of thing, we went for the cheap option instead of the Seinheiser (however that's spelled). Well, just as many other reviewers have reported, we do get better levels than with a shotgun, but they're accompanied by terrible static that we have to later eliminate in Adobe Soundbooth (just use the \\"Eliminate Noise\\" process and voila!).Definitely NOT recommended for Pro-level work, but I guess if you're a Pro, you already knew that. If this is for occasional use and you have the CS Suite, then it might do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced Piece of Plastic","review":"This unit is priced way too high for what it is: A flimsy plastic toy. Mine arrived DOA and unfortunately I didn't have time to test it before the return period expired. I took it apart and found a loose connection on the receiver output wire. A simple solder job to repair it, but that should not have happened straight out of the box. Both of the microphones are crap - on par with the $5 Radio Shack units. The lav is very tinny and thin sounding. While the handheld sounds slightly better, the build quality is terrible and it feels like a child's toy.

They're really quick to get back to you on anything you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"First off these are actually 5 star headphones and I just wanted to rate this 1 star to get your attention. Yes, these are definitely \\"audiophile\\" grade headphones. I paired them with an Asus Xonar sound card with the on-board headphone amp. Brought me to an entirely new plateau of what music and everything else could sound like. It was really amazing.However it didn't last. To the uninitiated you are not supposed to use headphones like these all-day or other extended periods of time. I had no idea about any of this and it didn't take me but a few weeks to develop tinnitus in one ear immediately (with playing everything at reasonable volumes). Tinnitus is a permanent and irreversible form of hearing loss exhibited as a continual perception of ringing (or some other noise) of the ear. This can be extremely difficult to live with.I imagine most people buying these already know what they're doing, but if you're like me, be extremely careful with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound great, but teriible cables.","review":"I bought these to replace a pair of Dennon 2000's I had that broke, and these were a step above those. To me they sounded fantastic once they were past the burn-in period, which was about 10-20 hours or so of use. They definitely got better with use. However, the woven sheathing on the cables is a problem. It makes the cables very stiff and unwieldy, plus the black woven sheathing started coming apart in spots exposing the white batting material underneath. For such expensive headphones, the cables are quite poor, and I returned them and got a new pair. The second pair also had the same problem, and I returned them too and purchased a pair of Senheisers instead. For that reason, I do not recommend them even though I thought they sounded as good or better than the Senheiser headphones for my taste. The cables on the 2000's I had had similar cables, but the sheathing seemed to be a bit better quality, and never had the problem of coming apart like these did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn.","review":"So I bought these headphones somewhat on a whim, not sure if they would be right or not, knowing that I could return them. Well, they're awesome. Everyone I've shown them to has been blown away. Two things to note though:Listen to your music in flac! Or any other lossless audio codec. You will get the most out of these headphones this way.These headphones are a bit roomy. If you dont like your ears to swim a bit (doesn't affect sound at all) then they might not be right for you. For me, it makes it more comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Decent","review":"These Headphones deliver clear and consistent sound with Denon performance. If you are using this for your iphone or portable player, make sure to get a amplifier for them.From a stereo receiver these headphones perform nicely in a well balanced nature. The bass is present but not overwelhming and the highs are crisp without being to bright, the midrange is nice and clear.My only \\"gripe\\" is I would prefer just a little higher bass response because I love rock music and I like to feel it.But overall pretty good but pricey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"This product doesn't work.

I opened the package at home to find that the color coding on the cables was incorrect and that trial and error would be the only way to get the right connection. At their usurious price point, I find this type of defect absolutely unacceptable and furthermore I would note that the cable construction was unimpressive using a cheapish vinyl jacket on the terminations.

My favorite character was Sammie son, who was the only real man in the end. I thought Maria was a bit too involved with he girlfriend but how can you not be when you created that bond of friendship. Maria took a little too much from Sammie by allowing her into her home, causing more drama for her ownself. Shocker was Norman, Maria new boyfriend who came off as a bit too perfect but the truth of who he was finally took the life of Maria, psycho son of a gunn.

The renditions of Could You Be Loved, Living For The City and Sunshine Of Your Love are admirable, but the straight covers of Bodhisattva and Burn Down The Mission are best left to the original masters. And Luke, please, what were you thinking trying to do Elvis. Poor execution of what could have been a funny goof.

I bought it for my wife as a gift that I thought would inspire. All it did was turn her off to what she now thinks is a sport filled with a bunch of egotistical babies. Has this man ever had an adult relationship with his wives??? Peace through self-indulgence??? No wonder he has to jump from partner to partner. Physical ability without a brain or heart is truly an empty life.I recommend: The Endurance for a great adventure book.If you want climbing- The Seven Summits (you can read how well Mr. Roach gets along in here with other too!) or just about any other book ever published regarding climbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book for a donation","review":"Those are some great reviews.

Besides being the boss' son Yip Chun really tries to pass his knowledge and philosophy to the readers, unfortunately with poor results. I'm a beginner in Wing Chun and it really was a bit disappointing try to figure out some techniques, specially when the text is not in harmony with the pictures.

Try it if you spare some bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good If You want to Learn Technique","review":"Being new to Wing Chun, this seemed to be a good book to learn something about its technique as well as its historical bankground and philosophy.

Turns out the album is a collection of 80's sinth-pop, combined with a generic vocal performance. I hate myself for saying this, but I think it's little better than the Rocky IV soundtrack. Off the whole album, I'd probably just save the 13th track, Song for Al (reprise), a solid 80's rock tune. I don't find anything particularly pleasing in the rest of the album, but my least-disliked tracks are Balti Lament, Can't Make up Your Mind and Death Zone - Whiteout. Apparently this stuff is not my cup of tea. I'm happy to hear someone (the other reviewer and his family) appreciates it, I just wish I would too, since Airey is a classic keyboardist and Cozy Powell was a fantastic drummer.

This feature did not work with my standard cable box unless the box teetered off the side so its sensor was directly over the VCRs sensor (whickh is placed on the left top corner of the VCR instead of the middle).

I am fascinated with books and their history, and the background and subject matter give this book an entirely different level for enjoyment.But I have had it with the hero: Alex Plumtree who is beginning to look more and more like the world's biggest patsy. The things which happen to him, mostly brought about by people who \\"have been sworn to secrecy\\" or who \\"just want to protect him\\" boggle the imagination.

Only gripes I have are that I could have used one more audio input for the CD changer, and the remote is one big checkerboard of small buttons. You can also find more features on newer DVD player components.

When I first thumbed through this book, I was amazed at how every single feature jumped out at me. The colors used on these pieces of furniture are striking and the designs are beautiful and unique. This book offers something different than all of the rest - it does two things: first, all of the fabulous ideas get you excited and motivated. It makes you want to run right out and find something to paint. Second, each piece of furniture is so uniquely done, you cannot help but want to use your imagination and create your own works of art. Have you ever considered decoupaging tissue paper onto a table? How about napkins? It sounds unusual, but these designs work beautifully.

I can listen to Art do practically anything. However, there is a little bit of redundancy in the song selection here. Unlike earlier albums where I have favorite after favorite after favorite, some of the tracks here are a little too much alike to stand out on their own (now I'M being redundant!).

I listened to this through three times and this album can't figure out whether it wants to be completely mind-numbingly boring or come off with pop songs that remind me painfully of hits the The Partridge Family used to put out. I'd give it no stars if I could. Artie honey, please just sing and stop trying so damn hard to incorporate others into your act. I just want to hear him sing, like noone else possibly can.If you want to hear Art's phenominal voice...this is NOT the place to get it.

I've always enjoyed Art Garfunkel and now I'm anxious to hear more from Buddy Mondlock and Maia Sharp. They're both incredibly talented.I enjoy all of the songs on this album, but I think my favorites on it are Bounce, Crossing Lines, and How Did You Know. I'll tell ya. . .I'm playing this CD a whole lot more than I thought I was going to be. It's pretty addictive.Two nights ago I saw Garfunkel, Mondlock, and Sharp in concert.

At first I wasn't sure if Creative made good modems, but now I'm convinced, not only do they make good sound cards, their modems are also top-notched and resonably priced.

It definitely moves forward from the last album, and by no means harkens back to the first album.That said, I am a big fan of the band's sound and the vocals on TruANT. I have been very pleased with Up in the Attic. If the band could have penned a couple songs that rocked a little harder like some of their work on the first album, it would have made this a five-star review.

I am a tremendous fan of the band's first album and unfortunately, it doesn't seem like they could repeat the feat. Dryden Vera Mitchell's vocals are still great, but the song lyrics have become, well, stupid. Not quirky and smart like in ANThology.

However I cut the rubber off, relieving me of this issue, but now the mouth peice is a bit weird shape. It is also a little bit high pitch and like someone else said, and u need to blow a little harder than the acme ones to make enough noise. So basically I am satisfied with it, after some slight mods.I am surprised I am the first one to raise this issue, but maybe reffing in cold temp. such as a hockey rink increases aggregation, and other ppl reviewing ref soccer.Edit: after using it for a while I figured that maybe the rubber mouth piece was causing the dryness.

My stylus in fact, after two weeks of usage broke and I had to try to fix it and saw the whole inner functions of the pen. It is made all out of plastic, but not the hard good one, but instead the type of elastic, cheap plastic. I finally fixed it but i'm fully disapointed with this product.

Jacob spent three millenniums forcing other demons to comply to the rules of staying away from humans, and yet here he is bringing one home. The interplay between characters was charming to say the least. The book was fast paced and easily holds the readers interest. My only complaint was the fact that so many characters sounded interesting and Frank let so few in. Plus she opened up doors for conflict (such as with the council) and left them hanging. There could have been more way more conflict to create a more tense and interesting book.

She allows you to understand their world without getting bogged down in metaphysical detail that saps the fun out of a story. You want to like these people, you want to know them....and after some of the scenes, you want to love them!

I'm shocked that Ms. Frank created such a detailed and intricate world in her first book. She has a lot of details and history about how Demons are different yet similar to humans and introduces Druids into the book. Because this is the first book of the series, she takes her time to introduce different characters that will be geting their own books in time. I loved how the main and secondary characters are connected and how the interact with one another. I enjoyed the storyline. It was simple yet complex with new things. I loved how she took some of Christine Feehan's ideas and made them her own. I felt like this was a new concept and I really enjoyed her new world.

The story idea is great, but the author loses me with mediocre writing. I thought I was reading a high-schooler's story. The characters were not defined at all. I can understand a character changing during the course of a story, but Frank's characters changed according to her whim. The other thing that was weird was the perspective. When the heroine, Bella, is observing and thinking, suddenly Frank shifts to what another character is thinking. There's not mystery to the story that way. I was fairly disappointed.

The writing is clunky and unspeakable, the characters are two dimensional at best. The villains are vague. You have no idea about the scene since unlike other authors who kill you with description, she barely provides any. To top it off, if the sex is what you're after, you'll walk away wondering if the heroine had both of her arms on the same side of her body b/c humans just can't engage in that manner...if you know what I mean.

But I found it hard to reconcile that Jacob, the Enforcer, who has had centuries to hone his skills, had to rely on Isabella to save him not once but a few times. I don't like stories where skills appear without having been earned. For more than half the book, the story barely, moves with all the characters being angsty about what's going on in their culture. The sex descriptions are good (although he can't seem to get his fingers untangled from her hair!). I'll try Gideon (who really reminds you of Gregori from Christine Feehan's series) and see if I like it any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A yummy new series","review":"I hesitated getting this book initially, but I don't regret it now!Jacob definitely is a new premise in the paranormal even though the ideaof the paranormal as different species entirely isn't new. I was alsosceptical about this book being based on a race of nice, decent Demonkind.But I am glad to be wrong! The meeting between the protag, Jacob the enforcer and how he changes because of meeting Isabelle is a lovely crafted tale. Hopefully, future books will explain how the demon's are summoned and why their kind and the druids literally tried to wipe each other oout. I look forward to following this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another so-so, not great, story","review":"Bottom line: LoanerThis was yet another book, I really wanted to enjoy. Having never read Frank before, I was neutral.It starts off, and the two main characters sort of run into each other, fate I guess. Okay. I can believe that.But as I'm getting farther along, I'm noticing that I'm not really that captivated by the characters or the story. The book didn't have me picking it up during all hours of the day sneaking in reading, because I as the reader, was so enthralled by it.And the sex scenes were...just tepid..definitely not smokin' (which may have had more to do with lack in the character development).I'd recommend J.R. Ward, Keri Arthur (Riley series), Sunny, Kim Harrison for adventure with sex. And for mostly adventure MaryJanice Davidson, or Laurell K. Hamilton, or Patricia Briggs (Mercy series)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not disappointed","review":"I had read the Shadowdwellers and simply loved Rapture. So, I decided to jump over to her Nightwalkers. Even though Jacob came no where near Magnus in Rapture, I still was pulled into the character of Jacob. The book was a quick read meaning that I could get nothing else done while reading this book. It was a book hard to put down. I saw some others with derogatory reviews but I look at a book in which I wish to escape, have my heart beat a little faster and simply fall in love with the characters. This book did all of that and more. I cannot wait until I start with her next book in this series.

Yes, they don't differ much from all the literature out there of this type of the book.Sometimes I think that once you read one you read them all. But, the nightwalkers are very interesting in the sense of a little novelty on the old path.I enjoyed the book from beginning to end, even though on the back of my mind I knew it wasn't much different from the rest.At least not much different Alyssa's Day Atlantis type of plot. Same I see you and I will love you forever. Honestly, what happened with the seduction? If it is all set as magical match making it lacks all the seduction don't you think?Well, it is well written nonetheless. The author has style, use very good words to express feelings, the sex scenes are not the hottest, too much emotions going on, too much thoughts, honestly sometimes I think, how can they think so much as they are doing each other?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what i expected","review":"I like the works of this little know author.

Kelly touches every major Father of the Church from the Apostolic Age to the 6th century as well as many relatively minor figures from the early Church. If you want to know what the early Christians believed, I highly recommend this book to you. I caution, though, that in order to get the most out of this book you must have a thorough knowledge of the history of Christianity for the first six centuries at least. This book is already 500 pages long, so there's little time for Kelly to stop along the way to explain historical developments. The book is not even done in chronological order other than perhaps separating the Apostolic Fathers and Apologists from the later Fathers into two different sections of the book; the primary division of the book, though, is thematic.

The failure is attributable to the language which, despite 4 revisions, remained archaic, verbose and convoluted.Or am I expecting too much for the author to express in clear terms ideas of which early Christians were not even clear about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What you will never learn from the press, who fights the last war","review":"Larry Schweikart provides an inside view that civilians haven't heard from other sources.

Quick logical presentation. Easy and engaging read."},{"rating":"1","title":"chuckleheaded special pleading","review":"In Schweikart's strange view of American military history, this country never waged a war of aggression---so the War of 1812, the Mexican War, and the current debacle in Iraq have to be ignored or, in the last instance, made into a war of self-defense, despite the lack of connections between Saddam and 9/11 and Al Qaida.

Regarding American \\"victories,\\" U.S. policy went down to defeat in Vietnam, Korea, and the War of 1812. It's going down in flames in Iraq and Afghanistan.

You grasp the product by the top of the cone which is awkward and slippery, especially for someone with small hands, like me. I can only imagine how difficult it would be to keep a tight hold on it while vacuuming up a mess with weight - such as cat litter. You cannot turn the unit on/off with the same hand you're holding it with. The on/off button is at the tip of the cone, which is at your wrist while the cone is in your hand, so you need to use your other hand to operate the button. Finally, as others have written, the exhaust blows around more stuff than the unit actually picks up. I plan to return mine as well.

Sure it may look nice (and not even that nice), but all it does is blow the crumbs and dirt around before you can suck them up. I think the folks giving it such good reviews must clean without looking, or else they think it has done its job when in fact it has just blown the dirt to another part of the room.

It does a great job of cleaning up cat litter and small pieces of food and hair on the tile and the carpet in my kitchen area! I am very impressed with the look and ease of use of this product. The only drawback that I have seen since using the Kone a few months now, is that it lacks much power, so sometimes you have to go over an area several times to get everything. Plus it has to be held at the right angle to the mess to get it all up as well. BUT these are easy to overlook when I use it daily and it does just what I needed it to do! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"kone vacuum","review":"Not sure what to say about this vacuum. It seems to work well enough, but I have a difficult time holding onto it, as there is no handle of any kind. I hadn't thought it would be quite that difficult to hold while vacuuming. I ordered this after reading quite a few good reviews. It seems others did as well, and now there are more negative reviews to read. I wouldn't really recommend this vacuum. There has to be an easier to use vacuum. I actually have an old Royal handheld electric vacuum that works very well. I guess it's not as \\"cool\\", but it is more effective and much more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"packs a punch","review":"This hand held has more power than I expected and looks great in the living room.

If you want a hand vacuum, then buy something else. I, like many people, was drawn in by the unique look of this vacuum and the idea that it could actually sit out on my floor without looking like a dirty vacuum. I didn't take the time to research this at all, I just wanted it. (It's so cute darn it!) Anyways, from day 1 my husband complained about how terribly it picked up stuff, and when it did it just shot it back out in his face. I thought that surly he was just being picky. It can't that bad. But it is. It's weak, loud, and just blows everything it does pick up in your face. Waste of money. I just had to go out and shell out more money for one that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suction was great... before it stopped working","review":"Worked great, despite the air blowing out from the middle of the device. As long as you aimed it so that it didn't blow air where you were trying to vacuum, it worked. Never had a problem with the battery holding a charge either. But then one day it just stopped turning on. If I hit the power switch about fifty times, it would eventually turn on and stay on. But it's annoying to have to hit the power switch fifty times every time you want to vacuum up a little mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kone Happiness","review":"The lightess in weight that I've ever used in a hand held vac, and does the job too!

Only negative is if your hands are dry it can slip right out due to the shape. It is powerful and small enough I can leave it behind the bathroom door for a quick vacuum after dressing.

The design of this thing makes it hard to hold, it doesn't have the greatest sucking power, the tip is so round it makes it hard to get into tight spaces, and I can never put it back on its base the first time, I usually have to spend a few mins (that I don't have) trying to get this thing back on the charger.

After I ordered it, I read some complaining reviews. I was concerned. They didn't like the blowing. My son-in-law, an electrical engineer, said that anything that took in air had to have it come out. Duh! It is perfect for my uses. I keep three grandchildren. One is a two year old and makes messes, dry ceral, potatoes chips, etc. That is why I bought it and it is perfect.

The other 9 locked up my computer, or weren't even recognised by my computer as proper media! If you look online, you will see that many people have problems with these DVD's and there are message boards devoted exclusively to this product!I would not suggest these. However, I have also used Verbatim DVD+RW's extensively with no problems and would highly recommend them instead of Memorex.

I have noticed with jeans and towels, especially, that the fabric feels almost starched, it is so stiff and brittle. And the brittleness has led to very premature break down of the fabrics. I noticed that any kind of elastic in my clothes, or clothing with spandex in it, became lax and is essentially ruined.

Compared to some of the other non-green detergents, it doesn't clean as well or as thoroughly, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. My major caveat comes from the cap that it comes with - it has very faint marking lines inside showing how much to use - the typical user might fill the entire cap without ever noticing the lines. However, if you're doing that, you are using far, far too much detergent. I don't like things that make me use too much detergent (thereby increasing my cost per load significantly). It should do a better job on whites, which I find still need some bleach to get really clean and eliminate small stains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget Jones meets Sex and the City!","review":"I read this book because I saw it recommended in Zink Magazine and on a couple blogs.

It was in the non-fiction section, but in the small type behind the title page, it said that certain situations were altered for dramatic effect, so it's hard to know what was really true.

I tried shoving the two back together but only ended up causing more damage to the telesoping section. I eventually managed to mate the two and wrapped it generously in electrical tape --- sexy. I will say that I noticed an increase in reception right away - but I have a sad, crooked antenna that I doubt will stay together very long.

David MacAulay's book titled Pyramid would be a much better use of time. MacAulay's book is full of detailed drawings that a child could sit and ponder - good for their attention span. For literature I would recommend Jill Rubalcaba's A Place in the Sun and Eloise Jarvis McGraw's The Golden Goblet.

This book is similar in tone and style to Caucasia by Danzy Senna and Falling Leaves, which tell of difficult childhood and teenage years, but is not as good as either of them. I found it difficult to read. The author seemed to only scratch the surface of some of the real issues and characters/people in her life.

However, it is definitely missing something, probably more insight into the relationship between the author and her family. We understand that she invents a fantasy life, but I would think she would have a little more insight into how her position in the family impacted her on a deeper level.

It is more about the life of a woman that had to struggle for her independance and the way she survived her youth, college life, and becoming content with who she is. I guess it could have been based a little more on life with her sister, but maybe that was not Ms. Fox's intention in the first place. All in all, the writing in this was great, it made you smile, it made you sad. It was a nice, relaxing book. The characters were bright and so real. I highly recommend this book as a nice, easy, read with a lot of insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out funny, but it quickly went downhill","review":"This book started out funny (with Lonnie's fear of toast) and quickly went down from there. Instead of being a book about her crazy sister, we ended up being fed a bit of her own personal neurosis and details of her first sexual encounter. To be honest, that's not why I bought the book, but I grudgingly read on hoping that the book would get better. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"worth what i paid...","review":"...and i got the book for free. I thought the book sounded interesting, like it would be more about the relationship between the 2 sisters, or maybe an interesting character study into the mind. Instead what i got was a totally dysfunctional family with an overbearing father and a doormat mother who are too wrapped up in themselves to really deal with a special needs kid (the only person in this story that really gets pushed aside and you feel truely bad for). Lorna's tale is more about herself and learning her place in this world, which i'm not sure she ever does. The writing is self centered and paints the writer as completely neurotic and probably in need of professional help as much as her sister (who is absent from about half of the book). An OK read but pretty disappointing overall considering it could have been a whole lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with Channel Plus 3025","review":"Doesn't work as advertised.

You can see it starting with the no-tangle thick power cord to the switches in the handle. Balance and shape is perfect and performance is amazing. The biggest disappointment is that I paid for the Ferrari name. I am a F1 Ferrari fan and because this product is licensed by Ferrari and the motor was designed by Ferrari it caught my eye. The box this hairdryer comes in has Ferrari's logo all over it; no mistake that this is a Ferrari hairdryer. Once you take it out of the box you'll notice not one mention of Ferrari anywhere on it. There is a little Italian flag on it and that's it.

This book was more suspenseful than most \\"mystery/suspense\\" novels found at airports and booksellers, and the sex scenes are not only well done but develop the story. My enjoyment was slightly puzzling, however, because I found the lead character, John Anderson, someone who hopefully would get brought down a peg or two. I found myself liking the secondary characters better than the \\"hero.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Crima and Passion an awkward mix","review":"Deadly Affairs is the second book in a new imprint by Virgin called Crime and Passion. Virgin is famous for the famous Black Lace series of erotica. The point of the new imprint is to mix erotica with crime fiction. Too bad it doesn't work. The \\"sexy bits\\" seem like they were just added to fulfill guidelines (erotica must have 50% sex scenes). The story itself is okay, not a very complicated mystery at all. A womanizing executive is killed and the hero, John Anderson finds out that there are many people with a reason to kill. The sex scenes are well written, but they add nothing to the book except to make it a bit naughty. I won't even go into the cold, controling \\"hero\\" or the slutty female executive or the sexually repressed diviorcee. Too cliched to bother with. Hopefully as the imprint grows, the books will get better. I think mysteries can be very sexy.

Reading about her perspective that women want to be wanted rather than fully know was right on target for me and because of the new found perspective, I felt released from the need of \\"wanting to be wanted.\\" I resist some of her claims as to WHY women do this - from my point of view, she spends a little too much time blaming society, culture, men. I think the WHY is important to know, but I wanted to see the book focus a bit more on what women can DO about it. In general, the book more than serves its purpose to raise the issue and bring awareness to it.

However, the look and feel of this Bender Method Pilates DVD left me wishing I would have never wasted my money. The music is awful, the direction is awful, and the workout is pointless.

Radio Shack had never heard of \\"HA\\".

It is NOT one of the very best - far from it. To wit: Patrizia Ciofi gives one the constant impression that she is wrestling (with her facial expression) in order to produce all of her singing notes, by the time it gets to the higher notes her face is so distorted, as if she is about to suffer a brain-struck. Her head is continuously tilted sideways and her face becomes asymmetrically - this is frightening to watch. A good singer she is indeed - but what's the gain here at the age of DVD and Blu-ray...? Awfully wrong.Ad to it the stupid staging that serves no purpose and you end with a DVD that you can do without. If you must have this opera take the other one, with Dassi."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the best possible","review":"While this performance is great and probably the best available, with Florez singing Ah mes amis twice, his performance in London with Dessay was better, due to her superb singing and better staging. It is a crying shame that Decca cannot or will not bring out the very best of his performances since they need to be preserved for posterity. Decca controls what comes out since he has an exclusive contract with them and they are the doorkeeper to his recordings. I believe that almost all live performances are taped and all Decca would have to do is to use the London performance tape and issue a version with Dessay. But whether Decca feels any obligation to art and to posterity is not certain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another splendid Florez show","review":"Many reviewers have mentioned that the stars of this production sing their hearts out and I totally agree. I have never worried too much about productions and whether the producers are coherent in their ideas regarding the staging (One example is the Netrebko/Villazon Salzburg Traviata). This Donizetti opera is fantastic from start to finish and well worth buying and watching over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurrah !

Instead the book took regular yoga poses, which you learn in any basic yoga class, and applied them to golf.Now there is nothing inherently wrong with that - its just that I expected something really focused on golfers - maybe my expectations were too high?I would recommend this book to people who have no concept of Yoga and need some flexibility and general physical conditioning improvement.However if you are an active person and have the possibility of attending Yoga classes then do that instead.

I ordered my copy of Improve Your Golf With Yoga Techniques and soon after began their program. The positive results came about rather quickly. When it came time to make a golf shot, the yoga techniques allowed me to relax and remain focused. I am encouraged that my performance on the golf course will improve even more as I continue practicing the procedures described in the book. The book is written clearly and the exercises are easy to follow. Not only has my golf game improved, but it has inspired me to take a yoga class for a better understanding of the techniques.

Anyone telling you that it would fit is wrong !I defy anyone to show me how it would fit. I am not speaking of installation. There is a nice video on You Tube about the installation. Installation in terms of twisting it onto the arm is easily understood. The problem is the adpater clips make it IMPOSSIBLE to install the ANCO 31-10. It does not have the right adapters.I want my money back and hope that Amazon does the right thing and refunds me for this. It is their fault.

But good old Amazon has several to choose from. So let me say it does fit but it isn't easy. You have to fool around with it and turn it the right way to get it on the hook. And you don't need to remove the pin from the blade arm to do it. You just need to twist it through the arm the right way and wrestle with it a bit. But the payoff is you saved $12 bucks.

(thats about the best word to describe this book)I absolutely loved it! The way she recounted her childhood so clearly is fabulous and extremely interesting! She really points out all the hard work it took to get to the top. I especially liked how it, with such detail, describes how she felt about Desi Arnaz. Her love for him shines through in her words. Also, how she spoke about her wish for children made me cry with happiness when she became pregnant with little Lucie, and then Desi Jr.! The divorce with Desi was hard for me to read and grasp. It seemed she really wanted to work things out, but it's disheartening when she tells about her hatred toward him in the end. I think deep down she would have dedicated a lot of time to reconciliation, because love obviously still settled in the bottom of her heart, and his.

Never before has a book been written in her own words. It was enjoyable as well as sad and brought forth the emotion in a clear way that was really Lucy. I Love Lucy is the Best show ever created for television and Lucille Ball is the Best Actress. I learned things about her show I never knew and things about her. From the Whirlwind Romance to the Hardest Times, this book is top notch reading for anyone who \\"Love's Lucy\\"!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other bios","review":"Of the 4 Lucy bios I have read, this one is by far the least enlightening.

Not sure if this is correct, but she was thinking, and thinking deeply.I see the book as a success, therefore. If it can grab a young mind, offer a literary journey, and provoke thought - why not.My daughter reads a lot, so I feel is a strong reader for her age. She is 9 so enjoys such genres of literature. So, judge accordingly.

I think the solution to our pollution problems is definitely electric cars, but I found this movie to be extremely bias and provide little useful information. I would suggest to anyone that is interested to read \\"The Car that Could\\" by Micheal Shnayerson. It gives the full story of GM producing the EV1 and the challenges they faced. Once again I would love fully electric cars to be available in the market today but I believe this movie did not confront the subject with objectivity.

When it came out, only a handful of people actually backed it up and leased one. They proved that they had the ability to make an electric car, but it was waaaay too expensive for them to ever support such a low-production vehicle.If they actually allowed people to buy out these cars, no matter what the contract, someone would have found a way to sue GM into giving them maintenance and support.

Nobody bought the electric car. Car companies were forced by the government of California to manufacture electric cars, which ended up cluttering the car lots because nobody was buying them.2. It takes at least half an hour to charge an electric car sufficiently to travel just a few miles. It takes four to six hours to charge an electric car enough to travel 120 miles.3. Most environmentalists were eager for hydrogen energy to become widespread... until President George W. Bush endorsed hydrogen in his 2003 State of the Union address. Not surprisingly, now hydrogen is suddenly part of Teh Ebil Big Oil Conspiracy.4. Where do they imagine the electricity these cars get charged with comes from? It's generated by power plants, many of which get their energy from... oil.Sorry, but there is no Big Oil conspiracy against the electric car, any more than there was one against the Edsel."},{"rating":"2","title":"General Motors Blew It!","review":"The film reminded me about another movie, \\"Tucker, the Man and His Dream\\" which also tells of a better car that was pushed off the market by those who want \\"free enterprise\\" but only for themselves, not their would-be competitors.In our capitalist system, General Motors is, like any other publicly-held corporation, supposed to be in business to make money for its stockholders. In killing the EV-1, General Motors put the interests of the oil companies ahead of its shareholders. Less than a year ago, before the current spike in oil prices, GM's stock was over $35 a share. Today it is at $10. If GM had kept making EV-1 for those people who wanted them, they would have owned the automobile market today and their stock price would be through the roof! Talk about short-sightedness."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Promise of a Better Tomorrow... crushed by big oil and the auto makers","review":"This is a great documentary that shows what progress and innovation can bring when big companies work for a better tomorrow, and how they will stop at nothing to destroy that progress when it threatens their money and power.Living outside of California, I had no idea that these cars were used on such a large scale.What a great impact these cars could have had on reducing our need for foreign oil and reduced smog pollution, if only the auto makers and big oil hadn't successfully killed it all. Keep betting on people buying gas-guzzling SUVs, see how well that works as gas passes $4 a gallon.GM is probably regretting not expanding the EV program, but big oil is still laughing all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Informative","review":"This film has never been more relevant than it is now.

The truth is that we started out with electric cars 100 years ago, but the big oil companies perceived the electric car as a threat and got rid of it.

The electric cars were quite popular a decade ago but are now non-existent, this explains why. There were less breakdowns in the electric car and of course no gasoline. The result was that GM could not have people driving around in reliable transportation, where would they make money on repairs? The other factor is oil companies, with no legitimate competitor they could do whatever they wanted and have. Strange that the owners (or leasees since they were not for sale) were not allowed to keep their cars after the California law was repealed.

This tale should please everybody: It's a love story -- I laughed, I cried. It's a who-done-it mystery. It's about a car that was a real kick in the pants to drive.Oh, there are a few that won't like it -- they don't like the fact that it didn't use any fossil fuels.EVs may not be for everybody -- but the ones that were created *SHOULD* have been allowed to be driven and not taken back forcably and then crushed.GM wonders why it's going bankrupt and Toyota is making money hand-over fist? Toyota didn't allow a market setting product to wither on the vine -- it supported the Prius' slow start and now it's reaping the benefits from that investment. GM could have had that with the massive lead it had in EVs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little expose'","review":"I worked for Saturn during this time as a salesman and didn't even know they sold electric cars or saw one.

The shutdown of the EV1 project now looks to be a huge lost opportunity for GM. Imagine the demand now if these cars were available all over the country. The movie gives evidence that GM placed all their bets on the short-term profits of the SUV/Hummer market over the long-term wisdom of the electric car. Let's just hope that the US auto industry can use the talents and creativity of their employees to produce non-gas burning alternative vehicles that could be sold all over the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent documentary","review":"This is an eye-opener. The argument is that there was no demand for the electric car, but as a hybrid driver (Prius), I seem to recall the same mantra when they were first introduced. Our Prius is the most trouble-free vehicle we have ever driven. It is small, but comfortable. We have no problem keeping up with traffic when entering or exiting freeways. I hold the car manufacturers and government responsible for causing our auto industry to lose out to Toyota. I include the government because government subsidies went to develop diesel engines instead of supporting the electric car. If the e-car had remained in the market, GM would be realizing the same sales as Toyota now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required in school","review":"If you always thought capitalism was the answer for the world's problems, watch this movie. It's devastating, and proves that big business controls what Americans will buy whether or not it's what they want.

Interviews with activists, auto reps, and CARB chairman Alan C. Lloyd leave no question about who killed the program and why, but it still rankles to follow Paine as he puts all the myriad pieces together.

When the laws of physics and the demands of the marketplace won't bend to your green will then scrap the car and start over. That is why the Electric car died and not due to some oil conspiracy. This is yet another brain dead conspiracy theory film.

I was never aware of the speeds that the electric car could attain and that on a single charge it could go at least 70 miles. It is a very practical unit for city driving but you would need something that would last a bit longer for long trips. The people that owned these cars seemed to have a lot of fun driving them.The premise of the film is that the oil companies put pressure on government officials to doom the original electric car. It seems like nobody in the government cares about global warming, pollution and protecting the environment.

In fact, the announcement of the EV1 actually prompted CARB to include the requirement for an electric car in their next set of rules. In addition, GM continued to promote the EV1 *after* CARB gave in and removed the electric car requirement.So why did GMT kill the electric car? It's more mysterious than ever.

We home school and this was hands-on science at its best--lots of fun, unlike labs where you just watch pill bugs who (for whatever reason) don't behave the way they are \\"supposed to\\" for the experiment, etc. These projects produce results and better yet teach at the same time. Kids (and parents) will find reasons to learn more about chemistry, physics, etc. And, it will be fun as the research will again have hands-on applications. The projects make you feel like you are Benjamin Franklin in the thunderstorm with your kite and key...(for a correction on that historical event, check out a history book)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper in supermarkets","review":"This is a great fruit soda, will surprise you if you are used to artificially flavored junk.BUT... It's much cheaper in supermarkets. Trader Joe's, as noted above, sells it for under $3 in a four-pack.There also exists an all-natural version without the preservative or artificial colors, that is sold in Whole Foods. Side by side it tastes a little better, but is more expensive. I prefer it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic soda, great taste, just needs a little more fizz for me.","review":"I tried this for the first time recently and found it to be simply fantastic. Ever since the early 1990's I have looked for a replacement for my old standby, black cherry flavored Clearly Canadian that has long since disappeared. This is by far the closest I have found and in the flavor department, this stuff is much better; no lack of cherry here. The only wish I have is that it had a little more fizz. While it is a little pricey here, the cost does include shipping, which is undoubtedly expensive for such a heavy and bulky item. For those of us without a Trader Joe's around, this is a great way to get your hands on this wonderful drink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Address Book","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my boyfriend who wanted to get organized. This is the perfect address book for a guy - it's leather and it has cool pictures of vintage Harleys. It holds many addresses and it's a good size (not too big, not too small)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"I highly recommend this album. It has touches of hard rock and electronica that make it distinctive. There are some bitter sweet love songs, like \\"The Great Big Burn\\". It also has more uptempo song like \\"Funch\\" and \\"It's Coming After\\", featuring the late, great, Layne Staley. The album liberally uses audio samples that keep things interesting. Second Coming's follow up and major label debut featured a different singer and a more traditional metal sound. It really wasn't the same band after this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Organized","review":"This is one of the most poorly laid out language books I have studied from. First of all, I would like to state that languages are not my forte and I am not a natural at linguistics. Vietnamese is the fifth language I have studied and this book has made it most frustrating. The vocabulary is scattered all over each chapter rather than concisely at the beginning or end like better organized books. The glossary often does not have words the reader is looking for when they have forgotten them chapters later. There are also a few typographical errors in the answer key which further confuse the student.Also, table of contents only lists the titles of the chapters and does not list subtopics or chapter objectives. So if the student wants to reference a certain language point, he/she has to remember which chapter it was from then comb the chapter to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colloquial Vietnamese 2 CD set","review":"This CD course NECESSITATES the accompanying book, but they are not sold together as a single product. I have the Cambodian version and found it very good as a continuation after learning basic Khmer by other methods. I still chased down the book online though to maximize the benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book plus cassette seems a good idea, but is too hard.","review":"I'm trying to learn Vietnamese and have made several attempts to use this book plus the cassette. I usually learn languages rapidly, and I'm also an ESOL teacher. I would expect a Vietnamese speaker to be able to have a simple conversation after an 18-week course. Unfortunately, this book expects an English speaker to do this in Vietnamese after two lessons!Vietnamese is very different from English, so a slow approach is needed with plenty of repetition and simple exercises.The book and cassette are well produced, but they do not show an understanding of how languages are learnt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a second course of study only","review":"For a true beginner this course is not truly user-friendly. I have been to Viet Nam and was married to a native in Ho Chi Minh City. This series did nothing to prepare me to communicate in the language. The tonal system is not explained, practiced, or heard in the attempts given. Vietnamese without true tonal understanding is unintelligible. The audio version leaps into full conversation with little to no preparation. It was necessary to take another course in a classroom type setting to understand what this series was trying to get across. The book is fine, but one would need a native speaker to record the lessons in lieu of the audio portion."},{"rating":"1","title":"too difficult to hear pronunciations","review":"I have bought this book with 2 CDs and I found that this book is good if you have good ears. The people on the CDs speak too fast and it is very difficult to be able to repeat the correct pronunciations. Although it is a good book if you have more than enough time and more than enough patience to learn Vietnamese when using this book, it's not a very practical book if you want to learn just the basics when having a conversation when speaking witha Vietnamese speaker. I don't suggest buying this unless you are absolutely stranded and do not have a choice of selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate content","review":"I'm using this book and tapes/CDs under the guidance of a language instructor in a one-on-one situation and I find it woefully lacking. Both the content and the pace of introduction of new vocabulary are inappropriate. Why would one expect to be speaking with a diplomat in the second lesson of a language instruction series? There is no model for pronunciation at the start of the CD/tapes other than a very quick series of vowel sounds that are far too quickly presented and inadequately explained. I've asked my language lesson provider to find a different text to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor picture quality, hard to focus","review":"Vertical lines and noise in anything but bright outdoorsunlight.

Seeing how this book is by Rasputin's daughter, i figured it may offer a new light about him that had not been shown in other books i have read. Unfortunately, this went to the extreme and I found this book to be a completely one-sided account of this man. Perhaps some of what was said is true, and maybe he is not as bad as other sources have made him out to be, but according to this book, he did no wrong, and much wrong was done to him. Overall, i was very unimpressed with this book and feel that there are many great books available about this subject, and this is not one worth spending time reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, easy to use, reliable","review":"Plug it in and it works.It was cheap.It works great.It is optical!I bought this mouse to use with my laptop.

Though I liked Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea, Farewell to Arms seemed rather boring. It gives a realistic and fairly hopeless view of war, revealing of Hemingway's own experiences. The soldier and the nurse's love affair is also autobiographical, but somehow has an unrealistic quality. Maybe I just don't like the nurse's characther, disregarding her own identity. The action is pretty slow and though the ending is foreshadowed, it felt more like a chopping off of a story than a closing. Overall, some interesting themes and classic messages about human nature, but a slow and terse writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better at Describing the Problem than Providing the Solution","review":"Anderson provides an easy-to-read book here, giving anyone who has an overloaded, exhausting schedule sympathy and understanding. He describes the problems of emotional exhaustion very well, whetting the appetite of the reader for answers. Sadly, in the second half of the book on recovery he doesn't provide them well. He describes solitude, prayer, the Bible, spiritual direction, sorrow and joy as traits a person should have to recover from and to avoid emotional exhaustion, but doesn't relate them to one another. He also shows the reader where he needs to be, but does very little to help him get there.I've read much better books on emotional/spiritual exhaustion. Unless you are a fan of the author, I'd encourage you to pass on this one. The title is catchy, but it is all downhill from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tav's \\"sparks\\" die down","review":"Tav is a writer but not a poet! the book is like a taggled web poetry. that he shook up and prayed to his \\"higher power\\" to let it work out! i'm quite disapointed that this is his \\"vitage\\" work. it makes me wonder was he that desperate to put another book out there he dug deep into his journels and pulled out this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Worked just as i expected, a typical router priced right.

The whole neighborhood came over (practically) when word got out that I got the DVD for my sons. We love Olivia's expressions and ear movements, and she's a great cartoon role model. This is a very clever, funny selection of episodes, highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughter LOVES it, and you can skip the commercials","review":"My 2 and a half year old loves this DVD. She has had the original Olivia book, and we've read it to her since she was very young, so perhaps that's part of the reason she's so into this movie. If she has a choice, this is the DVD she picks to watch.There are \\"commercials\\" for other Nick shows at the beginning of the DVD. You can't go straight to the menu; however, if you press the Next Chapter button 5 or 6 times, it will very quickly skip right through all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Olivia, hate the opening commercials","review":"We bought this to keep our toddler occupied on a long plane trip, and we love the TV show.

It's true that we don't use or recommend his exact tools but a large part of learning about how to network is adopting the mentality of recognizing the opportunities, and of recognizing reciprocity.

This album is an interesting hybrid of various pop strains at the time ('67/68). Great to hear Jimmy Page playing more pop (just for contrast!), and songs by the kinda forgotten but good Brian Nicolls. A little bit top heavy with production at times, but it is INTERESTING production/arrangement I think. In the end, she comes across here almost like a lower voiced, somewhat sultrier & 'transatlantic' Jackie deShannon. That's fine with me-- and the inclusion of fine 'cool pop' version of Richard Farina's \\"Hard Lovin' Loser\\" almost makes the album worthwhile on its own. Great '60's stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what it should be","review":"I ordered this as a replacement battery for my Sharp Zaurus SL-5500.

Its great, nice GUI (VERY user friendly, take it from someone who's used Windows all 17 years of her life and only just switched to Mac). However, I'd always notice that the macbook was REALLY hot - and so was the power adapter. Although it was extremely powerful and never really crashed on me, turns out, this came at the cost of the adapter. After one year of continuous use, the cord of the adapter (not the removable part, the part that connects the macbook to the actual item) melts on you. It would be fine if it was an isolated case, but it seems as if a lot of users have been having the same problem (check out the macbook forums). So keep in mind that after a year, your laptop will stop being useful until you get a new adapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap; didn't last long under normal use","review":"After a little over a year, my power cord died. $80 for a replacement seems a little steep.

But, there just wasn't enough examples or enough information in this book. I don't feel like I am any closer to starting to trade options. I have so many questions and this book did not answer any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Surprise","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book but it was recommended to me by a friend so I ordered it. When I got it, my first thought was\\"Wow. Short book is right.\\" But don't let its length fool you. It is for people new to options and it's a very condensed volume of information that focuses on covered calls and touches on a few variations of them. It starts out with an overview of options and gives good easy to understand examples. It then moves into buying and selling options and finally focuses on covered call writing. It gives very good examples of various trades and the affects of yields and volatility.You can use this book to get started on covered call writing with good confidence. I really liked this book a lot because it was very focused on teaching one very effective and conservative options strategy instead of trying to teach several confusing strategies all at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"HA HA HA","review":"I see that you guys are not selling as much these days??

Naw, that couldn't be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An epic of two girls and the Russia they both love.","review":"This is the first, and in my opinion, best book in the Russians series, which tells the story of the aristocratic Fedorcenkos, the humble Burenins, and their homeland as revolts and war assail it.The Burenins' poverty forces their daughter Anna to go to St. Petersburg and work on the vast Fedorcenko estate. Soon, she becomes personal maid to the Princess Katrina Fedorcenko. Though the shy, selfless maid and bold, willful princess are opposites, they become close friends, and as Anna learns the ways of the aristocracy, her faith slowly changes the fiery Katrina. But revolution and war loom darkly over Russia, and both watch helplessly as war erupts in their beloved Motherland.This is an excellent book in a good series, and it contains a wealth of information about Russia. The characters are vividly lifelike and the story is captivating in spite of a few slow places. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only a saga of a family, but of a country as well","review":"I am a 17 yr old boy who was not interested at all in this series for years after we got it. My mom and sister read them but I thought that they were just fictions about a girl. Then I read the first one out of curiosity. These books take you through the Russian Revelution through the eyes of an aristocrat, a servant, a revolutionary, a political prisoner, and a peasant (serf) family. If you have ever wanted to know more about russia's history or how their government worked, or if you want to hear the diferent opinions on revolution against a tyranical government, or if you just want a good story about a serf girl with no future who is risen to a position that is beyond her imagination, read these books. And Please--- read them in order, they have such an interlocking plot that you would ruin your enjoyment if you read ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best series I've read!","review":"The writing in this series is phenomenal!

I had to cram for the AP the weekend before and this book was a tremendous help. I read the other review and it said that the multiple choice in the Princeton Review was harder than on the AP, but I beg to differ. I thought that the Princeton Review practice tests were easier than the real thing, but the information in the book was very good to study. All Princeton Review books are great and they are the best to choose from. They are especially good with the SAT's and are not as boring as most others. They are written in a more casual language rather than the tedious and boring style of something like Barron's. Overall, I highly recommend this book and I suggest that past tests are purchased from the college board to prepare for the AP if you want to get a guaranteed 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Audio, Nice Cord","review":"Bought this at Radio Shack a while back, liked the look of it and I like how it fits in my hand, but it just has poor (muffled) sounding audio, as tried on several different radios.Not really a loss though, I took the nice mike cord off and used it to fix another mike.

However, I dislike misreprensation which the title of this book is.

I honestly loved this hilarious, entertaining read. I often find many of the Oprah Book Club and NY Times Bestsellers, painfully slow, boring and unable to hold my attention span. Any Woman's Blues, was impossible for me to put down even for one second.Simply put, if the award winning novels, Snow Falling on Cedars and the DaVinchi Code temporarily cured your insomnia and you still can't figure out why everyone lists those titles as their favorite books, then I highly recommend this witty, vibrant, and honest novel. A perfect lying on the beach/vacation read for any woman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jong Makes Me Smile Again","review":"I've read this book several times over the last ten years. I adore her decriptions of her lust of men, sex, & love. Her prose is shockingly graphic, yet soft. After first reading this years back, I knew I'd never look at a man on a bike (motorcycle) the same way again. <grin>I won't give a summary of the book- amazon does that already. But pick it up @ your local bookstore & start with the first page. My guess is that you'll eagerly buy it & find it hard to put down.It's great reading such liberating literature. Such fun to delve into her naughtiness.Try this timeless erotic tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"There is some intelligence and a few flashes of insight here but on the whole, Jong has created a thin world that revolves around implausible sex. There is something excessive and fantasy-driven and predictable about the way the main character portrays her relationship with the younger man, as well as her portrayal of subsequent liaisons towards the end of the book. I had heard so much about FEAR OF FLYING but thought I would read the less-famous work first. Now, I am less inclined to read FEAR OF FLYING. This should have been an in-depth look at one woman's obsession, an intelligent treatment of lust and sex, but it was simply vacuous. It reminded me of Joan Collins with a bit of an effort at \`social observation.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"Are we talking about the same cd? This cd is not what I expected. It was somewhat slow and boring. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate and am actually into slow, melodic, seductive music, but this cd just did not seem to go anywhere.

And don't let the names of the remixers fool you on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMHO- 3 stars","review":"This disk has some rare gems and some not so great tracks, like most remix compilations.

Jimmy Coates is as good as Cherub and Jason Steed. It's better than Alex Rider. It does not copy James Bond, although Jimmy is called James and Jimmy for short. The story is original, mature but easy to read.One of my favorite books. I don't know why the series is over looked compared to Alex Rider, because its a much better series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Smith's Journal?","review":"This book was well written and documented. It has much historical and spiritual value. My disappointment in the book was that it did not contain the contents of Anne Smith's Journal as a whole. It is an editorialized document written about Anne Smith's Journal, much in the form of a term paper. I did enjoy reading the excerpts from her journal and would have liked to read it for myself. One gets the sense of who and what Anne Smith was from this book, however the total effect is broken up by the many outside points and notations. I would like to see a copy of the original journal as a part of this book. I think that this would complete the work. I understand that the journal by itself is not a complete document. The combination of the two would be a excellant resource for spiritual growth and AA history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie, backpack, and Freddie the Frog","review":"This is a nicely made doll by Fisher Price.

The scripts that the book came with sounded like your typical telemarketer. (The boring type you usually hang up on) The tips were also nothing special: things like saying \\"thank-you\\" after calls. There are also very hard to believe statistics thrown scattered throughout the book. Example: \\"it is not unusual to see 5%, 10%, and even 30% response rates\\" in regards to e-mail marketing.The (very) few nuggets in the book are scattered around without any real organization.Find something else.

Im from South Los Angeles, born and raised here on Hyde Park and 10th ave. I been from the Rollin 60's since I was 10 years old and im 25 now. Definately has to check the source. He mentions a few of my big homies in the book, I asked around and cuz name definately is well respected. This is an inside look on how we live and grow up. A must read for anybody who wants to see how we live and those who considering being a part of this foolishness. Come see how we live before you judge us. Reading these reviews disgust me.

This book leaves you wanting to know more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside the Crips","review":"This book is by and large a terrible read. The editing is poor and the story suffers from it. The book is hard to read, do to the inability of the author or the editors to maintain the characters identities. For instance Monster Kody the author of his own auto-biography is refered to as Big Buster, Monster Ken and Monster Kody. Sometimes various gang monikors applied to a single character appear in consecutive paragraphs leaving the reader confused forcing you to scramble back and verify that you have not missed a sentence or two. The same occurs when the identity of Huckabuck from the Rollin 60s is merged with a character of the same name from Harlem 30s. When Huckabuck is discussed and later dies, the reader is not informed which of the two characters we are reading about. I would suggest buying this book at a discounted price or check it out of the library but don't waste your money buying it at full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"Wish i could say more, but i just started reading it.

When I installed the combiner I immediately noticed a degraded signal especially from the cable box. The picture from the cable box signal was especially snowy. I tried several fixes to clean the signal but nothing worked. I removed the combiner and installed a switch and the signal from both sources is much cleaner (no snow) -but now I have to get up, walk over to the TV and slide the switch when I want to change from local HD channels to the cable box channels. I did not evaluate the splitting function of this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Combiner does not work!","review":"I read the good reviews and though it would work for me to combine signals from two antennas.

It is amazing to me that this stuff still has an audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Proved Him Right","review":"It's funny how some negative reviews of this book spoke about how wrong Greider was and how right corporate superheros like Jack Welch were. Now in 2003 as America struggles to rebuild after the savage [things] that these corporate overlords have done (Enron? Worldcom? Global Crossing?) we see just how accurate Greider's predications were. The men who rose to power in the 1990's didn't get there because they loved all humanity, they got there because they wanted power above all else. It wasn't the job or the love for their products, it was for money. If they had to fire tens of thouands of people, if they had to bankrupt the company, that was fine. THEY got to keep their millions in the form of Golden Parachutes. History has now born this simple truth out.

A week later they said \\"Oh, we are out of the dinner plates and didn't know if they would get anymore.\\" They said I could get 4 Square plates or return the order for a refund. Christmas had already come and gone and no packing material left, so I had to settle for square plates. The sensible thing would have been to notify the customer before sending anything.

The sound quality is better now (more bass, and all). At the risk of being accused of heresy, I shall also state that I prefer the newer version of Alice's Restaurant -- more solid performance, fewer glitches, etc. But with at least two other tunes, Ring-Around-A-Rosy Rag and The Motorcycle Song, something is lacking now -- or is it just nostalgia? It's hard to judge whether you, the average listener, would prefer the 30th anniversary edition, or the 1967 original.

The warm-up consists of different sets of sun salutations that stretch and wake up the body before engaging in continuous standing and sitting poses. The approach is clinical and straightforward with full focus on the physical instructions. Unlike Alan Finger's videos, there is no constant reminder that the student should not exert beyond what s/he can do. It is assumed from the start that the viewer will not push her/himself beyond what s/he can. However, Tracey Rich and Ganga White provide options to both the flexible and not-so-flexible. As the video title states, this is a flow of postures that awaken the body, resulting to more refreshed and strengthened muscles all over. The savasana portion is also great; the video allows for around ten minutes of entire relaxation with only the soothing background music accompanying it. If you're a beginner looking for a mid-level hatha yoga practice, this is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vinyasa Flow Workout!","review":"I had been taking vinyasa flow classes for almost two years, and then I realized how expensive it was getting. I've tried other yoga tapes (Rodney Yee, etc), but this workout was most like my classes...in terms of level of difficulty, and focus. It's a great supplement for when you can't fork over the $15/class. I agree with the previous reviewer who said the poses aren't held long enough, but that's my only complaint. The instructor's voice is soothing, and not annoying. The background music is not cheesy either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Video for Beginners","review":"For years, I've been recommending either Total Yoga (1992) or Rodney Yee's Power Yoga - Stamina Version. Now that Tracey Rich and Ganga White have put out the three Flow Series tapes, I now recommend the Water version of the Flow Series to beginners in decent shape. If you are over weight, have old injuries, or haven't exercised in decades, then get the first level tape - Earth. But for most people just looking to get started in a flowing yoga style, nothing beats this Water tape. It's forty-five minutes of a safe, well-rounded program. If you want a 20-minute, not as well-rounded program, then get the Stamina Version of Rodney Yee's Power Yoga. I am so glad these two finally made more tapes. I just wish they'd hurry up and get the whole thing on DVD. Anyway, if you want more of a challenge and like to sweat, get the Fire version or check out David Swenson's Yoga Short Forms.Oh yea, one more thing. Be safe and watch any video at least once before you just jump in.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an intense yoga workout.","review":"I have been doing yoga regularly and I am not very happy with this cassette. As pointed out by the other reviews the poses are few and they are not held for long or it moves too slowly.

The first few episodes were a bit too corny for my taste, but then the series really took off and became a must-purchase. I bought all three seasons without having seen the last two, and loved them.This is a great deal -- but bear in mind that the packaging leaves something to be desired.

The author is a professor in England. He sees the presidency from an outside view as the head of the world's only remaining super power and has a good view of the problems that the US is facing from the outside world and internally.His view is interesting to see, but in some places I wonder if he really understood what he was seeing. The anger and almost hatred that one faction or the other holds for the current President is amazing. Yet, there's still a general following of his authority. The contempt that most people feel for Congress, except for our own representatives is another point difficult to understand.His conclusion after a pretty good recap of history is that the US will muddle through, on that I think he's right. There will be screaming and yelling, one disaster after another, but in the end it seems that things work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Better To Face The Enemy...","review":"...than to turn away because you don't like what you see.

She realized some time before the accident that after successfully moderating her own drinking, she was NO LONGER able to moderate. Possibly, that was due to some very real and significant life changes she was experiencing at the time, but that's just my speculation. She advised the MM group of her decision. Then she joined AA.

Audrey Kishline had decided that MM did not work for her at the time of her accident.Just wanted to make that clear.MM is hard work, but it does work for some people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really sad","review":"This book is really quite sad and poses methods that will only lead alcoholics to more intensive drinking and guilt. This, of course, was the case with the book's author, Ms. Kishline, who killed people in a drunk driving accident after writing this book! Moderate drinking simply does not work with someone who has a drinking problem. I have been sober in A.A. for 18 years now and that has worked beautifully for me and countless others. A.A. Has had more success than any program. It was beautifully devised; there are no leaders, no dues or fees, no enforced beliefs, just meetings with fellow sober alcoholics and steps 'suggested' for recovery.

When alcohol causes trouble it's time to grow up. I did without this appailling book. AA drove me nuts but Jack Trimpey's \\"Rational Recovery\\" was so simple, safe and effective. Let finally reiterate to you a point I have already made. Ms Kishline who exposes \\"Moderate Drinking\\" manages to KILL two people whilst on her programme by Drink Driving. Not a very good arguement huh? Her programme is simple wishful thinking. If you have not got a drink problem \\"Moderate Drinking\\" is unnecessary.

Most do not WANT to be alcoholic, and groups like Moderation Management give them the reason to drink they are looking for. Drinking alcoholically is a grave danger in society. Kishline found AA to be disagreeable, because in the state of denial, alcoholics do not want to stop drinking, and most cannot--without a spiritual power of guidance. Unfortunately for her, and for the family whose father and daughter were killed as a result of her drunken driving, her life is now unmanageable. This book does NOT propose abstinance for the chronically sick alcoholic--now we have seen the results in the author's life.

Reading this book confused me on the great mystery of Jack the Ripper and a possible killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graysmith keeps the reader wanting more - excellent!","review":"Graysmith is wonderful at keeping the reader mesmorized. Each page loaded with evidence of the crime scenes and statements from witnesses that contradict themselves. The author provides an intriguing description of the birth of \\"yellow journalism, dirty politics, wheeling and deeling by newspaper publishers, William Hurst and Mike and Charles De Young,(\\"San Francisco Examiner\\" and \\"Chronicle.\\") Anything to sell papers and be number one, even at the expense of playing judge and jury. One accused. Other players look equally suspicious. But one man has to face the mobs, dirty journalism, and judicial circus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Confusing","review":"By the time I finished this book I couldn't figure out whether Graysmith believed Reverend Gibson or William Randolf Hearst was Jack the Ripper. He simultaneously showed the newspaper accounts of the day to be, at best, heavily predjudiced accounts of the crimes, and then depended on them for his research. His reconstructed diary of Theo Durrant was the last straw--it was written by a character he had invented! I'm going to avoid Graysmith from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the Jack the Ripper Subtitle","review":"I am a Jack the Ripper buff, and that is why I got this from the library, but I found it more interesting if I didn't think about the Jack the Ripper subplot. It is written well, and an interesting case. If you're only interested in Jack the Ripper, go elsewhere. But if you're interested in William Hearst, San Francisco in the early 20th century and well-written \\"true\\"-crime, this is a great example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Solve The Jack The Ripper Mystery","review":"This book is basically about the \\"Bell Tower Murders.\\" They aren't really interesting crimes, although the story of the innocent suspect who was convicted and hanged is. Another suspect happens to be a minister from England with ties to Whitechapel, his first name is John, and he is called Jack. This is pretty much Graysmith's basis for \\"solving\\" the Ripper's identity. I expected better from Graysmith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly unconvincing","review":"Graysmith didn't even convince me that there WERE two murders at the church or that the church even existed! If a book purports to be \\"true crime,\\" please don't make guesses at what the thoughts of the principals might be! Refer to your sources! Use footnotes! Were there any photographs of San Francisco from at or near the time of the murders? If I can see photos of Lizzie Borden and Jack the Ripper's victims elsewhere, why do we just get illustrations (most without source citations) in this book? Evidence of this kind would make the book much more credible and convincing. I didn't pick the book up to read about the newspaper wars, either! The story of the Bell Tower would have been interesting as a novel if the secondary plot lines were abandoned. But if it's going to be written in narrative style, PLEASE tout it as fiction it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too cute!","review":"My daughter had a few sets of the PeekaBlocks so getting some of the balls was just a given. We bought the animal ones and they are soo cute. They are just the right size to fit into her hand for rolling or -morelikely- to be tossed out of her highchair and fetched.The one of the hamster in the hamster ball is my personal favorite. And what child doesnt love balls. I dont see her outgrowing these any time soon. We do not have any of the playsets like we do for the blocks but will be getting some for her birthday:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are my son's favorite toy!!","review":"My son loves these.

Now that he's standing, he likes to throw them on the floor (as hard as he can) to hear what sounds they make. That's it.

It details seven different models of classroom teaching in addition to containing three chapters on how to cultivate thinking skills in students. These three chapters may be the most important in the book. Cultivating thinking skills in our students will help them as they work through their entire lives. The seven models for classroom teaching supply ideas, methods, and suggestions for implementation in the classroom.I would highly recommend it to all teachers and aspiring teachers because of its applicability in the classroom.

Having attended several M$ events on this very topic, Jerry Honeycutt really outshines M$, making his process the definitive resource guide for any Desktop Architect. Some of the information is available from M$ White Papers and other sources, but never before have they all been so well thought out and available in one location. The book also contains unique advice and techniques that you won't find anywhere else. You will learn techniques that you didn't know were possible. As an author, Jerry Honeycutt has a talent for being clear and concise when it comes to complex subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money well spent.","review":"This book has lots of interesting art activities which relate to math. Some of the activities are worth doing over again. Hope there will be a part2/book2 on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Connection?","review":"Where was the math art connection? I was extremely dissapointed with this book and wonder how it got any glowing reviews. It is preachy about teaching to the right brain with little substance for teachers to use. In addition, either the author has serious issues with administrators or I just didn't get the little sarcastic cartoons in each lesson. The ideas for making the connections were ideas I'd already seen. Last, there were no visual examples to help the reader, which I was extremely strange given the topic. I expected to see things about the Golden Ratio, proportion, and geometric relationships linked to actual artistic works. I regretted having bought this book and if I didn't live overseas would return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Performance","review":"I have had this CD for over 20 years, and have played it often (I keep track of when I play my recordings, and give them ratings on my own system.) Recently, I bought the recording of with Pierre Boulez and The Cleveland Orchestra, my favorite in all the world. So, I have compared the two recordings, and truly find nothing lacking in this one. It is well done, and a clean, crisp recording. So, if you want a good buy on a fine performance, this one fits the bill. The liner notes are decent in explanation of the material also.Even though I bought a new CD of another performance, I will keep this one and enjoy it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor edit, and too many ads","review":"This magazine is filled with \\"advertorial\\" and is over 70% ads.

Well, did not work, my adapter did not work with the 2010. The 2010 was faulty also, and I could not get a warranty exchange since Amazon is not an authorized dsitributors for this product. I had to purchase another unit plus the power supply, now the savings that I was expecting by not paying my satellite provider for an extra box are going to take double the time (almost 2 years) to recup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant Authors -","review":"The text is either a great text with horrible supporting documentation, including the practice quizzes, or wonderfully written practice quizzes and a horribly written text. And I am very sad to add, the quizzes the Authors (or is it the Publisher's handiwork?) market to the Instructors are equally ill-conceived. If it is the intention of the Authors to write material and provide learning materials such that the quizzes are a reasonable measure of that learning they pitifully miss the mark. If the quizzes are merely to identify how poor the Authors did with the textbook, then they are excellent quizzes. The concepts are difficult enough, but when the Authors go out of their way to convolute the verbiage in either their text or online additional materials this is academic elitism. This is not a text I would select."},{"rating":"1","title":"was great until I needed it","review":"The book arrived on time as promised. The book was in great shape, however the cd that comes with the book seem to be sealed but was a different version then on the front of the book. Also when I tried to install the cd program SPSS it said there was a file missing. I took notice to the back of the cd and it looked a bit rough. I almost did not need the cd until the last week of class and so I lost points off my grade. I attempted to contact the seller,but received no feedback from them. I have not spoke to Amazon, so I thought to warn people to be careful if your order required the cd programs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criminology research","review":"This book was a very helpful learning tool which enabled me to develop the proper methods to conduct and utilize information on a professional level."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"The sofware that accompanies this textbook is bad. If you have a Mac, IBM want's you to purchase further software for $40 for SPSS to work on Mac's. If you have a PC, you have to jump through the hoops of deleting a windows update and one of the file's on the disk being corrupt. Amazon customer service was of no help either. DO NOT BUY THIS TEXTBOOK IF YOU NEED SPSS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartoony at best","review":"While a few of the painting included are quite nice, none are breath taking or even exceptional. As long as the artist sticks to landscapes or panoramas the works are okay, but as soon as characters are added the pieces take on a very unrealistic cartoony feel which I doubt is consistent with how most fans visualize Middle Earth. Tolkien's Word: paintings of Middle-earth is a much nicer work, still for a collector of all things JRRT, you may want to pick it up if you can find it cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition horribly edited","review":"Wambaugh's story is great as usual, but there are so many typo's in the Kindle edition, we shouldn't even have to pay for it. It's worse than a high school edit on an old typewriter. Disgusting!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Not one of Wambaugh's best but it was still a very entertaining book. I think he does better in his books as he jumps from one team of cops to the other. But as always I like his style and he keeps me smiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated information?","review":"This book is good but not great, and appears to have lots of dated information. For example, the author cites Nike, Reebok, and Adidas as the brands to look for when buying technical running shoes, but the fact is that these three companies make a lot of \\"casual\\" and \\"retro\\" shoes, many of which are mixed into their line and sold as \\"technical\\" shoes to the unknowing. He also seems to suggest that cotton t-shirts and sweatshirts are fine to run in; if you are seriously training for a marathon, whether it's your first or your fifth, you would be better off with advice that encourages you to wear technical running tops made of technical fabrics (coolmax, dri-fit, etc.). They are much more comfortable, breathable, and moisture-wicking, therefore leaving your body to focus on running efficiently rather than struggling to cool you off.It just seems like there's some not-so-great advice in here, which then made me wonder about the rest of the information he was presenting..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete rip-off","review":"This is not a book, it's a pamphlet. For that amount of money, you would expect something more substantive. Not a lot of information, or motivation is included in the couple of pages. I much preferred the The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer, which really motivates and informs you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple advice but may not lead you to a 4-hour marathon","review":"There is nothing in this book that I didn't agree with except that I'm not sure that you could follow these instructions to run a 4-hour marathon. It's a straight forward book and it's simple to read. You can pound it out in less than an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Helpful!","review":"I found this book to be very disappointing, and quite frankly, a waste of money. As a 5+ hour marathoner, I bought this book hoping to gain insight into how to run faster. Instead, the author basically assumes that you're already running fast enough and enough miles to run a 4 hour marathon, so he simply provides a standard training plan that would allow you to run a 4-hour marathon. Therefore, I found this book to not be very helpful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with Caution.","review":"Make sure to combine brains with your brawn, when working out. While there are some interesting factoids peppered throughout this little paperback, it may be too simplistic for the novice runner and result in injury. Jeff Galloway's Marathon training technique is far superior and slow and steady is definitely a more prudent (and ultimately successful) method for marathon preparation."},{"rating":"1","title":"No content","review":"There really wasn't much information in this book. As an adult, you should be able to dress yourself for runs in differing weather but this was the type of information that was contained in this book. The training program with speed work is essential to lowering your marathon time which is why I gave it 2 stars as opposed to one. Unless you want the VERY basics of marathon training/running, I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit dated, but still a great book.","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It is a wealth of knowledge, especially for the beginner runner that I am. I'm sure that all of the hard work will pay off in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information is just plain wrong","review":"The central contention of this book is that Oprah ran her marathon in under four hours and so can you. Such a feat is incredibly inspiring, but infortunately, it is simply not true. Oprah's time in the Marine Corps Marathon was a respectable 4 hours and 29 minutes, but not sub-four. Plus Oprah had her trainer with her the entire race, pacing and encouraging her. The lesson, don't believe everthing you read.I did find the book helpful in my marathon training, but don't expect any miracles. You'll do just as well picking up a runner's magazine and reading the articles on marathon training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go for it!","review":"I'm giving it a try and so far the book is being very helpfull....direct to the point, clear and realistic.....I promise to let you all more in tree months!Good luckAs promissed here I am....back and guess what....RUNNING!The book and the technique proved to be good....easy reading....and it works....not effortless I may say but a bit of persistence and you will also get there...Good luck, I will let you know how my first marathon went..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so realistic","review":"I am a 12 year running vet and a second time marathon trainee. I was looking to improve my time from my prior marathon from 4:30 to 4:00. The training schedule in this book is a bit far reaching. If you are going to do a training run of 24 miles, you might as well run the extra 2.2 miles and get the marathon over with right there. Seems a bit extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor, want my money back","review":"I was under-whelmed in the extreme by this one. When I got to the two pages on 'how to pick up your cup from the water stop' I knew I was on to a looser. Bad bad bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informational read, nothing more","review":"It is informational, nothing more. There are some good points to the book but it is not realistic. I have run 5 marathons and the only way to get to the 4 hour and under mark is to do alot more training than what is listed in the book... period. If you are a mere mortal like myself (ie; you have a life, kids, job etc.) then you are kidding yourself if you think you can do this. I am not saying it is impossible, some people are in fact natural born runners. For those people they could read the wall street journal or daily news and run a 4 hour marathon on that training. Of course, speed work is important, tempo runs and long runs (no duh) but alot more of all of the above will get you to that goal (think 50 miles a week or so). I keep it around and thumb through it to look at goal times and get some pointers, thats all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"I have yet to run a marathon and this book (which you can read in one sitting) is very inspirational and I am going to try it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too short.","review":"I am training for my first marathon and thought this book would be a good resource. It's got some good motivational stuff, but the book is just about basics; I didn't feel it had any \\"meat\\" so to speak. You can read it cover to cover in an hour or so, and I didn't come away with anymore information than I could find on marathon websites. Save your ten bucks and do the research on the net, buy a different book, or even better - join a marathon training group headed by a veteran marathoner. BTW, I did pick up Nancy Clark's marathon nutrition book - that is a great resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and to the point","review":"This book provided a quick high level overview of how to prepare for a Marathon. You have to be able to run about 7 miles to begin the 16 week training course.

It's dreadful. The \\"product description\\" promises a story of a weekend after which the characters lives will be changed forever. Plot is simple. Verow hires a hustler to spend a weekend with him and then films their multiple sex acts. Other than a series of hand held camera close ups (many out of focus), that's it. If you want well made gay pornography, than buy it. Don't waste your time on this pretentious vanity project."},{"rating":"1","title":"After just 18 months the dictionary failed.","review":"I have owned this dictionary for about 18 months. Used it once in a while, however, its screen started to show signs of failure not a long time ago. The Ectaco refuses to repair (I was told that they, actually, do not repair its products at all, they just replace them), and asks ~$200 to exchange it for another model which will probably last another two years... I have two Ectaco electronic dictionaries, and based on my experience, all of their products are overpriced. Their Customer Service is far from being perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teen Slang","review":"For anyone who's trying to keep up with what teens are saying to your face or behind your back.

It has a lot of good action, even though there are some sections that are rather boring. This is not the kind of book where all of the main characters stay alive until the end, although the two main characters do survive.This book keeps you reading, although it can get tiring in a few spots. By the end, I found myself just wanting to get it over with, even though that was where most of the main action was.Overall, I think that I would give this book between 3 and 4 stars if it was possible. It is a good book with faults (which few books do not have) and I would recommend this book for someone wanting a good, clean book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Bible for Teen","review":"I bought this Bible for my 14 yo Godson (high school freshman) who has had little formal experience on anything Christian based.

A whopping 61 disks (but no briefcase) - All 9 seasons and the movie and gobs of extras. The number of disks per season matches the original releases and NOT the slim sets. MSRP is $329.98 (that's $5.41 per disk), so Amazon's price will probably be under $300.00 should they decide to offer it.So, if you want to pay an additional $220.00 for the \\"cool\\" briefcase, get this one. If not, wait 'til November."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bard of the oblivious male","review":"The people and situations in Russell Banks's short stories, here collected from those written throughout his 37 years of writing, generally have two things in common: stark lives, and oblivious people. Yet somehow he manages to make us care about them, probably because they ring so true. His writing is poetic in a way that doesn't call attention to itself. He is one of our unknown masters who, like Carver, Ondaatje, Woiwode, most often tells us stories centered on reluctantly-civilized males mildly bewildered by their lives.Not an easy writer. But a very good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated, but readable","review":"Banks has written some great novels, Continental Drift and Affliction being two of the best, but the short story seems to be his true love, or so the author says in his rather self-aggrandizing note, \\"Dancing with my Eyes Closed.\\" While Banks dismisses a lot of his earlier work for its youthful \\"pride and rage,\\" I find those two ingredients to be at the heart of his best work. The nine new stories in this collection, ironically, placed in competition with some of the old (even if edited) stories, lack the very heart and abandon of a writer on the edge. Instead, Banks seems to have eased into the comfort of an older Cheever or Updike, churning out self-conscious and self-impressed stories that are readable and well-crafted, but ultimately rather dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary","review":"If there was a sense of humor, or even hope in Russell Banks' life, it must have been beaten out of him a long time ago, if these tales are any indication. There is a perverse yearning glamor to be found in these stories about the hard, bitter truths the characters find, or don't, almost as if the hopelessness is something to be envied. Cheever, it can be said, is often times dour and meloncholic, but at least lightens the load with transcendant prose , and a dark wit. Banks lacks even that, and this succession of dark skies, long winters, and teeth-grinding pain bearing just wears out: the writing, dare we say, even veers towards the cliche.A better written and more incisively written set of stories are needed in place of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I browsed this book at a local bookstore: on page 94, the authors claim that 'navajo', 'hopi', 'apache' and 'inuit' each translate literally as 'people' in those languages. Both 'Navajo' and 'Apache' are other peoples' names for the people we call Navajo and Apache - not their own - not words in their own languages at all. 'Hopi' *is* a word in the language we call Hopi, but it means something along the lines of \\"well-behaved one\\", its use to refer to the Hopi people is an extension of that concept, and the generic Hopi word for 'people' is unrelated to it. 'Inuit' (the plural of 'inuk') *does* mean 'people' among the Inuit, but 1 out of 4 isn't a very good track record. The authors' main point - that many peoples call their group simply 'people' - isn't wrong, and it would have been easy enough to provide accurate examples, but the sloppiness they display here - well, I didn't buy the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not convinced","review":"I'll keep it short.

They find the \\"camera angle\\" of the ancients, what they saw and how they would have interpreted it. This has enabled them to start to decode what many myths were meant to convey. It is an exciting beginning. I am sure that we will soon be hearing of many more secrets being deciphered using their tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive bookshelf (or wall mount) speakers.","review":"These small KLH speakers were just what I was looking for in a low cost, very attractive bookshelf style pair for my office.

These do!They're small for one, well-built and sound great to boot! They make a nice addition to a partially assembled system like mine, and really round out the sound. My system is piecemeal: an Onkyo amp with two channel outputs (front and back), a Technics CD player, and Acoustic stage 150W speakers. What I needed was rear channel speakers. These fit the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"I've never owned any products by KLH but after reading the reviews here i felt confident that they would be decent. I have a new high end sony receiver and all monster cable. So that's not the problem. I set these up as rear speakers. They didn't stay up long. They emit a constant hum as soon as they're turned on. Sound quality was poor with no definition. They were so bad, i had to send them back since they detracted from my other speakers. Don't be fooled and think you can get good, quality speakers at this price. The product is actually even cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for notebooks/laptops!","review":"I purchased Coby CV-M25 Hands-Free Headset from amazon and was absolutely disappointed.

It uses actual financial statements from well known companies2. An \\"ok\\" description of how to do some research on sites (mainly cnbc.com)3. Links to a few sites I hadn't heard ofBesides those three things I think in this book Mr. Byron's writing is clunky and I found the text hard to decipher at times, I think there would be a lot of improvement if parts of the financial statements were marked so you'd get in idea of what he was mentioning (instead he'd say now look for something that is close to 300 million... yeah like that helps.) Also if there were screenshots (pictures) of the websites where he is discussing how to do something it would be easier to see.All in all, I don't plan on using this book for anything and I don't think it's worth anything to investors who've used cnbc.com before and have seen financial statements.Reed Floren"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pan for good cooking.","review":"Super great pan.

So those who want to avoid the offgasing of non stick products may want to think twice about this one as well.Update: Offgassing aside, we did buy this pan a little more than a year ago and it just got thrown away. We only use the non-metal utensils and take very good care of our cookware, but this pan performed like every other non-stick pan we've tried. It works great for a while and then craps out.

This normally can be adjusted on any other earphones but not on this one, If you try to adjust it, it wont budge, i tried even harder and i realized why.

It serves its purpose and is inexpensive. Yeah it's not the best, but what can you really ask for for this price?That being said... I did not usually store mine in the case, as I often wrapped the chord around my iPod. This MIGHT have stretched the wires at the jack and earbud connections and contributed to the short in the wires, therefore I would suggest using the case to store when not listening.I will be looking for something a little sturdier next and will perhaps be a little more careful with their storage.

I've always liked the Apple earbuds (though I know I'm somewhat unique there), but my pair broke.First, the bass is the one thing missing from the sound of these earbuds. Treble and mids are fine, but there's really no bass. I went so far as to set the EQ on my iPod to \\"extra bass,\\" and that's pretty much where I leave it with these headphones.Second, the cord is somewhat stiff (unlike the Apple ones), which means it's always getting caught on my coat lapel and pulling out of my ear. It just doesn't bend easily enough.For those that complained about the shape--face it, every ear is different. I do think these earbuds are slightly larger than others I've had, but comfort-wise they're fine.

On top of that, I have now had them for a month and the wiring failed. Now I get terrible sound out of only one side.

If you are not familiar with Dig-N-Rigs, its a GREAT game that comes with a dashboard unit that mounts on your computer keyboard. You load the software and then all of the controls are on this dashboard, like the steering wheel, crane levers, key, and horn.

Its still a good game but not near as gratifying as Dig-N-Rigs, and I hope they eventually come out with supplemental software to that game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mic","review":"I use this with my AX360 headset for voice on Xbox Live. Since the AX360 is a 5.1 surround sound piece, the earcups are rather large which means the boom on this mic is a little short for my tastes, however it does pick up very well. Fits in the ear pretty well when you put it there (I usually tape it to the outside of the left earcup.

It seams to be most appropriate for items that use a lot of watts powering heating elements. It probably should not be used for sensitive electronics or items that remain on for long periods of time.We have seen inconsistent results in some cases, but nothing one would not expect. When used with our toaster, the toast is almost too dark when set to the lowest setting. On the other hand, we have to leave waffles in the waffle iron a minute or so after the timing light goes off or they will be undercooked. Both appliances worked normally one 110v.We have been using 2 of these units daily for the last year with our US appliances on 220v power. Considering their cost and that they work as well today as they did on day one, I would buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of watts are we talking about?","review":"I have purchased this converter because it is advertised as a 1600watts appliance. I plugged it in happily, together with my 150watt Xbox (the original one, not the 360). Luckily, my Xbox did not explode. Unluckily, this converter died. It made a big flame and a loud \\"boom\\".

Good luck to any future buyer, make sure you don't have anything flammable nearby when you test it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The thought behind the dance","review":"It is a while ago that I read this book, and I liked it, albeit not enough to go through it again. Ms Bentley described 4 dancers who did rather erotic numbers in the days that the Salomania rage was sweeping over Europe. She seemed more interested in the motives of the dancers rather than the quality of the performances. This, because of her own reaction to performing erotic dances. I think it is this that makes the book helpfull. It is not realy about dance, it is about the experiences and feelings of women who expose themselves, and use the dance as a vehicle. In the eyes of some this may be a taboo subject, and I admire the honesty wherewith Ms Bentley writes about her subject, and about her own feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toni Bentley triumphs again","review":"With an intimate knowledge of dance, keen eye for historical detail, enticing premise, and droll prose (many turns of phrase made me grin), Toni Bentley has taken what could have been a bone-dry, pedantic topic and infused it with wit, humor, and rigorous scholarship. The result: one smart, sexy book about four sexual rebels. Here's hoping the success of \\"Sisters of Salome\\" brings \\"Winter Season,\\" Ms. Bentley's haunting memoir of her Balanchine dancer days, back in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time on this","review":"If the main character walked throughout the house one more time I was ready to break the DVD.The acting is not terrible, but...There is no sex, no nudity, just posing and more posing and even more posing.There is no real story.

This guitar, if strings are replaced plays AMAZINGLY well for it's price, the amp for a practice amp is second to none, top quality all the way. You really do get a GREAT guitar and amp for a small price..you simply cant beat it. But again, lemme make it clear that you SHOULD replace the strings ASAP as that is this packages ONLY fault. Now, go buy it and have fun with this great guitar package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money!","review":"This guitar package is excellent. The amp is incredible; it completely blows away most other practice amps with great distortion-lots of cutstiomizable settings-and fairly good sustain. The guiatr itself is pretty good. However, previously mentioned by a few reviewers, the strings are very low quality. If you're not going to go out and buy an entire new set (which costs about $8), make sure you follow the manual's tuning guide (I broke my b string on the first day because I over tuned it). The manual is very easy to understand. It will show you what socket to plug the cable into with a diagram, and all sorts of other helpful tips. The only problem besides the b string breaking was that the cable stopped working after a year of extensive use. Great job Behrigner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good pack for the money, but...","review":"I had to spend the same amount of money fixing a tuning problem on the guitar and changing the strings"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"While the guitar is okay, it has quite a few errors.The amp just sucks. It's noisy and basic.There is a huge amount of fret buzz.The amp overall gives it a thin, papery sound. I upgraded to a decent fender amp and it sounds much better.The frets cut my fingers when I do slides. Which is bad, because in my band (we play death metal) I use alot of slides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Package!!","review":"I got this guitar package yesterday and I love the guitar. It comes with everything you need. The amp makes a great sound and has good features. The downsides are that the strap is very poor quality and can break soon after you use it. The instruction manual isn't very clear on how to work everything. But other than that, you'll be jammin' in minutes. The price is great! You should buy this package."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best all around cleaner","review":"I purchased this cleaner to try it a few years ago, but can no longer find it locally, hence my purchase online. It cleans virtually everything, and doesn't have any odor what-so-ever. It's great for people with perfume sensitivities -- much better than those headache-inducing toxic sprays. I feel much better about using this with pets in my house. The woman who cleans my house says it works better than anything else she has tried -- even on that gross red mold in showers.

I'm not a photographer but something in the way he composes his shots moves me. Mostly, tho', it is the quality of the contrast between black and white- and the richness of the color in his photographs. I'm sure it all has something to do with the equipment, exposure, film, etc. People like he, Adams and Claxton make black and white as sexy as color-if not more so. If you love jazz, you will find some iconic pictures here as well as some that have probably never been seen. Lets' put it this way, if I had the chance to have one photographer shoot me as a musician, it would be him. I once called him up out of the blue to talk photography (which I know next to nothing about) because I was/am such a fan. Just the finest technique that makes the pictures seem three dimensional.

The change from using two basses and two (sometimes three) drums with one guitar did not make them necessarily stick to one sound but did make a very dark style of music on this band. Unlike Cough, though, which seems that they've grabbed any wind instrument they could find and put it on this record, made them a more complex sound. Do expect, however, the two infamous screeching vocals of B.E. to be present. Hard to tolerate at first listen almost, a few spins in your CD player with an open mind should make you experience some kind of enjoyment if this is your taste.

I did learn 2 things: I'm disappointed in Blackbeard and I'm glad I wasn't a cabin boy. I gave up halfway through it. 2 peg legs down. I don't want to be a pirate anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spank The Plank","review":"The author in the book sacrifices the importance of the emotional and spiritual ties that bonded the shipmates to a overemphasis of the relatively unimportant but intimate physical bond the men shared. For example, the common practice of \\"walking the plank\\" must be understood within its historical context as symbolizing the buccaneering version of a fashion show affording seaworthy suitors ample opportunity to size up potential bedworthy mates. I was saddened of the lack of illustrative material that should have accompanied the more explicit descriptions of homoerotic parlances. To his credit, the author has \\"laid\\" the groundwork for further inquiry to this fascinating subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"possible but unlikley","review":"Being a expert on pirates I must remind readers and the author that fully half of all pirates were casterated before they went to sea.Also a \\"anus\\" chastity belt was in common use then.Pirates rarely if ever sodomized each other only the captain and his officers were allowed so enjoy sexual favors and they usually always raped big black slaves freshly captured from Africa.But otherwise the book is quite enjoyable I like the chapter on \\"hot bunking\\" and also the sexually charged \\"whale blubber rub down\\" were quite interesting.Any Pirate ships hiring?"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO!!","review":"This book is very indepth in explain how pirates would survive on long journies abroad by sleeping nude three to a bunk like spoons. With the weather conditions, that was their only means of survival. It makes one understand that sodomy was part of their lives, as they usually had several male lovers aboard the vessel. The chapter on hot racking was especially revealing, considering 90% of all pirates engaged in that. This is a very good book about pirates and their lifestyles and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting stuff.","review":"It's true that in authoring this book Burg was slightly hampered by the fact that 300 years ago there weren't any busy homosexuals a la Steven Zeeland running around with tape recorders prying into the sex lives of pirates. Still, Burg does an excellent job weaving together what scanty materials do survive. Only the most persnickety footnote-fetishizing queens will fail to find this book a richly rewarding read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book is funny, she is annoying","review":"While I loved the book and found myself laughing out loud, I really felt like I would despise her in person.

Check it out of the library instead if you just gotta."},{"rating":"1","title":"A minor redemption story","review":"I spent the better part of this book hating Jen Lancaster. Excluding the few times that the story was actually funny or charming (see: scheduling wedding during Porn Expo) she is rampantly narcissistic, selfish, unrealistic, classist, and not-so-implicitly racist. Now, you could say \\"well look at the title! she admits she's egomaniacal, etc.\\" Yeah, but it's not charming or self-deprecating humor. It's grating. You sort of expect a redemption story out of this based on the title, and we kind of get there, but not really. Things get better, as does she, but the severe lack of self-reflection (other than \\"why did I buy so many purses?!?!\\") keeps this from being the charming fall-from-grace story it could be. She's still possesses all of those terrible qualities by the end of the book, but they're muted by her inability to express them through spending power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Me","review":"This book was just not for me. I was a little upset that I didn't like it. But mostly because it had been on my wish list for a long time on PaperbackSwap, and I had been excited to get it. And now I wish I hadn't. The main character was just a picky, finicky woman who I would use a stronger wording for but I am trying to remain PG. Now I suppose to some people that might be funny. But to me it was just pointless. I almost stopped reading but by the time I was going to I was almost half way through. And at that point I had used enough time on it that I didn't wish to stop. So at least the book counts for my 2009 Challenge but that is about all it counts for.

I did skip to the end to see if she gained any enlightenment through her experiences, but nope - she's still a terrible human being.

I only finished it because I knew Jen was going to get her comeuppance and I wanted to revel in it. The book was amusing due to the horrible and embarrassing situations she created for herself. But her monologue was not funny; it was mean and b**chy. In order for me to really like a book I have to be able to relate and sympathize with the characters. I could do neither. The only reward was in reading about her getting what she deserved.

It was a surprise to read her overly flattering descriptions of herself and compare them to the image in the book. What a shock! That itself was worth a good laugh, but that is the ONLY one.

Good for her for sharing her story!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not my kind of book","review":"This book was very shallow, and I did not enjoy it - in fact for the first time in many years, I did not even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You either like her or you don't","review":"and I didn't. It seems as if all the other characters in her life were easier to like than Ms. Lancaster herself. The situations are entertaining and the book is an easy read, but unfortunatley Jen's real life persona is annoying and self-centered at most. Her bitchy, catty attitude made her book unenjoyable and reminded you of the bully girl in high school. And the way she writes? With so many broken thoughts? Make this book? A definate no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter Needs Some More Lively Color","review":"Throughout the first 200 pages I despised the author, but the whole time I assume I was suppose to hate her. However, it didn't ever get much better after that even though she toned down the obnoxiousness a few degrees. Upon conclusion, I felt that her story wasn't that interesting to put into a 400 page memoir. I can empathize to a degree with the difficulties in being laid off and trying to find work that will pay at her previous level. I do think she is a hard worker and am certain it was a horrible situation. However, most of the book talks about her behavior in reference to being laid off and I think she tried too hard to make herself seem funny and cute. I actually found her to be quite boring and fake (despite the fact that she constantly told stories of how NOT boring she is in life). Also footnotes in a memoir only discussing your opinion is irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better as you go....","review":"I started off by REALLY hating Jen and her superior attitude, but the further I read, the more she grew on me. While my case wasn't nearly as extreme as Jen's, I can relate to the pain having to give up things that were once luxuries that have become necessities! Of all the \\"blog\\" style books that are out there, this is really the cream of the crop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"I LOVED it! It is full of sarcasm and humor. I think I spent most of the book smiling and laughing. She is a FANTASTIC author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I spent my money and time on this book.","review":"I feel guilty for spending money on an book authored by someone who finds humor in calling people retards. How can anyone be so devoid of empathy? Joking about people with cognitive challenges is just a step below people who use the \\"N\\" word. How can anyone find this funny?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Was Funny?","review":"I alternate my reading between fiction, non-fiction, travel, politics, humor and my hobbies (sailing and scuba). I rarely say that a book has nothing to offer, even if I disagree with a non-fiction position for example. Skip this book ... it has nothing to offer a reader looking for funny, life experieinces or creative insight. I can't remember having read a book this pointless in the last 15 or so years.(Jan 2013 - re-review) So, I picked this up again to see if maybe I was having a bad year and my review was unfair: it's not. I feel bad that someone actually is going to profit off of my book purchase. The conclusion I reached when I re-read the book is this: Trying to be funny in pointing out the disparity between wealthy and poor is possible, and I actually enjoy it. Think David Sadaris or Dave Barry. Those two authors use clever, creative writing, which is unfortunately missing from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How was this a best seller?","review":"The author is self conscious and the book reads like a bully looking for affirmation. Dont waste your money, time, or energy on this book. Save the trees too etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"F'ing Fabulous!","review":"A must read. Lancaster is HILARIOUS. And believe it or not... there's a moral to the story. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's up on a pedestal and needs a reality check while laughing your [...] off. Truly one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"In whole agreement with the other one star reviews...","review":"I recently purchased this book based on its good reviews. Like the other \\"one star\\" reviews I have no idea how those reviews happened.I thought the book was awful, characters boring and stereotypical.I am a big believer in finishing what you started, but this is one of the few books I couldn't make it all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time!","review":"This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read! Not only is she the most hateful person to ever write an autobiography, but she annoys the reader with her non-stop footnotes in an attempt to be witty. If I ever wrote something so honestly superficial about myself, I'd probably contemplate suicide! This was a complete waste of time and a horrible read! I only read it for a book club, and I have nothing nice to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"stunningly bad reading","review":"I thought this might be funny because I enjoy books by women that are touted as humorous chick lit - but this book is not only not funny - the writing is so cliched and forced that I had to stop reading about halfway through. It is so rare that I don't finish a book because I have never been a quiter and I can count the books on one hand that have gone in the trash and this is one of them. Stick with Crusie or Kinsella who have it all over this wannabe writer. Sorry but the truth must be told. Not sure how a publisher picked this book up as it appears to be a debut - must have been desperate or blind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I think the author is just a bitch. Not an entertaining bitch. Haven't even finished the book because it was so uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I purchased this book because it was listed in Amazon's section of other books purchased by people who purchased books by Laurie Notaro (a truly funny chick lit author). I found my way to Notaro's books in a similar search for what people who read Sedaris purchased.At the start of the book I thought the main character was a caricature who was mostly oblivious but still in on the joke with the readers. When I realized that the book is truly a memoir and I figured out that the author's picture is in fact a picture of herself from her wedding day as described in the book, it just made me feel sad. Going through life on a daily basis with that much disdain and dislike for those around you would be miserable.Had I been expecting that, rather than what I had hoped would be a funny riff on a stereotype, I may have been better prepared to enjoy it or likely not have read it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy b*****","review":"I got about 1/4 through the book and called it quits.. This book is awful. She is so rude and unquestionably inconsiderate and mean. I understand the book title alludes to that but I figured she couldn't really be that awful. I think it's a failed attempt at comedic sarcasm. Either way, my book club dropped the book after a unanimous vote that it wasn't worth our time. I tried to give it my best shot thinking she would have a change of heart or I would start to see some sort of plot starting by 1/4 through, but unfortunately that has yet to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"I read this book when it first came out and I laughed out loud so much, that I cried-- in the airport, none the less. You can't help but relate to Jen in some ways, and in others, you can't help but laugh at her:) If you are looking for an upbeat, easy read, this is the book for you. I gave the book to my mom and aunt and they loved it to, so I think women of all ages can relate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter is the New Black is THE New Book","review":"I grabbed this book without realizing it was a \\"memoir\\" until days later when I was set to crack it open and devour it. I had mistaken it for the typical chick-lit fare and was disappointed. Stuck on the beach without any other options, I began to read...and was NOT disappointed.The author is very relatable. She touts herself as a not-so-nice person in the early pages, but has the self-humor and grace to call herself on it and let you laugh both with and at her as she finds her way through daily dramas and mishaps. She's easily recognizable as someone you have known in your life and you can't help but enjoy the read even as her life has its ups and downs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yipee Jennsylvania!","review":"As a longtime Lancaster reader via her blog I can assure you if you like her blog, you will like this book. A quick, breezy read, with some unexpected moments never chronicled on the blog"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"I read this book with great anticipation, having been a fan of Snarkywood and Jennsylvania for quite some time. The book does not disappoint. I laughed out loud constantly when reading. The story of Jen's struggle with unemployment is kind of like an afterschool special written by the writers from the good years of \\"Saturday Night Live.\\" In the beginning of the book, Jen is one of those women that you love to hate. A girlfriend that you are nice to, so she doesn't cut you to shreds behind your back. But by the end, you find yourself really pulling for her and her life. And again, very funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book","review":"If you want to know what to expect when you read this book - check out the author's blog site prior to buying. I did just that, told my sister's about the book (mainly the title caught my eye as it could be my life's motto) and they bought me the book. I thought it was a fun, light, quick read and would reccommend the book, and based on the first book, I'll be buying the second - because like it or not you end up caring about the author and what is coming next in her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter Rocks","review":"Jen Lancaster will have you laughing and snickering the whole way through her witty memoir \\"Bitter is the New Black\\".

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less about this book but prompted me to ask the question","review":"Anyone can call themselves an actor, right? I mean since 99% of actors are unemployed, why can't anyone just say they are an actor? They will be lumped in with the rest of the unemployed actors. No need to show talent. No arbiter of talent.I felt the same way about this book. I was given this book(apparently no one actually purchases this book as everyone writing reviews seems to have been given the book)and upon reflection asked the same question about authors. Does being published make you a writer? To me, Bitter Is The New Black is proof that being published does not make you a writer. Having a blog does not make you a writer. Saying you are a writer does not make you a writer. Sadly, the author is not a writer. I hope the \\"New Black\\" is inheritance for this lady. Do not waste your time when someone tries to pawn off their book to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Hardly worth me writing a review.

This book seemed like one of those so bad it is good movies but never got anywhere but horrendous. Penguin publishing is embarrassed to have published this.

Then I read the book and found it atrociously written. I pondered, why should I write a negative review about it? Didn't my family teach me if I didn't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all?

Seems the positive reviews are fake. I sincerely hope so because no one in their right mind would EVER say this book is the funniest, best book they ever read.Accept that there are many many people that find Jen Lancaster's writing and persona annoying. Many people that don't understand how she got a book published. many people who have every right to express this opinion. As do you have every right to lie about how wonderful the book is.For me, I watch as the Jen Lancaster employees keep writing fake reviews and marvel at how pathetic that is. Everyone is allowed their opinion. Haven't you learned that yet? My opinion is this book isn't worth the paper it is written on. If Penguin didn't agree, they'd put her next book out in hardcover. Ever wonder why that isn't happening?"},{"rating":"1","title":"unreadable","review":"Amazon reviews are usually pretty reliable. But this book failed miserably. In fact, it was so poorly written, glib, stupid, and utterly senseless after about 10 pages I chucked it. It isn't just that this idiotic character Jen Lancaster is self-absorbed and inexplicably wealthy (ok supposedly she is a successful career woman...), but the author thinks readers should be amused with reading ridiculous footnotes. Gimmie a break. Footnotes in a book meant for pleasure are simply annoying, especially when they amount to useless parenthetical comments. The chatty tone of the writing sounds like a 10-year-old's efforts at trying to be entertaining. Dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, This Has Been Done","review":"It's been done ladies. If you are writing a chick lit book, please stop relying on italics for emphasis. It's lousy writing. Anyway, Jen loses her job. Is incredibly superficial. Then gains perspective and gratitude. Name dropping, lable dropping, discussion of roots, discussion of values. She then must provide a fairy-tale ending of getting a job and a book contract. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not want to be her friend","review":"I really thought I would like this book, initially I thought it was witty and clever. It is good vacation book, easy and mindless, but really by the end I just felt like I had wasted my time.

Jen is nothing but all about herself. Through out the whole book all she talked about was how she needed a job to buy more stuff. She should have been grateful that she still had a roof over her head instead of worrying about how she can buy herself a new pair of shoes. I am sorry that I even wasted the money on this book. I read it with my book club and not one person thought it was good. I do not recommend buying this book if you feel you must read it go to the library!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why dumb down??","review":"This is yet another of those books designed to dumb you down, and in the end that's the worst kind. Instead try reading something with something that helps you learn or grow, from non-fiction to great fiction. Sorry,but along with most \\"fake\\" reality shows, there's nothing to learn here, and reading about a snot isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book. Waste of time.","review":"This book was terrible. Seriously, I am sorry that Jenn in Jennsylvania admitted to this being a memoir! I love a good fun read as much as the next person but this is a worthless read. The book played into every sterotype imaginable and her ignorance was offensive in parts. What type of \\"heroine\\" uses a wedding as a ploy for money, cancelled her health insurance to buy shoes and subsequently associates material things with peoples self worth including her own. The next time you are sterotyped as being a gold digging, self indulgent, money grubbing egomaniac just because you are a woman, a New Yorker, an American or a Sorority girl you can thank the HEROINE of this book. I am relieved I picked up the book on the free rack at the library and did not support this author financially the last thing I want to see is a sequel to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"entirely too self-satisfied","review":"At least the subtitle is straightforward: the author/narrator is everything she claims to be and more. I buy the condescension, the egomaniacal, and the self-centered parts, but the smartass stuff? Not so much. The oh-so-snappy dialogue in this book is labored, precious, and too clever by half. The author can't truly expect readers to believe that she always has just the right witty retort, scathing rejoinder, and perfect put-down at hand.Then again, the boring narrative needs something to make it halfway readable. Lancaster's stories of being an entitled jerk only go so far, and aren't noticeably driven by anything other than the a need to share her insufferable personality. Once she belittles and insults everyone in her life, she expects readers to be impressed that her new landlord will go on to win the grand prize on The Apprentice? Damn, it's amazing what people will publish."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Who told this woman that mean is funny? A very immature woman, incredibly materialistic and shallow. I just don't like her, and I really didn't care about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny!","review":"This is such a funny book. I love Jen. She is really funny and makes chick-lit different than what you're used to. I identify with her character--even though she comes across self-absorbed and all. Aren't we all like that a little?

Watching beige paint dry would be more enjoyable than this book I have to say..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow train wreck","review":"Just like Forrest Gump said \\"stupid is as stupid does\\", and this book has the examples - from beginning to end. She not only burnt her bridges to any and all past employers, she added gas and flame throwers to make sure those bridges were fried to a crisp. It was like watching a verrrry sloooow train wreck from the time she was fired (if she was just laid off - she would have been re-hired by her former company when they were hiring again) through her long unemployment. The title is all you need to read - the rest of the book is just more of the same. It's a good read for those contemplating employment as to what not to do if you want to stay employed, or if laid off, what steps to take to not get re-employed. Some parts of the book were an actual three star rating, some parts just didn't need to be in the book at all - so I would have averaged the score to a 1.5 star rating if I could. Not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for witty, look elsewhere.","review":"I am honestly mystified by the popularity of this book and, in particular, by reviews that describe it as \\"witty\\" or \\"clever.\\" It was recommended to me by a friend, and I resolutely plowed my way through the first three chapters without coming across a single witty, clever, or even original turn of phrase. Rudeness, selfishness, and egomania can indeed be witty and clever, but they are not necessarily so. Ms. Lancaster has apparently not grasped this crucial distinction. Her particular rudeness, selfishness, and egomania is tired and dull. Who could possibly find a woman describing someone as \\"my gay best friend\\" witty and clever? Sorority girls have been doing it every day for years.There are many funny and well-written memoirs out there, most of them authored by people who have actually done something worth publishing a book about. This is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get All The Fuss","review":"This is an obnoxious person, writing about her obnoxious life and we're supposed to be entertained by it? I have no idea how this became a best seller, except if the author bought a million copies of her own book (which wouldn't surprise me based on her personality). Maybe I've met one too many people who act like this in real life - but the fact that the author is now making money off of her own self centeredness is repulsive. If you want to lose brain cells - go ahead and buy it. It's not entertaining - more like, anger invoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entitled much?","review":"I have no idea how this book got published other than the possibility of Ms. Lancaster having connections within the industry.It is never a good idea to write a memoir when the main character is wholly unlikeable. One example: Ms. Lancaster sneers at people who are on welfare, and then goes on welfare...so she can buy designer shoes. That pretty much sums up her attitude about life and herself. Her sense of entitlement is positively staggering. Blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was hoping for a funny read with this one... there wasn't one part where I laughed out loud. Jen comes across as spoiled and ignorant, with a huge false sense of entitlement. Not for me, glad I bought it on ebay for only 5.00. Even that price was too high for my wasted weekend/hours of my life I will never get back. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bitter.","review":"I wanted to like this book. I love snarky, witty, acerbic humor. I am myself snarky and acerbic. Sadly, I just couldn't like this. It was frankly too bitter without being charming. I guess I am not into bags, tags, or shoes enough to relate at all to the heroine. I just found her rude, boorish, and unfunny. I guess the title sums it up pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!!!","review":"This was absolutely AWFUL!!!

This woman is a total WITCH...but let's replace the 'W' with a big CAPITAL B!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter I Bought It!","review":"I made the big mistake of bringing ONLY this book on a Transatlantic flight. It turned out to be more annoying than the screaming baby sitting next to me! It read like a bad blog from a very unfunny, fat ex-high-school Thespian. I dragged myself through the first half, and then threw this waste of paper away. I instantly felt guilty, as the airplane lavatory was too fine a receptacle to be expected to hold this trash! Want funny? Read David Sedaris, Bill Bryson or even Nabokov. Skip this pabulum.**By the way, Jen, I also HATED the humor-free footnotes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Would not recommend this to anyone.

The writer did not draw me in AT ALL to root for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to read more from this author!","review":"This book left me wanting to read more from this author. I found this book to be interesting, funny, acerbic and touching. Some of the stories were written so vividly, I could imagine being there and only wishing I could have thought up some of the comeback lines and comments that Jen Lancaster provided.

It was by an author who had graduated from Purdue, our alma mater. I picked it up at the airport before boarding a flight back to Chicago. I laughed out loud on the plane, several times.

As I was reading it, I came across line after line that made me think of comments I have always wanted to verbalize myself, but never had the balls to do it.

Every time I flipped the page, I immediately scanned to the bottom to see if one was included because I thought they were hilarious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your $r-not funny at all!","review":"I am ticked that i allowed the pos. reviews on here to convince me to spend $$ on this stupid book. This woman is SO NOT FUNNY. She aspires to be the next Helen Fielding but she is not. Aside from the character of this book being so egotistical she is just plain juvenile. My 11 yr. old daughter is more witty than this author. For being so educated and successful her vocabulary is very elementary and the writing is so boring. There are 2 chapters dedicated to her longing for a new couch?

Her humor is mediocre at best and I've since started 2 other books. This title was selected for a book club read, luckily my book club is moreabout the wine than the actual book. I refuse to waste another minute on this book outside of the bathroom and I will show up to book club with a strong list of suggestions, as this garbage was agreed upon after several bottles of wine. Jen Lancaster is an annoying ego maniac. I can't believe she was compared Sedaris, if I were David sedaris' publicist, I would sue, this \\"book\\" is generic trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yea, she's increadibly self absorbed, but REALLY FUNNY!","review":"Ok, so I admit that when I started to read this book, I actually thought it was fiction -- no one person could really be this \\"Condescending, Egomaniacal, Self-Centered\\" -- her words, and really appropriate! I was a little disapointed when I actually realized that it was a non-fiction memior (um, like the title kind of hints), but Jen is extremely funny -- like I laughed so hard I cried repeatedly. By the end of the book I had actually become kind of a fan, and now I read her blog regularly.So in summary, don't read this if you are looking for a role model, read it if you need a really good laugh -- and who doesn't?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Promo for Jen's Website","review":"I liked this book until I realized it was just a huge Bait and Switch tactic. Shame on you, Jen. Though I felt guilty inwardly chuckling at the story of a rich, pampered white girl making too much money ending up living in the barrio (hey Jen, it's the BARRIO, not the HOOD) with no luxury SUV in sight, I still chuckled. Then I realized she was merely again tooting her own horn about how brilliant and funny she is and as proof, here you are reading her brilliant and funny new book. Too meta for me.This would be a good guilty pleasure book or cotton candy fluff when you get tired of the good literature. Then again, realizing all I've done is feed into Jen's shoe shopping obsession by buying her endless self promotion packaged as her first novel, I feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an enjoyable read, don't waste your time.","review":"Confession...the only reason I finished this book was so that I could contribute something meaningful to my book club's discussion. If my book club ever reads another Lancaster title, I'll opt out for that session of the book club. While at times Jen is amusing, overall, I found myself disgusted and annoyed by what a mean spirited, whiny and spiteful person she was in the face of her circumstances. THOUSANDS of people lost their jobs during the last and current downturn, yet most of those people didn't continue to act like unapologetic, entitled divas. An extremely disappointing read.

Ms. Lancaster really has a gift for telling a good and funny story.Quibble one: A lot of the language she uses is SO over .... well, I wish it were so over. Five years from now, this last decade's version of 80s valley-speak is really, really going to uber-grate on the reader.Quibble two: I agree with Ms. Lancaster that her husband, Fletch, is a saint. Good thing he is, because I cringed at her really personal description of Fletch's struggles with depression, and I'm a stranger.Some of my favorite scenes: Writing down how to answer a phone and use the copier for her first temp job. Picking up the marathon registration materials amidst the agressively fit.

This seemed like a bunch of rambling, incoherent nonsense! I'm glad this isn't a book I paid for. I would have been horribly disappointed if I had. It was pretty bad.

I have never been a fan of Chick-Lit before, but now I am hooked! I started reading her copy (which she was lending to another sis-in-law) over the holiday weekend. When I had to give the book back I was crushed. I ran to Amazon and purchased my own copy and devoured it right away.There are very few books that make me laugh out loud, but this one was full of belly laughs. I personally can not identify with Jen, but I swear she is channeling a family member. It is the kind of humor you are drawn to, but don't want anyone to actually know you think it is funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I had not heard of Jen Lancaster prior to picking it up in the store. But I had to buy it once I read the subtitle and description. This book did not disappoint. It is so funny and witty and real. I'd recommend it to all my bitchy, snarky fashionista friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it, love it, love it!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is one of those books you can curl up with and have a good laugh, a good cry and feel better about yourself with Jen's poignant tale of life after the dot-com bubble burst. She comes out a changed woman in the end and very relatable. All in all, a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abso-freakinglutely hysterical","review":"This was one of the funniest books I have ever read- and I've read quite a few. I will highly recommend this to all of my friends and family for years to come. I think at times I was laughed so hard that I was cried. If you're looking for a good, easy read with a refreshingly honest and comical storyline, I recommend you pick up this book. And, best of all, it's a true story!I'm already looking forward to Jen Lancaster's next book! Keep them coming, girlfriend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not disappoint","review":"After reading this book, I became a [...] fan. Writing about all of the pitfalls of coming into money in the dot com era and losing it, trying to make ends meet by temping, Jen Lancaster never once falls into the easy trap of coming across as feeling sorry for herself. From her struggles with her weight, to balancing bills with a rapidly depleting bank account, I found myself in tears with laughter more than once with this book. Definitely recommend this book to any Laurie Notaro fans, along with her second and third memoirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I spit out my milk through my nose.","review":"I read this book after being laid off from my job on the advice of a friend. It took me 24 hours because Jen is brilliant. My stomach hurt from laughing so hard that I almost was unable to direct my boyfriend what chores I wanted done while I read. If you have not done so, save yourself some time and buy all three books. I'm like a junkie looking for a fix I'm so psyched for Such A Pretty Fat to be arriving at my door."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sugar Coating Here....Loved it!","review":"This is an excellent book. I would recommend it to anyone. I can't wait to read the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"More blog-inspired diarrhea","review":"The best way to describe this book is misogynistic. I can not think of a better portrayal of the most negative stereotypes of a woman. Yeah, yeah, I know it is supposed to be snarky and outrageous and as believable as James Frey's memoir, but it is nothing unique or insightful. The sarcastic sentiments of this book are being echoed a million times over on blogs littering the internet: \\"I am a woman; I think I am smart, I can write creative insults, I deserve a fancy purse. Gimme gimme. Life is hard. Wah. The end.\\" Seriously folks- don't fund this woman's attempt to make a living off of worthless drivel...send her back into the unemployment office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"I love this book.

Well done for holding it together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Being unemployed can be lonely, thanks for keeping me company!","review":"THIS BOOK ROCKED!!!! So much so that I felt compelled to come here and write this review even though I have nothing better to do. Since I am thoroughly unemployed, I spent the better part of my day today tearing through this book. I read it in 8 hours, laughing and crying through the entire thing. In the 6 months of my unemployment I haven't laughed so hard or felt so understood as I did reading this book (well, ok, oddtodd.com helps too). The best part is I can completely relate to the overacheiving, over-inflated sense of self that Jen has previous to her enlightenment. Kudos, Jen on an amazingly personal and hilariously written story. Thanks for this awesome book. I only wish I had more to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than a page turner.","review":"I haven't had many opportunities to read as of late, but I purchased this book 4 days before a trip and I thought what an excellent book to have for the plane and for the trip! Excellent, was too true in this case. I came home from Borders, book in tow with the intention of waiting until the flight began to start my new purchase, but after a sneak peak of the first chapter, that's all it took. POOF! Book was done in 3 days and I was left with no book for the trip. That's my idea of a great read. Kudos to you Jen, your book, and your talent to leave me bookless for my trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black is sooo my color...","review":"I've read Jen Lancaster's blog for years, so I was eagerly awaiting her first book, \\"Bitter is the New Black,\\" and after reading it (in fits and snatches over the last week) I can say I was not disappointed.If you've ever been faced with the choice between re-doing your roots or paying the electric bill, if you've ever found yourself committing couch envy, if you've ever been between jobs and unable to support yourself in the lifestyle you'd become accustomed to, this book is for you.Jen makes no apologies for her snarky, funny, manner of living, and while some of her choices aren't the same I would make, reading about her fall and subsequent struggle to rise again made me nod my head (at times), laugh out loud (a lot), or cry real tears.If you liked The Devil Wears Prada, if you enjoyed The Nanny Diaries, you will LOVE Bitter is the New Black."},{"rating":"1","title":"review","review":"book was used, i bought it new. wasnt so happy about that. semi fast shipment. was reimbursed two dollars.

We were pretty excited and considered contacting the author to do a little q&a.;As we began reading, each of us individually called each other with \\"can you believe how awful this is?\\" We decided to ditch the book and read 4% Famous. Thankfully the bookstore agreed to take them back as an exchange.I'd like to hear from other book clubs on this. We actually stuttered it was so unreadable. The self importance, superficial, mean spirit coupled with poor excecution. But again, I only read a portion."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thank you","review":"I had to put this book down after 2 chapters.

I would have liked to have seen more Best Practices provided. I was extremely disappointed with the blatant sales and marketing that was thrown in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing and customer-focused!!!","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. It was to the point and very direct. The companies' stories were extraordinary. I would recommend this book as a reading must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated - Not Current With Laws - Poor Material","review":"This book is grossly outdated and should not be sold as an investigative resource or reference. The author references using pay phones of all things. It is not current with recent privacy laws, the internet, databases, etc. and makes no mention of these.One chapter has no reference to finding people and is filled with personal safety tips. The title is misleading, even for it's day, which may have been in the 70's or 80's.I should have checked the publication date before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good buy","review":"Obviously this writer hasn't looked out side his rear window in a number of years. Amazon you should be ashamed of your self. I've found most of your so called experts on bounty hunting and PI work have not been introduced to the world wide wed, or many of the current laws pertaining to the hunt. My recommendation folks: Don't buy from the ego driven puffed up BS artists claiming to know all and tell all about bounty hunting and investigations Get the real scoop at good college or training school for police work. Anything but one of these BS, outdated, ego stroking FICTIONAL works of non-art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best performance for this price","review":"As soon as I fired up the KLH PSW8100-8 sub, I was impressed. For the small price and small size, it pumps out loads of bass! At moderate volumes the bass is clean and loud. When played at very high volumes the \\"tightness\\" or transient response was degraded, however. Also the sub could produce almost no material under 50 Hz, which is still better than any other sub in the same price range that can produce the shear output of this one. For cheap, loud, clean, and fairly deep bass, this is an excelent solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Boomer","review":"I purchased the KLH PSW8100-8 a month or so ago. I based my selection purely on price, KLH branding and the customer reviews on Amazon.com. I have not been disappointed in the least. The bass is excellent and really adds alot to my home theater setup. I made the mistake of purchasing a home theater system with a non-powered sub-woofer. This one really booms. I could tell the difference as soon as I set it up (With ease I might add). Don't be put off by the down firing feature. It is a positive as far as I am concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I purchesed the KLH subwoofer for Christmas and I don't know how I ever did without it. When you hear the Bass that comes from the small size that fits anywhere you will be amazed. And the price is right for anyone. Don't be fooled by the price and size of the sub unit. Watching DVD movies like Godzilla make you think that the monster is right outside and tring to get in. This is a must have for anyone on a tight budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service","review":"The sub is OK, rounds out a basic system, low price for basic performance. However, the one I purchased stopped working after about a month of use. KLH asked me to send the power unit into them for repair. I have not heard one word from them since. Phone calls and e-mails have not been returned. It is like I never existed. So be wary, sometimes buying cheap cost you in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I almost got knocked off my couch","review":"I hooked up my subwoofer last night and watched the movie \\"Ronin\\" on DVD. There were a couple of scenes where cars get blown up. Not only did this subwoofer rattle and shake my apartment, but it also blasted a jetstream of air that almost knocked me off my couch. Very happy with the product so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, low quality","review":"After reading some of these reviews I thought this would be the perfect last addition to my setup. The price is definitely right, but the old saying \\"you get what you pay for\\" certainly applies here. If you want to pump any significant bass through this box at a decent volume, it just can't handle it. Constant rattling and speaker 'splat' sounds are very noticable even at middle volumes. You are better off saving a few more dollars and finding some that can handle the load, and you'll save yourself the hassle of returning it once you realize it's shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a sausage factory BUY IT!","review":"The sweet grill over the port rocks for acurately recreating the sound of driving on the highway with the window down. The hexagon legs transfer the mighty sound of the 8\\" driver into your carpet! While running a frequency test of 30hz the woofer separated from the box and the port blew out because of the stupid grill. However, it was slightly amusing watching it fly apart. If you buy this subwoofer even for [$]..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigger is Better","review":"I have changed my mind about this subwoofer. The sub performed fine for the last two years, but it started having problems. It would thump very loudly when powered on and the bass would flutter as if the woofer or the amp was going out. I purchased a 12\\" 200 watt power subwoofer and I am very pleased. If you can afford a 12\\" sub go for it. If you want the full movie experence go for the bigger sub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very reliable...","review":"When I first bought this sub, the sound was great. It integrated nicely with my DD 5.1 / DTS hometheater system. Now, one year later, it has a bad buzz that just won't go away even when no signal is being sent to it (not even CONNECTED to the amplifier). I guess you get what you pay for. My next purchase will definitely be of a better quality and hopefully much more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the price","review":"After shopping for subwoofers and finding most in the $200-$400 range, I jumped on this one. It is easy to hook up, has several options, and useful adjustment controls. My only complaint is that the \\"auto-off\\" function makes a noise through the speaker - but I'm not usually nearby when it happens, so I don't notice it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant handle really low frequencies","review":"This subwoofer goes ballistic when it tries to handle very low frequencies, in movies such as fight club, I am very disapointed in this subwoofer, maybe my standards are too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for XP users","review":"I was very disappointed--the description said it was compatible with Windows XP.

Granted that this is \\"basketball\\", it sure applies to this book. The book's layout is very effective, it begins with the 7 layer OSI model and ends with WAN networks. Reading the book once will not do!! You must understand every single line of the book, cover to cover to tackle the exam. Some of the book's questions are challenging, especially the electronic flashcards (some are even harder then the actuall exam questions!). This is a method to make sure that you understand the detailed topics that is covered in this book. Remember \\"playing with the big boys\\", well consider the assesment , bonus exams, and the flashcards are the big boys. If you can beat them (pass exams, and answer every question in flashcards) then you should not have a problem passing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read,Practice and Pass!","review":"I took the CCNA exam about 5 days ago and passed, barely but I did pass and thats important. The reason for me passing the test barely was that I studied for 4 short days! I used this book and practiced most of the commands on the Sybex Virtual Lab e-trainer. I had scheduled the test so that I could get something like 12 days of study, that time period was cut short due to family commitments and in the end I just had 4 days left. I read the book in a real hurry, skipping some parts that seemed vague. I read and re-read the parts that seemed confusing to me, most notably subnetting and the WAN protocols, did the practice tests and took the real test and to my amazement, I passed! And all credit goes to this book. It has EVERYTHING you need to pass this tough little exam. All the commands you can possibly find on the test are in this great book. All you need in addition to this book is a router simulation program and you are set!Get this book, Practice and Pass the test!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked for me!","review":"I thought that the book was great.

It covers most of the material that you need to know (probably about 90%). It is geared towards the exam only, though, meaning if you want to become very proficient in Cisco configuration, you will want additional material. I used this book in addition to hands-on experience and some other study material and had no problem passing the test.

This book starts from fundamental things, so that it can refresh you about some things basic, you can go on studying easier. I think you can get what you want and what you need in CCNA exam from this book. However, this book cannot give a full details about WAN, such as Frame Relay, ISDN etc. I think you need other resources for supplement to ensure you can pass.Anyway, it is still worth to buy it.

I returned the Osborne book and bought the Sybex book and I am glad I did. This book maps perfectly to the Cisco CCNA exam. If you read and study this book, you can pass the test, no problem. I think the review questions were harder then the actual exam. Also, the CD has cool stuff on it. Check it out. I recommend this book highly!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great study guide and collateral materials.","review":"Very good study guide, the CDROM has a good test engine. There are a few small errors, so back up your studying with some reference material. As always, you should never assume you buy any book and pass tghe test only from the book. You need some hands-on too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awsome book! Has everything you need.","review":"I don't think anyone can pass the test by just reading a book. However, with all the great examples, router configurations, network analyzer output, labs and exellent review questions, you can get really close. If you were to combine hands-on experience with this book, the test will be no problem at all. This book has a great CD with a test engine that lets you test by Cisco CCNA test objectives, a subnetting tool, network analyzer and network diagraming tools from Visio. Add the best glossary I have ever seen, and this book ROCKS! I recommend this book to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passed the test 1st time only missing 5 questions","review":"I have all three CCNA books and the only one that WILL get you a passing score is this one. It clearly answers Cisco Test Objectives and in the sample test has some of the same questions as the real test. GET THIS BOOK"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the book to buy.","review":"This book is full of editing mistakes that make complicated subjects such as subnet masking even more difficult. The author tends to mention topics, but not go over them in great enough detail. This may be fine if you are planning on stopping at just the CCNA level, but the readers wishing to further their certifications will find this lack of explanation frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book in combination with the ICRC by Cisco.","review":"I really like the way this book reads. I went through the book and the ICRC book and passed the test. I recommend this book for finding all the information needed for the exam. It is all there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for really fresh beginners !!","review":"The content are just cover the surface of CCNA not touching the depth, and its have too much error information...definitely for freshman to know what is about CCNA but not for preparing exam.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good except for typos","review":"I'm almost 1/2 thru book and have no complaints except for a fairly high # of typos considering this is the 2nd edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you need","review":"This book contains all the information pertaining to the 507 exam with no fluff and nothing left out. It doesn't read like a Stephen King novel, but it doesn't read like a dry technical tome either. I tried using CCNA for dummies but I consistently failed the practice exams I found online, so I purchased this book, and I scored a 924 on the exam. I recommend reading this book once cover to cover, and then rereading the OSI model chapter and other chapters you may have trouble with. I was lost much of my first way through, but everything fell into place the second time around. I'd also recommend doing all of the labs in the book with either a real router or a simulator. It's crucial to understanding the proper syntax of IOS commands. It's not necessary, but pretty helpful anyway. And practice with the CD-ROM test and every practice test you can find online. If you miss a question, it's most important that you know why you missed it. The test really isn't difficult if you know your stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"The casual style lends something to be desired","review":"I found the book hard to read due to the casual style of writing. The author uses first person and slang to teach a very technical subject. The book has errors as most do. It also does not fully cover the material neccesary to pass the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically a Brain Dump","review":"As with all of Lammle's book, this is basically a braindump of the exams that he got, if your exam is different from his, this book is useless. I find the book full of basic technical errors . It cliams that Lammle \\"world-renown\\" for his Cisco experiences. But before 1998, I've not even heard of Lammle as far as Cisco certification is concern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I just took the CCNA exam last week and passed it with a 841/1000. All I used to study was this book and the Study notes by Lammle's. Also used Boson practice tests! those were awesome! One of those tests ( series of 4) referred directly to this book and gave page numbers. That was awesome. Thanks. AG-T.. Now! off to the next adventure! GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CCNA by Todd Lammle helped me excel.","review":"I read this book twice and it helped me pass the CCNA exam on May 2, 2000. Examples, easy to read style, humour, end of chapter tests etc all reinforced reading material. It wasn't too helpful with ISDN; however, overall it's quite deservant of 4stars(equivalent to two thumbs up) Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I just passed CCNA exam with this book. It was well-organized and easy understanding. If you have access to router or some simulation software to finish all the Hand-on labs in the book, that would make instructions easy to remember.This 800-page-book seems a lot of reading. But if you want to understand sth not just remember exam stuff, reading the whole book is still worth. I wish this book could dig a little deep in the WAN part.Besides this book, some practice exams are neccessary for you to pass the exam. I took some free samples online. If you rich enough, you could buy whole sets on some websites."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is all you need to pass the CCNA","review":"Excellent book. Well written, structured, easy to read and understand. Many of the actual test questions are in the review and sample tests of this book. If you can read through this book and answer all the review questions, you'll ace the exam. Pay particular attention to: CLI, IPX, ISDN, Frame-Relay, OSI model, Switching and Routing and know IP Subnetting. Forget the Exam Cram and all the others. This book makes it easy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chapter 1 terrible","review":"I haven't gotten past chapter one yet, but I hope the rest of the book is better than this. A lot better. The book seems to contradict itself regularly, and uses terms that it hasn't previously defined, so I have to keep a bookmark in the glossary section and flip back to it frequently(and I'm not a novice either). The questions at the end of the chapter are completely worthless. Many of them are so vague as to be unanswerable, and for many of the rest I can find quotes in the chapter that contradict the answers given. I like review questions, so I've bought another book that has better ones. But if the quality of the text doesn't improve in the coming chapters, I'll have to give up on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its really good","review":"I used it and scored 950. It is written to the point and hence really makes concepts clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Invaluable Study Guide!","review":"Reading past reviews about this book, I decided to use it, in addition to the ICRC student guide, to take the exam. I passed the first time because of this book. Even though the actual exam questions are harder, the study guide's review questions after every chapter will greatly increase your odds. I highly recommend it to anyone!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book for a review prior to CCNA test","review":"The book has exactly what it I expected it to have - a quick and easy overview to help you prepare for a CCNA test. Easy to read, and the practice questions really helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent study guide for the CCNA exam","review":"This book has almost everything you need for this exam. For the most part it is right on target with the exam objectives. In my opinion, this book is worth every penny you spent. It is well written with lots of examples. The network diagrams are nicely done comparing to the other book by Syngress. The author has gone a good job in putting everything you need to know into one small package.

I scored an 832 on the exam!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning","review":"Warning, this book does NOT cover in detail, everything that you need. I successfully completed the CCNA exam yesterday using only this book as my study reference, and passed with flying colours as a result. HOWEVER... WAN technologies, an area of the book covered by one light chapter (11), was not covered in anywhere near enought detail. I am a Novell CNE, and hold a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science, and relied heavily on these assets as well as experience to get past a number of areas that were either NOT covered in the book, or NOT covered in enough detail. Also, the exam on the cd is simply a computerized version of those quizzes in the book, and is nto a good test sampler at all. Overall though, I would fairly recommend this book to others, as I could not have passed the exam without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why not be both a CCNA and CCDA","review":"This book, the CCDA book, and the Cisco beginners guide are all u need.

Buy your book from AMAZON.COM, because it is the cheapest way not to mention they have customers who resell them after they use them, go the cheapest route...Also the book includes LABS, which is very important in the course to learn, and last time I checked the other book did not have any.

The exam notes are the same exact thing except not nearly as much FYI. If you are new to Cisco and need to become familiar with their technologies first, I would *strongly* recommend the CCNA Certification Series from CBT Nuggets. It consists of 4 cd-roms filled with over 20 hours of videos to prepare you for the CCNA following Cisco's objectives.Use CCNA exam notes, CBT Nugget's CBT's and self tesfsoftware and you can't loose!

Todd does a great job of explaining the things that he writes about in the this book.[2] This book does a really fantastic job of discussing Sub-Netting.Con's:[1] This book falls short when it comes to the material on the Transcender test. This book is missing at least 30% or more of the test. Becuase you will be tested on hardware inside a CISCO 7000 router which is not covered in the book. There are also some commands that are not covered as well.Also, do your self a favor and do purchase Todd Lammle's CCNA Gold software program that emulates a CISCO router/switch network. Our CISCO engineers at work however, do recommend the CISCO Press books by Wendell Odem. Also, it would be envaluable for you to go to Ebay and purchase a CISCO 2500 or better router to play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Read, but information can be incorrect.","review":"The writing style of Todd Lamle is great, however, when buying a technical book, you want it to be correct. Can you imagine buying a car, and in the manual it tells you to used Leaded Gas because they forgot to add un in front of it!I found a few errors in his books, so instead of relying on them I always went to the source... Cisco's website or books.I will not buy more books from Lammle, if you are going to go for the higher Cisco certifications, then you should definitely get a book written by a CCIE, not a CCNP. You can get the CCNP without any real world experience, however the CCIE is a different story, and that makes all the difference in the world.Sort of like Microsoft books, get ones written by Mark Minasi, he is experienced and knows his stuff well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over 100 DOCUMENTED ERRORS!","review":"This book has over 100 DOCUMENTED ERRORS and some that are NOT!.

You can tell Todd Lammle has been working with Cisco routers for a long time to get this kind of information in a book. This is the problem with the Osborne book, no experience. If you actually want to learn the nitty gritty of Cisco routers, then this book is for you. I have just ordered his ACRC book due out this month. I can't wait. I read the Cisco ICRC book by Laura Chappel and liked that too. However, the cover has CCNA on it, and that is misleading. It is basic ICRC, that's it.

However, it did include a large database of questions (400), flashcards for PC and for Palm, and overall was much easier to read than most texts. While I did take an ICND course provided by my firm, this was my only other supplement (mostly for use in reviewing and taking the practice tests) and I passed on my first time with a 924. I would recommend this book, with the cautionary note that there are a few errors that might minorly test your faith.

Because it's so baggy with only one place to tie it down, it blows off of my 4-Runner every time anyone walks by the house and farts.To add insult to injury, the eyelet where you can insert a rope to hold the cover on the car popped-off the second time I used it. So, now I can't tie it down without worrying about the fabric tearing.Bottom line: spend a little more money and get something that works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Dissappointment","review":"I used this once. Just once!!! They ripped along the seams and holes when rubbed against the windshield. I spoke to the company, which was extremely helpful and apologetic.

Still the company was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I got this because the car cover I had for my 1977 Oldsmobile Cutlass had finally given it up. I had been using that car cover for over 20 years. At first I was happy with the fit and function; however, this did not last very long. I have only used this cover for 7 months, and it has literally disintegrated. It looks like the cover was made out of recycled paper, and has just completely come apart. I would not recommend this cover at all if you plan to keep your vehicle outside. Extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad cover for the money","review":"I have a box on the back of my 73 chevy.

I thought the book would only be full of goofy things like monolithic cheese monuments and the world's largest six pack. Although it has that in spades, there are also plenty of historical places to see, like the shrine to the birthplace of the Republican party and the grave of Edward Gein, inspiration for Silence of the Lambs.Growing up on the west coast, we used to watch movies about the midwest and say things like, \\"Wouldn't you go absolutely insane in some small town out there?\\" Oddball Wisconsin has answered my question.This is a great book if you're in the area or just want to get out of Chicago for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Road tripping through Wisconsin's unusual side","review":"Most people when they go on vacation go to national parks like the Grand Canyon or theme parks like Disneyland. How many would go to see the Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame with a giant embalmed worm on display? Or how about the world's biggest corkscrew? A serial killer's grave?

Just when I thought there was a book to help people understand what it is like to live with a Firefighter, I find out that it only applies to the loved ones of the Male Firefighters.

My son did have a lil bit of trouble with the mouse and clicking on the star at first but soon got it and doesn't complain, so that really isnt' an issue. They both use this at home or in the car by themselves. I like the fact they like it and can do it alone but I can also sit and work with them and learn more from it. It does get annoying when the books come out and you have to put them back...It happens often if we are in the car and moving the toy. Other than that it is GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Out-Dated","review":"The electronics on this toy look and sound like they are from 1980's. Atari had beter graphics.

You just have to watch and wait for the best deal. Therefore your review should not be based on the price because that just makes it look bad and makes the star ratings pointless if they are all about price. For the record I got this from Amazon and not a seller for 53.99. The day after I ordered it, it was back up to 67. Point proven. Otherwise I will go ahead and rate the product. I love this show, it's amazing. The set is only the individual season sets packaged together, but it's still great. They are actual boxes, none of the cardboard slide in and out cases or anything else. I know it's not a Fox dvd set, but if you have ever bought any of those the boxes are like that. Examples would be Buffy, Angel, or Prison Break. I always like to know those types of things. I would definitely recommend this product to fellow Dexter lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough to care","review":"I heard a lot about Dexter and wanted to see what it was all about.

Brilliant acting, very good scripts that are based on Jeff Lindsay's Dexter novel and a lot of dark humour.This box set offer is quite cool. When I ordered this set, it was offered at a reduced price. So I got a lot more for less. At this point I like to thank the guys at amazon for being very generous shipping this set again for the same price, because it was shipped back due to a failure in the post service in Germany.

The others are either dreadful or just average. Fabriclive.09 by Jacques Lu Cont is a set that contains one good track (\\"Gold Is Your Metal\\"). The others are average electro-funk tracks or dubs/re-edits of music that originally fell into rock or pop genres. I hate it when a rock/pop/alternative track gets edited into a pseudo-electronica track. Unlike genuine electronica, the original music was not designed to be set to a beat and does injustice to both the original genre the music was taken from and the world of electronica. Examples from this album include: \\"Abracadabra\\", \\"Sweet Dreams\\", and \\"I Wanna Rock!\\". Tacky, tacky, tacky! Music you would expect to hear at a county fair.

We first watched this movie (by mistake!) when it first came out. We actually watched the whole thing because it was so funny (not on purpose, mind you). But once we got started, we just had to see what happened next. The filming was completely cheesy. The slow-mo in the last scenes had us laughing so hard we cried. The \\"wolf\\" attacking the bad guys was particularly memorable (not!). Have you ever seen a little kid with a stuffed animal held to their throat pretending to be attacked? Yea, well that's it. And the narrator.... he's in the movie, then dies... but keeps narrating. How does that work? I did just buy this ridiculous movie, cause we've been wanting to laugh again.

Although twenty years later - I'm pushing 40 now - they come across a little dated, they are always a pleasure to read again and again, which I do. This was always one of my favorites, from the somewhat exotic - to me, a Texan! - locale of Cornwall, England to the terrific atmosphere Michaels creates in these creaking, wonderful old houses, it entertains up to the end. I also enjoy the fact that although there's a tiny bit of romance in the background in the tension between characters, it's never a prominent arc in the storyline, and in fact is barely discernible at times. I like that because if I want to read romance, I'll read romance. When I want quality, sophisticated suspense without all the gooey love stuff, I turn to Michaels every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one was a disappointment","review":"I love this author, whether she is writing under the name \\"Barbara Michaels\\" or \\"Elizabeth Peters\\", but this novel was a disappointment to me. It is a gothic mystery. Carla is a young American who suddenly finds herself the sole heiress for a Cornish mansion. No money comes with the deal, so she is going to have to sell it, but why not vacation there for a few weeks first? Well, it's a haunted, ancient mansion. And there is a legend that a young woman disappears, supposedly taken as a bride by a water monster, every two hundred years. And Carla is the next intended victim. Interesting story line, but in my view, a very unsatisfactory ending. And it all just doesn't fit as neatly together as her stories usually do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will appeal to fans of Gothic tales","review":"I love a good old Gothic-themed tale, and have recently been re-reading Barbara Michael's books, as they contain an interesting blend of the supernatural, romance and history. In \\"Wait for What Will Come\\", readers are taken to the Cornish coast where our protagonist, Carla Tregellas, originally from the US, finds herself the beneficiary of an ancient house on the coast. Carla is made welcome by almost everyone, except the sinister housekeeper, who warns of dire consequences if Carla does not leave the premises. Romance also beckons in the form of eligible men in the area, but will Carla fall prey instead to a seducer of supernatural origins? This is a tale that will appeal to fans of Gothic tales, and someone looking for a quick and engaging summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!

I am a new investor and I was hoping to find some info that would help me get the insider scoop on investing. The big error in the book is that Kurtz observes the people he writes about in a setting where they know they are being watched. He therefore does not have an insider's point of view, but rather a contrived, \\"let's-put-on-a-show-because-the-author-is-here type of performance.

Most of the material is \\"ancient\\" in that it took place a few years ago and any respectable investor knows that Wall Street is all about today or tomorrow--not what happened in 1998. He puts CNBC, Jim Cramer and others under such a microscope that it becomes silly. I really don't care when Maria gets a cup of coffee or Jim clicks his mouse to buy a stock.

But calling this an invasion to conquer America... just reveals the prejudice and paranoia of a closed conservative mind that hates everyone who looks different and everything that tastes different. If Buchanan was a Native American writing about his country being invaded by foreigners from across the Atlantic, that would make more sense. And its funny how Buchanan talks about the legacy of Sam Houston... What legacy. The legacy of massacre of Indians and slavery of Africans.

How do we tell who is an \\"illegal\\" immigrant or not? This country was, and is still being built be cheap immigrant labor, that capitalism so enjoys to receive. The Republican party is divided in this fact, supporting big businesses with a guestwork program and the control of immigration through the militarization of the border, or support the parties extreme right by deporting all of those so called \\"illegal\\" immigrants.Immigrants who come to this country to work and make a decent living are the victims here. Immigrants pay taxes under false social security numbers and get none of the benefits in return. If capitalism can't distinguish labor between an american worker and an immigrant worker then why treat immigrants who are building this country like criminals.This book is fueling racism, and making it ok to harass immigrant wokers who create the wealth in society. An Injury to one, Is an Injury to All!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy xenophobic conspiracy theories","review":"Pat Buchanan has created an elaborate conspiracy theory to back up his xenophobic views. He seems to think that Mexican immigrants are coming here to claim land that they view as theirs due to old history.Ironically, the reason they flood here is because of something that his people gave to latin America . . . Catholocism. The 'no birth control' and 'no abortion' tenets of Catholocism lead to an explosive population growth among its followers. And since the economies of their native countries are unable to create jobs fast enough, these people migrate north for economic reasons. That is all there is to it.This book is an interesting read only to get a glimpse into the mind of a reactionary right wing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you even read the book, Mr. Rimmey?","review":"I doubt it, because the supporting documentation goes very far in demonstrating how this issue transcends racism. Moreover, he discusses the fact that most immigrants are hard-working, law-abiding people who are just trying to make a living. There are also a staggering amount of illegals in prisons, gangs, taking advantage of entitlements, etc. In addition, Pat talks about how it is the ethnic minorities in this country who are being hurt through competition for jobs and keeping the minimum wage down.People both liberal and conservative recognize the need for some reform to our insane immigration policies and our leaders' (both sides of the aisle) paralysis in defending its citizens. It is people like Mr. Rimmey, who throw around words like \\"racism\\" \\"xenophobe\\", \\"nativist\\" etc. in order to preclude any intelligent debate on this issue that are as much a danger as the politicians and illegals bringing crime and disease to our country."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"I was very objective in reading this material. I have found however that the author plays one minority against the other by including comments from some minorities that benefit his book.

However, of some of the more activist of conservative authors, his works are perhaps the most researched and reasoned I have read in a long time. In \\"State of Emergency\\" Buchanan gives a strong historical and social argument for securing our borders. With one exception cited in the next paragraph there is almost no ranting and raving on the lunatic fringe -- consider that the next time you read an Anne Coulter book -- but a well reasoned, intellectual argument for why we must protect our borders and preserve our culture.The only negative is I do not agree with his assessment that President Bush's immigration policy is grounds for impeachment. Although I am a fan of the president -- yes, the man still has supporters -- I disagreed with some of his efforts at immigration \\"reform\\". However, I do not agree that his immigration policy goes to the level of treason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Rimmey","review":"would you care to list how important illegal immigrants are to the US?

But I have found that he fails to make his point when it comes to the conclusions and recommendations to fix the problems he outlines. This book is no exception. Great research, interesting, but it need a hard punch line conclusion at the end with specific, easy to follow recommendations. A specific chapter at the end with numbered recommendations listing exactly what can/should be done to stem the flow of immigration would make this a more powerful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misunderstanding definitive evidence","review":"Pat Buchanan relies on much of statistics in his book. It would be worthwhile to double check his facts with other think tanks. When looking at many other policy institutes, one can see that we are not being \\"overtaken\\" by immigrants. We have the lowest percentage immigrants population in US history. I often read in his book, as well as other reviews, that \\"they\\" are trying to take over the country. Who exactly are \\"they?\\" Has anyone ever asked \\"they?\\" Are \\"they\\" the immigrants who have been here for three generations, or are \\"they\\" refugees? Are \\"they\\" children who had no choice but to follow their parents?

We are living in a time where the United States is rapidly changing and it's not for the better. The illegal immigration problem runs rampant and unchecked and is leading to the division and yes, the potential downfall of this country. California is already lost, Arizona is fighting for its survival and other bordering states are rapidly being taken over. It is in no uncertain terms an invasion and occupation of portions of our country. It will not stop there but will continue, if unabated, to the rest of the United States. It's simply a numbers game and our number is up."},{"rating":"2","title":"So true it's scary!","review":"Pat Buchanan has always been a little too extremist for my taste, but this book isn't his right-wing opinion. This book is a compilation of facts taken from every study done on these subjects. It compares population statistics from the past and present and projects into the future to the year 2050. I'm afraid that so much of what he's pointed out is already happening. I can see it here in the Atlanta area. Soon, it'll be all over the country. It would take such drastic measures to reverse what is happening, that it won't be reversed. That makes me sad for our children. They won't even know the America I grew up in. What will this great country of ours look like in 2050? Will we be an extension of Mexico? Will the Islamic extremists reduce us to their level? Will the Political Correctness craze turn us into pansies, like the French? Do we have the guts to do what NEEDS to be done. Frankly, I don't think so. That makes me sad, so very sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"State of Emergency...","review":"After reading this treatise from Buchanan, I'm scared to death. Perhaps I'm more afraid for my children and grandchildren. This glorious country that our forefathers crafted is slowly, inevitably heading for downfall.

This is primarily for instruments, but even in the mid-upper vocal register the sound gets really distorted. I tested several of them with brand new batteries, different brand microtapes, they are all the same. Bad sound, and a TON of 'air static' pickup. You get what you pay for.

I heard about this successful raid, and finally I stumbled upon this great little book describing the raid. The book starts by describing the thought process of Wallace who thought the dams would be a worthy target of British bombers. The floods would destroy factories and limit the output of water and energy in the industrial Ruhr area.Wallace had to surmount bomber limitations, design a new type of bomb, and devise a method on how to deliver the bomb load against the side of the dam. These processes are all investigated and solved in the course of this book. The final bombing run is the high point of the book with the successful destruction of the dams. The loss in bomber crews plus the German civilian losses are also summarized.

Can't even find it in the UK! But still, the price when it was available was around $5.99 (USD), and 24.99 is outrageous! Wow, what is the seller thinking?

I have always had combination skin, even into my 50's now and this product is the best. Not too drying for my drier patches and the microbeads keep the oilier areas under control, and I use it daily. As this product was becoming less available, I was it afraid that it was being discontinued. I have tried other things including: Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleanser (too few microbeads and cleanser is creamy but more drying), Olay Total Effects Citrus Facial Scrub(again, too few microbeads and cleanser is more of a gel, but even more drying),and Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Brightening Daily Scrub (this one is the closest to the Nivea product with a nice tea tree oil scent, but still falls a bit short of the Nivea product).

Fast decisions might feel good but they are often wrong. The authors' thesis is really that information and painstaking care are necessary for truly reliable marketing decisions. Better to go slowly and get things right than to go off in the wrong direction based on misguided gut feel. This book is \\"counterintuitive\\" because it goes against the grain of all the \\"one minute manager\\" and \\"go with the flow\\" management prescriptions that we have seen too many of lately. It is really a call for rational decision making, and in the twenty-first century that may unfortunately seem unusual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap.","review":"I love the Look/Shimano cleat wedges. They work fantastic. These however are terrible. The wedges stop the serrations on the bottom of the SPD cleat from digging into your shoe. This is actually a necessary thing for the cleat to do because otherwise it will slip. I couldn't get my cleat to stop moving with these shims in no matter how hard I tried. If you tighten them down to the point where the cleat almost stops moving, you essentially push the cleat right trough the wedges. I would like to see a metal version of these. Perhaps one that \\"lock-and-key\\" fits the bottom of the SPD cleat, and has a mimicked surface to the bottom of an SPD cleat. All and all this is a descent design, but crappy material choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bike Fit Wedge","review":"I have purchased several of these over the years.

Why do only some of the personality descriptions seem to be cleverly lifted (a short string of words at a time) from those in the book \\"Day-Signs: Native American Astrology From Ancient Mexico\\" but not others?

Yes, there are some things that are Cherokee-words, a few pieces of stories (not much detail) but I really have to question, especially since she doesn't give any background, whether this is simply Cherokee stories pasted over the Mayan calendar. Information on Ms. Hail and her background, studies, etc. is scarce.This comes off as untrue, a bit new agey, and really does not do the preservation of Cherokee ways any justice. In my opinion, misinformation is worse than no information. Don't write something and say it's Cherokee when it's not.

I originally was hoping this was the Shrek Trilogy character. Nope it was a poorly animated, horrifyingly arranged wannabe. There was nothing to look forward to except to find the escape button and find a different movie to watch.DO NOT BUY this movie. Save your money for something like a dental visit, renewing your license at the DMV, or getting a haircut. All of which are MUCH more enjoyable experiences to sit through.

Not to mention the awkward moment when Peter and the Princess are found in an empty bedroom in which they say \\"Soooo, now what?\\" There is also a question of what the film makers are implying by introducing a talking Jamaican monkey.If you look past the discontinuity of the plot, the poor voice overs, the animation, and the creeper chamberlain (weird pedophile pants!!!!), it was still an horrible film!!!

The female characters in this film were dressed like hookers - they did not belong in this film, they belonged in a rap music video wearing J-lo jeans. When the characters were speaking their lips never moved in sync.William Shatner is the voice of Puss in Boots, and apparently had a hair ball in his throat the entire time if his weird, high pitched, raspy voice is any indication.The faces were weird and sort of satanic (possible night mares for me now) - their movements jerky and clay like.We didn't make it 15 minutes before I'd been creeper out to the Max and shut it down.My kids were not impressed, and I'd rather be gut punched than see it again.CREEPY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie was horrible.

I was not surprised to see a film made to further capitalize on the wildly popular puss-n-boots character from Shrek, but this is going to far.

My wife and I rented this Blu-ray to watch with our eight year old daughter and five year old son, and every single one of us thought it was atrocious. Especially the voice acting. I like William Shatner as much as the next Trekian, but he did a terrible job as the voice of Puss'n Boots (it made me want to put sharp objects in my ears).If I could give it zero stars I would. Do yourselves and your kids a big favor and never watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated G? This film is creepy and inappropriate!","review":"Shame! Shame! Shame! This movie is absolutely vile and should be re-called! It was cheaply produced, annoying, creepy, and inappropriate! It is definitely NOT a G rated cartoon.My daughter picked out the DVD at Target, I looked at the packaging for a G rating, and bought it. We sat down after homework for dinner & a movie, and were shocked! Allowing my daughter to watch even 2 minutes was like allowing her to watch some lecherous flasher. I finally had to pull the plug on the princess' risqué tavern dance scene - the one with low angles of the female character's gyrating butt! I felt absolutely violated and disgusted- my 7 year old daughter was watching this garbage!

Sadly it did not get her attention and honestly I was glad after watching it! I am not a fan of this version... I think that the way the animated characters are dressed are inappropriate for you children, there are some pretty dark scenes, and the voices are just creepy(William Shatner really should have used his regular voice)! This movie was just not age appropriate for us! The animation was really great though!! I would have to say that we DO NOT recommend this movie to everyone, that parents should watch it first to see if they approve of it for their child (should really have a PG rating)!!Disclosure: I was given the opportunity to review for Phase 4 Films through Team Mom.

I caught this stinker on Netflix and I'm still recovering. Rated one star but should be ZERO.Don't waste the money on this.

It was a waste of our time. Awful all the way through. The cat's voice was awful (and later find out it's William Shatner?). The animation was slow and weird. About the only thing positive about this is that it makes you realize how good Dreamworks and other are at making their animation smooth and not distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a lame knock-off","review":"This movie is a terribly amateurish attempt at computer animation.

I thought that even at five she would be able to recognize weak animation, a lame/unfunny script, and irritating voice overs that weren't even close to matching the mouth movements.

The others perform ok, but longwave band is very poor, it would not receive any NDB's or weak transatlantic LW broadcast from overseas even with a loop antenna. The radio does well with receiving local AM and FM broadcasts but overloads bad on FM. The AM band does OK with receving semi local and distant AM stations at night. The shortwave band only picks up a few shortwave stations in the daytime and is ok receiving shortwave stations at night with some intermod from a local FM station. You need a long wire antenna for indoors witha telescoping rod connector. The radio is ok for beginners and traveler's who visit places that require a paperweight throwaway radio.

The stations are easy to tune and the sound quality is amazing -- clear, clean and crisp with no staticky interference.The radio itself is quite sturdy and substantial in weight.Nothing cheap about the design or the packaging.It comes with ear buds and an attached antenna for FM channels and short wave bands.If you're in the market for a small portable radio with a big radio sound to take along to the beach or just to listen to while relaxing in bed, look no further than the Coby CX-CB12 Radio.It's one radio that really delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best $10.46 I ever spent","review":"In short, this radio works surprisingly well.I was able to pick up shortwave stations from various countries (China, Japan, Cuba, Romania, etc.) with generally acceptable clarity. The various religious stations located here in the U.S. come through very clearly indeed, and at no point was I wishing for more volume -- the speaker in this thing can be ridiculously loud, given its compact size.That said, this thing is cheap. Which means isolating signals from smaller stations can be a bit of a hassle. I haven't tried the earbuds that are included with the set, but I suspect they aren't any better than the usual \\"free headphones\\" you get on airplanes and such.But again, this unit is surprisingly good.

AM/FM come thru just fine, and Iwas able to pick up quite a few stations on the SW bands even in theafternoon. I'm in North TX and was able to hear Radio Havana, RadioChina Intl and Radio Canada, as well as a few other ones I could notidentify. There is some signal drift and few stations came in crystalclear, but for that you will need a real (and expensive) SW receiver.For the price, this is more than appropiate for a casual shortwavelistener or someone who wants a good emergency radio.**EDIT: After about a month of using this radio, I realized thatthe shortwave frequencies are labelled wrong. For example, the needlesits on 11.35 mhz, but you're really listening to 11.75 mhz. Irevised my review and shaved two stars off for what is a major,major defect. I'd rate it lower if it wasn't so cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This radio cannot isolate stations, and as I flip through ALL of the SW bands, all I get are AM and FM stations all overlapping.. It's borderline impossible to isolate any one station on any band outside of FM without having at least one other station audible in the background.. Bad circuitry or something, because it seems that everything is polluted by AM and FM.. Like they screwed up the circuitry allowing cross-over..

Of four regular stations in the area, this radio only picks up two.

As undersecretary of state under Carter he was the key U.S. player in the Iranian hostage release, warmly adding how a restaurant applauded him at dinner shortly after coming home from those negotiations.

The holes in the hitch lined up perfectly with the factory holes. I had to drill 2 holes for the 3rd and 4th left side bolts, but the u-bolt slid into the frame rail easily. I was a little ticked that the receiver pin did not have the cotter pin type clip that prevents the pin from falling out (It looked like the bag had been opened previously). Luckily I had an old clip from my last hitch, but if I didn't, I would've had to spend another $6 to get a new pin and clip. Minor setback, but It should come with all the hardware. It would've got 3 stars if I hadn't had an extra. And it would've got 5 stars if my muffler didn't rattle against the 3rd bolt on the right side. I removed that inner bolt (2 mounting bolts on the right side is enough for what I tow). It would also be very nice if it came with a plastic or rubber plug for the receiver hole. No biggie though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carmy receiver Hitch by Curt","review":"Recieved the hitch quickly and installed that evening.

My old wallet size is about the same as my Palm Vx in this leather case (but without a lot of junk I used to keep in my old wallet). The rubber spine that holds the Palm Vx in place seems like it could tear if you frequently remove the unit from the case. I just leave it in the case and fold the flaps back for hot-syncing.TIP: I find that it's best to slide the Palm Vx in the case so that the screen faces the flap without the card holders. If you put it in the way shown in the picture, your screen may get scratched from any credit cards you might have in the holders.I wish they put a transparent ID card holder in this case. That's one thing I miss.

It does that just fine and is pretty sturdy. This means it's also fairly thick -- the device with the cover on is nearly twice as thick as the device without the cover on.Another disappointment was the leather clasp. While it does keep the cover shut, the tongue part of the clasp is quite stiff and holds its same position even when the cover is open, blocking the screen, unless I force it out of the way with my pinky as I use device. This is annoying and awkward.Also, the clamshell nature of the cover means that I cannot place the Palm on its charger without removing the case, stashing it somewhere nearby and adding to the clutter on my desk.In short, I would recommend getting a flat, flap-style screen cover instead of a clamshell case, if all you're doing is carrying your Palm around in your pocket or purse, unless what I described above actually appeals to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great (Until It Wears Out After Only 9 Months)","review":"I was pretty satisfied with this case.

In combination with the stylus pen, it was a nice package. Six months later, I'm not so pleased. It is not very good at protecting the palm from inadvertent power-on. It also pins down the up arrow, so alarms barely sound before they're silenced. Worse than that, the rail that holds it to the case is attached with a strip of rubber that is ripping off. This is probably because the rail fit is pretty tight and the edges around where the rail inserts into the Palm are a little sharp. Taking the palm in and out of the case daily (which you need to do to sync or charge) has worn down the rubber. I'm thinking of asking for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design","review":"What a terrible accessory!- The strap that latches the case keeps getting on the way when trying to write.- The Palm V can't fit on the hotsynch craddle without removing the case.

They are not the same. This pair is sloppy on. When I walk around the house without shoes, just socks, the bottoms slip up to the side of my foot. I have to keep reaching down and adjusting. The material is very different, feels cheaper, like something I could buy at the big discount stores. This sock has 85% acrylic and the previous pairs had 70% coolmax. I will check the material more carefully next time and stick with the coolmax."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"These were quite heavy.

They wear extremely well too. I am happy to have found a source for these fine socks. Would I recommend them. Absolutely!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Thorlo quality, but REALLY short","review":"Weird little socks -- I tried wearing them on their own and my ankles felt naked... so today I put on a pair of these short socks and a regular pair of Thorlo tennis socks OVER the short socks, and it's working out pretty well.

However, I wear them at work (I'm on my feet all day) and they're great for that and I would imagine they'd be good for long hikes as well.

By that I mean that these are meant to be worn with running shoes. Typically, you want your running shoes to be about half size larger than your regular sneakers. For that reason, a thick sock, like these, will fit perfectly. If your running with a regular shoe that's not made for running, I'm not sure this sock will work well for you. It covers most of your ankle, as a result I've never blistered running with these shoes. Also, I can wear these twice without washing because they're so sturdy. I've worn these socks with running shoes that were a bit past the expiration date (past 300 miles), and the cushioning of the sock made it feel like I was running in shoes with new cushions."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"These socks are amazing for running.

The book, written after Qutb's sojourn in the United States, contains a sharp critique of sexual harassment and the commodification of women. The book explores the political implications of the Muslim practice of zakat. Zakat is ordinarily viewed as a form of charity, a type of alms for the poor. Qutb argues that zakat, properly understood, provides a means for rectifying the imbalances and momentary instabilities of the market while preserving private property and commerce; enables the protection and just distribution of common goods, and provides both principles and practices that secure social welfare without breeding dependency or diminishing human dignity. The most illuminating aspect of the book is the recognition of the importance of human dignity to economic justice and political order. Qutb is of interest not only to Muslims but to anyone interested in political economy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Intolerance & Poor Scholarship","review":"Qutb's book is a study in cultural chauvinism, filled with denigration of foreign cultures and religions. In a clash between tradition and modern, Qutb seeks refuge in reactionary rejection of the present and fantasies of some Golden Age that probably never was. He retreats to radical interpretations of the Quran, which he claims are the \\"original\\" ones, but which contradict the Quran itself. The Quran calls Jews and Christians, \\"People of the book\\". Qutb calls the 'jahili', barbarians. The Quran has five pillars: daily statement, daily prayer, Hajj, Ramadan, charity. Qutb replaces these with his favoirte, \\"jihad\\". Mohammed himself calls battle jihad \\"the small jihad\\", and prefers the \\"big jihad\\" of overcoming ones self. Qutb ignores this totally. So essentially, Qutb replaces the Quran with his own distorted reading of it, based on culture shock and bigotry, and has the audacity to call his own extremists views the \\"true\\" Islam."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Berryman, Collected Poems","review":"I ordered this book as a birthday present to myself.

The 4.7s work great, I even get what should be DL space items compressed without much quality loss to the 4.7sThis is very bad.

Well, I have since attempted to burn three Memorex DVDs that either didn't pass the verification process or failed to play the whole video without some sort of glitch. In each instance, without changing anything (same software, same burner, same video, same PC and same player), I burned the same videos on Verbatim disks and all three burned and played without a glitch. The only reason I didn't give a 5-star rating is I've only used three disks of the thirty- pack. Based on my experience with other brands, three disks may work, and you may have to throw away the next three.

The Bounty napkin maaaaaaaaaay be just a tad puffier, but not by much. These are definitely comparable and are made from recycled paper. I LOVE knowing that they are made from recycled paper and can be recycled again. It makes me feel really good to know I'm helping our poor planet in this small way.

I have extremely sensitive skin with allergic reactions to most razors. I found these razors a couple of years ago. There have been a few times I've been forced to use an inferior brand in a pinch and I end up with legs on fire. I don't know what I do differently than the reviews above, but I do know I've had a lifetime of miserable shaving results until I found these.

I've randomly tried other razors, and I keep coming back to these. I have really sensitive skin and these don't seem to cause irritation. They don't pivot (which I actually prefer) and you do have to hold them at a slightly different angle than a 2 blade razor if you don't want to cut yourself. I think that explains why a lot of people report problems with them, but after that initial learning curve these are great, no more cuts, and I find that the angle for these is a a bit more ergonomic than I've found in other razors."},{"rating":"1","title":"CUT MY ARM!!","review":"I purchased the Soleil razor and it cut my underarm BADLY!

I might have been able to tolerate that. However, there was also an electronic whistle increasing in frequency with the RPM of the engine. The whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player. The volume of the Coby CA-747 was ok. I hadn't thought that would be an issue until I bought a comparable Maxell cassette adapter at Long's to replace the Coby CA-747. The volume with the Maxell product was very weak, and I had to turn it way up. The Maxell didn't go click-click-click, but it whistled, too. So both the Maxell and the Coby get 1 star from me.

Sound quality is what you would expect from a tape player, it isn't stellar but it's nothing to complain about especially at this price. It has a headphone cable, so can be connected to a walkman, iPod, laptop, or mp3 device which is very convenient.My only issue with this item is that occasionally the tape player won't accept it, and will pop it back out, but after a few tries, it usually works. I'm not sure if this is a problem with my particular tape player as I have not tried it in any other, or whether it is a product flaw. However, it doesn't happen too often and isn't much of a hassle to pop back in once or twice.Overall, I would certainly recommend this as a cheap yet very effective way of playing your iPod or other device through your car stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Connector does not fit iPhone","review":"I have tried this with 2 iPhones.

At first, the adapter worked like a charm . It was quiet, without static, and adjusted just fine to changing volume.However, after about a month and a half, the adapter started to interrupt itself, cutting out and grinding audibly, even occasionally forcing itself to eject from the tape player. It still works somewhat, but its overall durability leaves something to be desired and it is only a matter of time before the thing completely dies.I should note that I did try to take the precautions listed in the adapter manual. I did not leave the adapter in the cassette player while not in use, and was careful with it.My bottom line: you're gambling if you buy this adapter. Maybe it will last.

However I cannot deny the superior sound quality they offer compared to a radio transmitter, and I highly recommend them.If you have problems with this device I would suggest checking your tape deck. Most problems with be with that, and not this device however that is also possible. You may have to wedge something in with the adapter to reach maximum sound quality and avoid the tape turning over while in transit. Any period of silence may enact any 'Next' feature if your tape deck has that installed.I hope this works for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out great","review":"This adapter was working great.

There is something wrong with the friction wheel in the device that fails after a few dozen hours of work. The sound quality when it was working was great. I wanted this to work, since the FM transmitter products I have used have not met my expectations and cost a lot more.I bought two of these items and the other one has lasted a little longer but it is starting to show the same signs. One suggestion is flipping the cassette part over if you can use it that way in your player. This seems to work for a short drive, but you end up flipping the cassette over and over on long drives and the wires usually get in the way when you're not inserting it in what would seem like the primary direction for your player."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"I have a Kenwood Tape Player in my beefed up 81 Jeep CJ7.

In short, when you read the fine print on the package, it says, \\"may not work in cassette players that have auto-reverse\\". Mind you, the Sony and Memorex adapters I bought and used for years had no issue with my auto-reverse (aren't they all auto reverse??).

Thanks god, before doing that I deceided to give this cassette adapter a try. Good for any mp3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Works like it is supposed to. TThe different positions are a bonus too. Only problem is I only have 1 car with a tape deck, and I never drive it."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works.","review":"It works. Yeah, it's kinda quiet. But I'm one of those analog lovers and I do actually listen to tapes and I've noticed that all tapes play quieter than the radio in my car. Is this true for all cars? I don't know. But before you freak and think there's something wrong with the adapter maybe just consider that ALL cassettes are different than the radio, and this adapter is, in fact, a cassette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"The cassette adapter works wonderfully and I really like the dual position allowing for any kind of holder. I would highly recommend this product to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive, easy to use, works perfectly","review":"This is one of those surprisingly inexpensive items that worked exactly the way it was supposed to straight out of the package. I haven't had the problem mentioned by other reviewers regarding my tape player going into auto-reverse, but the directions posted by them on how to handle it look simple. The sound quality sounds good to me (FYI, I don't play music at super high volumes) and mostly, it's easy to use and it WORKS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job superbly","review":"After a lot of research I was down to the Coby and Sony adapters. I own a lot of Sony audio products so was tempted to go in for the Sony one. But I was not sure of these kind of adapters and the Coby cost $8 as against $13 for the Sony. So I placed my bet on the Coby (didn't have much to lose). Havn't been disappointed since. I use it in my Honda Accord factory installed system along with my Samsung K3 player. Works as good as the CD player. Only thing to note is to get the best performance is to ensure you have good quality MP3 (128 kbps and above, recommended is 192 to get true CD quality).There was some disturbance using it once but after some rest to the adapter the problem has not returned. Not sure if it was the adapter, player or the system itself. Will update this review if the problem persists. In conclusion I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lead warning","review":"The small-typeface instructions contain this warning: \\"Handling the cords on this product will expose you to lead....

It keeps repeating cheap items at the end will cost you more money!!!!!! Now I am buying a sony adapter...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coby Cassette Adapter","review":"This product did not work in my car. No matter what I tried to do, as per instrucions from other reviewers, it would not work. Within two seconds after I would insert the cassette adapter, the car's tape deck would eject the adapter. A complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auto-Reverse","review":"This adapter didn't work in my car because of the auto-reverse feature, and it seems that a lot of people are having trouble with this...In my opinion they should make a separate adapter that doesn't have auto-reverse on it, then people will buy that instead of seeing what they have to do to make it work, and then end up not buying the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works for short time, then rejects all the time.","review":"I was happy with this for a couple of weeks. I used this for 10-20 minute driving. Even though it was a little bit of noisy, over all it worked fine. After 3 hrs trip, it rejects all the time. if anybody knows how to fix this problem, please post here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"i like it alot. sound quality is really good, and the fact that you can put it into multiple types of cassette players is a real benefit.one bad thing is that the cable is way too long. its so long that your mp3 player can fall out of your car, without the cord holding it back. i lost my ipod touch because of this.great product, highly recommended to anyone with a car with not way to connect an mp3 player. much better sound quality than a fm transmitter.ps, there is some white noise in the background, because of the way sound is transferred by the adapter"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is really unreliable","review":"I was really excited to plug my Zune into this so that i could listen to music in my car. However, when i began to play a song before it got to the end the tape would pop out. I cannot tell you how annoying that is. I am going to best buy to get another one because the one i got is clearly faulty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problem as others have mentioned","review":"When I insert the adapter,it pops right back out again after a few seconds. Since I can't turn off auto-reverse on my tape player ('97 Avalon), I tried the other poster's suggestions about removing one of the gears inside the adapter, but that did not help. I called Coby and the person on the line claimed that they have had no reports of this problem. So she couldn't help me. By the way, there is no knowledge base on their web site for any of their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"My car cassette player hated this!","review":"I am sure this might work well for people whose cassette players don't do auto-reverse, but I can't turn that feature off in mine, so my iPod played for about 30 seconds and then turned off. Drove me nuts!!! It worked when the car wasn't actually moving, so maybe it's just my player, but I returned it and got something better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work As Expected","review":"Given that you are converting your digital iPod or MP3 player to an analog cassette player that probably hasn't been use in awhile ( or ever), that this concept provides any measure of audio quality it amazing. But this Coby does the job. You lose some high and low frequencies in the translation, but unless you have an ultra high car stereo (then you probably have an MP3 port) you really aren't hearing those frequencies anyway. I move the unit from a Passat to an Outback, one the cassette goes the long way, the other the wide way, both work find with no cord binding. I have had no trouble with any autoreverse issues in either car. I select Dolby off on both factory decks for a wider range of sound. I have tried some different brands with all kinds of problems, and had none with the Coby. So if you have a stock deck, or aftermarket with no MP3 input, this is the way to go on the cheap. It sounds better than FM radio in both cars. For the price, it can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"coby ca747 one channel only","review":"You get what you pay for sometimes. The Coby CA747 from day one had sound in only the left channel. Putting my finger in the cassette opening and pushing down seemed to get two channels occasionally but then nothing. The auto revers fix described in one of the reviews did not fix the issue but I knew this was not the problem. Just seems the head was not aligned with the cars cassette deck. Going to another vehicle had the same issues. A much pricier unit purchased from a local big box retailer works great. Based upon the reviews and being cheap I thought I'd give this one a chance. A gamble that didn't pay out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Can't take the heat","review":"This product performed very well when I first opened it and began using it. But less than a week after I received it, it stopped working properly. The sound quality was completely out of whack, as though the internal equalizer was shot. Only one instrument in a song's mix would be audible and the others would fade into the background. It made the music completely un-listenable. Granted this is July and the inside of my car was probably over 100 degrees for most of those days, it was still permanently damaged after only 5 days!The instructions told me not to leave my device in the cassette player while it was not in use so I removed it and left it either in the glove compartment or in between the two front seats. My friends who have similar products always leave theirs in the player and haven't had any problems. Maybe the instructions are flawed and that led to its downfall. Either way, I don't recommend this as a summer buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy - breaks first day","review":"This thing broke the first day. After testing it once, taking it out, putting it back in, and playing again, it only plays on half the speakers in my japanese car. It's only 9 bucks, so not really worth returning. It's crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good item.","review":"It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player. It kept wanting to stop and turn the tape over. Very annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously Flawed","review":"I've used my Coby cassette adapter for about six months. I'd buy a new car stereo, but my car isn't very new and it's one of those double height models, limiting my choices of replacement radios by quite a lot.At first it seemed to work OK, as long as I didn't push the stereo plug all the way into my MP3 player. After a while though, it seemed that no matter how much or little I pushed the stereo plug into my player, it wouldn't work right. It would either only play one channel if it was pushed in all the way, or I'd have to hold it in halfway for it to work. After a while it would cut out all the time.At first I thought the problem was with my MP3 player, but when I bought a different one, I could only get sound out of one of the two stereo channels. I've since switched to aWalkman Car Connecting Pack for MD Walkman and CD Walkman (Model# CPA-9C)and it works fine.Get the Sony instead. It works properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"invest in something else","review":"It \\"works\\" -- but it's terrible. The clicking/whirring is incessant and loud, the cassette distorts the music in such a way that the singers are inaudible and the instrumentation is overbearing, and this Colby cassette adaptor is clearly just a poor quality product.I guess this is what I get for paying so little, but I am going to go buy something that actually works instead. This was a waste of money, and it's not even worth what I paid for it. Frankly it really wouldn't even be worth it if it were free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ejected","review":"Returned item as it would be ejected by my vehicle's cassette palyer after two minutes everytime I tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Does not work well at all in either of our vehicles, skips and stops altogether, sound is awful."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],N={key:0},B={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-5106376c"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/22.md","filePath":"guide/22.md"}'),H={name:"guide/22.md"},P=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
