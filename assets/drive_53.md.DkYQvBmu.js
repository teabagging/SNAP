In less than a week my daughter broke out in the worse rash I had ever seen! There were open blisters and nothing I tried seemed to provide her any relief.

Not only that, the silica comes out like a soft gel, and is extremely hard to clean. And of course, our biggest concern has been safety. How safe is that gel if the baby accidentally consumes it?

Even with Cruisers, though, there are no worries/hassles/leaks like the other brands...The cost here is about the same right now as Costco but you get the luxury of having them delivered for free at Amazon (right now at least!)

Now they soak through. They leak, not from the sides but staight from the middle of the diaper. They can not be worn wet for more than a short time b/c they will soak right through. I recently found a size 5 left over from over 3 years ago and this problem did not occur. I definitely don't remember having this issue.

Our pediatrician had no idea what it was and prescribed an anti-fungal ointment and a hydrocortisone lotion. After more than a week using both, the rash just continued to get worse. We bought a package of Pampers Baby Dry just to see if a different diaper helped, and the rash cleared up within two days. I didn't really believe that it was the Cruisers diapers causing the rash since the Swaddlers and Baby Dry were fine (all Pampers brand), but when we tried using the Cruisers on him again a few weeks later (we had a ton left over) the rash came back after just a day. I did a quick search online and found lots of people have this problem. If you use these diapers, watch carefully for a rash and change to a different line of diapers right away if you see it and save your baby the pain and discomfort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pampers cruisers","review":"Pampers has the best diapers for babies!

I loved the swaddlers,baby dry and cruisers so I decided to stick with Pampers when I finally needed to buy diapers. I bought the size 3 Cruisers with Drymax and they are actually pretty terrible. There is no leak guard in the rear so i'm thinking that's why every time my little boy goes #2 it comes right out of the back of the diaper! Needless to say i'm very disappointed with the new Cruisers. The only thing good about them is they do hold a lot of pee, which is all my baby does through the night, so i'll keep using them for nighttime only. I've had absolutely no leaks as far as pee goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Design Is A Failure","review":"They changed the design of the Cruisers diapers. We used to buy Pampers Baby-Dry diapers for day use and Cruisers for night use. The Baby-Dry diapers couldn't hold in the wetness all night long but worked great for day use and were cheaper than the Cruisers. Now the new Cruisers can no longer hold in the wetness all night either. We no longer see the advantage of buying the Cruisers over the Baby-Dry diapers. We haven't experienced the diaper rash issue that others have. We'll continue to buy the Baby-Dry diapers for now, but we won't buy the Cruisers anymore. I don't know why companies feel the need to mess with a great product. I'm sure it was another bad marketing department decision.

I would be very leary about purchasing these diapers. My daughter does not have sensitive skin and we have not changed anything. The only thing that changed was the makeup of the diaper itself.

They are thin, yet, absorbant. I have given the other brands (private labels and Huggies)a chance over the years, but nothing comes close to Pampers. Not only are they absorbant, they are soft and are great for chubby legs! Cruisers stretch and have more of a \\"fabric\\" feel to it. For those who have chubby kids, the right size cruisers will not leave any red uncomfortable marks on your kid's legs. We were recently on vacation and after 5 hours of flight. 1 diaper was all it took. Our son pees a fountain, but the diaper held up. No leaks and son was kept dry, as usual. Huggies would never have held up. In addition, if your child wears the Huggies for more than 1-2 hours, the diapers end up releasing these gel bits on your child's skin. Yuck. Why bother with Huggies when you can have Pampers?

But that problem was solved for me by going up one size in diapers.) They are the best diapers I've seen on the market.

I can count on one hand the number of times he has leaked through/blown out of a Pampers diaper. They are great diapers - high quality and good design.

I've had leaks, which I've reported to Customer Service. They acted as if they were unaware of how many unhappy consumers there were, despite complaints all over the internet. When my baby wore these overnight, the dye... or something else from the diaper... stained the inside of her light-colored sleeping pants. Also, her diaper area looks irritated, which is not usual for her. After hearing about the CPSA investigation into this diaper, I am switching immediately to a different brand. I'm really disappointed with Pampers, and in Proctor & Gamble for their lack of attentiveness to customer complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same cruisers","review":"BUYERS BEWARE!!!! Do not pay attention to all the positive ratings prior to December 2009. The product is not the same.I have been a pamper customer since the day my baby was born. The old swaddlers and cruisers were great, with the mesh lining. However, pampers switched the product without changing the packaging, duping its customers to pay the same premium $$ for an inferior product. The new cruisers are horrible and prone to leaking as the new lining doesn't hold the same amount of pee overnight. Gone is the mesh lining that used to wick away the moisture from baby's skin. Seems like these new cruisers are the old Pampers Baby Dry.I guess now I will have to search for another brand, since I am so disappointed with Pampers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy New Pampers Cruisers!","review":"We were disappointed to see that Pampers changed their diapers without notifying consumers. The biggest complaint we have was the removal of the mesh liner - which was the whole reason we were loyal to buying Pampers Cruisers. These diapers give our daughter a horrible rash now every time she wears one. We have since switched to cloth and will not buy any Pampers product again unless they bring back the old liner. There is also NO absorbent layer on the entire back panel of the diaper! If DD is laying on her back, it all just comes right out the back side! They are an inferior product now, but still charging premium prices. I'd rather buy a store brand at this point, if I weren't totally giving up on disposables altogether! Very upset about this change. We used to love them, and have been buying them since DD was born - but no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the old cruisers!!!","review":"Yes we found out, too, when the new box was delivered. I noticed right away it was so thin and the mesh lining was nowhere to be found. Sigh... I went to Pampers website and they don't mention anything. I guess they didn't want to advertise they cut cost. The exterior of box looks the same, too, except the product is no longer the same quality. On Amazon product description diagram, they show the old design with mesh liner, which is no longer there. Pampers cruiser now looks like their cheaper Baby Dry model. We've been using pampers since my daughter was a newborn, when I tried so many diapers and decided on cruisers. But now we will have to change to something else! It's not Amazon's fault but we will be stopping our diaper subscribe & save, too. Arg.... So annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pamper changed - now they leak","review":"I bought a new box a cruisers and notice right away there was no mesh liner anymore.

I loved pampers swaddlers and cruisers, i used them for my son, they were the best and worth the extra money, NOT ANYMORE! I will never buy them again. we are on a tight budget but i would pay extra for cruisers, not anymore, they leak, they don't have the mesh lining, they give my boy very bad rashes, it's horrible! this is how they treat us loyal customers,swapping quality for trash and charging the same. despicable. save your money until they hear us customers and change back to the quality we've come to expect and were willing to pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the 35% price hike?","review":"We started ordering pampers from Amazon a few months ago, when Pampers were $7.49 a pack. Why all the sudden the $3.00 price increase? That is a huge and unfair rate increase, and makes ordering online no longer a savings. I can get a better price at Meijer ($9.49), and that's BEFORE I use coupons. It's disappointing that this product will no longer be offered at a good price.

However, over the past year and from multiple stores - including 4 boxes we just bought on Amazon - we have had issues with the Economy Pack (or whatever it's called). At least half, if not more, of the diapers are defective and my children wake up in the morning with the little absorbing beads all loose, the diaper split open, and a big giant mess.

My three cases of diapers were shipped free to my doorstep within five days of the order placement.Prior to using Pampers Cruisers we used Huggies Supreme with our active toddler but we decided that Pampers were far better for us in the end because they are less bulky and the tabs stay attached much better. Further, a simple call to pampers for defective diapers renders generous coupons as they stand behind their product. In sum, you get a good value from a good company."},{"rating":"2","title":"fits well","review":"Pampers are rated the best in many baby books.

Cloth like, very little leakage, no leaking blue gels, and no stuck together gatherings. Unfortunately, I found out that my second child all the sudden became allergic to Pampers; I think it's the new ones with dry weave liners. He started to have red bumps on his bottom everywhere not characteristic of diaper rash (back, crotch, scrotum) and will not go away with diaper rash cream, topical antibiotics nor antifungals. I'm a pediatrician so I was really puzzled. I finally switched him to Huggies and used steroid cream and they went away. I even called Pampers and they told me that the diapers are still the same. ?@$#$ I found out that this is not uncommon with Pampers. So moms beware. If your baby comes down with just red bumps everywhere and will not get better with diaper rash crea or antifungals (nystatin, clotrimazole), it might be an allergic reaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is poor","review":"quality is much worse than DRY BABY, but much more expensive than that.

I would be very leary about purchasing these diapers. My daughter does not have sensitive skin and we have not changed anything. The only thing that changed was the makeup of the diaper itself.

I highly recommend it to anyone designing websites, and parts of it to anyone who is hiring someone else to design or redesign their site. By using the methods described in this book and looking at other sites the person has done, you will better assess the quality of the person you are interviewing for the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have book for anyone","review":"I bought this book along with a few others, and I have to say, this is one book I can't put down! Literally I have it with me when I'm going around to see clients, in the car for a quick read, or to illustrate things to people.I have some clients I work with closesly who I have been trying to teach these underlying concepts to for quite a while, but I've now bought them a copy of this book to read, because it's short, concise, excellent information, and well illustrated.I'm a web designer, and this has affected how I design/code things in a huge way. I think about things like \\"I shouldn't just name that button Salons, because we can't have people even second think what it could mean for a split second\\", and therefore choose to name it something self-explanatory like 'Find a salon' etc.Couldn't recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely stunning book on usability","review":"This book is fabulous. It is very clear and easy to read, it points out how far you can get by just using common sense (and how you can develop it if you haven't got it), includes basic design principles and human psychology as well as some pretty strong examples. It shows you how a usability test can be performed and talks about what you should focus on. I very much like the approach that there is no average user and not just one correct way to design a site. This book is of great value, a true classic and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the topic. It is so well layouted and designed that I don't need a marker to highlight anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book for Web design","review":"This is a very helpful book for web design.

A quick read with good advice and guidance. The author definitely knows his stuff and does a good job of communicating the information in a succint manner. My only minor complaint is that the website samples are very dated and it would be nice to see those updated. I would also be interested to hear this author's opinion of more recent websites as many of them already have adopted some of his initial guidelines. So I would be curious to see what he would do now with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book! However...","review":"It's a good book on narcissistic traits. However, it would be great to learn more how to interact with narcissists, because sometimes we can't just avoid interaction with them. And they are human beings too. So, I hope, next edition will have a good instructional chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it really the best usability book?","review":"I have always heard about this book like the best usability book. \\"It was wrote time ago, with outdated websites as example, but the concepts are the same\\", I always heard. No way. (Review for Kindle Edition)I have been working in web development for the last 10 years, and I am a advanced internet user. So this books only cover things that every web designer or web developer should know if he have a little experience.The most valuable chapter is the one of user testing, that's because I have never done that tests in my work and it was new for me.But if you have a background in web design o web development, this book it's not very useful. Also, the website analysed are so old, that they have not much sense nowdays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining & Informative","review":"This is an excellent book on web site usability.

Clear and simple, easy to understand. If picked up in a shop, I would not have bought it.- not much content, lots of whitespace, large fonts, lots of images- common sense (ie, most of it you probably already know)Read a few pages, then sent it to a friend who is building her first website."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE waste of time and money","review":"If you have been on the internet several times over the past few years, you do not need to read this book. The content is very basic and examples are outdated. You can spend $3K for a website and you will still have a much superior website than the examples in this book. I recommend browsing the web for the websites of topbrands and also cool new start ups. The book is pretty, but is a total waste of time even though it takes only a few hrs at most to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is annoying","review":"For a guy that clams to be an expert on usability, this book for me has one fatal readability flaw.It is peppered with footnotes. Most are relevant and should be part of the text. Some are references and could be added in a \\"Suggested further reading\\" appendix. And some are pure noise.It makes the book hard to read. You read along and hit a footnote. You then need to look down to find out if the footnote is substance or not. Then find you way back to the text.This book loses nothing and would gain a lot if the footnotes went bye-bye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it when it was $40 - waste of money...","review":"This is just an ok book - nothing life changing. It cost me $40, then the publisher brought it down to $24. This is a $15-19 book. I'm upset I had to pay $40 for it. Asides from this personal issue, the book is ok, nice read. I would pick it used or borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"One of the most overrated books in the history of design publishing.Dated and obvious when first published, completely useless now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Binding fell apart on first reading","review":"The book fell apart as I was reading it for the first time. Perhaps book usability could also have been addressed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking","review":"I recently started working for an e-commerce company and needed to get up to speed quickly on a range of usability issues. This book really helped me to educate myself quickly. It is easy to read, enjoyable and informative. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read one book on designing a Website, read this","review":"This book was well written and has excellent examples. It's an easy read so it's easy to pass around the office. It was nice to give this book to 2 fellow employees who were on the task force to update our site. After reading it, we all were on the same page. I've read many books on designing web sites and this one was the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone designing a web site should read this first.","review":"This book presents clear and consise information that will help improve your web site more than increasing your rank in Google will ever do. Why? Well, if you a user gets to your site but doesn't know what to click or where to find the information they want, then they'll leave. Don't Make Me Think gets you thinking in the mind of the user about how best to present your site in order for users to get the most out of it.It's not a big book and you could probably summarise its contents in a few pages. However, it is an enjoyable read and contains lots of useful information with plenty of colourful pictures and diagrams."},{"rating":"2","title":"What every designer needs to know about usability","review":"If you're responsible for designing anything, website or not, read this book. Now.It's great at explaining why usability needs to be the primary concern in developing any sort of interface. The way a user looks at a site is very different than the way a designer does, and \\"Don't Make Me Think\\" points these things out clearly and easily.Even the title is a lesson, one of the most important in the book; \\"Don't Make Me Think.\\" If the interface makes the user think when they don't need to, it's bad. Cartoons, short chapters, and plenty of illustrations make this a quick, light read that will leave you convinced to spent more time on usability.While the book's shortness is one of its strengths, I'd say it's also its only weakness. It convinces you to spend more time on usability, but doesn't go too much into how. But that's covered in many other books, and a few are even given at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think","review":"If you ever wanted to reach into your computer screen and throttle the jerk who made that annoying website, the author does it for you. Very helpful in thinking about the design of my websites.I still find testing hard to implement and suspect others will too. But for general principles, this book nails it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read - for everyone","review":"We may not all create web sites, but we're all affected by the web and reading books like these would help everyone find some common ground and break through the current web impasse: After all this time most sites are still mostly useless pretty visuals (if even that) and we seem stuck on a string of technologies and fads: blogs, podcasts, facebook, twitter... chatroulette?This book is well written, easy to read, and has plenty of examples. Even seasoned players will find it useful if only as part of their conceptual framework, and to say \\"Amen brother\\" from time to time.My only problem is with the book physically, sheets have begun to fall off and I'm the only one that's read it... Poor usability when you're trying to read and hold the book together..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly useful, sensible advice!","review":"Great book if you are required to write any content for the web.

A must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very informative Book","review":"As the President and Creative Director for AUDIN Web Design [...] I found this book refreshingly informative. This book provided examples and case studies not found in any other book. I think this book was written for the client, but every web designer should read this book to get an outsiders (and insiders) view of web design. Over 95% of web design is wasteful and just awful and this book highlights that fact. This book is not a How-To book but a What-Not-To-Do which brings home the point even better. It's also more effective than some website that criticizes other websites, which I will not mention any names here. Anyway, a great quick read and very informative. I recommend highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me think","review":"Excellent and thought provoking book that helped focus my ideas on web useability. As Project Manager for web design projects, I needed a view from 20,000 feet - this got me there and then brought me down to earth. Very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend for novice and expert web masters alike","review":"Mr. Krug has managed to simply the steps needed to create web sites that are easy to use. We have been on a long term project to improve our web site and now can avoid many of the usability problems outlined in his book.Thanks Mr. Krug"},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers 80% of the cases","review":"This book is a very useful introductory text on usability. On scanning (no pun intended - the author has a chapter on how web users scan) the book I discovered it has valuable insight into almost all day to day issues we have designing sites which work. It helps you with a reality check on your site. You may not find solutions to your usability problems, but what you will find are suggestions and approaches to find a solution which works. The language and flow are really simple and that's what I liked most of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, quick read","review":"Steve Krug follows his own advise and lays out the book in such a way that you can absorb the first six chapters, the good ones, in no time, and leaves you with a much better understanding of the problem of making anything usable. Everyone making web sites or software of any sort for use by someone else needs to have read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Everyone who designs web apps should have a copy of this book.It changes how you think about Interactive architecture and page usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"reliable","review":"the book came immediately, and since i should have ordered it 2 weeks earlier for homework, that was a Good Thing. yay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth reading","review":"I am definitely not a usability expert but I was expecting much more substance from a \\"self proclaimed\\" expert. The examples are so obvious, dumbed down and old (from 1999-2000). I think this book should entirely be written with Web 2.0 in mind. I agree that design principles do not change over time, and this book is not about technology, but users expect more and more with new technologies. While some design patterns stay the same, some evolve and become expected with the advent of newer technologies.Don't waste your time with this book, and buy a more recently written book for people who really want to know about usability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book years ago","review":"For me this is one of the more pointless books that I have bought. Years ago I think this would have been a great read. But these days there are so many great examples of clean,user friendly and consistent sites that reading a book like this is not really needed. Just take a look at the more popular sites these days to see what to do (Amazon.com was an example used in the book).If your still not sure what makes a clean, user friendly site I guess that you can buy this book. I mean there are a lot of terrible sites these days as well. Just don't expect it to be anything ground breaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to read once","review":"I had to read this book in a college course a few years ago and it was somewhat outdated then. I bought this book for my wife and she agrees with me that it's a quality book to read once since it teaches usability basics, but don't expect to find the newest and greatest UI/UX information in this publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read enough","review":"Well, I've read enough to know that this book delivers exactly what it promises. Worth your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"What? You don't have this book yet?","review":"I am a professional Web developer and designer working for a large hospital and many smaller clients. Here's what I say to members of my team and to freelancers coming to me in search of work:\\"I don't even want to see your portfolio if you haven't read this book.\\"It is not the ONLY book of smart design, but it is THE book on smart design.Another one that I highly recommend, not as a substitute for \\"Don't Make Me Think,\\" but as a go-along, is \\"Designing the Obvious: a common sense approach to web application design\\" by Robert Hoekman Jr.If you can only afford one, get \\"Don't Make Me Think,\\" or don't bother showing your portfolio to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful information. Quick, easy read.","review":"Great book, full of useful info written in a clear, concise way. Read it cover to cover in an afternoon and started implementing what I'd learned immediately!

Great read for web designers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but the last part made me think","review":"Very useful information, but like many books bogs down a little on the back end. Other than that, the book practices what it preaches.

Thank you Steve Krug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think, just buy it!","review":"Excellent book.Being an internet user, i'm used to the tipical usability flaws on web applications. Being a developer, i'm used to write programs that work and also, to blame users that \\"don't get it\\". Well, after reading this book, turns out i'm now a smarter user and a better developer.Quoting the book: \\"Like a lot of common sense, it's not necessarily obvious until after someone's pointed it out to you\\". As a developer, i needed it. I've read it in 2 days (large fonts are used).The bookbinding however is not very good (pages are not very well attached)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have","review":"If you're involved in developing (as myself) or designing web-sites (or any other software intended for actual people), this book will give you helpful insights in the usability issues you are bound to encounter.The book is very well written, and is fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book before you build your website or blog","review":"Steve Krug's book is full of solid, easily understood advice on web usability. But even more than that, he covers a lot of ground, indirectly, on how to deal with clients (for web designers) and how to think about, plan, and execute a web project (for the rest of us). Add to that the clear layout and design of the book, the engaging writing and humor, and you have probably the best book on usability design on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krug book","review":"I think this is a great book. It uses common sense terms and it is easy to understand. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for beginners and good review for experienced web designers!","review":"I am new to web page design. Krug's book is succinct and humorous. He holds to his goal of being readable in a long plane trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have reference on your web-building bookshelf","review":"I bought this book to supplement a class I am taking to update my web design skills (I've been involved in web design & content management for over ten years).I was a bit hazy on the \\"infrastructure\\" lesson, so I asked my teacher which book she recommended for extra information. She recommended this one.THANK GOODNESS she did!It's easy to read and understand and it's short so it did NOT end up in the pile o' books I have yet to read (I literally read half of it the day it arrived on my doorstep). It clarified all of my questions and doubts on how to organize a website and how to design for ease of use.This book is a BLESSING in every sense.Thank you so much, Steve, for a fantastic reference!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thin book with everything you need","review":"This book is excellent. It's very accessible and easy reading without being superficial. It's not a usability cookbook, it actually makes you understand its principles and gives you critical sense to analyze any website and see what's wrong (or right) with it.I just couldn't find any negative points about the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandatory reading for developing on the Web","review":"As it promises, Steve Krug's Don't Make Me Think: 2nd Edition, is a quick, but extremely usable, guide to Web usability and design. The book took me less than a day to read (less than 3 hours), but has become, in my mind, a requirement for even beginners (like myself) of Web design. Since everyone who develops for the Web should have some idea of design and usability, this book should really be a mandatory requirement for said work.In short, there's no reason not to read this book if you're developing for the Web (writing content, programming, etcetera), or working with a team that does so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impress your clients","review":"Steve walks the talk with this beautifully laid out and wonderfully structured book about usability. This book is perfect for anyone who wants to understand how real people use the internet, indeed, how real people read just about anything.

This book is amusing and very easy to read - it's the best book on web usability I've found."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy + practical","review":"read this book in about 2 hours. no chatter, just meat. lots of illustrations to help you visualize and practical tips that you can easily implement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exemplary!","review":"This book is truly fantastic. I read it once and then immediately once again. It is incredibly informative; very interesting; truly insightful. It not only presents the bigger picture of the wonderful world of websites, but also presents examples, delves into details, and is written in a great, quirky tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Although most of the things mentioned in the book are just plain common sense, I'd still recommend it to anyone who works in the web industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common sense is obvious - so why do we miss it so often?","review":"I bought this book to help me with a project at work. I'm not an IT person but have somehow managed to get involved in an IT development project that requires me to focus on the user experience for a new system we're developing. We all know - on some level - what annoys us when we're searching the internet, but we don't always know why it's annoying. Or we don't always recognise why some sites are almost a pleasure to browse. This book has helped me understand some of the fundamental, common sense practices that make the difference between a good browsing experience and an annoying (or downright bad) one. It's an easy read that uses practical screen samples to demonstrate what it's saying. I've found it very useful and it has definitely made me look at my project in a different way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great content on creating a navigable site or templates.","review":"This book is good for beginners graphic designers.

Highly recommend this as an intro book to web usability and design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"Interesting to illuminate historical context, but political goals make for a read that is both woefully predictable and, I hope we can assume, unpersuasive. Interesting and useful to historical scholars and racists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent biography of important American architect and designer.","review":"The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright is a thoughtful, well crafted presentation of a gifted man who through his entire life was concentrating on creating special and unique architectural designs which incorporate the site - landscaping which supports and illuminates the design, the architecture itself, which stretches technology and imagination to its limits, the interior design which complements the end users life and lifestyle and the furnishings - furniture and accessories, textiles which are an extension of the design and a part of a well thought out whole.Great visual presentations of a great variety of Wright projects.Also, it is very nice to have the narration for the film done by award winning actress Anne Baxter who was Frank Lloyd Wright's granddaughter.Overall, very worthwhile for those who don't know or who already know about the man and his work. Very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't think so, sorry","review":"I hate to say this but this anime didn't catch my eye, and I didn't catch the comedy of it either.The story line is paper thin and you get the feeling as you watch each character introduce themself as if this is the second season of a long running show, that didn't sit well with me. I like some sort of beginning point: I'd stick to anime shows like; Fruits Basket, Midori Days, Chobits, Sister Princess and in August release of Negima: CAN'T WAIT!But who knows I stopped watching at the middle of episode two and put it in my discarded files of anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful gift book","review":"I have read many biographies written by Elizabeth Sherill that have blessed me, but to see into her own heart and life is a delightful experience.

I found that not to be the case though. The closest they come to that is the closing track \\"Oloololo\\". Still, that doesn't carry a worldbeat sound though. All in all, the high points here are \\"From A Moving Train\\" and \\"Wednesday Morning\\". \\"Town & Country\\" has some good character, as does \\"Overwhelming World Suite\\".

Think about that!This album should have never been released. For a classy group like America with a fairly impressive pedigree and an historical string of quality projects..especially their first few releases...this one is agonizing to listen to and makes your heart break for Gerry and Dewey.In the wake of a very solid latter day release like Hourglass, this one is extremely hard to take. Production is unbearably weak. This collection sounds like it was recorded on a shoestring budget. The songs themselves are non descript and the weakest in the entire America canon.Take it from someone who is an avid fan and owner of every single release by the guys, Human Nature is clearly the low point of a long discography.>It is noteworthy that after the abysmal failure of this album America ceased with new recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a page-turner!!","review":"This is without a doubt one of my favorite books. It has a lot of everything. It's a kind of a Sunny Von Bulow thing, inasmuch as the heroine, Babe Devens wakes from a long coma and helps police detective, Vince Cardosa, solve the mystery. You'll love Vince. He travels through new territory as he begins to mingle in the world of the rich and famous to uncover the truth.I have always been surprised that this isn't a movie. It would be a great one. Vince also shows upin other books written by Stewart. Believe me, it's worth ordering. You won't be able to put it down until it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful symphony ruined by terrible conducting.","review":"Sibelius' second symphony is one of my absolute favorite pieces of music. This recording, however, is an absolute travesty. Among other problems, the tempo in this recording is far too fast and it lacks the slowly rising tension that makes the piece so compelling.

And, just to qualify, I have a college degree and read a book or two a week so I am used to different writing styles.Maybe I am just too used to Joyce's straight forward approach and expected more of the same. I stuck with the book through a couple of chapters but could not get one thing out of it because his writing style so obscured any wisdom he was trying to impart. So, I donated it to the library.Personally, I would not invest the money in buying this book and I am sorry I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Waldorf education, home schooling resource","review":"This book needs tags: Waldorf education, Waldorf methods, Waldorf science elementary, Waldorf nature storiesA classic of children's science teaching published in 1882 apparently.

In a phrase we call this \\"making science come alive.\\"Whole-child method elementary teachers who do all their lower elementary science teaching thru storytelling, will appreciate this. Sadly this child-friendly \\"voice\\" in the field of science was extinguished in the U.S. after about 1975.This book may be a valuable science reader book for 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade children who enjoy science."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fairy land of science","review":"I am a scientist, and I regret that the American high-school students are hardly taught the basic knowledge of science - maybe some biology, but certainly not basic physics nor basic chemistry.

I'm sure that 30 years ago it wouldn't have seemed odd to tell your child a story about kisses being passed from one person to another but in today's age it just left a strange feeling with me esp at the part where the skunks kept kissing eachother back & forth.

Up through Doc's Da Name 2000, Redman continued to reach up to higher levels with each of his releases. His beats and lyrics seemed to age like fine wine, improving with time. But with the unfortunate arrival of Malpractice, this has all changed for the worse. Now, we have a tired sounding Reggie Noble who for the first time in his career, has decided to recycle old samples and lyrics from past albums - and not only is this material stale, it's completely out of context with this album. And since when does Redman sample DMX - the very type of rapper who is the exact opposite of the underground (the underground that Redman was apparently content with being a part of in the past). In sum, this album is weak on all fronts. Especially the ... Casio keyboard beats. Reggie - get your a$$ back in the studio and start blazin some hot new [stuff], cuz this album only belongs in the ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Redman himself said this album was wack","review":"The problem with this album was that it was too predictable (same song structure, same guest stars, etc.) and he made a poor choice for a first single (\\"Let's Get Dirty\\").

For your next album, Red, tell producer Erick Sermon to step his game up (for once), and also, chill with those stupid radio skits; they're not funny anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Ever!","review":"This album is by far Reggie's best effort to date. It contains everything you expect from Funk Doc(the hilarious rhymes, tight beats, skits, and the infamous radio stations) and more. It is one of those album you cannot only bump in your car, but sit at home by youself and laugh out loud. The strongest tracks are probably Smash Sumthin', Enjoy Da Ride, and Whut I'ma Do Now, although every song is pretty much amazing. Just like Doc's Da Name 2000, listening to this CD is like listening to an actual radio station, this time properly called WKYA - kicking yo A** radio.

This book inspires me to want to teach it to high school students. It shows how both philosophies of cultural acceptance of the established narrative and an acceptance of creating one's own narrative are just as viable and valid and can even be friends with one another. This is my second book by Abbey and my enjoyment of it is only marred by the fact that I have to keep a dictionary (English and Spanish) nearby."},{"rating":"2","title":"a moving tale of friendship and the cost of progress","review":"A tale of friendship and loyalty in the new west. But the main character Burns is definitley from the old west. It brings up the question of progress; is progress a good thing? It also makes you question what is right and what is wrong. The author Edward Abbey loves to make you question authority and he does it well in this book. A very good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Brave Cowboy","review":"A dull story that went nowhere. I kept hoping this wholly out of touch cowboy was going to deliver a message of \\"the old days and ways were better\\". Instead it was more about an out of touch, confused individual whose life ended without offering any insights. It was one of those books you kept wondering if it would offer some message. NOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\" and his opus \\"A Fool's Progress\\", I was let down by this particular Abbey effort. The cliched character of Burns, the beleaguered cowboy, riding out of the purple-hazed past to rescue an old buddy from the perils of modern times, is shopworn at best. Abbey's prose, usually spectacular, just doesn't seem up to his standards here. Missing, too, were the pyrotechnic polemics that make Abbey so much fun to read. The ending was so thoroughly telegraphed, I felt slightly insulted.

A beautiful witness from the Rialto whorehouse and a prospersous family lead Slocum on a trail that stretches twenty years into the past.... his own!There's really not much going on in this Slocum. The plot and action are confined. I kept waiting for something to \\"happen,\\" but nothing really did. Repetive. Slocum, himself, seemed wimpy and overly-concerned. He even takes on the part of a spur-of-the-moment defense attorney, which I found unbelievable. Slocum is at his best when he's tough, a little self-centered, and down-right mean.

Columbia has always been associated with high quality gear in my mind so we splurged and went for the Gardner Peak. The first time out there was a thunder storm and the sides began to leak. The 2nd time out the zippers on the doors started to catch in the fabric due to what seems to be too much side to side tension across the top of the door. The 3rd time out one of the door zippers came apart and we had to duct tape the door shut. I also had a fiberglass pole split on trip #3 but I fixed it with a hose clamp and electrical tape. During the 5th trip out one of the elastic cords inside the spars broke, another fiberglass spar splintered and the other door zipper came off the track. In all, the $280 tent lasted 5 trips which is about the same cost as 5 nights in a cheap hotel. Not what I expected from Columbia.

But as the story progresses we see that everyone has a secret, including the pre-Cival War home that houses the school.With precise storytelling, Emilie Richards unwinds a wonderful addition to her Shenandoah Album series that brings the residents of Toms Brook into our homes and makes the reader a wonderful addition to the close knit community that cares for one another in a way that now seems foreign to most of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political activism is the theme","review":"After reading Sister's Choice and loving it I thought I had found another author I could enjoy.

The customer service rep told me to order from the Web site then.This kind of disconnect between a company's Web pressence and other incarnations is unexceptable in this day and age. Plus, they are stilling calling my house trying to sell me crap!I never expected a historically beloved and classy magazine like National Geographic to have such shoddy and trashy customer service practices.

Someone called me from Amazon (that is a good thing that they followed up), but she could not give a clear explanation for why it was cancelled -- something to do with the seller having too many or not enough or??? But if this was the case, why is this still being offered? I'm tempted to try ordering again to see what happens, but if this means my son doesn't get his subscription, or we go through this again??

But NatGeo will call, they will call again, sometimes they'll just hang up on you, sometimes they'll pitch a product.With many print publications dying off due to the internet, it's amazing that NatGeo is driving customers away by becoming a 400 lb gorilla.And if they call my house again, I will cancel my subscription, take the loss and call it a lesson learned.

Unfortunately I renewed thru Amazon and they were to transfer my NG order to the publisher of NG so that I would not lose any issues between my existing subscription which is up this month and my renewal....this hasn't happened and I have had no way of contacting Amazon to rectify this situation. So I am writing a review of Amazon and the disappointment in renewing my magazine thru them and now will miss about 3-4 issues until they play catchup. Will think again before renewing thru Amazon.

I ordered it and received the new March issue plus the old January and February issues that I already have. I'll try to call them tomorrow to fix it, but what a pain. I would guess it is because they have lots of old unsold issues lying around anyway.National Geographic has a great magazine and some good documentaries, but their business side is awful.

It just makes me really dislike the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always an eye opener, with great photography","review":"National Geographic is simply a great magazine for people interested in the world. The world of peoples, the world of animals, the world of plants, the world of beautiful places, the world of ugly places. While the text can sound aloof at times, the photos are simply world-class. In fact, I read NG mainly for the photographs. As the Chinese proverb goes, \\"A picture is worth a thousand words.\\" NG hires some of the best portrait and nature photographers who trek thousands of miles each year to bring NG readers amazing and sometimes mesmerizing photos. This magazine truly opens one's eyes and mind.My only minor complaint is the large number of ads in the magazine which sometimes look almost like part of a real story.BTW, Amazon is charging too much for this magazine. You can subscribe on NG's website for almost half of what Amazon charges."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad service... don't buy!","review":"The magazine itself is outstanding. But the service is bad.

Frankly, the issues I've received are very disappointing. Not just because they blindly follow the new style of news magazines (glitzy but shallow), but also their voluminous advertising. The issues are much slimmer and less technical than those of older volumes, the maps less informing, and everything touched with sensationalism. In short, they've become \\"big business\\", and when the subscription expires, that will be it for at least another 20 years.In short, National Graphic has regrettably shifted its focus from its journal to its films. Which is great for the films, of course; but lamentable for the magazine's quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one problem","review":"I love NG Magazine so I decided to take out a subscription (which saves a lot of money) the one complaint I have is how they sent my first shippment.

Well, Persia was there thousands of years a go and its one of the oldest civilisations of the world. New Arabian money can not and will not change that history and will not rename the Persian Gulf.

They changed the names of people, villages, and landmarks from Macedonian to Greek in their attempts to eradicate the Macedonian name. Two things to remember:1.

It takes several tries to print one picture and just isn't worth the hassle. I can't even use it to transfer pictures onto my computer; that's how poorly it operates. I give up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still working after three years","review":"I bought this printer new from a retail store about 3 years ago. I've had no problems with the paper feed or any other mechanical issue. Sometimes (and very rare), it won't be able to read a picture for some reason. Not sure if it's bound by mega pixel size or what but I will select a few pictures to print and once in a blue moon it will say that it can't read one of the pics. After re-sizing the picture with a photo editing tool, I try again and it works. All in all I'm very happy with this Kodak Photo Printer 500."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 strikes & I quit!!!","review":"Bought a Kodak 500 on line. The LCD never worked so I tried prints from my computer. They were washed out & did not come close to the Computer LCD screen image, Kodak instructed me to return the unit to New Jersey at my expense, evan though it never worked. The several hours spent on line with thier customer service & 17.00 for frieght were compensated with a sample film 10 pack worth 2.50 after I complained about the return freight. I recieved a replacement unit about a month later. It was used but \\"certified\\" by the repair center. I set it up & it gave a false empty ink pack message which constantly pops up, it will not work from my directly connected pict bridge equipped camera & the prints I ran from an inserted SD chip are good except the bottom of the pictures are blank with a ragged edge. I am now trying to get a refund & have been instructed to return this unit for repair, ALSO AT MY OWN EXPENSE!! stay clear, Kodak does not back these things for a good reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE - There's a problem somewhere!","review":"We bought this printer at Christmas and the first had a blank screen (software problem).

I am currently reviewing camcorders and are finding reviews very informative. Please take ours to heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Please... find another photo printer.We purchased three units, based on the great reccomondation from Best Buy. Right now, one is making us manually feed the paper (it no longer auto-feeds), another had the same problem, but is now no longer functioning correctly, and the third is only starting to act up. We had taken one back when the auto-feed stopped working and had BestBuy replace it, but then the new one immedietley didn't auto-feed right out of the box! A friend of mine who purchased this based on my high reccomndation (after the first week of use) is now also having an auto-feed problem (he's saying that he has to manually feed each page, but he's ok with it). So with a review of four products (five if you count the one we replaced at Best Buy), this is a poor choice for a photo printer. :(Buyer Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad","review":"It's just a bad movie.

Regardless of whether their kids liked it or not (MOST KIDS LIKE IT), it didn't meet THEIR childhood Suess expectations so they slam it.We love Dr. Suess as much as the next family but if you can set him aside for an hour or so you'll find this movie is a whole lot of silly fun. It's very brightly colored, has good energetic music, lots of screaming, running, jumping, laughing and nonsense; it's a very ALIVE movie.My disgust and repulsion faded many views ago (sorry Suess). Besides, my kids like it; it's a whole lot of fun for the entire family (except my wife - it's just too silly for her)."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like The Crap In The Hat!","review":"This movie is so horrible.

Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cat in the Hat","review":"I was very unimpressed with this movie. It is not a movie fit for kids or adults.

It would have been more appropriate, if the movie had been made exactly from the Dr. Suess book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"Before I saw this movie, I was excited about it too. We bought the DVD as my 5-year-old daughter's birthday present. It turned out to be a biggest disappointment. The acting was not funny but violent. Most of the humor are not suitable for children. We also found the humiliation towards the asian people (or government) unnecessary. What I really want to know is when they made this movie, do they have children in mind? If you love Dr. Seuss, read the book. Don't waste money on the movie. Don't even rent it. It will do more harm to your kids than good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too adult for most children","review":"I can't count how many times I fought the urge to walk out of this movie. I took my 4 year old to see it, and was relieved that he was young enough to enjoy the silliness, yet too young to understand much of the humor aimed at adults. The level of poor taste demonstrated in including such allusions in a movie clearly marketed to children was appalling. Save your money and rent How the Grinch Stole Christmas if your taste for Seuss needs quenching."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie is supposed to be made for kids and this one is full and i mean FULL of trashy humor! The jokes are: sexual, crude, and centered around bad words, even though I had never seen the movie. When I read the review in the Wall Street Journal which said, \\"It may make you sad, or even mad, but the Cat In The Hat is very, very, bad!\\" which is probably the best description for a bad movie. I would not rate this movie PG (Parental Guidance Suggested) I would rate this PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned) due to the sex jokes. Also, when I read the review, I imagined a cartoon of Dr. Seuss crying his eyes out. I mean really crying his eyes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Seuss' book didn't have crude humor!","review":"On the cover of this movie, it says \\"Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat.\\" However, this is far from Dr. Seuss' Cat in the Hat. This is Universal Studios' Cat in the Hat, and trust me, these two cats in hats are completely different. Dr. Seuss' book was a fun and humorous book, great for kids of all ages. However, when it came to making the movie, the plot offered by the book must not have made a long enough story, so the movie is filled with crude humor and stupid jokes that try too hard to be funny. The plot is flimsy, and much of the \\"humor\\" is not appropriate for kids. Take a pass on this movie and read the real Dr. Seuss' Cat in the Hat instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star?! Yeah! NEGATIVE 1!!!","review":"This movie in one word was awful. It is filled wtih nudity, cussing the whole nine yards!! I am 16.

I'll bet that Dr.Suess' blood would be boiling, he'd be so ashamed with this \\"Children's movie\\"Even though this made 40 million, does NOT make it a good movie, nor appropiate for children.

Sure, it probably sounded like a good idea at first but this is causing Dr. Suess to spin even faster in his grave (The Grinch started his gyrations)!Mike Myers tells stupid \\"Austin Powers\\" toilet jokes, The supposedly magical Cat character uses credit cards and there are a billion \\"product placements\\"/commercials in this dreck. Why is Alec Baldwin in this and why was his character necessary? Hollywood producers took a pure, honest concept and turn it into a 90 minute commercial for consumerism and craziness. This sewage is worse than a arsenic laced martini!Don't be sheep, go see a real movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away, its worse than they say it is.","review":"Horrible, and really frightening version of the book that will give you nightmares on how bad it is. Mike Myers should be beaten senseless for what he did to the cat, and everybody who made it should be arrested for public drunkenness because only a person with enough alcohol could makes this film as bad as it is. Are my words too strong for you? Yes, but after you see this mess, you would think that I'm being too kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very bad","review":"This movie, billed for children, is full of nudity, sexual jokes and rude situations. The acting is bad and, except for the computer generated fish, the special effects aren't that special. I think another reviewer below said this: they should have made the whole movie on a computer like Toy Story and Shrek. The people who made this movie have the same type of shock humor mentality that permeates most TV comedies now-a-day. No cleverness and no creativity in the script. Dr. Suess is probably rolling in his grave. This movie is several pegs down from the Grinch (which was full of bodily function humor and not much else). Bad writing, bad acting and and a misguided idea of what a childrens movie should be make for a kids movies that kids should be kept from."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY KIDS LOVED THIS MOVIE!","review":"For all you people trashing this film remember the age group this film was made. My two girls are 5 and 9, both are bright and intelligent. They love to have me read them books everyday. They are begging to see this film again and to own the dvd when it is released. So for all of you out there (critics included) who hate this movie, please get over it. Life is too short. Your child's laughter and enjoyment should be more important."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there was an option for zero stars","review":"If I were an extremely stoned, mentally sub-par seventeen year old, I just *might* enjoy this piece of junk, but unfortunately I rented it for a 2 1/2 year old who loves Seuss books. Big mistake.Who makes a children's movie where the main character constantly talks about killing pets, uses terms like \\"Dirty ho!\\" (followed by \\"Oh cmon baby\\" with a flicking tongue!), and gleefully takes part in one mean spirited, violent act after another? Why must every character and set be grotesque and stupid? And this is from someone who shut it off after 20 minutes of horror. I can only imagine where they'd go from there.Not only was this the worst movie I can recall viewing, it's totally inappropriate for children due to the constant meanness and violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mike Myers Must Have Needed Some Money","review":"This is a poor adaptation of a favorite childrens book. How could some of the effects be good, and then the cat effects just suck? The entire script is contrite. This is a disgrace to a brilliant writer. Let's hope that next time crap like this doesn't see the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Another Dr. Seuss classic ruined. Why does Hollywood feel like they have to screw up everything? They take a wonderful story and turn it into a flaming pile of commercial dog poo.

It's unfair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money... take your kids to the mantinee","review":"First of all, I loved The Grinch. But, no doubt about it, The Cat in the Hat will not impress the older Dr. Seuss fans. There was no story and it seemed to butcher the original Cat in the Hat book. Mike Meyers was HORRIBLE... his worst performance EVER!!! He wasn\`t funny at all. In fact, I didn\`t laugh once throughout this movie.However, my 7-year-old son did enjoy this movie. The set was fantastic in creating a Dr. Seuss world. The colors were vibrant and fun. These are the only good things I can think of. So, take the little ones! They won\`t be as picky as me."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"This movie will probably entertain kids more. I didn't like it. The plot is simplistic, and honestly Mike Myers can be annoying. The movie tries to appeal to both adults and kids but the adult jokes are so lame. You'll either love it or hate it. I didn't enjoy how the baby-sitter was made fun of, the movie has a lot of crude jokes in it.There's also product placement in the movie where the kids go on a rollercoaster ride and the Cat goes \\"like at Universal Studios. Cha Ching!\\" Bad script and bad acting, and why did they hire Mike Myers for the part? He's so crude."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cat in the hat","review":"Fun-loving family movie! Product came sealed and was brand new. No problems or issues with purchasing this DVD. My son and I like the silliness of the movie especially with Mike Myers.

Here's why. All of the songs and the rhyming in The Grinch ruined the movie. But in The Cat in the Hat, the narrator, who only narrates a little bit during the movie, is the only one who does the rhyming. Oh, and also the Fish does it a little bit too. Songwise though, there is only one song done by The Cat. All the rhyming and song is done at the beginning of the movie. But the best part is the movie's humor. There's no swearing and it's just good fun. So if you just want to let loose, go see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!","review":"This film is a sad piece of trash. It is a waste of Mike Myers' talent and it is a disgrace to Dr. Seuss' original story.I can only see this film appealing to boys aged 12 to 16 and probably to drunken \\"frat\\" boys. It is a perfect example of \\"low brow\\" humor.Or perhaps it is a sad statement on the level of stupidity in America today.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie was real bad!!!!","review":"i bought this movie in hope that it would be a good one but i was really let down.

Yes, it's crude here and there, but the younger kids won't get the jokes since there young and too focused on the big cat. Mike Myers gives a good perfomance and I can't think of any one else who could do the job. Yeesh, mike myers was Austin Powers.... I think he can do anything in the movies..

It was a complete WASTE OF MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot me NOW!","review":"If this movie had lasted any longer, I would've hung myself in the theater. This film had such great promise, along with a deceiving trailer. This movie could have even been better than the Grinch, but NO, they filled this modern rendition of Dr. Seuss's classic with sick humor and dumb jokes. The cast was wonderful, how did the acting get so terrible. I give this film one star for Paris Hilton's 2 second cameo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the classic story","review":"I must say I was dissapointed in this movie. Dr.Seuss books were my absolute favorites growing up- they probably were the reason I started to read. The movie had nothing to do with the story. The jokes were crude- but everything is now- the crude humor adult shows subject us too has now taken over children's shows. Mike Myers is wonderful in the role and the kids are very good too - but the austin powers type humor did not belong in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay whatever u ppl i LOVED this movie!","review":"I don't care what other people said about this movie.

None of it made sense. Inappropriate jokes, unneeded parents (Or, step-parents), a dog that wasn't in the book, no colors except purple and green, randomly exploding cupcakes, going into a portapotty that leads to an underground dance club... the list goes on.Seriously, this is not a kids' movie. And it's not for anyone who loves Dr. Seuss. Basically, it's for stoned 20-year-olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Offensive","review":"When I saw the previews to the Cat In The Hat, I thought Wow This Should Be good. It has Mike Myers, Alex Baldwin, Kelly Preston, Sean Hayes, and Dakota Fanning in it. With a cast like that it must be good. I was wrong! The movie wasn't even funny! The little ones may find it funny, ages 8 and under. However, I did not. Also the movie is quite offensive! Whoever wrote the lines for this movie should of been fired! The movie has some sex-related quotes in it and the movie is Rated PG! The only cons about this movie is that it had a great cast and it had dazzling special effects! So if your a fan of one of the cast members then go rent it! Otherwise avoid it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"INAPPROPRIATE for KIDS","review":"I just finished watching this movie and I must say it is not suitable for children. The movie is filled with lame jokes that center around swear words and sexual slang.

It seemed to me that this movie tried to appeal to kids and adults alike but it didn't fly. Not entertaining enough for adults and not appropriate enough for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"As entertainment , Cat In The Hat is barely so-so. It aims at easy targets. And it barks when it ought to purr. Really, you shouldn't have to add burps, farts, and dog pee to Dr.Seuss. If directing bad movies were a sin to confess, Bo Welch would say oops for making this mess. The movie works so hard to achieve a sense of whimsy that you feel exhausted long before it's over.

Meyers is as funny as the hangnail on my big toe. Fart jokes are funny? Meyers hit a new low in Goldthumb or whatever that sick movie's title was. This was worse. If I had been in the U.S. when this movie hit the screens I'd have organized boycotts at the theaters and at the movie company premises. STOP TREATING US VIEWERS like morons, Hollywood. Take a lesson from people like Peter Jackson in New Zealand. You don't need to make GARBAGE to make money. Treat us and our children like adults.

This is an adult movie but only if you're immature.The humor is crude and the movie just keeps on pumping the crude jokes out. I'm no prude but when it's a Dr. Suess movie, it shouldn't be crude jokes. Why insist? Why can't Myers be in ONE that doesn't talk to kids about how hot their mother is?If mediocre body odor humor makes you laugh, you'll roll in the aisles. I know that Dr. Suess is rolling in his grave.Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"SERIOUSLY, DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS...","review":"Warning. Do NOT take your little kids to this movie. Their beloved Cat in the Hat is turned into a really gross character here. Mike Myers seems to be doing a Jim Carey/Bert Larh (Cowardly Lion) imitation and it doesn't work. The audience has to sit through flatulence and sexual jokes that aren't at all appropriate for a kiddie flick. The worst moment comes when the Cat gets aroused over a picture of Sally and Conrad's mom as he unfolds her picture like it's a centerfold magazine spread. Will someone please tell these movie makers that it's not appropriate to have adult content in a children movies? I've had it! The Cat in the Hat could have been great. It has fantastic special effects, great costumes and it's even funny at times. However, I can NOT recommend it if you're planning on bringing the children along with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Crap in the Hat","review":"Sucks.

This tries to extend a short and charming childrens book into an 82-minute disaster and succeeds. It is far too long and was made in the worst time. First of all, it's just a bad premise for a Hollywood movie. Secondly, it sure as hell isn't family friendly. Thirdly, we've got Mike Myers acting like Jim Carrey's worst performances. This is a film for braindead people who want to smother honesty amidst endless brightly colored artifice.Mike Myers' \\"cat\\" is smelly, gross, and terrible to behold. He goes ahead and moons the children in one scene among many... it is wretched. I would never allow my children to see this movie. I would much rather personally read the charming book by Dr. Suess to my children than expose them to this vile material.

As for the visuals, i would definitely not recomend this movie to anyone who is photosensitive. It nearly gave me seizures. The art directer must have been sugar high at the time. Mike Myers is simply awful in this movie and the script is simply miserable. Humor is based on farts etc. and other crap.

Mike Myers performance was way over the top and not at all funny. Some of his jokes were obscene and I was shocked these were included in a kid's movie. Fortunately my 6 yr old son seemed not to understand too many of these. I just groaned in my seat as the film pressed on. The only highlights in this dismal movie were Alec Baldwin's performance and Thing One and Thing Two dashing about the house an impersonating police officers. In addition, the story poorly resembled the book. I don't think you can do a film much worse than this. What were they thinking of????????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not going to show this to my kids.","review":"I was disappointed in hearing what Mike Myers had done to the lines of The Cat In the Hat. In Shrek, he was great. But I simply cannot show this to my nephew and try to explain to him that \\"Chocca Locca\\" is X rated.I would recommend instead to see Jim Carrey in The Grinch. Not only does he play the perfect Grinch, if he knows the movie is aimed towards a children audience, he will not do certain things in a movie. He will refuse to do so. The Grinch was lengthened a bit, but I loved it, and they kept to the book in some of the scenes, which is also admirable.Sadly, because of what was done to The Cat in the Hat, no other Dr. Seuss books will be put into movies, which is a shame.If you want the Cat in the Hat, stick to the book.

It's so annoying watching those things run around like crazy. I know it's supposed to be entertaining for children, but the things act like they're on crack or something. Do you really want your kids to look up to crackheads? I didn't think so. If you want a movie that IS good for the whole family, check out Finding Nemo.

There is actually a parallel with Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory with the humor (but this isn't a musical, by any means). Mike Myers is great as always, and by NOT rhyming or being childish, this movie is much more clever than it could have been. I laughed a LOT at this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Cheapness?","review":"hey i just bought this movie for my little sister. i open the case and theres not so much as even a booklet inside, just the disc. i bought it brand new so what gives? anyone else missin the booklet or did the store screw me? anyways, the movie itself is ok. nothing to go crazy about but it does have some moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets","review":"Relentlessly vulgar and stupid, it isn't hard to see why much of America would be attracted to it.

Very little of the original children's book is quoted or shown through the movie, and alot of garbage was added in. There are several blatant off color jokes through-out the movie such as the cat looking at the mother's photograph and it opening up like a playboy centerfold. Mike Myer's performance is shoddy to say the least and the voice he uses for the cat is a combination of his SNL character Linda Richman (the \\"Cawfee Tawlk\\" lady) and the cowardly lion. There is a whole subplot that involves Alec Baldwin as the mother's dead beat boyfriend that is ridiculous. I am truely amazed that actors such as Alec Baldwin , Mike Myers, and Kelly Preston would even sign on for such a distasteful insult to Dr. Seuss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't Impressed.","review":"I don't think this movie was good.

If you want a laugh or two look elsewhere.This was one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen, and yes I have seen Gigli!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely awful","review":"The Cat in the Hat is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. The script is in no way interesting or creative. All the hype of the movie made many characters who had micro parts seem like they had major roles. Mike Myers is not funny at all. The entire movie seems to be like one big deleted improv scene that would be contained on the DVD as an extra feature. I am beginning to realize that Mike Myers plays the same character in every movie. Like in View From The Top, his talent does not show in this movie. It made me feel no emotion whatsoever. Awful cast. Awful script. Awful direction. Just plain awful. NOT worth the price of a movie ticket. I don't even think it's worth the price to rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad.","review":"I thought this was going to be so much better than what it really was.

Mike Myers should stick to balying British secret agents and leave the Dr. Seuss characters to Jim Carrey or an actor more willing to make a family film. Myers is not funny and comes off as trying way too hard, and even puts in jokes that I thought were too dirty for a movie with Dr. Seuss' name at the top of the title. The production designs are annoying and all the supporting actors come off as annoying, especially Alec Baldwin. Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning are good as the children, but they can't save the movie from Myers, usually a very funny actor, just not meant to play this role. Save this one for the litter box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE CAT IN THE HAT Falls Flat","review":"The jokes soon become lame, dumb and tiredAnd the acting and screenplay are just...uninspiredOh, the directors they tried to preserve the book's magicBut the results, I must tell you were quite simply tragicI was rather relieved when the movie was doneI am not really sure how I sat through this oneThe movie plunges so far into badnessI found myself screaming throughout:STOP THE MADNESS!Please listen to meSave up your moneyFor I'm sorry to sayThat this cat isn't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh Jeepers cripes people!!!","review":"I hate this extremely kweer movie it is a total disgrace if I was you I would buy it just to burn it!

Mike Meyers had a bizarre accent which was a cross between the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz and Austin Powers. It grated on my nerves.Our six year old did not laugh. We had a chuckle or two. But the plot was thin and went off on tangents. Alec Baldwin was wasted in the role of the evil boyfriend.The Cat's antics were silly and the kids just stared at him woodenly.Someone obviously paid these \\"stars\\" a truckload of money to make this awful and disjointed and disappointing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I have to pay for an advertisement?","review":"I won't tell you how the movie is but I'll tell you I think its horrible that we're not able to watch the movie without first being forced to watch ads for other movies.At least with a VCR tape you could fast forward or at the movies you can get some popcorn while you want.This DVD won't let you just put in the movie and play it.I'm not someone who would download or use illegal copies of movies but if the studios continue creating DVD's with no escape options I might change."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Nasty.

This is just a kiddie movie. They should've computer animated this movie like they did with Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Shrek.

If you appreciate disgusting, crude and tasteless humor, this movie will be right up your alley. But my son will not be permitted to see it. This is most certainly NOT a child's movie in any capacity and should have been rated a minimum of PG-13. I suppose saying it should have been R is a little extreme as I dont believe there were any curses in it (I did not finish watching this despicable attempt at humor) but it should come with a severe parental warning as to the lewd, inappropriate content.

Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin do a fine job in the movie, but the rest of the cast is not that great at all. Alec Baldwin is disgusting as the evil boyfriend. Mike Myers can't hold a candle to Jim Carrey's version of the Grinch. He uses strange voices that don't work for me.

Its lude, crude and like watching a hyperactive acid trip in sickly neon colors! I've never thought Myers was funny, but this movie made me absolutely hate him. Not only does he look nothing like the Cat, he looks downright creepy!If a transmission of this film ever makes it to the receivers on a far off planet somewhere, those aliens would come find us just to rid the universe of creatures who could make something this hideous!They should have done what was done with Horton Hears a Who and made this into a CGI movie with anyone voicing the Cat EXCEPT Myers.

I am not a prude- on the contrary, I enjoy adult humor, and many rated R movies of the likes of American Pie, but I EXPECT to see that sort of thing in those movies. I don't expect to see that in a classic story that kids love. The centerfold foldout of the mother's photo, the obvious staring down the dress of the mother by the wicked neighbor, the rave scene- those are just a few.Now, I gave this two stars because it really is funny, and the DVD is packed with a lot of great extras.

Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what Jim Carry did but he should give up acting all together. He is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were in the film. The sets are ugly, and the cinematography is an eye sore.

The way they were able to bring the story to life was brilliant, but the Character of the Cat in the Hat was simply shameful. I was sickened, and do recommend to any and all parents and guardians to watch it first before allowing their child to see it. I find it hard to believe it's rated at PG. it should be PG-13.

Some folks may like it but I was offended and felt it was not appropriate for kids. Seuss' stories had a freewheeling innocence and wholesomeness to them; this film version is a smirking dirty joke pretending to be kiddie fare.Just as bad as THE GRINCH.

Even though the humor suites Mike Myers style and he plays his part well, the part itself is flawed. No plot surprises, (Who hasn't read The Cat in the Hat?) bad special effects, and stupid humor. (I tried to come up with a better word than \\"stupid\\" but I couldn't) This is definitely not The Cat in the Hat that we knew as children. Since when did he start blatantly referencing the words S.H._.T, B_TCH and _SS? Or show someone get hit in the b_lls and a dog p_ss on a sandwich?

Aside from its shameless promotion of the studio which produced it and the mention of the movie's pop soundtrack, this film is just too off color to be a kid's film. With several profanity references and some crude bodily humor, one wonders why they felt they had to include such nonsense. Visually, the movie is delightful to behold with its garish colors and some nifty special effects. Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin are perfect as the kids, and Alec Baldwin does a nice turn as the nasty slovenly boyfriend. But Mike Myers is just too out of control and self parodying, and Sean Hayes is a real waste as the hygienically concerned boss, but he's delightful in the voice of the fish.

There were some comments made that I was thought to be inappropriate for a child's classic, such as the acronym for his vehichle, the soiled garden accessory, and finally burned bottoms.

Helen Reddy leaves no doubt that she can still sing with the best of them and produce a winner for the dance floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks fancy, but won't last","review":"I've had two of these and both quit working within a few weeks of use. The case is not water-proof, not even water resistant. The rubber grips on either side of the case become dislodged and will not reseat properly. Chaning the battery may not even be possible, although neither of the two I had would work long enogh to put a dent in the battery life. Look for something more basic and durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"50% product failure","review":"I purchased four of these for gifts. Two of the four were dead on arrival. This is a very high failure rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addresses the Tough Minded Critics Headon","review":"Dr. Peale talks about his internal struggle before he adopted the truths of \\"tough minded optimism.\\" It was through observation that he discovered philosophy and generalizations didn't work in the real world of problems. The authentic faith as taught by Jesus Christ works! It doesn't ignore problems, it looks beyond them to solutions.Odd that the same two philosophies that were around in the 1940s-1960s when Dr. Peale came to his conclusion are still in the arena today. Those of us who continue to benefit from Dr. Peale's excellent insight are grateful he made the right (and I mean that literally) choice. What he teaches works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peale is a true Christian","review":"This book gives the account of Dr. Peale's conversion experience to a vital relationship with Jesus Christ. His wife led him to the Lord, even though he was already a Methodist pastor. Many people claim that he was New Age and an evil perpetrator of false religion. The truth is that he was a master at applying Christianity to real life situations, when others were only interested in doctrinal correctness.This is a great book and the title says it all: you have to be and remain tough-minded to shield yourself from all the negativity around you. Finally brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report, if there be any virtue or praise, thing on these things. You are not going to help anybody if you have a sad, bad, negative attitude. The world needs radically consistent happy and positive optimistic people or we'll go down the tubes.Have a happy day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Change the title...","review":"I bought this book and felt like this is more a book about Jesus Christ than optimism. Which is fine I just feel like the title doesn't really represent what it is about. I didn't care much for this authors writing as he seems to talk endlessly about non essential items in his life and then proceed to talk more about what he's going to talk about or had talked about. I didn't care for this book too much at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of No Limit's best releases in '98","review":"This album is tight as hell. I was kind of sceptical on getting it at first. But after I heard tracks #2, and #3 I knew I was in for a real treat. This album has only 2 bad songs in it. My favorite songs on this was My Entourage, Life, Go 2 War, Rodeo, We Represent, and Shake'm Up. This album was a big surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"HERE WE GO AGAIN.","review":"Big Ed is tryin to be too hard on this one. He really ain't no good. I like some of the beats and the other rappers verses, especially Fiend's and Mystikal's. The guest rappers almost make the album worth the one star I HAD TO give it."},{"rating":"1","title":"AFTER A SECOND LISTEN, HE STILL STINKS!","review":"I AM ON A MISSION TO BRING HIS RATING DOWN. IT IS VERY MISLEADING. I AM A NL FAN, BUT THIS MAN SOUNDS LIKE ONE OF THOSE RAPPERS WHO SHOULD NEVER MAKE IT. I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I WAS ON THE NL BANDWAGON, JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. BEATS BY THE POUND ARE VERY TALENTED, BUT THE ASSASSIN NEEDS DIVINE INTERVENTION TO GET ANYTHING BUT A ONE FROM OL' JAY DUB. LSG-4-LFE! HE DOES SOUND LIKE HE COULD BE 'BOUT IT, THOUGH. HE NEEDS TO CHANGE HIS FLOW OR STAY UNDERGROUND; THE MAINSTREAM AIN'T FOR HIM."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG ED IS THE TIGHTEST RAPPER OUT TODAY.","review":"Big Ed took his time with the album and he got good things out of it because every song was live and Big Ed kept it real and showed me that he is up there with Mac and Fiend."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars! One of No Limit's Best!","review":"Big Ed's death has made it a little easy to click on the 5 star button when reviewing his CDs. I mean no disrespect to the man and his legacy and I actually consider it compliment to the man to give him a strong 4 star rating for his first solo. The CD runs a tad bit on the long side, but it bumps through and through thanks to a strong showing from Beats By The Pound and all the guest rappers. Possibly a way to thank him for his years of service, Master P gave Big Ed the arsenal needed and Big Ed delivered.His style and flow is more straight forward than other tank soldiers, but on tracks like \\"Assassin\\" and \\"Life\\" Big Ed showed he had lyrics and flow. The posse cuts here are as strong as on any NL CD, with Fiend and Mystikal putting forth particularly strong appearances. Even Snoop Dogg joins the party at one point.This is one of the better NL releases out there and definitely worth a purchase if you come across it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple writing that is far too long","review":"From a military viewpoint, this story is not even close to believable. From a liturature viewpoint, this book has simple sentence structure, simple character development, and very basic dialog. This novel seams to have been thought of and written on a weekend holiday. Previous reviews mentioned this book as a freshman level read and that is a good description of the subject content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good action thriller that has stood the test of time!","review":"I read this book many years ago as a teenager, and after having purchased a Kindle I decided to revisit it, as it has been a very long time. As then, I am enjoying this book immensely, it's a great war time action story, with characters larger than life (the way we like them), but able to hold your interest. The characterization is brilliantly done and you would swear that if you ever met these characters on the street you would know them just like that, introductions un-necessary.It's a classic British versus Germans war time yarn, with a seemingly mismatched band of extremely competent soldiers sent into an occupied Island to silence some big German guns and thus effect the rescue of many trapped allied soldiers.The story is gripping, forcing to you to always be wanting to turn the page, even when it's well and truely past bedtime! What more can we want from an action book. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good website, awful book.","review":"Recipes inconsistent with their website, which would be fine, if they worked. Completely different time/temperatures that lead to the food not being cooked anywhere near what it should be. The amount of ingredients are also different, but not proportionally so, leading to a completely different product than what you expect. Stay away from the cookbook, and just use their free website, because you'll actually get decent food instead of wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaay overpriced","review":"When I saw the price of this book I figured I would get a nice hardback with tons of wonderful recipes...instead I received a cheaply printed paperback with no \\"wow\\" recipes in it. In fact, there are some recipes that call for certain ingredients which aren't even mentioned in the directions! I would suggest getting the other Dominican cookbook which is half the price and offers the same recipes, this one is not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a keeper but..","review":"I too would have liked to see a hardback version of the book for the price. I like how the book has pictures of every dish. I'm just happy to see more cookbooks in english--and in measurements that are easy to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERPRICED","review":"I agree with the second reviewer. I also bought this book (4 of them actually) thinking I would get nice hardcover books; instead it is slim book with medium quality photos. I praise the effort to compile Dominican recipes in English, since there are few available. But the quality of the book does not justify the price at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a great book!","review":"This is a wonderful book for children just learning their animal sounds. I have twin 18 month old boys and they scream every time I bring it out. I read it to them and they will say the animal sound. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"My 18 month old son just loves this book. It's definately his favorite book. He loves the pop up animals. He loves to say the animal sounds. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as bored of the rings","review":"i bought this book hoping for another bored of the rings. Its ok overall, but it differs from the Hobbit to much. Characters die that should'nt, plot twists occur that should'nt. In places it felt as though the author was trying to re-write the story. instead of concentrating on comedy, like a parody should, it seemed to take itself a bit too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of your time","review":"The book is so terrible, I cannot believe someone can write such a gibberish. It looks like an author has never been told that his sense of humor is unacceptable. It reminds me of a hopeless guy who cannot master an art of telling a joke and make others laugh. Whenever he tells a joke, other people would smile and nod their heads politely, but never tell the joker how really bad he is. The book lacks everything. It is not funny, it is utterly boring and its so called humor is anything but something you would like to read for an entertainment. Avoid it at any cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh. Author seems to be trying too hard","review":"I had high hopes for this parody when I saw the cover with the line, \\"If we likess it, then we putss a ring on it\\". Unfortunately that is probably the best line in (on) the book.Oh, there are chuckle-worthy moments. But mostly it's rather lame. I get the feeling that the author really wasn't in the mood to really let loose with the silliness and was trying too hard to meet a contract deadline. And I agree with the other reviews that said he changed the storyline far too much for a good parody.\\"The Soddit\\" is not comparable to National Lampoon's 1969 \\"Bored of the Rings\\". Even though a lot of \\"Bored\\"'s references are dated, it's still pretty hysterical. I was hoping for that level of humor, updated to the 21st century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not wortth the time or effort","review":"Stay away from this album. The band is in a constant state of flux, the lead singer DJ's on the weekends at some low level bar in Newark. The band members leave on a regular basis.

It took 5 months to get the first magazine, then I never recieved another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"Having read most every men's magazine over the years, Men's Journal has become my favorite. I most enjoy the wide variety of articles. I least enjoy a seeming preoccupation with sports I will never come close to trying (e.g., \\"Gear up for the upcoming season of back country helicopter skiing\\"). All in all, though, a good mix of articles on interesting people and places to visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun resource for active men","review":"This is a great magazine to highlight the fun places to go, things to do and things to own. It is not highbrow with big book excerpts, nor is is lowbrow with a bunch of buxom women all over the magazine.This is a magazine for active, athletic and adventurous men. There are 1 or 2 interesting articles about travel or adventure in each issue along with a feature article on varying topics from contributing writers. There are always good features on health and fitness tips. Lastly, the magazine highlights sports gear, fashion and gadgets.It is a fun, light (usually) magazine that I look forward to receiving each month."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to really enjoy MJ","review":"Don't get me wrong, occasionally there are issues I still read cover to cover, but it seems as though MJ has gone through a change lately. Gone is the focus of travel and fantastic adventure writing. Now the focus seems to be health, fitness and diet. I used to buy Men's Health magazine for those topics. If I wanted that focus I would continue to buy MH. There is no longer a consistent reason to read MJ on a regular basis anymore. Man, I miss the old MJ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rude letters when you do not renew","review":"This unethical company sends you faux debt collection type letters when you opt not to renew your subscription. The content is hit or miss and the retention attempts by their subscription department is just the last nail in the coffin for me with them. I will NOT be subscribing or buying another copy of this magazine. Half of it is ads anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formerly Great","review":"The pages of Men's Journal used to be an escapist weekend getaway in themselves. They brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9/11. Since that time, MJ has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be, which might have been fine for one issue. This is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF !!!!","review":"a Complete rip off I ordered this months ago and have yet to receive First Issue .

I know my brother didn't keep any old copies and I'm not sure he ever received the magazine at all, but I'm sure that my credit card was charged. I've never had a company not be able to find a record of charging me.

Sure hope it arrives soon; would hate to think the worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"This magazine might be good if you were wealthy enough not to have to work, had time to work out four hours a day, had your own chef, could go on vacation six months out of the year, or could afford (or cared) about fashion. Otherwise don't bother. They sometimes have a decent or interesting article but they are so few and far between it is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Magazine If You Make 100K a year!","review":"This magazine misses on the average Joe. It reviews products that the average person can't afford. I picked up a year subscription for a dollar. Can I get my dollar back? The only use this is for me is to recycle it. I mean the interviews are ok. But come on. This is more like Rich Men's Journal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good addition to the bathroom","review":"I never read the lame cover stories on the celebs, but the rest of the magazine usually holds my interest. It's like a few steps up from Maxim in that it focuses on what guys are interested in, but a little more mature and in-depth in coverage. There's always some little tips or one pagers on cooking, sex, sports... more interesting than what's in the daily newspaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great magazine for MEN","review":"I am an 18-year old college student, and I truly love this magazine. Although most of my guy friends find it boring (they really haven't matured yet), I think it is a great magazine. It emphasizes on what men like, from the outdoors to guy fashion. Personally, I like appreciate the fact that this magazine does not emphasize on half-naked women. It's nice to read and relate to many interests without having female sex appeal thrown at us as sexual deviants for a change. Although many of the articles are VERBOSE and don't really apply to me, I enjoy a lot of them. It's sort of traveling to a different world, where I later want to travel to. Many of the things in the magazine target older men, but I am happy to read and view them in this magazine.By the way, I ordered the 1-year subscription from Amazon, and every issue was delivered to me on time and in great condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got it for free. Glad I didn't pay for it.","review":"Magazine is okay. Seems to try to be a cross between Outside and GQ. Doesn't succeed very well. Articles are pretty short, and lots of reviews of high priced items I would never buy. It does have nice photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Men's Journal Order","review":"Ordered Men's Journal as a new magazine subscription for a gift, and it was a big hit! The magazine is a fun read and has a pretty awesome variety of articles, I was able to get a discounted price ordering from Amazon and it's much easier to have it sent to my home. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"90% Ad?!! What am I paying for?","review":"Well I am so pissed off by ordering this journal. It has some good stuff but more than that it is all advertisement! So I do not understand why I have to pay for it, when companies already paid for that amount of advertisement.They just sent me 2 issues and now after one year they asked a 3rd party company to send me a letter and ask me for 12 bucks!! I prefer to send those 2 issues back rather than paying either a penny for those ads!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature Men's Journal","review":"20 years ago it was a good magazine, but it relies on profanity for the majority of articles. I read magazines for the information and I don't need young lads spouting off the \\"F\\" word to get their biased opinions across. It isn't my cup of tea anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bunch of ads.","review":"This magazine really doesn't have much substance. The whole thing is filled with a couple articles which tend to be boring, and the rest of it is filled with advertisements. The magazine also has sections on how to buy really expensive clothes or accessories that don't have much useful value. I paid $1.00 for a one year subscription due to a deal from Amazon, and I'd gladly take my dollar back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"I bought a subscription for my husband, thinking it would have a variety of men's topics, like sports, health, etc.Instead, it's either editorial garbage (not useful information) or the kind of \\"articles\\" you could find in a tabloid.I guess instead of finding a mix of subjects, we will just have to stick withMen's Health (1-year)and Sports Illustrated (1-year)."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Past Issues Chewing Up My Subscription!@#$%^&*(!@?!!!","review":"I thought I was getting a good deal on this fine magazine, but my subscription started with 3 issues arriving.

Won't buy again. About 25% of it is worth reading, but I have better things to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Its Weight in Gold!","review":"This book is one in a finely done current art series, and every volume is a beauty! This one, \\"Great Women Masters\\" may be the best, since a large number of the artists here are not well known. Sure, there are Cassett, O'Keefe, and a few other very famous names, but perhaps the best descriptions and paintings are by pre-20th Century Artists,some from the 1500's,and especially some English Pre-Raphaelites. There are many,many color reproductions, descriptions of the lives of the artists, even very small color pictures at the book page corners, all which makes this a very special series, this being my favorite. Also, the size is rectangular and portable, not too heavy..All in all, just about perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable","review":"Works have been noted by Prestel and other publishers that are neither as inclusive, nor as useful. The author here has selected a large number of woman artists both known and unknown to me with reasonable biographies, maybe 4 to 8 representative works, each reproduced with high-quality illustrations and these generally with reasonable texts concerning these works.Some might seek to add or subtract some artists, but I would contend that one is not likely to find any work that is superior to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A textbook geared to advanced GIS analysts","review":"Very nicely written book. It is quite technical, with a very detailed and mathematically-oriented exposition. More suitable for a classroom teaching or for a GIS software developer/expert analyst than for the average user.

Would have liked more information on each item shown in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Christian Overtones","review":"York and LaRue's book presented interesting arguements of reasons to protect children in the so-called \\"X-Rated World\\". However, the book also shared opinions and social commentary with serious religious biases. It was difficult to concentrate on the topic when the authors often digress onto religious topics of which I do not agree. The authors address the issue of premarital sex and homosexuality with complete intolerance for those of alternative lifestyles. When they accused Planned Parenthood of \\"promoting traditional-values-free sex for teens\\" and of having a \\"radical agenda\\" I grew frustrated and abandoned the book. The authors, while presenting accurate information about the pervasiveness and danger of children accessing information via the Internet, they also presented their own \\"radical agenda\\"s with Christian biases and promoting wholly the intolerance of homosexuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"The idea is OK, but author is not","review":"Jan LaRue is one of the most narrow-minded, accusatory, and ugly (I mean on the inside) women I've ever heard speak (or read) and you'd be better off following the guidance of someone who truly cares about your children, not just about her own narrow agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"I ordered this due to a promotion.

I checked and they are correct they published a Dec 2012 issue and a Holiday 2012 issue. I suspect they decided to put out an additional issue as there was a lot of advertisers during the holiday season. However I do not want to pay for an issue full of ads.

It's a total waste of money. Even worse, the customer service is beyond belief. The customer service website is nonfunctional--after a few failed attempts to log in, it will refer you to their 800 number. Once you call the 800 number, good luck getting a human being.

There is a preponderance of advertisements for drugs. Prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, articles about drugs. Everything in this magazine is about drugs, not natural health and healing. At this point, they might as well accept cigarette ads.Whatever happened to eating right and staying thin? What about vitamins and healthy foods? Nope. Just drugs. Diet pills to make you thin, sleeping pills to help you sleep, and every other drug you can think of. Lots of ads and very little substance.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tons of Tidbits","review":"There are very few serious articles in this magazine-- just tons of tidbits (stats/facts/tips).

A first-time subscriber and it took over 2 months to get the first issue then I am continuously having to complain about not getting my subscriptions. They say they have no control of the delivery once it is in the mail. They will send copies. Why am I paying to get old copies sent to me? I think their department that deals with subscriptions need some SERIOUS help. My sister orders from Rodale (another magazine though)and she also has the same problem....maybe they should run an article on dealing with stress as that is all I am getting.....of course, I may have to wait a few months before I actually get that article, come to think of it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Price","review":"I was glad to find this offer on Amazon.

My dad used to get it back in the 70s and it was good, so I went with it. Nowdays it is lame, I never read it. Fine. But my biggest beef is, they keep sending it to me and charging my credit card, and I cannot make them stop. I effing HATE this magazine and am actually spending this evening with my hubby finding which credit card they must have access to, and maybe just cancelling that credit card. The thing that do is, they send a \\"your subscription is expiring\\" letter with the so-called last magazine, but instead they say unless you contact them, they will automatically renew.

Certainly not Prevention!! Articles about fine lines, brighter looking eyes, which eyeliner to use, which make-up to use. Ads for cat litter, cereal, Massage Envy, doggie dentures and body lotion. There are more ads in this magazine than articles. It's almost half the size it used to be and totally worthless as far as I am concerned.

Hacked?I am returning the book after a conversation with customer service. They told me to \\"Just mail it back\\". A 4 pound book? Really? So then it costs the nothing for a good try at selling a book, or thousands of books? I complained and they agreed to send a shipping label.POOR MARKETING!

I don't have much time to read the few that I receive so I always have a large stack waiting to be read. I usually reach for this one first. Sometimes I stash it in my diaper bag in case I have a minute to read when I'm out and about. This is not for serious, in depth informative articles. But I love the quickie blurbs about certain herbs, foods, etc that are good or bad for what and why. I like the fitness part, I think they're very attainable reasonable suggestions. The recipes are nice too.The CONS: I'm all for having bits on keeping your skin or hair healthy, but I always skip through make-up/beauty section. Seriously, there's a million other mags if that's your thing. Not applicable for Prevention I think. I wish they'd not run so many drug ads...counter to the lifestyle they are promoting...as in PREVENTION!

I am not sure why neither Amazon nor Rodale bothers to address/explain complaints here, but it doesn't inspire my confidence nor help them sell subscriptions. My 85-year-old mom subscribed to Prevention and another digest size magazine. The other magazine sold her a subscription out to 2017, using predatory, confusing renewal notices to elderly with bad memory, and still doing it, despite my requests to stop. The magazines might be under financial stress, but these predatory subscription practices make a smart buyer run the other way. Do you really think we don't notice? Amazon, why are you supporting this poor customer service?? Can Amazon at least try to explain and reassure concerns?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE","review":"Readers.

Pasajes strikes the perfect balance between a text for rank beginners and advanced students.It is abundantly clear to me that the authors of this wonderful work are acutely aware of the difficulties the student of Spanish -- especially intermediate Spanish -- is likely to face. As such, the text reads as more of a \\"conversation\\" between \\"teacher\\" and student, then a stern, authoratative text handing down the received wisdom to your unworthy soul. A real pleasure to work through.Although one is more likely to encounter this text as part of a college Spanish program, I would highly recommend it to any serious Spanish student intent on reaching a higher level of accomplishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"This book was confusing - Too much similiar information packed into the same chapter, very confusing for students....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"The posted reviews giving this a high rating are NOT OF THIS KINDLE EDITION, but are of the printed Latham-Matthews edition.

She arrives a naive tourist, looking to make a long summer out of a job she knows nothing about and lied to get. She ends up owning a home, or rather a country place, before the end of the summer. Hawes learns a great deal over the next several years from the locals. In her learning she uses her naivete of the region to amuse the reader and ends up admitting that her impressions of the locals at the start was incomplete and incorrect. Her prose is good and her discourse with the locals retold well. Deserves a better fate than on the remainder table where I found it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"Funny, beautiful, engaging, honest, informative ...

Liguria is an area we haven't explored much but Hawes' descriptive and loving narrative made me feel like I'll be returning home. Not only was the imagery delightful, but she explained much of the social and gender customs which are often puzzling among Italians. Tales of the rehabbing of a rustico which she and her sister turned into a year round home also delved into traditional techniques for dealing with clearing wells, whitewashing walls, cooking outdoors, and the real true way of making homemade wine. The book moves a little slowly at times, but then, it's Italy! I highly recommend this book for anyone who has been or will be visiting Italy. I wish I had read it before my first trip; it took me several to figure out when was the proper time to order espresso!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous book, great read.","review":"A real gem, interestingly written.

I visited Italy [Rome, Florence] in 2001 and could not understand whey the waiter gave me a strange look when I asked for more cream/milk for my American coffee after I had just finished eating dinner. Now I understand about the digestio system here. If I ever go back to Italy, I will be sure to get an espresso instead after dinner.

However, I became more and more dissatisfied as the story progressed. The pacing was extremely erratic, and some of the important events seemed ill placed. The author often led me to think that certain characters and events were significant when they were not -- so many side plots were opened and never closed.

I will also never forget the parts about how the girl collected bugs against a white sheet at night or how her mother went to the hair salon and had them style her hair several times so she could learn how to do it herself. I cannot wait to get my copy and read it again. I never thought I would find it. But if this story stayed with me all these years and with my mother before me, it must have an extraordinary magic that transcends space and time.

While it's not required for the understanding of this book that you read \\"Freckles\\" first - I do suggest it.I absolutely loved this book and it is now one of my all time favorites.

This book has everything a young girl (or young at heart) would love. Strength, courage, compassion, \\"comprehension\\", love and inspiration. I received this book over 15 years ago and it continues to rank #1 through the hundreds of others. The writer is clear and concise about settings and people. I truly care for all of them (I wish they would make a movie, true to the full book). While many perceive \\"Oh geesh.. moths?\\" I see it as the literal metaphor for Elnora's life in the book. Her transformation from 16 through 20 is wonderful. Moths and butterflies can be beautiful, if you know what to look for, and not only does the book teach us this directly - it teaches us this with people as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"I've read and reread this book so many times over the last 50 years and it never fails to inspire and delight me.

As in, \\"She then meats and falls in love with a young man...\\" Honestly! Then, in the very first sentence of the book, Elnora is spelled without capitalizing the \\"e\\" (it's capitalized elsewhere, so not just a stylistic choice).

It fell a little flat and it probably had to do with it being written in 1890. William Morris was disgusted by the industrial revolution and the poor social and environmental ills that manifested from it, so he attempted to write about a world that reverted back to an agrarian life. I just thought it was a bit of a cop out. I would rather read about a utopian novel where the people achieved some sort of enlightenment and learned moderation or something than to completely do away with technology all together. I don't see modernization as evil it is the people and how they choose to use it that creates the problem. I think my favorite utopian novel remains a book I read as a child, The 21 Balloons by William Pène du Bois."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Aboard the Lovejoy Train!","review":"In this tale, our lovable scoundrel is on the hunt for a precious model of a Victorian steam engine, although he doesn't know that that is what he will find at the end of this particular rainbow. Along the way we, the readers, are exposed to some more Lovejoy cheek. What a lovable villain he is! The description of his past experience in a tunnel is very realistic, and we also discover why tunnels are a main phobia with him. The more we learn about Lovejoy, the better, I think. We know how much he loves his antiques and women, but there is more to the man than that. This is an exciting story, and we find Lovejoy up against some pretty shady characters in his unending pursuit of the perfect piece.

Is Anjalie supposed to be considered smart because she gets people to do what she wants? It was tiring to have to read 230 pages of what is supposed to be considered wit and good writing. Anjalie and Lord Chance were both arrogant, his sister just simply stupid and the plot actually boring. Where was the humor? Darcy wearing a foot-wide cravat?

I have never been disappointed in either the quality of the text or performance in a Caedmon recording (or Arkangel for that matter).

William Finn (the compuser) is incredibly talented"},{"rating":"2","title":"and they're off!","review":"OK, I was so busy praising this musical I forgot to mention my favorite song. \\"And They're Off\\" is unbelievable--a driving melody conveying all the anger and processed-only-of-late acceptance of the stormy relationship of the lead character's parents. \\"There was blood on the ground,\\" yes, but also, \\"we laughed a lot, that's the part I forgot to tell you.\\" This is the first theater song in 20 years that has reminded me of the songs of \\"A Chorus Line,\\" with its honest confessional tone, thinly veiled anger, and humor from a character who is so proud to be--finally--\\"looking back.\\" I love this song, and Malcolm Gets does it for all it's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"I CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT'S *GREATNESS* IN WORDS!","review":"When I first heard the storyline, I was like \\"Oh wow, brain surgery, what a perfect topic to song and dance to\\" meant sarcastically, but I ended up being right! The music is just simply amazing, the many styles of music that Finn uses is breathtaking, I really wish it hadn't been so underestimated since the untalented Helen Hunt was starring in a play in the same place at the same time, but that's in the past. I *NEED* to make this clear: TO MISS THIS MUSICAL WILL BE TH STUPIDEST THING YOU WILL EVER CONTRIBUTE TO YOUR THEATRE LIFE! :-)I realize some people think lowly of this musical, but I think I figured it out. Now, to love this musical, you have to be totally appreciative and loving towards theatre. If you absolutely ADORE theatre, you'll love this musical! But if you just merely *like* theatre, you won't. So, THIS IS A MUST FOR THEATRE-LOVERS EVERYWHERE! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"quirky with some great momments","review":"It's great to have a new William Finn score on CD. Like his previous \\"Marvin\\" trilogy (In Trousers, March of the Falsettos, and Falsettoland), the score not only reveals characters but moves the plot forward, as there is little spoken dialogue. There are some outstanding individual songs...\\"And They're Off\\" is my particular favorite with its constant movement and drive. The bridge seems to come out of nowhere...and I like the way Finn constantly surprises you with his music. \\"The Music Still Plays On\\" is a lovely ballad that deserves a life beyond the show. In this age where so few shows with new scores are produced, this one definately deserves a hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw the show, bought the CD","review":"While in NY on business, I happened upon opening night of this wonderful show.

Still, I enjoyed this CD for it's catchy, upbeat tunes. There's a sweet story and seemingly unrelated songs are cleverly woven together into a surprisingly coherent plot. The music wasn't the grand, sweeping stuff I've heard alot of lately, but has complexities and originality that a lot of the more commercial stuff has lost. I was pleasantly surprised at the results of ordering \\"A New Brain\\" on a whim, mostly due to the intriguing title.

The first one is a lot about New York, the second is more an electronic album. Sound of Silver sounds to me like an electronic album about New York.Great album, very diverse, has its mellow moments (NY I love you) and a superdance tune (North American Scum).Also a nice crossover album, people who only listen to electronic music will enjoy it and indie fans will as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"This was the first CD I ever heard from LCD Soundsystem and once I did, I was hooked.

If that frightens you, take a stress pill and relax like Frankie. It's the good stuff, the stuff that made us press rewind when that meant something. Is it deep? No. Is it The Best Album Of the Decade? Probably not. Is it the most fun you'll have for slightly less than an hour, for many hours, of the kind you thought no one made anymore? Hell yeah, son.

Grab your earphones and sing-a-long, who cares if you're in the office or at the gym? LCD, uh, says you can...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than His Last One","review":"If I have one criticism of this album it would be that he wears his influences on his sleeve.

The last track is also reminiscent of Grandaddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Great","review":"I read the reviews of this cd and expected to get something I did not. My favorite track was \\"Us v. Them\\" which sounds a bit like a poor man's Talking Heads.

Many of the songs sound like tribute pieces to various bands of that era (Kraftwerk, Human League, New Order, even the B-52s), and I can't imagine this album existing without those influences. One star off for that, but four stars on for the catchiness of the cuts, the variety of sonic styles, and the witty lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got me into electronic","review":"I was one of those classic rock guys that thought the vast majority of new music sucked. Then one of my friends forced me to consume LCD Soundsystem and I realized that the new music revolution is here and it involves people with laptops.

They break it wide open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Derivative -- in a good way","review":"this is a great album, drawing its influences from places as diverse as late-70s punk (North American Scum), shriekback (Us vs. Them), and electronic dance music of the 90's. It manages to pay tribute, but in a fresh way without taking itself seriously. Great party soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"i like this cd too","review":"this cd rocks. the bips and bleeps are good, the lyrics smart, and melodies that'll stick in your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound of Boredom","review":"LCD Soundsystem - Sound of Silver (2007)I like dance music, but this CD is just too repetitive. True, there are some cool sounds, but nothing I haven't heard before. In fact, this James Murphy character cribs plenty from other artists. I can't always put my finger on it, but much of what I hear on this album rings a bell of familiarity. For example, I hear some elements of Can (and Murphy doesn't hide his affection for that group either).Having influences isn't in itself a problem; everyone has influences. But you have to build on those influences and take them in different directions for the music to be worthwhile. Everything on this record makes me think, \\"been there, done that.\\" True, the songs do subtly evolve, but the repetitive elements are so prominent that they render the album monotonous. I much prefer dance music that has more to offer in the way of actual songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"awfull","review":"the cd didn't came with the case and the album... the case that came with, says that the cd was a gift from the newspaper.. at should arrive before cristmas and arrived in february.. i dind't refuse it, because would take my precious time.. that seller should be burn out of the site!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively Fusion of Americana: Hawaiian, Country, Bluegrass","review":"This is a truly delightful album with many passionate licks, and an all-star band of Led Kaapana's friends. It is a wonderful blend of vocals and instrumentals, some more traditional Hawaiian such as Hanohano Hanalei, and 'Opihi Moemoe, and others bold and spicy mix, Les Flammes d'Enfer (Cajun), Move It On Over (honky-tonk), Honeysuckle Rose (swing jam with a piano). Having just returned from Kauai, I used various tracks for my DVD. Especially appropriate was Koke'e to accompany the Waimea Canyon slideshow, and the appearance of a violin (Stuart Duncan) is a pleasant treat. And the vocal of Alison Krauss in Waltz of the Wind, so gentle and lyrical, magical as the breeze moving between the pines overlooking the Kalalau Trail. And if you want to hear Led on vocals, there is My Sweetheart, a musical postcard to his wife while performing in Tahiti. Indeed, every song is a gift from the heart, and will touch your soul in many wonderful ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike Garcia really is The Man in breakdance!","review":"I enjoyed watching this and soon might try the easiest part of this volume - the robot. Maybe soon I'll try also some other things shown on this, but some of it seems too far away now like 1990 requires a lot better balance to hold 220 lbs with one palm. I've also personally emailed Mike Garcia and praised this video. If you want to learn this dance yourself or know how those people who entertain you at shows with this kind of dance do their moves, this video is a must and so are also any other volumes of this series.

I happened to see them on the tour for this album, and for the first half -- just Klezmatics -- it was one of the best shows I've ever seen. Then, after intermission, Chava Alberstein managed to surgically remove all joy and interest from the room with her boring schtick, annoying guitar, and tooth-grindingly mainstream voice.

To be honest, I always loved Martha's work but could never stand her show; now I can have all that her show offers (and more) without having to be annoyed by a tv programme.I highly recommend this magazine if what you're looking for is a source of inspiration for home projects, rife with easy -- and mostly quick -- crafts and decorations.

I love to buy magazines, but with most of them, if one article is a keeper, you're doing well. When I'm planning for Christmas - I get out all Martha's December issues and find ideas for decorating, gifts, cooking, parties that are worth using again and again. Same thing for Valentine's Day, Halloween, Summer Parties, etc. Some of her ideas are over the top, but I much prefer that to magazines that are \\"under\\" the top -- stuff that is so basic that I could write the articles myself. \\"Real Simple\\" really is simple, also dull and uninspiring (although the photography is nice).

It has a lot of great ideas for sprucing up your home, learning new things, cooking, crafts, etc. Each month it has a feature article that goes in depth on a plant or craft or food item that teaches you something new and gives you a background at understanding it better.Some of the crafts, however, are very labor intensive and I don't find them very realistic for the average user.

Her food is bland for the most part or has strange ingredients. The crafts have been scarce and either require a great deal of investment or are just \\"temporary\\" like place cards. Really who is going to spend six months making every single decoration and place mat for a one evening party? Also the articles on Martha and her family and their awesome homes should be limited to a max of two per year. The frequency of \\"how great am I??!\\" articles comes across as simultaneously pompous and approval needy - kind of a feat really.

Two issues into my subscription it stopped. I was really anticipating the December issue because I had many guests coming and could use some of Martha's helpful advice, however it never came and neither did January or February. I have called Martha Stewart Living magazine twice and while they are very nice and apologetic, I still have not received another issue. When I asked to cancel for a refund I was given a phone number with an automated system that uses a credit card account look up - being that it was a gift this is useless. Very clever for Martha and very frustrating for the giftee/consumer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with this magazine.","review":"I started my subscription to Martha Stewart Living in late 2001.I loved her show on T.V. so thought the magazine would be even better-WRONG.It is full of ads and subscription cards falling out from every page.What little content there is on actual Home & Garden or \\"Good things\\" is definitly not enough to justify the price of the subscription.I realize that Martha Stewart the name is a bussiness but the Calander of her personal monthly events,all the articles featuring HER home,HER garden,HER dogs and even her Daughters' home-is not really what I was hoping for when it comes to Martha Stewart the Magazine.The pictures are pretty though I will say that but even still-I will let the subscription run out and just watch her TV show for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top","review":"As much as I enjoy watching Martha's tv shows and we even turned one of our small bedrooms into a \\"craft room\\", this magazine is just too much for me. Besides being very expensive, she has filled her magazine with flashy ads for expensive things that are not even offered anywhere near where I live and has reduced the quantity of actual crafts and recipes. How many of us have the \\"vintage green stoneware, embroidered linens and fresh-cut flowers that she uses daily? She does however, do a very good job citing where some of the specialty items she uses may be found. I have subscribed and unsubscribed to her more than once, because I would flip through the pages and find very little useful information. I think she is now so incredibly wealthy and isolated from normal people, that she has lost touch with what REAL people's lives are like. Now, when I REALLY want to read one of these magazines, I just read it at the library and this keeps the magazines from collecting dust at my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martha Stewart Living","review":"Excellent magazine. Good size, presentation, great color pictures and easy to understand articles. I have this on auto 1 year renewall"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I adore Martha Stewart Living Magazine. It offers an escape from the self-inflicted stresses of the real world into the impossibility of a completely balanced life. In response to those who say \\"it is unreal,\\" I would agree, but isn't that the point? I doubt I will hollow out individual acorns to make lockets for party favors at a harvest dinner party while serving home grown squash, but if i can live vicariously through Martha, do i need to? The photography is goregous, the ideas are clever and even the advertisements are sumptious. Holidays are her forte, and so the dull months of the year create less interesting issues. However, these are nevertheless enjoyable. If you prefer something a little closer to reality, try REAL SIMPLE, but for escapism, LIVING offers a mini-vacation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MANY ADVIRTISMENTS","review":"I've subscribed over the years - on & off - but I've really gotten tired of the disproportionate pages of advertising vs. information/articles. Stewart defends the need for so much advertising to pay for \\"the magazine\\" - somewhere Martha forgetssubscribers also pay to keep her publication viable. At $4.95 a copy I don't appreciate nearly half the magazine is ads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!","review":"Love the recipes, love everything inside. I'm a foodie and this magazine is a monthly food for my soul. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"makes me feel good","review":"I love the photo work in this magazine. It is so signature \\"martha\\" and fresh and crisp. It makes me feel good to look at the pictures. I also find that the crafts and recipes are good yet basic, so I feel inspired to let loose and improvise on what's there.In short, this magazine is designed to make people (like me!) feel good, and that is why I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre magazine at best","review":"I got a subsrciption to this magazine because I thought I would enjoy it and as a newly wed glean some ideas for my home and I couldn't have been more wrong. The recipes are overly complicated and some of the dishes just don't even sound like they would taste good and the same goes for the crafts. Any articles on decorating show drab, boring homes. Overall I was just very disappointed and will not be renewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for real people","review":"Even though many projects in Martha Stewart Living magazine have nice style, they look better in the magazine than they do when you actually make them yourself!

They have become more radio friendly but in no way is this a bad thing. Anyone who enjoys modern rock YOU NEED THIS ALBUM. Anyone who loves lostprophets YOU PROB HAVE THIS CD ALREADY. Lostprophets are the shizzzzzzzz! id like to thank Intevideo for the fast,cheap and safe delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transmitting at a lower frequency","review":"First of all let me say that when I heard about this album's coming release, my hopes jumped to an all time high. I had expected something just as good or better than their previous albums.This album had good intentions but it shows that with a news producer, their sound took more of a mainstream hit and fell right among the pop-sounding bands that rule the teen stations. I must say i am disappointed with this album, however there are some decent songs. For example:Everyday Combat is a high energy song that continues a bit from their sound of Start Something. Broken Hearts, Torn Up Letters introduces a more Taking Back Sunday/emo sound to their already alternative agenda and serves for a nice blend. 4 A.M. Forever steers their melancholy intentions with mellow riffs and hard vocal choruses that provide an echo of hope for the album.All in all, I do not recommend this album very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"I like this album. I was recommended the group and the album by a friend. I am so pleased to have given this a chance. If your thinking about it don't.. just give the album a shot and frequent listen. Theres alot of good songs on here including Rooftops, Can't Stop Gotta Have A Date With Hate and A town called Hypocrisy. I gave this a 4 star rating because I do have other albums that I listen to more. However its by no means a disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened...","review":"This CD is horrible!So when I popped this CD into the CD player and heard track 1 i was like, this is gonna be pretty good. But after that, the songs started sucking and when i was glad when the horrible CD was finaly over and I didn't have to listen to anymore of Lostprohpets new poppy sound. Lost Prophets has obviously sold out and turned into a stupid poppy-punk band. The only good song on this CD is track one, and thats the only one that sounds like their old stuff. I mean, you listen to Fake Sound of progress and then you listen to this CD, you notice a big difference, and that difference is not good. Trust me, if you're new to Lstprophets don't buy this album. Buy either Fake Wound of Progress or start something or even both, but don;t buy this album if your looking for a good rock album. Again, the only reason this CD has two stars onmy rating is because the first song, the rest of the songs suck.LostProphets, please come out with something better and more original next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Because Prophets went mainstream...","review":"Just because LP went mainstream, and didn't yell and blast guitars as much as on the first two albums doesn't mean they cant have a SLIGHTLY softer album. Would you critics rather have the same thing on every album, or something new. Im a huge hard rock fan, but it doesnt mean i cant like regular rock as well. Grow up and enjoy the music.This album is amazing... buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISSING IN ACTION- LOST PROPHETS","review":"This album is quite possibly the worst album I have ever heard and I have heard some bad ones let me tell you! Well the prophets got something right there totally....lost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This album is just another example of not being true to yourself or your band. Jumping on what sells and neglecting the fans that made you so popular is just wrong. There was a time when it actually was cool to listen to lost prophets, unfortunately now is not one of them! I don't forsee this changing with these sellouts anytime soon! If you have a quarter, good, because that is about all this album is worth and thats stretching it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This is a weak effort by these guys. Very bland and forgettable. Doesn't compare at all to Fake Sound of Progress or Start Something. It's too poppy(only 3 songs sort of rock) and very radio frienldy. A huge disappointment..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album Yet","review":"Okay, I have always been a fan of the hard rock that the prophets of old produced. Fake Sound of Progress had songs like \\"Shinobi vs Dragon Ninja\\", \\"Kobrakai,\\" \\"The Handsome Life of Swing,\\" and others. The sophomore album, Start Something also had great tracks like \\"To Hell We Ride,\\" \\"Burn Burn,\\" and \\"Start Something.\\" Liberation Transmission has very little to no 'hard rock' on it. The only 'hard' song is the first track, \\"Everyday Combat.\\" The rest of the album is just... well, weak. It's very weak. The prophets have lightened up a lot. This album sounds nothing like their older stuff.So, if you are a fan of Fake Sound of Progress and Start Something, avoid this album. You will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liberation Transmission","review":"Lostprophets is a great EMO band.This CD is incredible!Better than their last release!The best song is \\"rooftop\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing, I hated it.","review":"No offense to anyone that like this album, but this album has to be the worst one I've ever heard. I heard the song \\"Rooftops\\" and I loved it, so I got the CD. Bad idea. I've never listened to any of their other CD's, but by what I heard on this CD, I don't think I really want to. Please save your money if you haven't bought it already. The CD is very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"The Lostprophets third cd is not even close to how great their first 2 cds are. The first 2 songs were on the right track, and Rooftops is obviously a single. But what else is there? 4AM Forever and Can't Catch Tomorrow are good songs but not too great, and Everybody's Screaming is ok. The rest of the cd is forgettable filler or emo trash. The fact that this cd isn't up to par isn't even the worst part, because every band makes a forgettable cd at some point. But this cd will probably be popular amongst the teenage girls, and thus their concerts will be filled with these annoying \\"fans\\" and all of their cds will end up being just like this one. I hope it doesn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone remember LOZT PROPHETZ?","review":"Naah probably not, but that's what these guys were called 4 or 5 years ago when they were a bouncy Incubus-like rap metal band. Kinda funny how soon things change and what is hot is suddenly not, isn't it? So before you could say \\"Fake American accent\\" the \\"Prophetz\\" traded their baggy cargo pants for skin-tight faded jeans, their Ibanez and PRS guitars for vintage Gibsons and Fenders, traded their angsty nu-metal lyrics for crybaby emo ones and even traded their turntables for keyboards. Isn't bandwagon jumping fun?Avoid this garbage like SARS mixed with Avian Flu"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome new CD","review":"I have never liked lostprophets before this cd, it was amazing and it got to me much quicker than I expected.

Awesome buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Willow","review":"I just didn't feel for Willow as i had all the previous characters. The series starts with Willow as a college student, returning home after a tradegy in the family. i won't spoil it, so that's all i can really say. It's the typical set up, except i really wish that the series has started earlier in Willow's life, like all of V.C. Andrews other series. I just didn't get to know Willow, she was boring, and the relationship with Thacther Happened rather quickly in my opinion. I did manage to finish it, so that's why it gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too boring for words","review":"I couldn't get through the series because I found myself uninspired by the character. She lacked the drive of V.C. Andrews previous heroines. Her father lies about her real mother so of course she goes to find out about her blah blah blah. I mean her blandness reeks on every page.I really don't recommend this book to any...it's sad to say since VC Andrews is my favorite author and i find her books very entertaining. I like reading things that don't necessarily stick to what people deem normal.Willow was just too normal...I couldn't get past book two."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont believe what they say - ...","review":"i expected so much from this book because of all the praise people gave it. so i bought it with great high hopes and then... they fell. willow grew up in a huge house with gardeners and a full time nanny. she thought she had a hard life?? why did she have to leave school? all the vc heroines think of is family. they need to grow up. i hate the way theyre all beautiful, all talented, all \\"bad liars\\" and hate doing anything \\"bad\\". they all have belived mommies and daddies and hate to disappoint them. read the first to series of vc books, but dont go looking in the others for pleasure unless you like to hear people whine about their hard lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful... I want more!","review":"I had to admit that I had mixed reservations about this book. I like the mini-series, but was ready for a full length novel again. I had tried desperately to read the Hudson series, but couldn't quite get into it and so I had my hopes that Willow would turn out to be a good novel... and it was. I loved it! It left me wanting more and the surprise at the end with the letter from a familiar face from the Casteels... was superb! Can't wait for the second book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is great","review":"All of her books are pretty much the same. With twists and turns in each novel. She is still one of my favorite authors. this book is really good and keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you are a fan, I recommend reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After the lackluster Hudson series, I, as a longtime VCA fan, was excited to pick up this book when it was released on the shelves nearly ten years ago. but I was disappointed. Neiderman obviously wasn't trying as much as he had been before, and everyone was flat. The story was only mildly interesting, and there was none of the thrills and chills that came with reading a real VCA book, or one of Mr. Neiderman's earlier ghostwriter books (Cutler, Landry)And I'm not sure why Mr. Neiderman couldn't have chosen a better family name, instead of the name of a jewelry business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly dissapointed with the eintire series.","review":"I was very disappointed with this series. It's not written in the same style as all the other VC Andrews books. I have never been so disappointed with the lead female in a V.C Andrews series before. Also, her story was dull, and many of the characters seem flat and two dimensional. I was bored with it. I also jumped the gun and bought the entire book series, without reading it, so I'm really kicking myself. *Sigh.* oh well, life goes on! P.S, If you want a way better VC Andrews story and character, read the Logan series instead. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST!","review":"I have read every VC Andrews book and this one was the only one that I could not finish reading. I put it down after the fourth chapter. I could not get attached to the main character and to say the book is boring is a huge understatement. I bought the rest of this series and now they will go unread. Do not waste your time reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"Willow was not that good. I admit, it was better than that horrible Logan series, and the disappointing Hudson series. And those mini series...! But Willow was not that much different. It was so obvious. I mean, come on, you could only predict the whole book in the first three chapters!! Willow was a pretty good herione, although I prefer Heaven, and I liked the way she was strong. A pretty disapppointing book, though, comsidering all the great reviews it got. I expected it to be a lot better. Want a good V.C. series? Try the Heaven series. The new ones are recycled plots with the same old, same old blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Couldn't get past the first fifty pages. It's the same old stuff, just a different setting, as usual. Of COURSE the \\"dark family secret\\" is that Willow's father had an affair that produced her - since when has the GW been creative and come up with something new? Just once, I'd like to read a VC Andrews that doesn't include the word \\"real\\" when describing a mother or father. The character letters at the end are nothing more than marketing plugs for the other books - maybe people are finally catching on that they're just not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant! Much different than any other series!","review":"The De Beers saga is wonderful! The saga itself is much different than anything VC Andrews has come up with in the past (or her stand-in writer, I should say). It's much more modern than her other stories, but just as thrilling and shocking. Willow was a wonderful read and if you like what VC Andrews has done in the past, you'll like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best...","review":"series vc andrews has ever written. i've read the first 2 books and they were so good i stayed up all night reading them! a little racy, but all of her books usally are, aren't they?? ^_~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laserline CD160TWRB/CD30TWRM","review":"This dual-package of CD towers was offered at a fair price.

This is my favorite. I seems to be the most informative and the topics are presented in Parents long before Parenting every gets around to it. For example, Parents had a indepth article on new discoveries in miscarriages and the following month parenting ran a similar article, but was not as informative and obviously was a steal from Parents. There are also great contest. There are also topics that parents can send in comments about and actually get paid for them if published.

Great ideas for both family and individuals, including timely articles on the benefits/disadvantages of immunizations, sleep, schedules, meals, birthday party ideas by age, best toys, best products (car seats, strollers), etc. One of my favorite sections has different parents comparing products and writing candid reviews about these products. I highly recommend Parents magazines for both pregnant women as well as parents (new and experienced)."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but a bit consumerist","review":"I found this magazine to be OK but nothing really worth paying for. Flipping through this magazine I felt like they were trying to sell me every baby product under the sun rather than trying to show me how to best bring up my child.I was surprised to see no mention of breastfeeding in the whole magazine, but I guess there's not a lot of money to be made in breastfeeding products; And the 'must have' baby products would set most new parents back half a years salary. Their information was in many cases common sense and in other cases a bit misleading.From what I have seen I think this may be the best parenting magazine out there, but I would recommend any new mums to save their cash and use the internet instead, you will find both sides of the story there, not just the one which is trying to make money off you."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER SHOWED UP","review":"Ordered this 8 months ago, never received an issue.

For chemists wanting a good current expository text, that does not assume any prior knowledge of it, try this work by Rouvray.There is much overlap between studying complexity and information theory. Indeed, this book has a chapter devoted to Shannon's theories. But, as befits a book for chemists, that chapter is toward the end. Instead, Rouvray talks about complexity in the context of thermodynamics. [You do remember most of your thermo books, don't you?] Then we are shown how complexity can be quantified in so-called complexity indices, for various molecules.Then there is a discussion of how molecular complexity might be correlated to the difficulty of synthesis of such molecules. Hopefully, your chemical intuition can come into play, making complexity far more understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ogre's Like Children--As a Meal, of Course","review":"\\"Once upon a time there lived a lonely ogre.

Lots and lots of facts. But there's one peculiar thing about this book: instead of looking up trivia by category or genre it has the answer first. Kinda like Jeopardy. For instance, you'll look up 'Zot!' first and *then* you'll get the explanation: 'Sound of a thunderbolt in Johnny Hart's comic strip B.C.' As opposed to looking under B.C or JOHNNY HART, or THUNDERBOLT, etc. So, in other words you have to know the answer *before* you get the \\"question\\". So you can't look up entries by *subject* or *category*. There's no SPORTS, MUSIC, LITERATURE, ART, HISTORY, etc., at least by way of looking up. So unless you're a \\"trivia freak\\" or just an avid book collector I'd suggest NOT getting this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go wrong with Alexi Lalas","review":"This is an all around feel good CD with fun melodies that demand to be replayed over and over.

If you aren't using a studio this is easy to carry and use."},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS BETTER THAN NOTHING","review":"Let me start out by saying, I hate flash photography. The flash creates spots of light, harsh shadows, and makes a picture look \\"cheap\\". IMO. A defuser can soften the colors, even out the light, and bring out more details in a more naturally. Unfortunately this defuser does not really accomplish that significantly. But it is better than not having a defuser at all. Go look at my youtube video under GlockNinja channel.

Another reviewer had suggested taping a curved business card to the camera to deflect the flash to the ceiling, and was mocked by a different reviewer for doing so. I tried the business card trick until my Lumiquest Diffuser arrived. Sure, I had to bump up the flash a little and could only hold my camera one way, but I must say it worked far better than the results I got when the Lumiquest finally arrived. What a piece of junk! It's hard to see how anyone could get it to stay in position and even holding it while taking pictures I didn't get much better results than the naked flash. There has to be something better out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Canon Powershot SX30 or Similar","review":"Does not work well on Canon Powershot SX30IS. Won't stay attached to the front of the flash, even if it would the screen would rest on the pop up flash minimizing diffusion. Did very funky things with white balance even if I used the flash setting. Had to hold the item in place and use a custom white balance. Even then I got strange blue lighting areas in my shots. Returning the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleck. Save your money, get something else","review":"I ordered a Lightscoop and this Lumiquest soft screen. I am not pleased with this soft screen, it does not diffuse like I expected it to. I might as well have put a piece of wax paper in front of my flash. Of course, at this price point, you cannot expect miracles. However, in order to get it to work on my camera, I would have to secure velcro TO YOUR CAMERA. Uhh, no. I did test it as best as I could, but even holding it with my left hand as it was supposed to be attached to the camera.The flash was barely diffused. Again, for 11 bucks, I am not sure what I was expecting.That said, I would seriously save a couple extra bucks and get a Lightscoop. The difference is unbelievable. I have a friend with a hotshoe flash and my indoor results were comparable to hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a very disappointing product","review":"I'm glad that I didn't spend much on this diffuser for my built-in flash for my D80. This product not only diffused the flash, but also eliminated its effectiveness overall. Rather than getting some sort've soft light effect with this diffuser, I ended up getting underexposed shots (even with the flash strength boosted up to 1.0+). Thanks to the mediocre results I got from this product, I managed to just stick with my SB-400 in conjunction with an omnibounce diffuser. The pictures advertising this product look better than the product that you actually get. What you get is a plasticky/flimsy piece of material with velcro stickers to help attach it to your camera. Very disappointing indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"What a terrible piece of equipment! First, it you have to VELCRO it to your camera, putting adhesive goo on your hotshoe. If you try tilting your camera, it falls off because of the poor fit. It is just a pain to use- make one yourself and save some grief and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's supposed to do...","review":"This device does what it's supposed to do: diffuse the flash output coming from the built-in flash. The biggest difference can be seen in indoor shots where a straight flash produces harsh shadows; this will soften it a little. Personally, I'm not a big fan of indoor flash photography, but I am now prone to use my flash more because of this. This isn't meant for the enthusiast or professional photographer; it offers no flexibility. For that, you will need an external flash and a dome diffuser."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well for the price, shipped fast","review":"It turns your crappy on-camera flash into something you can actually work with...for the price, you can't do any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"It does what it's supposed to but it's about as cool as wearing your socks over your jeans.

It came today and I read the directions and trimmed the left side (with the black up) and I still cannot get the flash to fire at all. I've trimmed tiny little pieces at a time and tried each time after the trim. Sometimes I can get it to fire if I push to the left or right in the hot shoe, but most times it won't fire. What a waste of $$$. I wish I had put this $ in the red kettle at Wal-Mart instead. I ordered the Gary Fong Puffer Pop Up Flash Diffuser - CANON/NIKON and it'll be here on Monday. I sure hope it'll do what I need. I just don't want to always take my Speedlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very homemade type solution with poor instructions","review":"First let me say that it will NEVER look as rounded and sturdy on your camera as it does in the product photo. Even when it's behaving well, it's going to look a little more jerry-rigged and flimsy. So far, it seems to help a little with providing more warmth and less blue/white glare to photos. But it's not necessarily what you think it is going to be from the photos, so if you want a headstart on making something homemade, go ahead and buy this. But if you expect it to look and perform super professionally, keep looking. I've seen a Gary Fong Puffer in action and it looks amazing. I've heard comments that it breaks easily used with Nikon cameras (something about the fit in the hotshoe) but I've got a Canon. It looks a lot sturdier than this and it performed really well in the shots my friend took."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wierd profile photos.","review":"The first one with the lady in pink - showing comparison betweendirect flash and soft screen, I don't see much of a difference.And the third picture from Evelyn Schmitten - I think that's adifferent diffuser that the gentleman is holding.REGARDLESS - As long as you set your expectation correctly, this product is great. I own a canon 50 d and had to cut a piece off so that it mounted right in the hot shoe. Of course it won't replace an external flash, but for emergency situations, does an adequate job. Keep lowering the flash output on the camera until you get a right mixture of ambient light and flash..and pictures turn out pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed with this item","review":"I am a natural-light photographer, but there are times when a little flash is definitely helpful. I purchased this soft screen and was not very impressed with it. I haven't used it very much at all, and when I have used it I haven't noticed a great difference between having it on or just going with the naked flash. Price-wise I don't feel I was out too much money, though. I would not recommend purchasing this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product that makes your pop-up flash useable!","review":"This product allows you to use your SLR's pop-up flash by keeping the the direct flash hot spot from ruining your photograph. It's a small soft screen, and definitely doesn't replace more professional lighting techniques, but wow, what an incredible product. I use it outdoors and indoors when I need flash light. Best product for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Save your money. The light diffusion when this is used on a Nikon D-90 is minimal. The screen does not easily curve like it is shown in the photo. The small tab that inserts into the hot shoe tends to straighten out and does not hold the angle required to get a curve in the diffuser. Because of this, the screen lies almost flat against the flash. As a result there is very little diffusion of the light. So - this will go into my drawer of never-to-be-used-again photo gadgets. You'll be better off with a Fong Puffer or similar light modifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for all DSLRs","review":"I bought this item as it came recommended in a book. I was thrilled to get it as it says it's compatible with all DSLRs. It seems as it might be more geared for Nikons and Canons -particularly when Canon is specifically mentioned in the small insert that are the instructions. I could not get it to work with the Alpha 200 as the manuafacturer suggested trimming to get it to fit. While they did respond to my inquiry, the instructions were very vague and I never got it to work. Very disappointed, but it may be a nice option for a Canon or a Nikon, which are two of the most popular cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"Having used this product a short while,I find it almost useless!!!!

Yes, it is about marriage -- and not only on the physical plane; that is what makes it so potent, because Fortune shows why natural marriages are as they are FROM SPIRITUAL CAUSES. But because all of creation is built up from this basic marriage of two divine halves, the book offers much to consider in contemplating any subject.The nice thing here, too, is that despite the depths that Fortune can reach in certain works, she tries to keep this one simple enough for even beginning readers. By the end she may really be pushing them ... but by then, they've been well prepared.This is a must-have for any student of the esoteric."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, profound stuff!","review":"This book goes into depth I've never seen anywhere else. Dion discusses the chakras, and how a couple relates on all the levels. For example, the root chakra is a magnetic connection, the heart chakra love...well that much is obvious, but an explanation is given of how a busy executive might have a strong intellectual relationship with a business associate, be able to discuss intellectual topics with her that he can't discuss with his wife, so on the level of intellect that is essentially a connection, just as if he had sex with her it would be a connection, but on a different chakra level. The goal being, to be compatibly mated so that you connect on ALL the chakras with your partner. POWERFUL STUFF! I think this book, along with The Shared Heart by Barry & Joyce Vissell, should be given as wedding gifts to every couple! They just might save a few marriages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathfinder","review":"The band drives me nuts and as many times as I have attempted to set the barometer and altimeter, the altimeter always seems to be way off.

As far as the band goes, it come unbuckled and falls off of my wrist regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Otto","review":"Excellent! Nothing cheers me up like listening to Crazy Otto. My Uncle had this same album when I was little and I loved it then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful...!","review":"Those familiar with Norman Cook know his genius. Unfortuantely, it doesn't show in \\"Halfway...\\" It's a congested piece of oversampled beats and dysfunctional melodies holding abosolutely no catchy tune whatsoever. Instead, Cook relies on the old \\"Guest Singer\\" route (Macy Gray and Bootsy Collins being amongst those) to singing away to off-beats and congested melodies.Hopefully, FBS will have a better offering next time around. This one is one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambitious but Disappointing","review":"Fatboy Slim set his own bar too high with \\"you've come a long way, baby\\". The only way for Norman to evolve and escape the high expectations set by his former work is to evolve into a new direction. He chooses to literally spoil his own style by collaborating with Macy Gray and Bootsy Collins. Whether the already mentioned collaborations are fine is questionable. The fact that they are not techno at all, is however, not! The rest of the album also aims to sound original and makes a large step back from the quality of \\"you've come...\\". Although this album has an enormous commercial success, it is much much worse than Fatboy's last work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fatboy Skank","review":"It's not bad, per se--just not *there*. Fatboy has the big beat thing with thick layered sounds, but the funk thing isn't working for me. A little might have, but it just screeches on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on... It ends up being annoying instead of fun. It comes off as experimental, as it's said to be--but then I already have plenty of used CD-drink coasters from other experiments gone bad. To be fair, this isn't exactly a frisbee, but it's definately not on the A-list and probably not even the C-list. If Fatboy keeps this going, I'll be takin' a pass on his next collection of skank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fatboy Slim","review":"Every track on this disc reeks of Fatboy Slim, and that's a good thing. A few of the songs would be better without lyrics, but he does a good job keeping it entertaining. \\"Star 69\\" is a darn good song, but I think his remixes are better. This isn't his best CD, but's it's good enough to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost there - but not quite","review":"Unlike the last album, Norman's decided to tone it down a bit, recognising that big beat is slowly fading fast on the UK dance scene. This album is a little more housey and shows progression, but there seems to be something missing. A few of the tracks promise something, slowly building up the beat, leaving you waiting for the finale, but it never comes. A good album, not great (less commercial and radio-friendly than 'You've Come a Long Way Baby'), but still satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fatboy-like album","review":"I don't know what happened to him, but this CD is a disappointment compared to On The Floor at the Boutique, the Essential Mix, and even the Norman Cooke collection. The album is not interesting and lacks the humor that his previous albums have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Following the Chemical Brothers...?","review":"When I think of Fatboy Slim I think layered instrumental beats that create atmosphere, not Macy Gray. Stacking vocals onto what would have otherwise resulted in perfection seems like such a waste. The tracks don't suit eachother at all. There is no melding between songs which has made all of the other Slim albums so good. The vocals distract from the MUSIC which is what it SHOULD be all about. I would have had no problem with this album if he would have left out all of the singing. It is annoying, just like the Chemical Brothers \\"Surrender\\". So, if you're looking for a good techno/dance/mix album look elsewhere. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's New?","review":"Another album from our dear Mr Zoe Ball, wow, it has Bootsy Collins and our hottest neo-soul diva Macy Gray featured on it, yeah, it is different from the last album, but still, Fatboy Slim is forever Fatboy Slim, he is neither the creater of Big Beat music nor is he one of the most innovative. This might be a much better album than his awful 'You've come a long way', still, I smell much cheese in it. Come on, he can't even beat Chemical Brothers in terms of sonic experimentation, you expect him to experiment?? It is one of those insipid HUGE dance albums of the year, together with Roni Size's 'In The Mode' and Moby's 'Play: The B-Sides', all of those albums have GREAT marketing strategy and most dreary music. I rather stick to my Photek and Amon Tobin, sorry! Heard that he is not going to make music again, if it is not a stunt for Mr Ball to sell more copies of that trash, then I will say: Horray!!!Hey, Mr Ball, the exit is there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my","review":"I've not been a big fan of Norman Cooke's work. He's far too novelty-ish (is that even a word?) for my tastes. But this one just plain sucks. I don't know what it is.

Using samples is the way to go in this genre, good buddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake techno-Fechno","review":"Give me a break, people! As a recent admirer of REAL dance remixes I must say that I heard some of Fatboy Slim's songs such as \\"Praise You\\" and wanted to puke: it's not techno in the least. If only you opened your mind before you went ahead and rated this semi-talented waterbug as a first-class \\"Techno Maestro,\\" you'd eat my words.

Decidedly more mixed bag, even soul-infused in some instances such as the 2 Macy Gray collaborations Love life and Demons are already reasons to pick this album up, and there ain't too much electronic influences on these tracks but Macy's rapsy vocals worked in tandm with the sparse instrumentation provided by Cook. Other tracks such as the Jim Morrison-sampled Sunset (Bird Of Prey) and Retox are more alike to his previous works. Overall a good sophomore effort that isnt a formulaic follow-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dissapointed","review":"This is the worst album I've heard yet by Fatboy Slim. It seems he's lost touch with what makes really good dance and big-beat music. The only decent tracks are Ya Mama and Drop the Hate are the only two songs which can compare to his previous releases. It seems that the success of Praise You from his last album, and Moby's play have made him completely change to a softer, less hard-core form of music. I have been a loyal Fatboy Slim fan since his first album came out, I bought his second album opening day, as I did this one, but I thought this album was weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halfway to the toilet","review":"Upon listening to this CD, you'll be Halfway to... disgust. You'll probably be dissapointed that this CD is so different than his other stuff. But,keep listening you'll then find that it's an enjoyable CD, and worthy to own if you're looking for something a little different in the tecnho genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Wild CD","review":"Fatboy Slim has an accentric musical style, which is evident on this CD. The only flaw is that some of the songs are both repetitive and long, which is great for a party but kind of annoying if your listening by yourself.The real highlights (And I hate to say this) are the two songs featuring Macy Gray. Love Life is nice and funky, and Demons is a gospel styled song that is very interesting. More highlights included Sunset (Bird Of Prey) which has vocals by Jim Morrison, Ya Mama which was also on the Charlie's Angels soundtrack, and Weapon Of Choice, the new single which is getting large airplay on MTV. Although there are probably going to be no mainstream breakthroughs like the Rockafeller Skank, it's OK because Fatboy Slim is not a mainstream artist.This CD is a blast to listen to. The songs are fun and full of energy. I'd suggest it if you liked his previous work, or you like house music. This is an awesome CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best fatboy slim!","review":"I reckon this is the BEST fatboy slim cd, mainly because it has weapon of choice!

This has a lot less main stream sound than many of his other albums, but its a great show on the versatility of his music. If you dont like it, listen to it all the way through. If you still dont like it afterwards, go pick up some \\"Now thats what i call music\\" albums. Im sure thats more style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instant Used CD Bin Fodder","review":"Fatboy goes lame on this album. His desired style shift might be a personal preferance, but it's not listenable like his last two efforts. There's the exception...mainly track 8--Drop the Hate. Burn that song to an MP3 and sell it used, use it as a frisbee, or a coaster. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"...and a half stars!","review":"This CD should be 4.5 stars. It is one of those CD's that you have to listen to a couple times to aprecciate it because it's a very different turn for fatboy slim. The tracks with Macy Gray are awesome, Bootsy Collins is a good track, and all the other ones are really fantastic. You have to give this CD a chance, it may take a little time for it to grow on you, but once it does, you'll be very happy with the results. With a mix of trance, big beat, gospel, and hip-hop beats, fatboy slim doesn't upset with \\"Halfway Between The Gutter And The Stars\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CD of choice","review":"I bought this CD because I saw the \\"Weapon of Choice\\" video on T.V., and thought one song was good enough to buy the album.For the most part I've been happy with that choice, my tastes have been running from Acid Jazz to Prog Rock, and this seemed to be a movement towards hip-hop and funk. Hearing Bootsie gave this a nice feel.I play this CD as a background soundscape from time to time, and the \\"What the f**k\\" song is annoying, but not so much I skip over it.I've since gotten over the facination with \\"Weapon of Choice\\", and I realised that the Video really helped sell me this CD. I wish the video was available somewhere.On a positive note, I was really excited to discover the fat boy slim website with online mixes, and looking forward to listening to some of his other material.This is a compelling impulse buy and has solid tracks on it. It's the first of it's genre that I've bought, and I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"gottahaveit","review":"I enjoy the music on this CD very much. Fatboy Slim creates through a mystical alchemy an infectous set of dance numbers on Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars. My favourite smile producer and hip-shaker is LOVELIFE with its clever alphabet and colour code. Some pieces are frenetic like YAMAMA. DROPTHEHATE is arresting with a compelling, powerful message to \\"Drop the hate; forgive each other\\". The funk is blasted from a bass that never strays far from the mighty tree planted in the seventies, and the melodic lines bring back the songs of a time when an artist had a name. If you like melodic, accessible dance music with a super funky beat, this CD will interest you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatboy Slim Strikes Again","review":"Through a co-worker I've become a huge Fatboy Slim fan so I eagerly awaited his new CD.

I like to sleep on a queen blowup mattress with my daughter on one side and my husband sleeps on a cot with my son in his sleeping bag on the floor (he now got a cot but hasn't used it) on the other side.It does take some time to put it up and you need at least two people.

The process of ordering and shipping went very smoothly. We put it up in the backyard the same day. It was relatively easy to set up. You just need to make sure that you start with the roof. STEP ONE : you will have two poles marked green, one goes on the left, the other one on the right along the sides of the tent roof (the shorter 10 foot side). STEP 2 : take the two longest flexible poles and slide them through the blue sleeves into opposing corners of the roof, this will make an X. STEP 3 : use the two smaler flexible poles for the middle creating a diamond shape. STEP 4 : use the four red marked poles to hold the tent up in the corners. The two yellow poles go in the midlle of the 15-foot sides of the tent. Attach all the poles into the respective two/three way plastic elbows. Raise the tent up an VOILA.The size of this tent is very generous. We can't wait to go camping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tent but a little leakage around the door zippers","review":"THe tent was perfect for our family with 2 kids. Easy to set up.

Also, the design was unique. It was fairly easy to assemble, even by myself. As others have stated, the directions are hard to understand. Once I put the tent up, it was apparent that the seams were not sewn well. The zippers are cheap and snag. The rainfly could have been better as well, since there is not enough overhang at the doorways. If you don't do allot of camping and require a large tent, then this is for you. If you are a frequent camper, then I would recommend a higher quality tent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Tent","review":"We purchased this tent a little over a year ago. We have used it approximately six times. Two seams are already ripping, the cord that holds the bay window open with a stake is torn, the rings that the stakes go through are broken, the zippers on the door have always snagged (you have to step on the tent at the bottom to pull it tight enough not to snag, and there are strings hanging all over where the seams are coming apart.

It was 100 degrees that weekend, so we minimized our time in the tent. However, this thing is huge! It has ample headroom. The fully-separated rooms are very handy for coping with little kids. My favorite feature is all of the gigantic windows. It almost seems like the whole thing can become a mesh tent.Also, the footprint for this seemed a little less obscene than some of the other family-sized tents. It's super heavy, so it's not for backpackers! However, the case has rollers, so it's easy to get from car to site. Like any tent, it's a bit tricky to get back in the bag, but the bag also has an \\"expanding\\" zippered section that can increase the bag size for less-adept packers."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost in transit","review":"amazon sent to wrond address. they lied and it took, an act of God to get help. most of which came from ups and dhl not amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Tent Ever?","review":"Golly Gee Goober, I've owned enough tents to know this sure aint the best tent ever!

It comes with a nice canvas bag with wheels and the tent fits back into the bag very easily. I love the remote light that you can velcro to the tent, just enough light in the dark.

The only thing that I did not like with the tent was the poles for the top should be marked because they are very confusing, we put this tent almost togeether right several times only to find out the poles were wrong and that is a drag. Other then that it has alot of room and feels like a condo. Don't forget to put a tarp underneath it before you put it up to keep you the floor dry. Even when It does not rain the ground gets damp. A real nice feature and convenience was that there is a place to hang your battery lantern from the ceiling, that way the whole tent lights up. It also has lots of screens making it real airy and opting for a nice breeze from virtually every angle if you would like one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Quality!

We have owned several tents and none compares to the attention to details such as the snap lock fasteners for the rain fly.

Tough choice to make, but the Uruguaian rugby team who's plane crushed in the Andes in 1972 had to make theirs.Everyone who reads the book asks himself: what if I were in their situation? Would I have been brave enough to go on? Would I have been able to eat human flesh, even if it was the only mean of surviving?It is really pretty powerful. It actually makes you think, this book. Makes you appreciate the bravery of Fernando Parrado and his fellow passengers, be it if they made it at the end, or not.Piers Paul Read does a fabulous job of recounting it to those who haven't been there, makes it all come alive (what an ironic choice of a word) in front of our eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I caught the end tail of the documentary of this story on the history channel which made me want to read the book.

They not only face the lack of food due to no plants or animal life on the mountain, but also sub-zero temperatures and two avalanches. This is a story of how the desire of surviving comes true. This book also made us think about death from a wider perspective, and of how hard it is to lose a friend and have to eat his dead flesh in order to survive.

If you wanna save time, just watch the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"not gripping","review":"The main problems I have with this book are the lack of suspense and the poor documentary-like writing style.The book isn't suspenseful becuase you know from the beginning that there will be survivors, the digestive and cannabalistic hardships are predictable, and you cannot attach yourself to the characters and worry about whether they will be survivors. The only genuinely suspenseful part of the book lasts about 7 pages. The characters are consistently one-note in nature, and the interaction between them becomes predictable quickly. A probable reason for this is that the author didn't have enough room to develop the main characters since there are so many of them.I am aware that the book is nonfiction, and my secondary complaint is most likely a symptom of that, although I've read well-written nonfiction before.I'm quite tired right now, and I've probably made several spelling and grammar errors which I'm not the mood to check for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroism, not cannibalism, is the point of this amazing saga.","review":"Alive is the true story of the Uruguayan rugby team whose crossing of the Andes by plane ended in a tragic crash.

The boys were faced with almost certain death, yet their faith in each other and in God enabled them to withstand what for most of us would be beyond our ability to endure.

In fact, the duet sounds so impersonal, Madonna could have very well recorded her vocals on an Mp3 file before FedExing them to Spears. \\"Hey Britney,\\" goes Madonna, \\"you say you wanna lose control?\\" Well, if both singers lost a little \\"control\\" and got a tighter groove, \\"Me Against the Music\\" would be the killer dance tune it could have--and SHOULD have--been."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to good music?","review":"Britney is back, but she is not necessarily improving.

It's still too early to see if good music will win out, or if Britney and her legions of evil who gave her a record contract will ultimately achieve unholy victory.Britney Spears exemplifies what is wrong with the music industry today. There's now just a few corporate conglomerates using their resources try to sell people bad music like this. All the radio stations in this country are practically owned by only two companies, Viacom and Clearchannel, who want the same limited number of \\"recognizable\\" songs played so as to maximize their advertising revenue. Radio listeners are less likely than ever to have access to good music.Avoid this kind of heavily-promoted garbage and seek out some good music. It's out there if you look for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"britney and madonna lesbian loverz4life","review":"this sucks more than the 2 of them together they should make girls gone wild along with pisstina aguilera, pink, and every other lame azz pop icon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Is The Real Madonna?","review":"For Britney Spears, she seems to have entered an all time low with her career. People feel that way about her with her egotistical kiss with Madonna at the MTV Music Video Awards, which was just terrible. Although I'm not ashamed of Madonna for doing outrageous stunts, for Britney to do that has made her into a Manufactured Madonna these past few years. The song she claimed to have kissed Madonna with, Me Against The Music is one of the worst collaborations this year. I thought it was absolutely trashy. For Madonna, she sunk to a low level, and Britney has crashed into an iceberg. To be honest with you, Britney Spears kisses like she pulled on Madonna every time she is on stage now. As for the song, I seriously hope you pull it out, and trash it in the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"just as I thought it should have been.

A must read for vampire fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic, what can you say.","review":"I read the books a few years ago and wanted to have a digital copy. As the subject stated, it is the classic. Just as Tolkien can be thought of as the base of all fantasy novels and role-playing games, this book is the basis of all stories involving vampires. Dracula is a complex, non-soap opera, but evil, as a vampire should be. The resent flood of teenage friendly blood suckers is just sad. This is the way that they should be presented. A must read for any one who likes horror or fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Tis book really ended in a way I didn't expect. I can definitely say it held my attention for the longest time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody Does It Better","review":"What can I say? Bram Stoker is the master when it comes to vampires. No one has managed to do it better despite the many imitations (I am yet another author who has tried to follow in his footsteps). I absolutely loved this story from the moment I was first introduced to the junior version in primary school. In hindsight it seems like a very strange choice for young children, but I'm not complaining. The whole books is so steeped in Victorian sexual repression and desire that it is great fun to deconstruct, which I did much later as an English major. Forget Twilight and it's shallow, obvious themes and read a book with real depth and something important to say about the culture that it was created in. I've got to admit it does lose me a bit when it turns into a \\"boys-own\\" type of adventure towards the end, but it isn't enough to detract from its overall brilliance. Bram, baby, you're the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"intense read!","review":"I am, let's say, a big fan of vampire stuff. The story was so intense that I could not help but get hooked to it. I love the storyline, the plot, the characters, everything!I have been reading review already written for this book and was sadden to read about the negative comments regarding the language and as to how the book was written. If you will try to take a look on the bigger picture though, this story entails a diary/notes, so we'll just think that that is what's written.In general, this book is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a definite classic","review":"I was blown away by this book and highly recommend it to anyone mature enough to appreciate the superiority of literature over Hollywood kitsch. Long after all the movies have lost their sophistication and have become corny, this book will still be disturbing. When you read it, keep in mind that it was written over a century ago when society was rigidly moralistic and consider how shocking it would have been to a Victorian audience. Another suggestion is to consider reading it from the point of view that it could be the fear of the spread of syphilis that Bram Stoker was tapping into with the sexual-like contamination of the blood and the insanity. Then take it a step further and consider what impact the book would have if it were written today, only about AIDS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read if you adore vampires","review":"Even if you only /sort of/ adore vampires, just like folklore, or have a passing interest in supernatural fiction--\\"Dracula\\" by Bram Stoker is a rather necessary book. It's a wonderful, dramatic, fully realized, surprisingly topical novel, a quick read for all its antiquated language, and still popular even after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked this novel","review":"I've never been a huge goth/horror fan. I suppose werewolves and undead and all that are okay, as long as the heroes get to smack them good before the story's over. But if it gets too scary, I don't like it. I don't like being seriously scared, I guess. Suspense, that's great, and adventure, but not horror.Anyway, I really loved this novel. I was a little leery at first, for the reasons mentioned above, and also because of the sometimes association of vampires with sex. I wanted to read it because I wanted to see the source material that many modern vampire stories come from (\\"Van Helsing\\", undead in D&D;, \\"Vampire Hunter D\\", vampires in other video games and movies, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than I'd expected","review":"I've always told myself: sooner or later you must read Dracula. Honestly, one cannot be 30 and be always embarassed of his own ignorance because he has not read this classic. However, what has alwas stopped me, was the vague fear to be bored to death. I expected to find some old language, full of pathos and words no one has used in a century. But I was pleasantly disappointed! The book is really interesting, a true page turner, it is full of action. And it is very different from the movie with Gary Oldman. Very. Now just a couple of words to explain why I rated it 4 stars. Two things were a bit annoying: somewhat lengthy monologues of Van Helsing, and the fact that there is a very precise division between the good and the bad characters. But that's just a trait of the bygone century's literature- a part of it, at least. Overall, a must read, definitely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Classic","review":"If you are a occult lover, or a vampire fanatic, you must read this book. Bram Stoker is a great writter and has a lot of vampire lore to back his story up. The begging of the story is great, but it starts to drag on. I felt the ending was rushed, but the book is still a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sinlge, greatest novel ever written.","review":"This book is poetry in motion. The storyline flows through the novel unlike anything I have ever read before. Stoker's mastery of the literary technique by itself make it the greatest novel of all time. Combine that with the plot and sheer terror it bestows upon us and you have a novel that hasn't, and probably won't any time in my lifetime, be matched in its elegance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really exciting page turning book, every minute.","review":"Wow! This book is awsome! Even though it was required reading after reading the first few pages I was hooked. It is amazing how someone is able to write something as good as this. The only thing I didn't quite like was the way some things kept staying the same, like when Mina Harker was getting hypnothised. For a few days she said pretty much the same things. What would make this a better book would be more interesting variations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic.","review":"I saw the movie many years before I read the book, and the book is so much better.

None of the new vampire novels can compare to this classic. One of my favorite books of all time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic, but there are other classics","review":"Dracula by Bram Stoker is a classic novel of the 19th century. There is no question about that. Anyone investigating 19th century Western literature or who has a keen interest in disturbing fiction should read this novel. Indeed, Freudian, Darwinist, Niethzean, and Socialist forces were changing the West in the 1800's, and Stoker effectively uses them to frighten the reader. However, Amazon.Com wasn't convenient in the 19th century; it wasn't around. Similarly, what scared middle class Britons in the 19th century just isn't disturbing any longer. So if you want to read a disturbing fiction to be truly disturbed, avoid this. If you want to read a classic 19th century novel, read something by Dickens. Avoid this novel unless you have an acute interest in specifically reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the dead rest in piece.","review":"It's getting a bit long in the tooth now. Bram Stokers Dracula was a good book for it's time, but alas times have changed. There are a whole new breed of horror writers focusing on the vampire element in this day and age. You would be better of focusing on one of them. Dracula may be the most famous Vampire of them all, but if it's a good blood curdling horror story you are after there are many, more evil and fierce than he ever was.It's more like a warped version of beauty and the beast. The characters have that kind of melodramatic foppishness that comes with the period it's set in. If you've ever read anything by Brian Lumley then this book may be somewhat disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but there is better out there","review":"The book certainly has its powerful moments. But I was disappointed with the cliche writing. The characters at times risk being plastic. I am sorry there are no half stars available in the rating. I would give it a 2 and a half, rather than a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dracula Falls Short of Expectations","review":"I am fond of Bram Stoker's method of retelling the tale of Dracula from the vantage point of many different characters via their journals. At times however, these journal entries became rather wordy with extraneous information. I am glad that some of the characters' hopes and fears are explicity expressed, but then others' are not which is disappointing. The main female character, Mina Harker, is treated as an equal to the male characters (she was praised for her typing skills and her courage) and at the same time thought of as delicate and someone that needs protecting. It is a rather confused example for women's liberation to say the least. And my last comment deals with the fact that the ending falls horribly flat. All this suspense is built up, then in the final climatic scene (man vs monster) there's no struggle and it's all over very quickly without the extreme details given in the previous scenes. I expected something more from a \\"Classic\\" horror novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this a classic?","review":"I don't understand. I don't understand, why this has so many great reviews.

The time spent reading the three books was worth it. It was an entertaining cultural experience.I'll leave it to the experts to try to tell you why they are classics.

When I did, I really looked forward to getting back to it. I read a review that was upset the language of the period wasn't kept, but there was a tad in the form of quotations, and personally, I was glad it was written more modern-like as it was easier to keep up with and continue on without having to stop and savor what the persons are attempting to convey, with the old English being much more difficult to follow as quickly. It definitely kept my attention and I would reccomend this book for most all ages.

His depiction of the 'Man Himself' paints a picture of total evil, and he is likewise able to describe and form completely different and original characters, in Jonathan Harker, Jack Seward, Lord Godalming, Quincey Morris, Mina Harker, Lucy Westenra, and the powerful Van Helsing. Through these characters' eyes the story it told, vividly and with a sense of hurriedness that will draw you in and keep you through the novel, and through the method of 'journals' these characters come to life in a way that would not be possible otherwise.

They don't really express the wide range of emotions we would expect in real people; they are entirely too predictable. The story, too, while containing some admirable elements, is not as exciting as, say, \\"Frankenstein\\" or \\"Great Expectations\\".

First, note the unique literary style, sequences from journals and letters of the protagonists. This would have enhanced the realism to the book's early readers. Also, note the power of the crucifix and the communion wafer. The world of a hundred years ago adhered to a religious fundamentalism that is now found principally among those whom civilization has left behind. The supernatural elements are portrayed as perfectly realistic and the reader is genuinely terrified of the Count and his converts. If you cannot discipline yourself to put on those one hundred year old eyes, however, you may find this book to be little more than an interesting entrant in the history of science fiction, without the tension. Now, if you really want to feel terror, try warding off a hoard of modern fiction's monsters with a crucifix."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book, like its namesake, is timeless!","review":"I read Dracula many years ago, and the beginning chapters still haunt my memory today.

After the play when asked how he liked it he replied, \\"It was alright, but it had too many cliches.\\" To complain about how Dracula met his end in the original book, is like reading North and South and wondering who's going to win the war. Or watching Titanic and being surprised that the ship sinks. In my mind the flowery Victorian style only adds to the horror.

I highly recommend reading Dracula and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read Classic","review":"This book is long but it is a good book to read to pass the time and it chills you to the bone. And the book itself is not expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before there was Twilight...","review":"Dracula has always been one of those books that people say, \\"Oh, I loved that story\\" without actually reading it. According to Twain, that would qualify it as a classic. I absolutely love the letter/journal technique that the novel uses as its main narrative structure. Brilliant. At first, this may seem troublesome, but stick with it and by the end, you'll love it. It gives the reader a chance to get inside the head of multiple characters, a major plus. Don't be afraid to tackle this somewhat long book. Yes, it's about a \\"bad guy\\" vampire, but it has so many things going for it.I'm pretty neutral about the Twilight series; however, if someone wants to talk about Twilight, they need to at least read Dracula first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good explainations in the book","review":"Its a good book because it explains the text of how the author wanted the reader to see it as"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Being such a big fan of the vampire genre, I'm amazed that I waited this long to finally read the one that started it all. I'm so glad I finally did. Bram Stoker's Dracula is full of creepiness, suspense and rich atmosphere. The story is told completely through correspondence (letters, diaries, newspaper articles...), but it flows smoothly and that method gives great insight into each of the characters and what they're thinking and feeling. Dracula is a thrilling page-turner that everyone should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dracula, better than the movie......all of them.","review":"Dracula, a 19th century horror book, is holding true to its genre, despite its age. This book had me at the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. The book is set up in a journalistic/letter written style, making it more suspensful. You may find that the letter you are reading is a simple entry in the character's life, or the last letter/entry that they'll ever write. This book takes its time by showing the characters emotions and lives than rushing through it like most movies. This is Dracula, in his freakiest form...his first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dracula the Unexpected","review":"Perhaps, like most people, I had preconceived ideas about Dracula. Hollywood has been hard at work creating an image which, while ghoulish, is much different than the novel.Bram Stoker's book is subtle and chilling. Dracula is all pervasive and immensely powerful. He is cold and can find his victim almost anywhere.I recommend this book to everyone. The reader will be unnerved by its pricipal character but pleased that the novel itself is so different from the standard dross dished out by Hollywood. Read it and relish in Dracula in his original carnation."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT transaction!","review":"Thank you for the smooth, fast transaction.

There are about 20 good pages which are countered by over 450 of pure dreck. Don't even get me started with Van Helsing's painful \\"dialect,\\" which is like the worst writing of Twain and Stephen Crane when they did the same thing. The myth and idea of the Count have staying power, but the novel is as dull as dirt. I know all the critical reasons for its popularity, but all of these strike me as very strained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"Maybe I just started reading it with the wrong idea in mind but it seemed rather boring to me.

The Transylvanian setting is commendable as well. Unfortunately (and this is terrible), it seems that Bram Stoker did not realize his true talent. The rest of this story is mostly about his flat human characters from London, the most annoying of which is Mina, who tries to act mysterious by giving Van Helsing an unintelligible diary as a joke. The most redeeming aspect of the rest of the novel is Lucy's suspenseful struggle against death, but after she finally dies, the author really has nothing left going for him. This is the trendsetting vampire novel however, so I highly recommend it nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"As awesome as Dracula started out and as amazing some sections were within the first half, the book as a whole is a huge yawn. I saw this on a few lists of best horror novels of all time (even on a list as one of the scariest books of all time) and I could not disagree more. As I approached the end of the book, I began to wonder \\"how could this end yet, only fifty more pages to get to the climax of the book and start on the gore by the Count or to the Count?\\". Fifty pages turned into thirty, then twenty, then ten, and alas Bram got to the climax (if you can call such a disastrous ending) and began and ended it within a paragraph. No gore, no horror, no nothing. I wanted this to be something of horror lore, but it signifies only a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 STARS BECAUSE OF DAMAGE","review":"I give this 1 star because the book arrived damaged, the red page edges had alot of damage, corners was damaged badly, It had a bad scratch down the middle of the pic on front, the back looked like it had been rubbed around on the floor and the binding was broke.

It started out very interesting, and certain parts were not bad at all. But all the other things that seemingly had nothing to do with the novel was distracting and caused me to stop after 100 pages. I was to do a book report on this, and ended up doing my report on Gaston Leroux's Phantom of the Opera, which is a wonderful story. I would advise many to not read Dracula. Maybe I have missed something completely in this story, that does happen sometimes, but I thought it was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this a Clasic?","review":"OK, why is this book required reading for high school students? It is very long and I think that Bram Stoker was german anyway that's gotta get people confused. All of the sentances are backwords!

The male characters are not much better. the story itself becomes a lingering punishment to finish. if you must read it, i suggest that you find an abridged version."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, boring \\"classic\\"","review":"Maybe I've read too much Sookie and Twilight, but I thought that this \\"classic\\" of Dracula.

What I love most about this work is that it is told through letters and diaries of those involved instead of being a typically written story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dracula","review":"Before the Twilight series there were stories about Vampires that actually were good. The most famous of these was the story of Dracula by Bram Stoker. Structurally it is an epistolary novel, that is, told as a series of letters, diary entries, ships' logs, etc. Literary critics have examined many themes in the novel, such as the role of women in Victorian culture, conventional and conservative sexuality, immigration, colonialism, postcolonialism and folklore. Although Stoker did not invent the vampire, the novel's influence on the popularity of vampires has been singularly responsible for many theatrical, film and television interpretations throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.This book was a long one and at times I admit to struggling with it. I was very interested in the origins of Dracula, but I think there was so much involved in this book that at times I don't think I enjoyed reading it. Overall it was a decent book but I wouldn't consider it a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the greatest vampire story of all","review":"Deep and Freudian, full of unconscious images and atmosphere.

Unsurpassed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stoker's classic vampire story is still captivating!","review":"Those who have seen the recent film treatment of _Dracula_ will be interested to hear that it actually sticks pretty closely to the book. If you are only familiar with the myth of Dracula through movies, I strongly recommend that you read the book that started the Dracula legend. Although some of the language (especially dialect) of the story is outdated, it is surprisingly readable, and not overly afflicted with flowery prose. _Dracula_ is told in the form of diary entries and letters, so the reader gets to see inside the heads of a few different characters. This book is definitely worth reading if you have any curiousity at all about vampires"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dracula","review":"I would not recommend this edition to anyone. Very disappointing. I bought this edition last year and just got round to reading it. I read the paperback many years ago and often say it is one of the most atmospheric books I have ever read; but I must say that this edition is unbelievable!

Oh what the hell, i said to myself, I watched vampires movies and they were scary a lot but can it be alike in a book. nah of course not! well people i was wrong. This masterpiece of Gothic horror is the story of archetypal evil and the eternal struggle between life and death. It is the lefend of the vampire, who feeds a diabolic craving into the veins of his victims while drawing from them the human blood that is his only sustenance. The hypnotic spell that Dracula casts over the reader will linger through many black and stormy nights.

The story is written as the diary of young Jonthan Harker, detailing his trip to East Europe on behalf of Count Dracula, the ship's log journeying from the Black Sea to England, and the encounters Harker has with the vampire upon his return to London.The story works on several levels - as a classic horror novel, as a love story, as a commentary on good and evil and the human condition - even as a travelouge (the places and routes taken by the characters are uncannily accurate). But it is as a horror / thriller that this book is at its best.Leave your expectations behind - the original is very unlike most of the films inspired by it (Coppola's \\"Brahm Stoker's Dracula\\" is the closest to the book) - I recommend you read it on its own merits.

Written as a series of letters and journal entries in a quaint Victorian style, Stoker's work is heavily reminiscent of other authors of that time period, including Doyle and Poe.The vampire mythology that has sprung up over the last century has has greatly revamped the powers and weaknesses of Stoker's monster, the core remains. The dreaded Count Dracula leaves his Romanian castle to come to London, to search for the fresh blood he desires to quench his insatiable lust. A group of Englishmen must uncover the nature of the beast in order to destroy it and protect their loves.While the book seems somewhat more lengthy and wordy than need be, and its vampire seems almost tame in comparison to modern versions, it still serves as a great reminder how this all began."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to be a writer its a must","review":"Dracula is an amazing lesson on the characterization.

Probably it would because it is so innovative otherwise. But the rating of such a novel goes beyond normal considerations. The plot does pick up nicely though and who can argue with ze count overall and his permeating influence in modern culture.

The fear, the dread, the sinister Count and elegant prose all add to feel of a great horror novel.Then the rest of the book comes along. What once was a horror movie becomes pure Victorian drivel, with laughably divination for the two females, Lucy and Mina, that not only destroys the readability with the extreme flowery nature of their banalities, but detracts from the true horror that Stoker brings about in the first 100 pages.The last fifty pages are interesting, as they are on the quest to destroy Dracula, but the drudgery of language and the previous 300 pages destroy all hope of enjoying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dracula","review":"I do not like this story.

In the first 200 pages there have literally been less than a handful of short-lived moments that were actually interesting. Other than that it feels like NOTHING is happening. There's no STORY here.I can't help but wonder what are the standards when it comes to classic books...Is it simply being old? Groundbreaking? Longevity?

I like to actually read books but don't get a lot of time to do that, so I could listen to the book when I wanted to and then it would sync up to the approximate location in the written version so I could read when I had a chance. Didn't get it to actually sync exactly to the same spots where I stop reading one and opened the other but it was close enough I could find it without problems.I do bristle a little at having to pay twice for the same book, but I guess I do that with VHS and DVD movies if I want different formats so i can't complain.The book itself is classic.

I had never sat down to read the book. Now that I have an eBook reader on my iPhone and iPad (and Android), I took the opportunity to download this book. To say it's engrossing is an understatement. Stoker's eloquent use of the English language is so evocative, and actually quite beautiful at times. There is no gore or ugliness, in fact, it makes you realize how much liberty Hollywood took (surprise...NOT!) in making the films. I truly think this is one of the masterpieces of English-language literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Thrilling Tale","review":"I loved this novel; the story was well written and I was even frightened at times as to the detail and the images of the greatest vampire of all time. I would strongly encourage evertbody to read this wonderful classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for all horror fans","review":"First let me say that I wanted to review the unabridged version and couldnt find it on Amazon. Bram Stoker's books was writtten in the late 1800's so some of the text my require a look into the dictionary. It is by no means unreadable. I think even a young teen would have no problem with it. I had to look a few words up but so what I expanded my vocabulary a bit. If your not sure just go to a book store and turn a few pages. If you like spooky stories about vampires and the like you'll enjoy this book. One thing I have to say is that I saw the movie first (the one with Gary Oldman titled same as the book) and I actually liked the movie more than the book. The movie puts a romantic twist to it that really works in the film. If you havent seen the movie read the book first. You may wind up liking the book more than the movie. You cant go wrong. It's a classice book that should be on your reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this edited?","review":"Why is this text so disfiguringly edited? This edition of the classic novel has been rewritten in colloquial \\"common\\" American English. And not well... it reads like a Goosebumps novel, and there is absolutely none of the natural flow of the language that made the original text so enjoyable to read. It seems almost like this is one of those attempts to write old literature in a fashion more appropriate for \\"young adult\\" readers. Even if this is the case (and there is absolutely no indication judging by the cover or the contents leading up to the first chapter that this is true), the problem is that this is edited badly... very very badly. This is a shameful ruination of Bram Stoker's fantastic story. I implore anyone who finds this review to rather search for another edition. There is a reason this one is so cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic novel with excellent narration","review":"One of the very best Gothic novels gets first-class treatment from narrator Robert Whitfield in this unabridged production.

There are many different interpretations of the meaning of this story, but I like to think of it as the \\"dark side\\" of Victorian literature. It is also interesting to point out the many erotic overtones in the book. As for the story itself, it drags a bit, and though it is genuinely creepy in some parts, the ending is so quick that everything is wrapped up in two pages, with a \\"happily ever after\\"-type ending that has Van Helsing bouncing Mina and Jonathan's child on his knee. However, though the book does have its faults, it is still a classic novel of English literature and should not necessarily be classified as \\"horror fiction\\" when there is a lot more there to be discussed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than I expected","review":"My only experience with Dracula has been with movies, so my expectations were entirely different. I found the novel very enjoyable and found the style to be interesting; it gave me a way to see the story from several points of view. I had expected more of the story to take place in Dracula's castle instead of most of it taking place in London.This is the first novel that I read on my kindle and I have already started reading several other books on it. It is a good way to go through books and is easy on the eyes.This free edition is basically text with no table of contents or links, but for a novel that is fine with me. The Kindle search function allowed me to do a search for \`chapter' and I was able to create my own table of contents.

I had read Black Flower a few years ago, and absoluetly loved it. The Judas Field is most certainly on par.His novels on the Civil War reach far beyond the battlefields themselves. He truly has a strong grasp on the psyches of those who lived and fought this war. And his ability to paint the southern landscape is breathtaking at times.His characters are true grit, with incredible depth.While he has written three, on topic, this is only the second I have read. I will most definetly be going back for the third.If not for authors such as Bahr, I'd unlikely read very much fiction at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight to another time.","review":"This book is a well written reminder of the changes in custom, values, and culture. It brings the horror and lasting effects of war to reality for the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I have been a Howard Bahr fan since THE BLACK FLOWER, and now he has in this third novel written a fine portrayal of the burden of the Civil War on those who fought it and the ones who waited. Bahr is a master of description and his prose is poetic in its imagery. Anyone who thinks that war is noble must read Cass Wakefield's ever-present memories of the Battle of Franklin--his comrades who were blown to bits, the bloody ground, the maimed corpses, the futile stand by an army ill-equipped, starving, and threadbare. It was Franklin, Tennessee, but it could be Iraq. The reader should make a trip to the site of the battle and walk among the headstones in the little cemetery. There are ghosts there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an Outstanding Book","review":"This is the second one of Bahr's books I have read. I enjoyed The Black Flower, but I think this is the better book. In fact, this is a remarkably good book. Bahr has an uncanny ability to capture what I assume was the whole scene surrounding the Civil War. His accounts of the battles are memorable and his accounts of what must have been going on in the heads of the soldiers is excellent. The book is haunting. He doesn't sugarcoat the realities of the killing and suffering. I recommend it unconditionally not to just Civil War buffs, but to anyone who enjoys getting lost in great literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Judas Field","review":"Wonderful book by an amazing author.

It's hard to find clothing that will fit all the dolls.The Sweetsville Kelly dolls with the large heads (often called \\"lemonheads\\" by collectors) seem to have been a huge failure.

This was the first time that I had not bought the Holiday doll since 1988.When I saw the 2004 doll in the store, I knew that I would not be purchasing her either! Her head is too big and her face looks like a hooker's. I did give her one star for the gown. I would buy the gown if I could get it without the doll, which ruins the overall effect. She looks like one of those $5 Barbie lookalikes that are sold in convenience stores.I know that these big headed dolls are popular with the kids, but I hope that Mattel will consider the likes of collectors as well.

The sets generally appear to have been made by an amateur company, and one is left to wonder if there was a director present at all stages there are so many places where the cast seem to move aimlessly, unsure of where they are supposed to go. The conclusion of Gotterdammerung must represent the worst staging ever presented.

The title clearly indicates, but does tend to make most think it is primarily about Lewis and Joy. At any rate, it comes across as readable but dry. It seems to be about a boy lost in a confusing life filled with loss who then seeks desperately for his own worth. Sadly he seems to find his worth mostly in who his mother and stepfather were. If that is the sort of story you seek, then this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Douglas G.","review":"What an unusual childhood Douglas had living with 2 geniuses.

Gresham was eight years old when his mother took him and his brother to England to meet the writer; in time, she and Lewis married. Gresham's mother died when he was fifteen and Lewis died three years later.The subtitle of this book - \\"My childhood with Joy Davidman and C. S. Lewis\\" - is misleading, because he has little to say about them. Gresham was away at school throughout their marriage and his descriptions of Lewis are vague, indicating he didn't know him well. The book should have ended with Jack's death, but goes on at length about Gresham's adult life which was uneventful. Fans of C. S. Lewis who hope to gain insight into the man will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mission Octagon","review":"Mission Octagon is an action packed thriller that you won't be able to put down until you know how it ends.

It's bad enough when you try to change the cat's litterbox. But you're asking for trouble putting this poorly designed contraption on it. What's even worse it trying to wrestle with removing and reinstalling it should you need to do anything to the box. It's bad enough the top half of the \\"Mega Elite\\" doesn't firmly attach to the base. But the little poles on this cover tend to get stuck in their mounting holes and pull up the base when you try to remove the cover. So then you're faced with the hassle of putting the top back into place before you can reinstall the cover.Basically it seems like a good idea but in practical it's a huge pain in the, well... just avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy it!","review":"This piece of junk broke before I even had a chance to use it.

I know our cat(s) leaning on the kabana is what is causing it to rip but if it is a product used by cats it should be durable enough to withstand a little bit of handling.

It was one of his favorites. It became one of my favorites, too. Over the years, I reread the paperback so many times that it literally fell apart. I was delighted to rediscover the Kindle edition.Don't be put off by the genre. The plot is much more adventure tale and character study than western. The plot revolves around the dynamic between the books' two central characters; the cowboy, a seasoned trail boss engaged to deliver a herd of cattle half way around the world, and the Cossack--a Russian officer assigned to make certain the herd is delivered. It is the interaction between these two strong me, who literally come from opposite ends of the earth, and their relationship to the men they lead which makes the tale.If you enjoy Jack London or Kipling's adventure tales, you will likely enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cowboy story ever!!!!","review":"I read this in paperback years ago and gave the book away.

To find it again on Kindle was truly a great moment. However, this is not for the faint of heart. If it was a movie it would be rated R. The language is down and dirty and it you are offended by that kind of talk you might want to look elsewhere. If you can get around the language, this is a great story and not just a great story but a look into the heart of two very different men who are very similar. I enjoyed the way Huffaker brought out the fact that some people are more alike than they think. This is another great read and you will find yourself with the characters every step of the way. Hard to put down until the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I first ran across this book when I was in high school - found it in my dad's library - I loved it - and re-read it over and over again.

Thanks for bringing it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Returned It","review":"I'm somewhat surprised I'm in a position of writing a negative review. But after reading about a 1/3 of the book, I asked for a refund. I spent a lot of time as a youth on a working cattle ranch. It's obvious from the 1st chapter, the writer knows nothing about cattle or cattle drives. I was turned off by page after page of \\"colorful metaphors\\" as Spock would put it. I'll leave it at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whenever I find this book, I buy it.","review":"I've never been a western fan. I'll say that right up front because that said, I buy this book every chance I get. My copies keep vanishing as I loan them out and new readers fall in love with Huffaker's work. This, and One Time I Saw Morning Coming Home - these two books are full of warmth, compassion, passion and the rich delight that comes with a book that's just a wonderful read. Huffaker deserves a much wider readership and it's a shame his books aren't better known. Give this one a chance if you see it - and then share it with someone who's never had the luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"I read this book ages and ages ago and loved it so much that I looked for it in every public and military library I was near as a traveled around the world for twenty years in the Air Force. It's become so hard to find, that I finally purchased a used copy a couple of years ago. I am a voracious reader, but normally do not read Westerns. However, this is one of the best books I've ever read. It's essentially about friendship, honor, loyalty, etc., but it rises above cliches because the characters are so unique. It (and anything else by Huffaker) needs to be re-published."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have read this book several times and each time I am re-convinced of how real the story is. At many points, I am either laughing or nearly crying. Huffaker really brings his characters to life. If you have never read this book, read it. And then read it again. And again. You will never tire of reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent study of human nature, hilarious and moving","review":"I first read this book as a teenager. To this day (22 years later) it remains my all-time favorite. The story presents some of the richest characterizations of human beings to be found in written word. It combines the best of adventure, history, humor, sorrow, friendship, fraility, and love into a riviting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuzzy Venus.","review":"Some have compared this release with Fuzzy Logic and this was, for them, a good thing. After buying Phantom Power and Rings Around The World I found Fuzzy Logic to be bland and generic.Hey Venus is better than Fuzzy Logic in that it contains two songs that I enjoy rather than none. Most of the tracks are repetitive and lacking in the sparks that made the last SFA albums so good.Perhaps Gruff Rhys' solo effort, Candylion, took away some of the songs that would have ended up here. Perhaps they decided to lay off the weed for a while. Whatever happened, Hey Venus is a step backwards for such a talented band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing & Disturbing","review":"This story begins with a scenario involving the sex trade in gold rush San Francisco. Ms. Coulter goes into great detail over the heroine's experiences at the hands of her captor. What I found distasteful in the extreme was the ongoing sordid sexual perversity between Dr. Saint Morris and young Juliana, the girl he rescued. Very needlessly dark and disturbing. Not Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and Disappointing","review":"The book begins with an interesting story of human trafficking that draws the reader in. A great potential villain is sketched out. But it all ends there. The storyline is soon abandoned. I kept reading and hoping for its reappearance. But the next three quarters of the book rambles here and there and becomes a drudgery to read. The villain disappears for long periods of time, only reappearing by name or brief encounter. Only near the end does he reappear for an flawed ending that seems to conjure sympathy for him. Very disappointing. The plotting is illogical throughout and the dialogue is especially weak, that which you might see from very beginning writer. I found nothing about this book to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to read","review":"As a huge fan of Sophie's Choice, I decided to try this one. It may be \\"great art\\" since the critics all love it but it shouldn't be this difficult to read a book. Virtually no characters are likable. The story is totally depressing and repetitive. I almost didn't finish it but at some point decided to go down with the ship. Probably won't read another Styron."},{"rating":"1","title":"rambling","review":"I'm not sure if it's the translation from book to Kindle, or the writing itself, but all I can say about this book is that it rambled on and on.

Everything is so ambiguous, and the plotline is very vague. I like real classics, not this modernist trash. This book was awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vivid Painful Story that Alas Goes on Too Long","review":"Overall I liked this book but I thought it began to drag towards the end. It became really repetitive and just wanted Peyton to throw herself out that window just to make the novel stop. Ugh. Styron's talent for vivid description is amazing and he gets all the characters right. But it just begins to plod along and I had to force myself through the last third of the book. Still, definitely worth the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tortured lives","review":"William Styron's first novel is often overlooked because \\"Sophie's Choice\\" is, without doubt, his flagship; however, his style in \\"Lie Down in Darkness\\" is as melancholy and forceful as it was in each of his subsequent novels. No reader can leave these pages unmoved by the depth of suffering, both self-imposed and due to other forces, of its principal characters. The family unit is rife with undercurrents and has no opportunity to become functional because the parents are so deeply enthralled with their own problems. I disliked Helen the most. Her passive aggressive martyrdom fueled her husband's neuroses and alcoholism until their relationship became Faulknerian in its dysfunction. Styron's well-known bouts of depression obviously inspired much of the insights into mental illness. The pain of these characters is palpable throughout the book, and I find myself thinking about this family more than I would like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it's finally over","review":"Yes this is beautifully written, \\"masterful prose\\". I wholeheartedly agree. Enjoyable reading? Definately not. I didn't find it depressing. I would sum it up as bad things happening to bad people. Not one major character had any redeeming quality at all. That's not the problem, though, for me anyway. I don't know the right word, long winded? rambling? For example, in one of the final sections of the book Peyton is speaking in about a hundred page long, all one paragraph, stream of consciousness. It's the culmination of the whole book, leading up to her suicide. It would be the most interesting reading yet, I thought, but it felt like it would never end. For me reading shouldn't be work and this was a lot of work to get through and I didn't feel like it was worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"I got this for my 8 year old son. he loves remote control toys but is rough on them. We had the XPV and it last alot more money and lasted 1 week. We have had this toy for a mont.

So far I has held up well and was well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes are so-so!!!!","review":"I bought this book when I was pregnant hoping that it would help me eat right. While the recipes might be healthy, the actual recipes itself aren't too tasty. Also, the pictures don't do it justice. I think I found about three recipes that I actually liked in this book. And these three recipes weren't super great. The times I did make them, I made them mostly since they were healthy and not so much for taste. For me, this wasn't the best book of recipes for pregnant women and if I had done it again, I probably wouldn't have purchased this book. My advice for anyone looking to buy this book is that you should go to a bookstore and look through it. That way you can see for yourself whether you would really like the recipes in this book and if this is something you would really want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Clear Recipes","review":"Not a bad book.

Lou Reed was never about selling out or having loads of extra this and that so it is not to be expected. What is to be expected is fine Rock N Roll. But, when Lou is associated with Rock N Roll he is also associated with Rap, Poetry, Electronic, and Glam Rock. Lou rocks out hard and exotic. The Celloist tortures her Cello during \\"Venus in Furs\\" and Lou sings it in an uncanny way. \\"Romeo Had Juliet\\" rambles into the 10+ minute territory and Lou turns it on and lets out the rock star that he is. My only complaint is Master Ren and Antony are not on board to hoard the spotlight. But, after 2 minutes into the concert their otherworldly precenses' are not missed and we can embrace Lou and his band prancing through classic songs with fresh twists. If you are a fan of modern Lou or glam rock Lou this DVD will entrance you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and uncaptivating.","review":"The style of writing was one of the poorest I have ever seen.

There ARE such things as Hispanic or African-Amercian riders. This magazine is obviously geared towards all those stuck-up, rich little girls with their own ponies. Why the 2 stars then? Cuz I loved the posters and there was some good information in it and the writers made it easy for younger kids to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the beginner","review":"Young Rider is a great magazine for the beginner- the articles are very simple and easy to understand. They have great posters, but there's usually an article on their backside. There are ads lining almost every page; there isn't nearly as much content as there used to be. The average YR magazine has about 60 pages/9 articles, which usually have half-page pictures. I'd reccomend a magazine such as Practical Horseman or Horse Illustrated for anyone over 13. But, for a young horselover, it's a very helpful resource. There's several pages displaying readers' pictures and stories, along with a few step-by-step articles. Things like coloring and markings are discussed in detail, and many famous events (like the Rolex Kentucky) are reported on. For the completely new English and Western rider, it would make a great gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice poster","review":"When I was younger I use to go to barnes and noble and flip through young rider. Only reason why I bought it was if there was a nice picture for the huge center poster. Even at a young age the articles seemed ridiculously simple and never actually contained useful information. I ended up subscribing to Horse Illustrated as soon as my parents agreed to pay for it and continued for a few years. If you want nice posters get this. If you want good general magazine you will actually read and learn from that also has nice picture (and its own centerfold, though smaller), get Horse Illustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"This is a great resource for young riders.

The first-time qualitative researcher will now be able to go through the process with a competent guide, while the experienced researcher will be able to find answers to unanswered questions. The book starts with an explanation of the theoretical and philosphical foundations of the grounded theory method in qualitative research.

Sections that give definitions of terms used in this research approach provide a clearer understanding of the discussion in each chapter.

Strauss (who died in 1996, two years before the new edition of the book was published) and Corbin have thoroughly revised the first edition of \\"Basics of Qualitative Research\\" and added, among other things, a FAQ based on their students' questions. Caution, though, the book is NOT a step-by-step manual or a A-to-Z handbook for forging concepts, building categories and properties, etc. and other books will have to be read as an introduction to the technical aspects of qualitative research. Also, a complete newcomer to qualitative analysis may find chapters 5, 6 and 7 unclear until he gets to chapter 8 about open coding.This re-edition of a classic is nonetheless a must-read for every junior researcher pretending to work in the tradition of grounded theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"This book describes all the basics of research in a clear, concise manner.

It arrived messed up on the ends. Since this was a gift did not want to give something that looks used. I have since found it in a store close by but really disappointed in the way this item was packed without cushioning therefore book arrived damaged. It is to much hassle to try and print out a label and mail it back so it went to charity.

No Bah-Hum-BUGS here!","review":"My toddler does not like bugs in real life, but she absolutely LOVES this Jingle Bugs book. It keeps her very entertained and is a requested favorite bedtime story year round. However, I do suggest strong parental supervision as some of the pop ups will tear under the man-handling of impatient chubby fingers. (The ornament bug, in particular, gets caught on it's box.) The lights and music on the last page can be a little tricky, but with some gentle manuevering, they will work.Overall, this is a highly entertaining book with bright, amusing pictures and witty rhyme that both kids and parents will enjoy reading together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I picked up a copy of this set very cheaply on Ebay [UK] with no big expectations about its quality, having been brought up on the old maxim that you get what you pay for. Boy, was I ever wrong. This edition surpasses my expectations big time and while my ultimate wish is to be wealthy enough to own a set of Solti's Ring Cycle I am beginning to enjoy this set more and more.The vocals come through clearly and for a live performance the sound is very clean. My edition came with the lyrics in German only, so unless your German is reasonably good you will need to find an English translation somewhere to help you out, but this is a small quibble. If you know the storyline you'll be able to follow things reasonably well.

Did I read a storybook on the business or did I actually learn to create professional animation with 3ds Max, Lightwave, and Maya? It seems that George Avgerakis is very savvy when it comes to the applications of business for Animation or he would not exist in his present position. As such he does very little in the terms of providing a good example of actually creating professional quality animation. He sells you a completely different book instead, which mind you, with a different cover could tell a better tale.

I don't think so!At the beginning of the book, the author writes \\"I didn't want to open [this book] with a lot of boring stuff about how this book was organized or what you could expect to get out of it.\\" There is a good reason for that.

Even General Eisenhower admitted that he had no choice other than to keep the brass in Washinton happy as well as the British. Had General Patton been allowed to continue without being stopped at several critical points during the war, not only would that have saved many American lives as well as others including the Germans, but many of us who served under Patton feel that the war would have ended much sooner, that the conflict over Berlin would never have occurred as we would have gotten there first and that his concern that many countries were turned over to the Russians and ended up totally unliberated while we did nothing might have been altered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interresting","review":"This book was difficult for me to follow.

To tell you how confused I was, one moment I thought I was in North Africa and the next he's talking about Italy. I said, \\"when did I get to Italy?\\" On the other hand, you do get a feel for who Patton was and he does give some good advice for tactics and he had some very interresting views of how digging fox holes dropped [spirits]. I didn't notice any mention of him slapping the soldier that he took so much heat over.I'm not going to give up on his writing and will some day try to read another book by him.

There's a couple of interesting subjects: jet engines, guitars, helicopters. But some are very incomplete - the chapter on watches focuses entirely on electronic quartz watches.

This woman needs to wake up and realize that a happy marriage usually wants to have sexual relations with the partners -because they love each other, not b/c they are sexually frustrated and unloved children.

Since we have this great thing called electricity many parents prefer to stay up a little later than their children, but the children grow to rely on the parental snuggling to fall asleep. It makes the children difficult to put to bed when babysitting for them (or in this case, impossible!) Also there is some silly \\"historical\\" type chat that seems anecdotal and unscientific.

All of these have solutions that we continue to work out for ourselves, but this author's comments were not helpful.

Big disappointment. The magazine is great, but not the service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanity Fair","review":"Received April 2009 issue, but no May although it has been on newsstands for some time. Sent email to Conde Nast via their website with no response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Current Topics","review":"I have read Vanity Fair for the past twenty years. The articles are timely and in depth. There are articles on politicians, bankers, CEOs as well as the Hollywood types. This is the magazine for those who want to be in the know. Also, the photographs are fantastic. If you are looking for a two paragraph blurb about the actress/actor of the hour, this is not the magazine for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah....","review":"I bought the Angelina Jolie issue in store and skimmed through the magazine. At the time I thought it was a pretty good magazine despite all the ads. Fast forward a few months and I now realize I have a magazine subscription to a boring magazine. Each month the mag is full of ads, I don't really enjoy the substance in it or the writing style. I think I got in over my head on this one. To each their own though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have not received my 1st issue yet","review":"I wished I would have heeded the other reviews about magazine delivery service. I was lured by the great prices, but delivery has been inconsistent. My Vanity Fair subscription was placed a month ago, and I have yet to receive my first issue. To be fair, the delivery date was stated as 5/20, but honestly how long should it take to mail a magazine? I love the magazine, so this review is more about the magazine delivery then the content in Vanity Fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, I'm a \\"Professional Subscriber\\"!","review":"I just went online to see how much a year's subscription in Canada would cost me - it said $38.00.

And my \\"special price\\" is only - you guessed it - $38.00. What a bunch of B...S.... you guys are peddling!! Come on - just be honest ok?

That being said, there is supposed to be a post card sent to the recipient of the order, this was not done. The estimated delivery dates on Amazon's site are in conflict with each other, in one place it states delivery in Sept or October and on another page it states first delivery on November 3rd, hmmmm that would place delivery 75 days after ordering. Really! this is 2010, should anyone have to wait for 75 days. I could take a covered wagon to the publisher and tell him in person of my order and then return home and come back in 3 weeks to pick it up myself before they could get it to me in 75 Days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not receive my magazines.","review":"I ordered this subscription in December, and it is now February and I have not received any magazines.

I would read it from cover to cover.Now, sadly, it is a bunch of fluff. The quality has really gone downhill. I am going to let my subscription run out. I really miss the old days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in Every Way","review":"First time I bought this magazine in 1992, it was very expensive and it was time when finding foreighn magazines and newspapers in Moscow was a great problem. And as I said it was my first big impression. Since that time VF became my best love I have every issue since that one of 1992. Design, style, articles all is perfect. During past 10 years VF has changed a lot in different ways but whenever I looked at the book shelves or show-cases with lots of magazines I always matched VF. It's a great individuality, it's a simbol of proffecionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"STILL WAITING....","review":"Unfortunately, I am still waiting for the magazine to show up at my doorstep.

I won't use it again either. The deceptive advertising that was used made me think that the 2 magazines that I subscribed to were part of a deal that was being offered. When I checked later, I discovered that they were not and I would have to deal directly with the magazine to change it. I got no better \\"deal\\" than using the flyers in the magazine directly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only received the first issue of a 2-yr subscription !!!","review":"I almost thought I didn't subscribe it successfully and got the first one.

Just wind. No fact finding, no uncovering news from reliable sources, NOTHING. It is trash magazine that has Gossip which makes the National Enquier look good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be really great. Now it is really left","review":"Vanity Fair used to be my favorite magazine. It is really sad that it has gone so far left. It used to have such well researched articles that were so objective. It is a shame that such a great magazine has gone so low. I wish the owners of the magazine pay heed to comments like mine. It is very important that the media remains objective and not have these far left agendas.I would like to add that their articles on Hollywood etc. are still very interesting and good. I do need to be fair in my criticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have Not Received One Issue","review":"I am disappointed that I subscribed to my favorite magazine, Vanity Fair, in May and have yet to receive a single issue, and here it is the end of June. I look forward to reading about Liz Taylor, but I fear that the contents will be quite stale when the subscription finally starts."},{"rating":"1","title":"People Magazine for Pretentious People","review":"I'd always heard about interesting articles in this magazine. But the mess of ads and People magazine gossip that lands (with a big, heavy thud) on my doorstep every month is the most worthless magazine I've ever made the mistake of purchasing. It's pretentious tripe aimed at a small group of NYC media insiders, self-regarding movie celebs, and those people who'd like to be part of that world. Even when they occasionally hit on a compelling subject, the writers are so narcissistic as to be truly repellent. It'd be more accurate simply to cut \\"Fair\\" out of the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timing is all","review":"This should be zero stars. This purchase of a subscription to Vanity Fair was supposed to be a birthday gift. Though ordered in September, it has yet to be started.

Sadly Conde Nast has let me down terribly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, superficial, and cheap","review":"This magazine is stuffed with often decadent ads of expensive clothing, usually dull photos geared to readers in their sixties, and parties featuring aging celebrities. I usually flip through this magazine in a fairly short time. However, every once in awhile there is an extensive, well-researched article. The last I can remember is a fascinating feature several years ago about the contemporary art scene before the financial bubble burst. Great stuff. Otherwise, I can't see this magazine lasting another five years. Mostly flash, little substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent,fun magazine","review":"This is a good woman's magazine.

It's because this magazine is pretty trashy but pretends that it's full of high-style, wealth-related, prestigious, and amazing content. It isn't. While most people would argue that magazines such as Us Weekly are even more trashy than this one, don't be fooled. Us Weekly, Glamour, and all those other lower-class gossip/fashion magazines are in many ways more fun to read because they're trashy but are able to own their trashiness. This magazine presents the views only high-style poseurs have. The first rule about money: only the nouveaux riche flaunt it. This magazine lacks political and cultural sophistication. So take your pick: either subscribe to a stereotypically \\"lower-class\\" magazine that is honest, or subscribe to an even more artsy, actual high-class magazine. This mag fails on all fronts."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Been One of My Favorite Magazines for Years....","review":"...I remember it covered all the dirty details on Clinton-Lewinsky, and the 2000 election debacle and the like.

But head and shoulders over the old Vintage paperback--except for one omission: \\"Roan Stallion,\\" one of the great poems of the Modern Age (found in the Vintage but not in this). And I cannot understand Gelpi's failure to include poems from DESCENT TO THE DEAD. Anyhow, if this selection enjoys another printing, perhaps Gelpi can correct, in his excellent introduction, the mislocation of Jung's house: not on Lake Geneva but on Lake Zurich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bleak, cold and beautiful","review":"Jeffers somehow captures the spirit of the California coast at night.

This was replaced by the manufacturer at no charge. However, over the next few years (read \\"AFTER WARRANTY\\") all of the lamps began acting erratically, lighting when they should be charging, turning off when removed from the charger, not lighting at all, etc. I contacted Vessel several times asking for assistance trouble-shooting, I even offered to return to them to be refurbished. Although they agreed the charger was most likely defective again, they offered only a 15% discount on purchasing any replacement parts. All of the possible replacement parts (batteries and/or charger) are expensive. I loved the product when it worked properly, but it is far too expensive to last such a short time. While it lasted, this product was great for use in our RV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theoretical physics explained to the non-scientist","review":"I read this book 25 years ago, yet it remains the single clearest explanation of Einstein's theories, particularly the theory of relativity, that I have ever read. Of particular note, the explanations usually employ the same mental pictures that were used by Einstein to develop the theories, e.g., an elevator moving through space, with no reference points. This is a particularly appropriate book to give to a high school student who has an interest in science but who may not yet have progressed through the basics of physics. I read it at that age, and it sparked an interest in physics, particularly light theory, that exists to this day"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good book","review":"7 years ago. I went to a small section of the science-translate books. I got this book in Thai version (Thank you for whom translate this). Up to now. this is one of the books I re-read most frequently. I might not smart enogh though I will get new idea from reading it every time. This book contain a simplified idea and give you the concept of Einstein most acknowledge theory. It's not purely science but include some kind of philosophy which let me think along whether it's true or not. Though it is still very readable and understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little early 50s classic still worth reading","review":"I've read just about every book on Einstein's theories meant for the general reader (as well as not-so-general reader) and this is the clearest, most concise, and best-written book ever done on the subject.I read this book almost 35 years ago and it's good to see from the other reviews of the older editions of the work that people still know about this terrific little book. It's a little masterpiece of science reportage done during a time (1950) when there were very few talented writers doing this sort of thing (unlike today), and in which there wasn't much demand for science writers in general. Lincoln Barnett was a gifted journalist and he produced a little classic in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"This film will destroy all the images of pasty-faced, up-tight, crabby, hypocritical Christianity that are out there. You see people who genuinely love God and because of that, also love others. Real Christianity lived out in normal, everyday lives, showing the world around them an incredible, personal God. And this film will leave you with a desire to live that way as well. No more stilted religion, but a living, breathing relationship with a God more real than anything we can see here on Earth. Life changing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing a must see film","review":"What an awesome and amazing film! I love the honesty and integrity that shines through as the film maker so openly shares his journey with us. This movie has true and beautiful artistic expression, stellar cinematography, encourages you, and does an amazing job of presenting a level of spirituality that is both heart felt, deep, meaningful, and real! This film has the power to change lives and already is doing that.....so why not start or take another step on your journey with God by purchasing and watching this film. Share it with friends, neighbors, family, and watch as you see the power of God unleashed in yours and their lives. Ponder, Soak, Ask, Seek, Explore, Receive, Be healed, and Be encouraged as you watch the film. Thank you Darren and all who were involved for taking this bold step and presenting us with a film that reflects the Fathers heart in so many ways. A hundred hand claps..and Gods continued blessings and rich increase of anointing upon you all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanna see God in action? Watch this DVD","review":"Really awesome documentary showing ways in which God is moving through His Bride today. This is not the dead, desensitized church many have rejected; this is a vibrant Bride who has embraced her role as being one with Christ. Men and women, young and old, transformed by the Lord are actual vessels of His life, His healing, His salvation - all over the world!Watch and be amazed. Open your heart to believe that not only COULD God be alive and well and preparing to return to earth for a Church He describes as His Bride, but with whom He will conquer all evil and recapture His creation for His glory and our great joy! Come and be part of what God is doing today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for those who believe in the power of the Holy Spirit!","review":"I love how Darren Wilson takes a look at the power of the Holy Spirit here on earth. It undeniably shows that God is with us everyday doing miracles. Although, I do not think that some of the signs and wonders are as believable as others, Darren Wilson shows then and let's you decide. You must also see his other documentaries: Furious Love (my favorite) and Father of Lights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Film","review":"It's very cool to see modern day miracles. I did have some trouble accepting some of it, or determining if it was a con trick (i.e. the gold dust and jewels), but the parts about healing stories were amazing.

There is a lot more going on in Christianity right now but most people dont know about it.Love is the key."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finger of God","review":"This is a facinating documentary on some of the ways that God is moving in the church today. I too have been powerfully touched by God's Spirit. This documentary supports what we see in much of scripture, what I've experienced, and what I've read about occuring around the world. It's inspiring to faith and challenging to Western rationalism. Yes, God is full of mystery and yes God is still moving with amazing signs and wonders."},{"rating":"2","title":"He is real","review":"This Video is nothing short of amazing!

However, what he documents is not the \\"Finger of God\\" but rather the lack of evidence offered by those who claim to invoke miracles in the name of Jesus.

It is extremely blurry and out of focus. Better is the Ruscico edition, but it has a very high contrast boost, losing much detail into the blacks. Best is the French Bach DVD, having excellent grayscale detail but only has the original French intertitles and no English subtitles.There is a custom DVD to be found free online which uses the Bach image and has new English intertitles, a soundtrack of Philip Glass music, and subtitles in eight languages. Search for: Aelita Oyarsa-Q.It is a very interesting film. Most people seem to miss the fact that all the scenes on Mars take place in an escapist fantasy in the mind of Los, who is prone to flights of fancy and daydreaming.In the final scene there is the message that the problems on Earth should be solved before governments spend large sums on space exploration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting artifact","review":"This silent film leaves a number of different impressions. The first, of course, is happy surprise that this film has survived in such good condition - compared to many other silents, it maintains high image quality throughout. Another impression comes from the remarkable art deco styling of the Mars sets and costumes. I'm no expert on older films, but this offers the most fantastical look of any I've seen to date. Yet another impression arises from the Soviet underpinning of the film, including swipes at self-serving authorities and the workers' bold revolution (complete with hammer and sickle).The plot had some loose moments, but this remains a wonderful look back as well as an entertaining movie in its own right.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muscle Museum US Part 1","review":"Brilliant track!Sleightly different mix from the album version.

Furthermore, after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like Hoya S-HMC or B+W MRC filters.

Turning the polarizer will also turn the focus unless it's in the automatic function.*it is very hard to take off your lens though. and you cannot tighten it loosely or else it'll unscrew as you turn the polarizer so you kind of have to tighten it onto your lens all the way"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Polarizer at excellent price","review":"The Polarizer does extremely well, especially if you live in an area like San Antonio where there is so much sun.

Shooting across a broad valley on a sunny day at some distant mountains I used both filters separately and together. The circular polarizer did a better job of reducing the obvious haze producing more saturated colors both in the viewfinder and on film. The Haze-1 did deliver a noticeable effect, but the circular polarizer was better and is priced accordingly. The atmospheric haze was so bad on that particular day that, without the filter(s), the resulting images were useless. I had also tried a cheap no-name circular polarizer for comparison. This Tiffen was superior to the no-name by a wide margin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great circular polarizer.","review":"For outdoor photos, I would definitely get a CP so that the colors of the landscapes are deeper. As an amateur photographer, its great bang for the buck, especially since I can't tell the difference between this and some $200 CP. Please do note, that this CP does get tight on your lens sometimes. My personal favorite and reliable way to get off a stuck CP is to wrap a cord (such as USB) around the CP and twist it off that way. Works every time. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"does it's job,,,one fits all my primes","review":"Picked this up for under $10 so I was skeptical when ordering. Boy was I happy when I tried it out and discovered it fits all my primes. Now, I'm not a huge user of filters because I don't really know how to use them effectively nor do I want to carry extra stuff in my bag. But I do enjoy the benefits of CPL's and have owned much more expensive ones. Some lenses require a better quality and thinner CPL and you may not be able to get away with a bargain like this this. Make sure you read how to use any CPL effectively or you will be dissappointed. Is this a stellar product? No. But for under $10 and usefulness I'm giving it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, works well for your average hobbyist","review":"I don't use filters much at all, but this circular polarizer works fairly well in removing unwanted reflections.

In fact, I leave it on my lens (Canon EF-S 17-85mm) instead of a UV filter because I use it so much.Pros:- good value.- darkens skies, controls glare on wet surfaces, makes colors pop.Cons:- vignetting at widest focal length (but then again, you shouldn't use it at the widest end due to uneven darkening of skies at widest angle).- doesn't play nice with cokin filter holder (spins when you screw on the filter holder, can be annoying to have to reset it).Overall, this is a good deal for a filter that will really help your photos look better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"Haven't had enough time to really use it much, but from what i cant tell it meets my expectations, as I had one before, just like it (just different size)."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you paid","review":"Not see polarization with LCD screen or polarized sun glasses.

Then it failed and it's irreparable.What failed was the motor that made the mirror ball rotate. The projector still works fine, but only projects a static image. What really annoys me is this was designed with the motor -- a small electrical motor that could easily be replaced for a few dollars -- SEALED INSIDE the mirror ball. I had to cut open the ball to get to the motor and, well, let's just say that putting Humpty Dumpty back together again is child's play compared to reassembling a mirror ball.A little forethought in the design could have avoided this. Motors wear out -- just like bulbs do. First year engineering stuff: put fallible components where they can be replaced.

The selection of pictures is decent, although there is one photo that I suspect is from the 1912 Scott expedition (of a tracked motor-sledge; the Shackleton expedition had only a car with it).

But I went to a local camera store and purchased another filter, and this Tiffen filter screws in to the new filter OK. So I suspect that it's not the threads-per-inch, but maybe the threads are too tall (they have a slightly large diameter which binds against the camera).The man at my local camera store said that Tiffen changed their packaging a long while back, and the filter that I had was in the older packaging. So perhaps this filter was made for older film cameras and not for newer digital cameras (that's him talking, not me).Either way, this filter only screws in about 1/3 of a turn and then starts to bind.

It required a filter wrench to remove it from the lens because the mount is very soft and threads not quite machined right. After I removed the filter, the glass was rattling loose in the ring.

This lens has artifacts like mad when you look close. taking a photo of people near christmas lights? Forget about it! I can post process but its pretty rediculous.

However, after a few light days of use, the glass element became lose. While it doesn't appear that many people have had this problem, I suspect it has to do with overall quality control at Tiffen. If you are going to put a piece of glass in between your photographed object and your expensive lens glass, spend a little money and get something good. The best thing you can get is something that you don't notice.That said, if you're budget conscious, use a kit lens/equivalent, and don't mind having to possibly send one of these backs for a replacement that works - this is probably a good filter for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap, but no use","review":"this comes free if you buy a nikon lens, but as many customers said, it has very bad flares when shooting next lights. so not much useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible internal reflections","review":"Only thing I like about this filter is that, I got it with my Nikon 50mm lens for free.

I only really experimented with it on indoor shots, but the reflections and ghosted light blurs are just ridiculous. It's almost comical how bad this filter is.Maybe it is ok for some conditions, but once a shot is ruined because of a UV filter, that's it in my book.

Those I focused manually, those that auto-focused, wide-open or stopped-down. Slow or fast shutter, even on a tripod.

Both produce green ghost images when shooting in bright natural light or strong light source in dark room (e.g. birthday candles).Verdict: If you've got a lens worth protecting, you surely want good images from it, too.

The price of this one at 1/4 the cost of most seems a good deal but my personal experience with it has been mixed.Any image of a lighted subject taken at an angel usually casts a reflection and creates a ghost shadow on the image. It can range from nearly invisible when printed to quite noticeable if the background is dark.

Tiffen used to make quality filters, but since it was bought a few years ago by an outfit called Topspin they started cutting corners and quit multi-coating their filters, so like this UV filter, they will cause ghosting & reflections on your pictures.

And Tiffen is a manufacturer of photographic equipment, so how bad could it be? Well, the price is low, and it probably is for a reason. You get what you pay for.No anti-reflective coating means you can see yourself in the lens, and when taking pictures against sunlight, you get fairly nasty lens flare. If that's what you're into, this is a great filter. But if you want a simple extra-layer to protect your valuable lens, but don't want any quality changes, Do not get this filter.I used original Nikon so far, and I do regret having tried to save some money by going with Tiffen.Same happened to the 52mm I bough - I guess it is a manufacturer issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon promoting wrong item","review":"The seller shipped promptly.

I'm all for filters just as protection for my lenses, but this was the worst buy. I accidentally dropped my camera (and lens with the filter) from about a foot off the ground and the filter shattered- not just crack, I mean shattered! I spent several minutes very carefully picking the glass off my lens hoping that no damage was done. The glass from the filter put a very small nick on the edge of my $350 lens. The lens is still more than usable as the nick is very tiny, but I'm more than disappointed in this product, which is supposed to protect the lens, not damage it.Please look for a shatter proof lens filter before buying this one!

It was really night and day. The reflection and glare & distoration were noticeable. I did replace the Tiffen with the Hoya ($79.99) and don't regret it.

I bought this filter to protect my nikon. It does the basic job, but I get noticeably better photos with my better one.

This is my fault for going cheap and not getting a multi-coated filter. I bought this on a rush because I wanted a filter to protect my lens while in New York. In hindsight, I should have waited and invest in a better one.On a side note: I also used an inferior Super Takumar 28mm lens that didn't have any filters on.

Take off the filter, and it's sharp and crystal clear.Needless to say, I'd take the risk of lens damage on my sub $100 lens than have shoddy images."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst ever filter","review":"i've used many brands. this filter comes free with my lens purchase. it is the worst ever.

This Tiffen filter is bottom of the 17 tested - it has virtually no impact on UV radiation and actually reduces light transmission by 3% on some wavelengths - not only is it a waste of money, it reduces image quality. On my Pentax lens, images tend to be over-exposed and of lower contrast.

It does not fit the lens and needed to be returned. It may be a fabulous lens, I was not able to try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I got zeikos filters for two of my lenses, and I'm very disappointed. I get a green ghosting whenever there is bright sun, or if I'm shooting into a light. Indoors it's okay, and it will protect my lens, but I'm going to have to take it off any time I'm shooting outside, which is a hassle and a pain, and not worth the money. If you're looking for high quality images, do not get this filter. I'm going to buy the Hoya UV filter as soon as I get the chance, it's worth the extra money, and I regret cheaping out on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor image quality yet cheap protection","review":"Thinking I was buying a quality UV filter and lens protector I soon realized it was more of a removable protector than a quality filter.

What a rip-off.All kinds of glare and reflections coming from this *very* cheap piece of glass. I had to re-shoot a lot of stuff because of my choice to use this filter. The amount of glare it picks up is ridiculous. It was my fault for buying it. I knew it had to be terrible at this price.If you have any doubt, buy one and find out for yourself.This product is 100% snake oil.

The filter is very poorly made, I am shocked that so many rated this highly. Normally the reviews on Amazon are accurate indicators of quality. The glass in this filter is not fixed, in fact it doesn't fit properly. The glass moves back and forth in the casing,it is as though the filter housing was made for a much thicker piece of glass. As others have written it was also very dirty as though it had been handled. I'm guessing somebody else was unhappy and returned it.I have experience with Hoya filters and have always been pleased with their build quality. I have returned the Tiffen filter as of today and ordered the Hoya. I find the filters great for both the protection they provide and function they serve."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"I bought this to use with my Canon 50mm 1.4 prime lens.

Wifey is not too careful when handling cameras (I hope she's not reading this). I wanted to prevent constantly cleaning fingerprints off the lens and the blame-game. When I took pics of some birds on a sunny day, the birds were slightly off focus in many pics even though the camera has a terrific AF capability. The pics did come out very nice except for the auto focus part.Indoors, in low light, the camera took a lot more time to autofocus than it usually does.

After a few test images taken against a desk lamp I did find that the filter did produce more glare at *certain* angles BUT for regular shooting in a moderately well lit area it did just as fine as the lens by itself.Ultimately, I did buy this for protection purposes, as I would much rather have this ten dollar-ish filter break than spend $400+ to replace my lens if it ever gets scratched. For THIS purpose, this filter is sturdy and sufficient. Nothing special, nothing much to complain about. 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messed up indoor shots where there are bright signs","review":"Please do not get this filter at all. Its not really worth the savings as the flaring effect is just too much to handle.I took a few shots in Pike Market at Seattle and the bright neon signs and yellow bulbs tend to reflect back from lens to filter back to lens. All my subjects had ugly green flares across their faces.It kinda killed the great 35mm f1.8 lens on my D90 results.I also noticed it always bounces the light source 180 degrees across the frame.

I have not noticed a big difference in image quality however it has helped protect my lense on several occasions. I would highly recommend getting a UV filter for that reason alone. The only negative is that the lense that came with the camera does not fog up when going from a cool building to the muggy hot outside climate that we have in Louisiana, however the filter does. So when I go outside I have to either wait five minutes for the filter to acclimate itself to the outdoor climate, or take it off for a few minutes negating any benefits it may have for that period.

CANON, in contrast, makes filters that take a lens cap or yet another filter.Returning it is not an option since I do not reside in the US, so all the shipping costs would not be worth it.

The reflection problem was sometimes just an extra smudge on the bottom-- but very obvious and pretty bad. It was worst in very bright conditions. I am going to order the Canon filter again. The problem was not that I had any condensation or smudges on my filter, because I had cleaned it off that morning.Given that most of my pictures are with lots of light/ outside, this is useless to me and I regret bringing it with me.

No clue how these happened but I do know that when it comes to my Canon 70-200 I'm not taking many chances.For this filter specifically I will say that I haven't seen any degradation or problems during normal use. The one thing I have seen is lens flare. Shooting with this during concerts or towards the sun definitely can give extra flare.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of independent film and artsy originality. This simply had no depth. For a film that was apparently (from what I could tell) a character study of a man that is being slowly talked out of killing himself, it never once achieved any sort of intensity for me. I was so bored by the end of the film that by the time we saw the rough \\"home-video\\" style footage of the cast bumming around, I actually found myself laughing hysterically at the fact that I managed to sit through it.

Throughout the film, we get many different views on life. The old man(who once almost commited suicide) reminds us to enjoy the simple things in life. The ending is sort of a letdown to say the least. I understand what the director is trying to do here, but I think it would have been better if he went about it a different way."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing happens very slowly","review":"I am a fan of international cinema and art-house films (Bergman, Truffaut, Renoir, Lelouch, Eisenstein, Kurosawa, Oshima, Fellini, de Sica, Tornatore etc etc) so I have to admit to being surprised and confused over how this film scooped prizes at Cannes and elsewhere. I suppose that it was so different to the average Hollywood \\"shootemup\\" that some critics thought it original. So original that the director obviously felt that minor factors like character development, a story and an ending were not really necessary. To be fair the camerawork is original and the film has a neo-realistic feel, so, if you want an alternative to the latest offering from Cameron and do not mind sitting through the long pauses, separated by long pauses, you could try this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is disappointing and overrated.","review":"After reading the critical reviews by the professionals on this movie, I expected far more than it delivered. It took far too long just to figure out what the main character was up to (help in his suicide attempt). Living in the SF Bay area, it came across at first as a homosexual pickup. The director spent far too much time filming a dirt road in barren hills both from inside and outside the car. When the main character found somebody to help him, the other man was just suddenly there and we never saw an introductory encounter. And then, at the end, the story suddenly became the filming of the same story. Why? All in all, it was underwhelming and pretentious and certainly filmed cheaply. The emperor has no clothes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?!? Save your money for something with substan","review":"This has to be the most boring movies I've ever seen in my life.

However, this movie delivers almost nothing of what it could have. I guess the director wants to leave all of the thinking to the audience. What it left me thinking is, \\"Why does Mr. Badii want to kill himself?\\" Another thing I was left thinking was, \\"Why are they wasting so much time showing Mr. Badii driving around?\\"This movie would have been great if it had only been half an hour, because there is at least one hour of this film devoted to showing a truck driving around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as ditchwater and about as deep.","review":"A large portion of the running time of A Taste of Cherry--perhaps the majority--is footage of a guy driving around in his car.

This film is not. I thought that a man trying to find someone to help him commit suicide was a good premise for a film. This movie proved me wrong. It is boring and trite. The cinematography is dull. The dialogue is dull. The words of the wise old taxidermist sound like they were written by a college kid trying to be deep.

It has been the sound track for over a hundred morning afters. That album set a precedent for early morning chill out albums, and is still in my opinion the best. This album is best for the afternoon after a long night clubbing. The mood is upbeat and soulfull, yet calm and sureal. I don't enjoy every track, but I do enjoy the varity very much. The vocal's add a touch of class to this beautifull soundscape created by Rollo and Sister Bliss. He even let his sister open the album.

The literature is very rich and the devices he uses contribute to the fascination of the reader with the character of Ibn Fattouma. At times even, readers will become vicariously sullen or extatic because of the skillful characterization. The concepts in this book about post-modern religion and the role of an intellectual are great fodder for discussion and will keep people who love to think engaged for a while, but the plot is not as strong as the writing or interpretative aspects. The debacles that Fattouma faces on his journey are not very engaging always and at times deviate from realism (deviation from conceptual implications). When reading the book, I imagine that most people will be waiting anxiously for the next glimpse into Fattouma's psychology and analysis of the world around him and few will pay attention to the actual plot and sideplots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't start here","review":"I was excited when my book group picked this title, since I'd never read Mahfouz and was curious about this Noble-prize-winning writer, who many friends admire. But the Journey of Ibn Fattouma was a stunning disappointment: it's a collection of simple morality tales that seem to me, at best good for children or young adults. The writing has none of the artistry of a Borges or Calvino, which was my hope: it feels flat-footed and plods aimlessly along from place to place, a bit like the protagonist of the fables. Indeed, for somebody interested in rich journeys to imaginary places, Calvino'sInvisible Citiesis a far, far better book, a masterpiece in comparison. If you haven't read Mahfouz before, I'd say this is the wrong place to start, at least based on my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"IT DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE A STAR.

However, the author's writing style differs greatly between names, and I was somewhat dissapointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay","review":"Although I adore this author, I prefer her much more as Sophie Kinsella. When she writes as Madeleine Wickham she lacks the wit and humor that won me over. The characters in this book are not particularly likable and share very different values than I do. Subjects like infidelity, teenage sex and teenage substance abuse are taken very lightly and almost passed off as nothing. The ending seemed a little too picture perfect for the \\"realness\\" and meatiness of the rest of the book and basically left me no better and no worse for having read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Boring","review":"I am a HUGE fan of the Shopaholic series so I eagerly embraced this series of books by Madeleine Wickham. That being said, I felt as though the characters were stiff and I found I couldn't relate to them. Two families find themselves sharing a villa for vacation, and unbeknownst to the rest of the family one wife and the other husband used to be lovers. Akward? To say the least! However I just was even interested enough in the situation and story to even finish the book which is highly unusual for me. The story just seemed to drag from one angry depressing moment to the next. I think I'll just stick to the Shopaholic series and leave Madeline Wickham books alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I usually love this author. I knew exactly what was going to happen next. Very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not for me","review":"Maybe I'm outgrowing chick lit? Or maybe this was just crap. I'm not sure. The last few chick lit books I've read have not really been enjoyable to me, so I'm sort of leaning towards the former; but maybe I'm just making bad choices. There were not any characters in this book that I liked. They are all reprehensible, selfish and annoying. Two families are thrown together in the same house for a week of holiday and it's starting to look like it wasn't an accident. The books that Wickham wrote under the pen name Sophi Kinsella are highly enjoyable fun. But the ones written under her own name have been barely more than average in my opinion. This one is just pretty bad. I wish I could go back to my self two weeks ago and take this away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It's hard to believe that Sophie Kinsella wrote this. She's come a long way in her writing since then. It was almost like a child wrote this book. Her books since and including the Shopaholic series are clever, witty and the characters are always endearing. These characters were very one-dimensional. It had a nice premise but just didn't follow through for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one-sitting piece of fluff","review":"I can see how this book might have been pretty interesting as a character study, unfortunately, I didn't like any of the characters. They seemed just a little off and a bit phony - not quite two-dimensional, but flat in some respects. And a lot unbelievable in others, especially in ways that screamed convenience, plot-wise. Speaking of plot... it was a bit thin, as well. Sure, the main premise was understandable enough, the old ploy of throwing enemies in together and seeing what happens. But the problem is that nothing really extraordinary or interesting does happen. It's all very predictable and clichéd, and the ending is a complete disappointment.On the up side, the writing was very easy to read and I sped through the book in one sitting.I wouldn't particularly recommend this book to anyone, but the writing this author has done under the name 'Sophie Kinsella' is far, far better and I suggest you check out those before you pick up this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"another fine read by Wickham/Kinsella","review":"I thoroughly enjoy this author's books, whether she is writing as Madeleine Wickham or Sophie Kinsella, and though this was not my favorite of hers, I would still recommend it. This is the story of two families who are struggling -- one with tension about a possible job loss, the other with redecorating crises. Both desperately need a vacation, and both have been promised the loan of a lovely villa in Spain by a family friend. Unfortunately, they have all been promised the same villa on the same week. Hilarity ensues. Well, no, not actual hilarity, but a more mature variation of hilarity -- hidden pasts, new beginnings, uncertain endings. Wickham is a clever writer and she creates believable, complex characters within a few lines, but I didn't find this cast too likable, nor was I very interested in their problems. Still, it's always a pleasure to read a master, and Wickham is a gifted writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleeping Arrangements left me a little sleepy...","review":"This was my first Madeleine Wickham book.

I really think any half-talented tenth grader could have written the same thing. Most of it is about Chloe, who has to be one of the whiniest, most illogical and overly emotional character ever. Everything makes her want to \\"cry out\\", even things that don't even happen. She really was so lame. My level of contempt for this character surprises me, I think it represents lazy, contrived writing.

I went in with little expectations and was immediately suprised by the coherency of the script, the above average acting, and the serpentine story line. There's certainly plenty to like here including a sufficient amount of bloodletting, some good suspense, and more than a few surprises. There's also plenty of story, and a satisfying resolution. It may be lowish budget, but it doesn't wear cheapness on it's sleeve which was such a relief.This one might fall a tad into the \\"horror with a heart of gold\\" category. It's easy to see this playing in theaters in say, 1986, with Cory Haim as the young lead. I don't think one need be a die hard horror fan to find enjoyment here either. Bottom line?

You were warned, this movie, if you are ONLY a Lucy Lawless FAN is at best worth a download, not even a rental). I know one man's treasure is another man's trash regarding value and opinions, but I cannot imagine how this movie got 4 stars (the reason I purchased it). I've seen other complaints about star ratings on Amazon, too. I've got a feeling that these ratings are coming from people tied in (royalty payments, etc.)in part.

This package is a very strong starter kit, including the basic necessities for most photography. The UV should stay on your camera at all times, as it adds clarity to almost all images, and protects your lens from any scratches or dust. The circular polarizer is great for photographing or video-taping any reflective surface, i.e., water or windows, as it filters out the reflection so that you can shoot what is either in the water or on the other side of the window.I did have a problem with the UV filter while trying to attach a lens to it. Though I used very little force, the metal frame was bent in the process and I had to replace it. Other than that, the quality of the filters themselves is very solid, and I use them on a daily basis.

The Title in the Kindle itself has an HTML code for the ' in Alice's and every line is cut off by word wrapping during an OCR.The lines would read something likethis,even though they are a part of thesameparagraph.Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland","review":"The treasure of this edition lies principally in its beautiful layout and thoroughly original illustrations. Strict traditionalists may find Garcia's gothlike depictions of their favourite Wonderland characters a bit off-putting, while fans of Alice looking for something distinctly different won't be disappointed. The text is Carroll's original classic, nicely set, with a whimsical unjustified right edge and pleasing gradient toned pages. This volume does not include Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass, which is a pity -- it would have been interesting to see Garcia's depiction of the Jabberwocky. Garcia's art notwithstanding, I would more highly recommend:The Annotated Alice: The Definitive EditionI also highly recommend:Alice in Verse: The Lost Rhymes of Wonderland"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book pictured is not the book you will receive","review":"The book received only included \\"Alice in Wonderland\\". \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" is not included in the book, even though the picture depicts that both are included.

I donated the book I received from Amazon to my daughter's school library instead of dealing with the hassle of returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, quirky book","review":"If you've never read Alice in Wonderland then you are missing out.

It was extremely weird, but weird in a good way. The storyline was indeed \\"curious\\" and if you can get past the weirdness then you can enjoy it. At times I could get past the strange aspects of these stories, but other times I thought it was a bit too ridiculous and confusing to say the least. A few times, I had to read a sentence more than once to fully grasp its meaning. There is not really any plot to this book, but I can see how it may be a fun book to read to kids.Definitely not my favorite books, but I did enjoy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland more than Through the Looking Glass. I'm not going to say don't read this because I know a great deal of people enjoy this classic...it's just that I didn't find it all that great. Nevertheless, if you find the time, pick it up if you want to. It's a quick read and you can make your own judgment about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this even complete?","review":"The story read like all the sentaces has been thrown it a blender and then reassembled into a book. The only reason I could follow any of it was because I have seen the various movie versions many many times. I not sure why I assumed that because it was a classic children's tale it would be good. The entire thing made no sense and on more than one occasion I believed that maybe because it was the Public Domain kindle edition perhaps I was missing a page or chapter. I know it was missing illustrations but it also felt like it was missing whole paragraphs. If this edition is complete than this truley is a horrible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice in Wonderland","review":"This is a free book on Kindle and a must read for every child and grown up if you have not read it.

Now that i've read it i've changed my mind considerably. the characters are so nonsensical that in my opinion it makes it very hard to read and i lost interest quickly. i knew that the characters were going to be somewhat crazy but the constant blubbering about nothing was very annoying to read. stick to the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movies are much, much better","review":"This book is the reason I've sworn off ever reading \\"classics\\" -- they're wordy and boring.

Actually, I read that Helen met a young girl at a party and was so impressed with the young lady that she became the model for this modern Alice! The girl's picture was in many UK newspapers last month! The book is filled with memorable characters - that you know are old friends but they have been given marvelous face lifts! Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Alice in Wonderland is a great book that I truly enjoyed. I like how the author made something symbolize something else. For example, the rules of the game they were playing symbolized the actual rules of the land. Even though this book is intended for kids to read but I say it is a book for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not far so lovable as the Disney-Movie","review":"What a boring book. First I saw the Disney-Movie from 1951... those lovable figures, like the brave Alice, the crazy Chesire Cat, the big red Queen and her tiny little king, the wild expressive story. Great. Then the remake or second part of the story with the extraordinary Jonny Depp. But nothing of these great pieces you can find in this book.The only good thing in this book is the crazy story, about a girl in her wonderland with the insane inhabitants.It was a dull writing. Sentences like \\"He said... Then she said... Then he said...\\" will make you lazy. There is no heart in the story... just a pure and clean describing of the chapters of this story. But what makes a book a good book? It's the describtion of all the surroundings, like how the weather was, what temper the figures have, all the nonrelevant things you want to know. You can't find them in this book. My recommandation: Take another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"I didnt like this at all, i figured it would be a bit more like disney's or tim burton's version, but no dice!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insanity in a bad way","review":"When i was a child this story always captivated me, but reading this tale as an adult left me annoyed and confused. Though the language is remarkable, the story itself us hard to follow at best. It is disjointed and fractured.

Two stars for ingenuity, but the lacking connectedness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange story","review":"This story is never normal, and every time we read it or see performance with this story, we come to the same conclusion.

This is a very good children's story! Adventurous, quirky, comical - the ultimate fantasy story. All of the film versions of this that I have seen leave out so many parts.

So now that I have a Kindle and some time I thought why not read this gem?The book of course is superb. No complaints there. The Kindle edition however is a different matter. There are NO ILLUSTRATIONS as in the hardcopy versions of this book. With a story saturated with visual metaphors this is an unforgivable sin - even though the book is offered for free. Sometimes \\"free\\" is really NOT free because this version can drive away some of the younger crowd from reading the book. That is the highest of sins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very briiliant book!!!","review":"This is a very unique classic! This is a must read book for teenagers and adults expecialy, maybe a little difficult for children. It allows your mind to go on an adventure. I truely admire Lewis Carroll as he points out all the characters leaving the mind full of imagination. The peculiar white rabbit Alice follows in the tunnel leads her to meet all kinds of different characters.Alice gets bigger and smaller through out the whole book as she drinks and eats all kinds of things. The characters make you smile such as the Duchess, Caterpilar who smokes but is wise, Chesire the Cat , lobsters who love to dance, the Mad Hatter, The King and the Queen of Hearts.

This adaptation even has bottles, cupboards, and food talking back to Alice!This BBC dramatization is likely to leave the listener feeling slightly disoriented; which is precisely how Alice felt in Wonderland. The cast, led by Sarah-Jane Holm, is superb; especially The Caterpiller, The Queen Of Hearts, and The Mad Hatter.

Yes, this book can be read by all ages and you pull something different out of the tale every time you read it. I read part of it when I was younger but it confused me too much so when I saw it on Amazon, I decided to give it a second chance. Lewis Carroll does a great job of displaying curiosity and the unknown adventures in a child's dream world.

She can now visualize what she reads. from the wonderful pictures. Every night - we read - 2 - 3 pages and I explain many of the words and phrases she's hearing for the first time. Even if it is late and way past her bedtime - skipping bed-time reading results in tears and tantrums. That is how much she loves the material.

Well, I enjoyed it to an extent, mainly when Alice was speaking with herself or exploring. But when characters began speaking or interacting with Alice, I was left scratching my head (probably much like Alice.) I'm sorry to the fans of Lewis Carrol, but I did not like Alice Adventure's in Wonderland. Why? Because while there was a protagonist, there really wasn't an antagonist. There was no hardly any plot, no theme, no conflict, and no resolution. There really was no point in Alice's dream. It did not make her a better person. And the characters in the book while amusing, literally had no point. Sorry, but no matter how many cents I have, it will never make enough sense for me.

Esmeralda was an elderly character with a lot of spunk, who also went through some rough times with her husband when he came back from the war. It was so easy to love her. There was a lot of humor in this book--the church ladies following Horace to make sure the mule got a proper burial, Esmeralda giving dating advice to her friend, Beatrice, the church ladies all picking out a casket together, Maria's fake name. But with the humor, I saw a lot of \\"what would Jesus do\\" stuff spread throughout the book in a very subtle manner--Esmeralda taking in Maria when she was so sick, Esmeralda telling Beatrice to go out of her way to be friendly to her obnoxious neighbors, Esmeralda telling Beatrice to make sure that Carl is a godly man, Esmeralda being so kind to Horace when he was so spiteful towards her in the beginning of the book.You will love this book and the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"I have read and reread this entertaining novel about a country church and the friendship of two women.

She and Beatrice are members of the Willing Workers Sunday school class. Then Beatrice moves away to find employment and their friendship continues with letters and phone calls. There are many other delightful characters and the plot is full of surprises. The story is touching, real and fun. This is the first in a series of three novels about Esmerelda. Each one is delightful. I own all three and have loaned them to a number of friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gal I would like to know","review":"The main character, Esmeralda, is a lady I would like to know.

She mistakenly calls him Splurgeon which is funny, and Esmeralda uses words incorrectly to funny effect. She notes that her friend is almost \\"historical\\" with worry and grief. I enjoy these turns of phrase and how Esmeralda meets each needy person with the best Christian response of \\"how can I help you?\\". She takes someone with AIDS into her home without a backward glance and works to arrange for an adoption and lots more that I won't share here, so the book will be fresh for you.

When i first heard Muse i inmediatly tought it sounded like RadioHead, only because of Matt's voice, but when you listen closely you start to realize this band is something more than just a mere comparison to many known bands (Nirvana,Queen, etc). Muse is in a league of its own, musicianship at its best ( one of my other favorites bands is Dream Theater for this kind of prodigy), every instrument its top notch and well complemented with the vocals. Sadly Muse is not a band for everyone, not for todays pop-music, fabricated-boring crap generation. If you like good instruments, excellent vocals and dark lyrics, you'll love Muse.If they keep this up in another album or better yet improved it i think Muse will know longer be unknown to the mass media, and they'll have the recognition they deserved, i just hope they don't lose their vision only to sell albums in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Forgive Me","review":"To have supported this band makes me sick. It is so sad that our culture perpetuates idiot behavior where people still believe in souls and gods.

I can't believe I supported these imbecile's. Please don't make my mistake. Stop the spread of conservative agenda's where people make your lives miserable and make you feel guilty for natural human behavior so they can control you like a puppet, just by promising some foolish fantasy if you do what they say. It leads to religious agenda's like George Bush and groups like Muse and all you brainwashed drones are ruining this country. Please stop supporting this idiot drivel and and dog-awful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"What a fantastic and unique album. My favorite tracks are \\"Time is Running Out\\" with its insightful lyrics about an addictive relationship and \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\", an optimistic ode about having the strength to do your best.

This is not some head-banging, teeth-gnashing, hate-spewing metal act, this is Muse. While the comparison to The Bends-era Radiohead is pretty spot on, and the mood in most songs is dark, and the subject matter darker, Muse's sound on Absolution is far from grungey. Absolution sparkles with an upbeat, experimental vibe. To stick to the Radiohead comparison (though Muse easily stands on their own in substance and style), think of pumping Kid a/Amnesiac era paranoia and experimentalism into The Bends era guitar-driven rock. The sound is dramatic, slick, and big. It's strong, but not raw. You will not believe that the sound on Absolution came out of just three guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's wrong with us Americans?","review":"We sit here criticising an imaginative British rock band for taking some influence from another imaginative British rock band!What is America offering these days in comparison?

It pulled me in, chewed me up and then spit me out, and I absolutely loved it. It's there best yet. THIS IS NOT RADIOHEAD REHASHED. Of course there are similarities to draw upon, but Muse is definitely on a level that is removed from anyone else. It is like they were making this album as if the the hope of the world hinged upon it. The music is a fusion of hope and despair. Beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm here to defend British music!","review":"All the comparasons with Radiohead are justified BUT I love Muse but HATE Radiohead.Undoubtedly one of Britain's finest bands right now, Muse have immense talent. Fronted by Matt Bellamy, the man with the ability to capture listeners with his amazing voice and guitar playing. Unbelivable song-writer too, because he conveys so much passion in what he does. They're one of the best live performers and command the audience effortlessly. This is a little surprising considering there's only three of them!Contuary to what other people are saying, Muse are not copying anyone. There is nobody around at the moment like them. Can be a little depressing but that never stopped musicians before.\\"Showbiz\\" and \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" are superior to this newer album, in my opinion. Check them out.If you can play guitar, try some of those riffs and I defy you to master them quickly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay","review":"This CD is finally being released on March 24, 2004 here in Canada. So I assume it will be in the U.S too, not too sure about that. But if you can get it, definitely recommended. And now that it will become a non-import CD it shouldn't be too hard for you to get it!You won't regret listening to it, definitely not Radiohead-esque. Voice, perhaps but stylistically they're very unique. I dig Bellamy's semi-orchestral piano skills in some of his songs. Lyrics are a bit lacking, but their instrumentation and uniqueness definitely makes up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I've ever owned","review":"I am a little late coming onto Muse. This is my loss completely. Listening to this album changes the way I feel about music. It is raw, powerful, emotional and hauntingly beautiful. It makes listening to other music hard, as most everything else I hear sounds comparitively like uninspired drivel, a waste of sonic space. Everyone of these songs is indeed over the top, and as bombastic as people say (save maybe Blackout) but they are so thrilling to listen to that you are happily carried over with them. I would recommend this album to anyone ...the vocals, guitars, piano, arrangements are a lovely example of musical creativity at it's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"remy zero","review":"Rather than Radiohead, I hear a lot of Remy Zero circa Villa Elaine.

They get 1 star because there is no originality here....none.If you like Radiohead, you might like Muse.

If you are looking for good music, do NOT get this album. Radiohead is being degrated when people compare this band to them. This album sucks. theres a bunch of whining and music beats that are ones i've heard before just with some screaming or singing in the back. Nothing was good on this album and no one should get this. take heed to my warning. please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: Radiohead","review":"Muse is BLATANTLY derivative of Radiohead. If you don't mind their complete lack of originality and long for a watered-down version of the source material.........knock yourselves out with Muse.They should be ashamed to have ripped off another artist's sound and sensibility so obviously.Just another example of the sad state of affairs in the music industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another face to put on the decline of public taste","review":"Not only do these guys not add anything to music but they create the illusion of good music which is far worse.This band does not fall into the same genre as Radiohead. Radiohead did not create a genre, they create music. It's just a bold and nearly successful attempt at capitalizing on what Radiohead has accomplished. The reason it is nearly successful is that listeners who are not highly discerning and who are into music for the image will listen to this, equate it to Radiohead, and delude themselves into thinking they know good music.Don't worry, though. It does not degrade Radiohead in the end because those who know better will know better. It's not enough of a parasite to really cause any damage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this album- IT ROCKS","review":"Muse is an absolutely amazing band and i think its a shame they have to be compared to Radiohead. Their styles are completely different. Radioheads music makes me depressed. Granted Muse is slightly happier but their tunes make me rock out like nothing else. Matthew Bellamy's vocal range is incredible, gives me chills and he plays the piano beautifully.Some of my favorites on this album:Time is Running Out - never get tired of this no matter how much its played.Butterflies and Hurricanes - In my opinion the most beautiful song on the album. Nifty little piano work.The Small Print - A rockin' songRuled by Secrecy - gives you something to think aboutSing For Absolution - Haunting lyrics"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of attention","review":"This stuff is amazing. I have not been this fired up about a band since I first heard Opeth and Devin Townsend. I especially love Track 5 (pay special attention to the bass and drums).It is difficult not to make comparisons to Radiohead because of the similarities of the lead singers' voices, however, the overall mood of the album is very unique. If you like Radiohead's kind of stuff, but tend to prefer music that's a bit heavier, then you might love this band. To me, the music on this album is defintely not intended to be played as backgound music, it demands the listerner's attention. Play it at the high volume it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy and Hard-Hitting","review":"I love the faster tempo stuff, especially the bass lines.

To me, this album catches Muse at the apex of their musical and creative ability. Unfortunately, it's been a steady decline after this album, although I will always see Bellamy and crew as absolute geniuses.This album explores such a vast amount of emotional ideas through a varied yet consistent musical approach. It's clear that the entire band takes music very seriously, and there are no limits as to where the band pulls their influences from. As someone who appreciates classical music, it was so refreshing for me to hear the classical style arpeggios that flutter throughout Apocalypse. And the thundering piano chords at the end of Ruled by Secrecy. This album has it all, and it deserves an attentive listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muse is amazing","review":"Muse isn't one of those bands where one or two of their songs are good and the rest of them are kind of weird or suck. Obviously some songs are better than others, but I enjoy every one of their songs.I loved Muse before they were big. Their music screams originality, and not just different, there's talent as well. The lyrics are deep, kind of like Radiohead though they're apples and oranges really. 5.00 for the mp3 version is a sweet deal. Can't beat that. I don't know if I like this one or Black Holes and Revelations better. They're both amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Apocalypse Please","review":"A convoluted metaphor for you:Radiohead = fatherIncubus = motherIt's as if Radiohead and Incubus, horrified at the thought of not having a child, adopted Dexter Freebish. Years later, the doting couple finally had their first-born, Muse. Not being the favorite, Freebish tinkered with Muse's mind a bit while the first-born took musical inspiration from its mother and father. The result: Muse's skillfully crafted and complex (\\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" and \\"Hysteria\\") sound that operates, at times, on subtle simple elegance (\\"Time Is Running Out\\" and \\"Ruled By Secrecy\\"). The lyrics fall in between Incubus' blatantly explicit stories and Radiohead's befuddling, cycphered words and work wonderfully and often keep the record aloft. They obviously know how to write a catchy hook while keeping it meaningful. This is a must-own record of wonderfully evocative rock for Radiohead fans and/or those who don't enjoy the bizarre subtleties of Radiohead."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just goes to show...","review":"how lame the North American music scene still is. Once again Muse prove that these days only the tiny, former colonial power with its dark and hurting soul has the potential to drive music to new shores.

They are unique, special, hypnotizing and inspiring.I don't understand the comparision to Radiohead, and although i love Radiohead i think Muse do that little bit extra and go that extra mile.i like Radiohead because they are weird, but they are also getting boring. I like Muse for the same reason, they are weird - but they are certain not boring.I can't think of any other band that had done a space opera rock theme for it to actually work.

As impressed as I was then by a few of their songs, this album, Absolution, has impressed me with just about every song.The songs on Absolution are melodic, intricate, and polished. The timing on the songs, every note... perfect. Additionally, the inclusion of classical-style piano solos gives their songs a wonderfully grandose feeling. Singer Matt Bellamy's daring vocals often remind me of a combination of Jeff Buckley and Thom Yorke (Radiohead). Vocally, the similarities are undeniable. Lyrically, not as much. As much as I love Apocalypse Please, Time Is Running Out, & Sing for Absolution, BUTTERFLIES and HURRICANES is the most engaging song on the album. Turn it up and let its magnificence envelope you.ABSOLUTION is without a doubt their best album thus far and will stand in the minds of many fans as their defining album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Listen","review":"Fantastic music to listen to on a long drive. It seems that each time I hear a song that I can pick up on a new sound each time - the same song sounds just a little different every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artful","review":"My heart pounds with the powerfully frantric drums and piano of Apocalypse Please, my quench for skillfull rock is healed with the tantalizing beats of 'Stockholm Syndrome', 'Time Is Running Out' and 'Hysteria', and the serene love song 'Endlessly' is a touchingly vulnerable tale hailing over the likes of 'Unintended'. 'Butterflies and Hurricanes' is a true tribute to the classical soul and the eeriely soft beauties of 'Blackout' and 'Ruled By Secrecy' is matched only by the accompanying violins and talented piano. The sounds of 'Falling Away With You' is streamed with crys of the skillful Matthew Bellamy, and the final troubles of a drowning soul are described through 'The Small Print' and 'Thoughts Of A Dying Atheist'.The album is an event triggered by the sounds of the Apocalypse (track 2) and all songs following are the racey thoughts of ending lights and feverish attempts to grasp that 'Absolution' before it's over. Truely Muse's most mature and dramatic peices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"This is definitely a great album. Better than most out there. BUT, for those that said this is better than anything radiohead has ever done, get your retarded head out of your arse.

What a sophmoric effort at reviewing what is, all in all, an incredible album. Its so rare that an album has even a few good singles on it but this thing is packed with some real honest to God rock. Radiohead comparisons are moot considering that Thom and Co. are making bad Moog rock, and I can't remember an album that was so consistently good from Radiohead (remember Hunting Bears).

They once stood as one of the most amazing, phenominal, emotional acts around, but now have resorted to pop based androgonous rock.Stockholm Sydnrome stands as a testament to TRUE muse, with Apocalypse please following almost. However songs such as Thoughst of a dying athiest & hysteria stray from the godly emotion withheld in Matthew Bellamy, and with Sing for absolution, it virtually destroys the album.Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"Well I must say this came as a surprise. For some reason Muse have decided to take the one bad track from OoS , Megalomania, and base most of their new album on it. Couple of good tracks aside (TPS, Stockholm Syndrome), the rest is very much a step backwards for the band. Far too much pompous noodling with strings and pianos, and even Matt's vocals seem more annoying then before. I know others have said this album shows Muse to be growing as a band, but anyone who loved OoS be warned: this is drastically different from that masterpiece and not in a good way. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't I Heard This Sound Before???","review":"This English trio is a Radiohead imitator--which is fine, of course. There's room on the bus for groups that can mimic another's sound if they can pull it off (ELO's Beatlesesque pop and the Feelies' Velvet Underground-charged tunes come to mind). However, Muse, unlike Radiohead, doesn't temper their progressive rock obsession with art school know-how. Whereas Thom Yorke and company believe--whether it's true or not is another question--that they are reinventing progressive rock for a post-punk generation, the guys from Muse define retrogradation.

I hadn't given it a full listen in years until the other day while I was driving in the Colorado mountains. I own all the Muse albums but this is, without question, their best effort. I love all the Muse albums but wow! This album is amazing from beginning to end. I would tell anyone new to Muse they should purchase this album first and give it a few spins before making a judgment. Muse has a way of bringing atmospheric & theater rock to the masses without sounding over the top and campy. The fact this album still gives me chills after not hearing it for years says something. Purchase this album and enjoy the atmospheric sounds of Muse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, great album!!!","review":"So I downloaded this song from this chick who tells me that it is an advanced song from Radioheads new cd \\"Telephasic\\" and after listening to it, Im thinking Radiohead is getting heavy all of a sudden. I was really digging what I was hearing and i see a video for Muse's single and I was taken aback. This whole time Im thinking Radiohead has done it again, and it was Muse. \\"Absolution\\" is an amazing disc from beginning to end. There is no doubt that he sounds like Yorke, but there is something more behind his voice and after listening through a couple of times, you realize that Muse has a style all their own. \\"Butterflies & Hurricanes\\" and \\"Sing for Absolution\\" are standout tracks to me, but really, they are all good. Definitely worth picking up on this because if this disc doesnt make them big, the next one will. I saw them for 5 dollars a week ago, so you can still catch them before they hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muse - Absolution","review":"WOW, this album is everything I wished Radiohead sounded like! Incredible riffs taking the listener into quite a heightened state. I saw Muse play at the Curiosity festival at Ontario Place recently and they ROCKED! They got my attention from the first second."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Makes me Pine for...","review":"This spirited album by Muse makes me pine so much for Radiohead circa '95-97, those years prior to the latter band's corruption via Kid A. Anyway, Muse rock with a vitality and an energy not common to many contemporary bands--just check out the emotive, wailing \\"Time is Running Out\\" for proof of what Radiohead, Wilco, and others have eschewed in favor of supposedly \\"nobler\\" musical pursuits. \\"Absolution\\" will not save the world, it will not make us view post-modernism in a different light, it will not deconstruct recorded sound--but it will provide for an exciting, enthralling, and ultimately rewarding listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is What I call a perfectly merged rock band","review":"Really good musicians! Absolution is the next step on their music, it shows a maturity on their studio work and the way they use electronic sequences along with the perfect performance of guitar, piano and drums; make this album a Master Piece, a new Classic. If you liked the \\"Origin of Simetry\\" this one won't dissapoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is an AMAZING rock band, the best new rock to be introduced, the best rock cd of the 2000's.They ought to be famous forever, this is how amazing they are, and this CD is incredible.Time is running OutHysteriaStockholm SydromeSing for AbsolutionThoughts of a dying atheistAll incredible on their own accord, even greater considering they came from one single band.Buy this CD if you want something to get over the crap that you last listened to and restore your faith that good rock still exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put, you need this CD!","review":"I am always looking for new stuff to listen to, new sounds, new bands. This is one of the best cd's I have heard in a REALLY long time. The songs get stuck in your head, but instead of getting annoying like almost everything else, you just want to listen to it again.The descriptions of the kinds of sound (Radiohead + others) is right on. There are not many bands out there that can create such a sound as Muse, and almost nobody that make that sound so riveting. They have set themselves far and above the modern American California punk sound that is finding popularity. If you dig the likes of Rooney, Phantom Planet, even the Strokes (not to bag on any of them), MUSE IS BETTER!If you don't have this cd, get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"Spinal Tap\\" of Radiohead","review":"Among this slew of bands that sound \\"like Radiohead\\", most of them unwisely (in my opinion) travel the plain Coldplay Travis route. Muse... doesn't. Most of the tracks have a hard rock minor key urgency like Iron Maiden and Freddie Mercury are chasing them, trying to give them an enema of boiling water.I'm sure there could be some good lyrics in there, but I haven't heard a word yet, and I don't want to ruin the rock-out buzz I've got here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muse Rocks My Face Off!!!!!!!","review":"Wow! What a great album. Yes, I agree, the vocals sound a lot like Radiohead, but Muse has a style of its own. It is more on the techno/trippy side than Radiohead. Every song on this album I enjoy. I strongly recommend this album if you like Radiohead, but be prepared to not like Radiohead as much after you've listened to this CD, you'll like Muse better. Muse would be way more popular than Radiohead if more Americans knew about them. Ah well, I've found a hidden gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"stop reading reviews","review":"first of all, screw the guys who like to waste tons of valuable space complaining about how the lead singer of muser is tryin to emulate radiohead and their sound. do something no one seems to remember how to do and form your own freakin opinion by listening to this instead of taking other people's words for it. muse is fabulous, and if you don't like it GUESS WHAT? no one's forcing you to listen to it. borrow a friend's copy if you want to see if it's for you or not. and stop writing essay long reviews that bash it, cuz guess what?

It reads like a 16 year old's diary--unbearably self-centered and self-absorbed, given to inane philosophizing and adolescent romanticism. It is somewhat astonishing that a sixty-something year old man has managed to abide at such a stage of arrested development. He may have inadvertently succeeded in his quest for literary recognition by writing what will one day be considered the definitive document of baby boomer narcissism and selfishness.

The vitality and wit of the man always shine through, in voices crazed and caring: buy Electric Lau Lau (CD) too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The picture of unmaking","review":"This book has been described as the journal of Jack losing himself. Some critics state that when he came back down from his time of solitude on Desolation Mountain begins his spiral downward into madness, alcoholism and loss of artistic edge. I disagree - but it is most certainly a showing of a break in his persona - as he describes the beauty and horror of having nothing to do but face one's self when that's all one has. The lies you tell yourself are strong, but give way when you have no one else to reinforce them for months on end...and this may have indeed driven Jack to the edge and beyond.The pre-eminent voice of the Beat movement, who both gave it its name and disavowed his involvement, is at his most exposed and honest self in this work. This is not a book to read for a relaxing afternoon, in my opinion. This is a book that will burden you - but you'll be better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey into the mind of a true madman!!!","review":"If you've read On the Road, then this is a must read. It is a true journey into the mind of a madman. A more intimate look into the man that defined a generation of our parents, parents. As a younger reader of the generation today it is beneficial for us to see how people lived in past generations and take with us their experiences that in a sense you could not experience today. If I've taken anything from this book its the showing of the need for insanity in the life of Kerouac. And the need for constinent movement, not just in the physical sense but also in the mental sense of having his mind in constient movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beauty Within the Tragedy","review":"Like all the Kerouac novels, the overriding point of this book is to show the beauty that lies within the tragedy of human life. Though Kerouac is \\"depressed\\" through most of the book, sickened by the people and places and travel which he once found so necessary, he finds mental respite in his mother and her unconditionally warm spirit, among other things. Another point which Kerouac strives to raise is religion. Though he and his friends more oft than not live a wild and consumptive life, Jack still remains devoted to the idea of God and the genuine goodness of people. This book, just as all Kerouac novels, describes life with a wide-eyed vivacity unlike anything I've ever read, if only in a less sunny way."},{"rating":"2","title":"great and warm story","review":"Desolation Angels is a sentimental story which takes place in the time leading up to On The Road being released. To me, this is a great story of adventure and personal reflection for Kerouac.

Worked great and our dog actually stood still while using."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfull for Lhasa Apso grooming","review":"This is a great product. The battery wears out at about the same time my Lhasa Apsos get tired of sitting relatively still. It beats paying costly grooming bills and the hassle of keeping appointments. It takes a bit of practice to get them looking as good as the groomers do but the good thing is that the hair grows back and you get to start again. I use this clipper on my two dogs, and about four others in my neighborhood. Love it. Cordless makes it easy to move with the wiggly dogs too!Update: Have had this product for almost three years now. I had to replace the blades but the new ones work even better! Make sure you order the correct blades.

The clippers are smooth and quiet so that my normally skittish cat actually sat through the whole session without even a meow.

Needless to say, my cat looks insane, but at least his hair is gone and he doesn't seem to mind at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great clipper with bad battery life","review":"I purchased these clippers approx 2 years ago. They are excellent clippers i.t.o ergonomics, cutting performance - the stainless blades work great and the clipper is relatively quiet. The clipper does not overheat. My concern is the poor battery life - mine is now dead after 2 years and I have to buy new clippers. I would have given these clippers a 5 star if I reviewed it a month after purchase, but 2 years from now they are useless. No, the plug in feature does not work - you can not run on AC power only if the battery is dead. The AC only works with the battery somewhat charged."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful... do not buy","review":"I bought these because the reviews at the time were good for these clippers.

My dog is a spaniel mix, Boykin and Britney, and her hair is fine, thick and wavy. These clippers worked like a hot knife through butter. It took less time, which means less stress for my girl.

If you're looking to cut a more hair-like coat, I suggest you look elsewhere.I purchased this for my Lhasa mutt who gets clipped short. This thing would pull on his hair and just clip some of the hair that comes through the comb. What results is an uneven coat of patchy looking hair. Even with no attachment any amount of hair would make the motor work and not perform up to par.Also the short little tips of hair that did get clipped would collect at the base of the blades and build up, causing even worse performance. I had to keep clearing the blades of hair after just a few strokes.Needless to say, these are getting shipped right back to the warehouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of specifications","review":"Product Details or full specifications should indicate the voltage rating of the battery charger.Supplying a 120 Volt charger to Australia is useless.

My concern is that if it hurts when it's holding against my hand, how much does it hurt my dog when I trim him.

I encourage reviewers to read customer input and not some of the nonsense that was spouted by the Amazon Reviewer. There is not a single album where Roy Kahn sounds like Geoff Tate of Queensryche, this is simply ignorant. Also stating that Kamelot is seeking attention from the Korn and Avenge Sevenfold crowd is ridiculous.The reviewer does state that they are more than the average power metal band which is true. Unfortunately saying that Helloween's Keeper of the Seven Keys was a failure is an oxymoron. That album is what influenced all the newer Power Metal bands.If you are interested in Power Metal get the latest Kamelot album, Ghost Opera. If you want to see how Power Metal started then listen to Helloween's Keeper of the Seven Keys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, outrageous Amazon review!","review":"It's unbelievable that someone as ignorant as this Amazon reviewer can write music review for a living! With a name like his, something like Red Boudoir, no wonder he's confused! The only common feature of Khan and Geoff Tate is they both have short hair. Comparing Kamelot's catchy power fast-driven metal to Korn's subpar monotonous rapping thrashy metal is a disgrace! I don't wanna even talk about the other second rate band, A7X. My nephew is a Korn fan, he never heard of Deep Purple. That tells you how different Kamelot's fans are from the listeners of those bands Boudoir foolishly claimed Kamelot is emulating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kamelot surprises everyone once again...","review":"Ghost Opera has sort of a different musical direction than the previous albums offered, in a very good way. It sort of mixes everything Kamelot has done and adds a little bit more. I must admit that at first I was a little confused by it, but after listening a couple of times to it, it grew on me and the songs became very catchy. It is not as dark as Black Halo or not as symphonic as Epica but definetly somewhere in between. Definetly recommend this album. If you liked their previous releases, then don't hesitate to get this one, you won't be dissapointed.On a side note, if you have not seen Kamelot live, I strongly recommend you do. They put on a magnificent show that will leave you wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moving towards the wrong side of the tracks...","review":"I've been reading the reviews for this album and I have to say I think it's amazing how many people think that this album is good. I think it is the worst album by far. It sounds like Kamelot was so eager to get the attention of teeny goths that they forgot their true fans. This album is so disappointing that it makes me sad. It's not \\"Kamelot\\" and that's the whole reason that we buy their cd's. It's okay to sound different, but this kind of different is NOT good. If you are interested in power metal check out any of Kamelot's albums BUT this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Extremely well written work. Kamelot are maturing and their music is becoming more conceptual. And, what can I say about the mighty Khan? well still one of the best around. I did catch the band in concert and they were dynamic. Khan of course steals the show with his multi-ranged and magnificant voice. This is captured on the CD as well.Although I liked this CD and the more I listened to it the better I liked it, I have given it four stars because I was not particularly pleased with the sound production. I tried it on more than one system, but still it sounded somehow distorted.With that said, I still recommend this CD to people who enjoy melodic progressive rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kamelot - Ghost Opera","review":"This band is brilliant!

However, every album I have heard from Kamelot has been top-notch power metal at its best. Ghost Opera takes it to the next level.Yes, employing orchestral elements seems a bit overdone these days, but mixed with Kamelot's dark and powerful delivery, it truly enhances the texture of the album. Ghost Opera is so full of passion and great storytelling that it can easily be compared to a Hollywood movie blockbuster. I would venture to say that Ghost Opera is a dark, haunting movie (worthy of a creepy Johnny Depp performance) confined to audio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed their mark!","review":"Songs seem very repetitive. Also, has some rip-off \\"Phantom\\" music to create the ghostly effect. Khan needs to stop with the attempt at soft singing. His vibrato kills all of the ballad style singing and his voice sounds way over trained. I am all about great vocals and this album does a poor job of showcasing them. Khan can sing better than this. Lose the heavy vibrato. I am a Kamelot fan but the album left me wanting more.

Every 50th light bulb has a \\"fuse bulb\\" (marked by a white casing the bulb connects into)that is GLUED into the socket. Once it burns out, the section of lights between it and the next fuse bulb will go completely out. It is not intended to be replaced by the user and does not have an available replacement part. If you try to take the bulb out, it ends the warranty. If this bulb goes out (and it will much sooner than it should)and your warranty is over or you messed with the fuse bulb, you are out of luck.

I never had a problem with them over the years, they lasted for multiple holiday years without having to replace them. The last two years I've had to buy new each year because one or two strands would burn out before xmas. Same thing this year, bought three new strands and the one in the center of the tree burned out xmas morning when the tree lights were turned on. Will never buy this product again, very disappointed. They are NOT \\"constant on\\" lights either, half a strand will burn out or three quarters of the strand or the entire thing, awful quality in recent years. Do not recommend at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say No to GE Pre-Lit Trees and Lights!","review":"Purchased a GE pre-lit tree with C-5 constant on lights. All GE pre-lit trees are on the expensive side, but beautiful trees. The lights worked a couple of weeks, then part of a set went out. With a thousand other things on my mind, I purchased more lights and tried to mask the flaw. By Christmas (about 3 weeks after purchse) two sets of lights were only half lit. The next year I didn't want to deal with it, so purchased more lights (definately NOT GE brand) and a live tree. This year I decided this $300+ tree was way too expensive to be a 3-week proposition (and at that with 1/2 of 2 sets out) and determined I would use it. Now three sets of the lights are half way out. I have spent at least 4 hours this evening alone trying to get them going. No luck. That is the last GE product I will be purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economical and reliable","review":"The string of these lights that was installed on our artificial tree lasted almost 10 years.

I join the thousands of Barry Hughart fans in *imploring* him to please publish another Master Li novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hughart Winner","review":"No surprise, another entertaining and delightful Li Kao and Number Ten Ox fantasy-adventure. The grisly murder of a prominent mandarin by a mysterious ghoul provides the catalyst for this duo to go delving into China's ancient mythology searching for the answers. Along the way, author Barry Hughart creates some of the most curious and imaginative heroes and villains you will ever encounter. Just superb.Sadly, as noted by previous reviewers, this is the third and last book that the author has written in this series. On the bright side, the books he did write were all sparkling 5-star reads. \\"Eight Skilled Gentlemen\\" is a winner - just read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farewell, Master Li","review":"In this, the final of Hughart's three Master Li books, we learn about ancient shamanistic deities and the homicidal Sixth Degree Hosteler Tu. The twists and turns are a little less surprising in this third outing, and even Number Ten Ox guesses the identity of the villain before the end. But the journey is just as magical and wonderful. Hughart has a gift for being able to tweak his cosmology - or our perceptions of it - ever so slightly, without damaging the integrity of his world. This wasn't supposed to be the last book, but since the esteemed Master Hughart has apparently set aside his labors, we can only savor the bittersweet ending of a series not halfway done. The Master Li series is in a class of its own, and I fervently pray against all odds that another volume of these 'long-lost chronicles' will eventually come to light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poem from my schooldays","review":"Got this book simply to have a copy of the poem.

As a teacher, his remarks on the different tracks children are railroaded into, are dead on. His stories are very personal and it is easy to relate it to members of my own family. The story of his grandmother's fight with Alzheimer's and the issue it raised with race, made me reread that story 4 to 5 times.

He gives you the history of white privilege in America, discusses the colour of divinity, talks about his experiences with racism, offers ways of combating racism, and so much more.In a society like America where racism occurs more often than not...at least, this has been my experience. This book lets you know that there are some people who are doing something about this problem and it prevents you from judging a whole group of people based on what you may have experienced from some of their members.I had the privilege of attending one of his lectures in California, and he signed three of his books for me. He also answered my question before I left the class, and I was touched. Thank you, Tim.

Kinda reminds me of the 1980 movie \\"Airplane\\" when the ex-fighter pilot tells the story of his life to the passengers; they end their lives in different ways after having to hear him...There are no issues if you planned on finding one. There is no summary and never any conclusion to the issue of racism. It is an amusing story of a 36 year old that has dillidallied in the fight for Black Power. His talk about racism is not scientific nor scholar but simply comes across as to what he's heard. Just alot of personal events that make you dizzy in trying to remember that the author indeed has a point to tell after all the irrelevant details of his story come in pages after pages of paper product.Amusing, yes, informative, no.

I wonder if Mr. Wise ever visited Appalachia or run-down cities like Detroit where whites didn't have any \\"privileges\\" to fall back upon. Wise is deliberately directing minority angst and hatred toward whites. Meanwhile, he and his fellow Jews are conveniently able to dodge criticism by claiming that they are the world's foremost victims of the white race, which has supposedly always been anti-Semitic. Wise is a foil to condemn whites, dismiss and ignore their many contributions to civilization, and subtly promote Jewish supremacism by default because everyone else is supposedly evil or over-privileged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tim looks like a Rabbi","review":"Looks like Timmy's trying to make a buck out of conning minorities out of their \\"hard-earned\\" money by pretending he actually cares about them.

Unlike STF, Wise articulates these arguments in the context of his upbringing and the forces and experiences that shaped him into the activist he is today. Wise's style is concise and approachable .

Ah, but Jews (or most Jews) are white, you say.

As a matter of logic, in the political sense, Jews cannot be \\"white\\".

Absinthe certainly has it's moments. In carving out droning, atonal soundscapes on which to build this disc, the anti-band touches on some ravishing, shimmering muck that can be seen mostly at the beginning and end of this project. However, in a brief nine track lineup consisting primarily of controlled noise, Absinthe's unique charm soon gives way to much undercooked experimentation, leaving the entire listening experience a bit to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I think that John Zorn is an important musician and like to give him the benefit of the doubt. Many of his countless albums are brilliant. Even when his music is not that interesting on first listen, I will hang in there and listen repeatedly in the hope of finding treasures not immediately apparent. However, this album just leaves me cold. I really don't care if it is like or unlike other Naked City releases, or which musicians are on it. It's one of those albums that stands on its own merits because it is so unique. It appears to be an exercise in making the smallest possible amount of sound for the length of an entire album while still making some sound. It may be \\"ambient\\", but if so, it is dull ambient. It's just plain dull. One can admire the idea or vision of this album but I have to say that I don't like it much, and I like a lot of Zorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no \\"there\\" there","review":"This album sounds like an experiment in how small an amount of sound can be recorded over the length of a CD, and whether anyone would then buy it or take it seriously.

After that, the articles start to sound about the same, and if you become a serious writer, you'll soon want something meatier. Here's why:This magazine (and its publishers) don't seem too terribly serious about the craft of writing. What they ARE serious about is making money off of the mass of people who dream of being writers. WD and F&W; publications (excluding Writer's Market, which is actually a valuable tool) is all about giving hope (not a better chance) to everyone interested in writing a book, despite the odds being stacked against the chances of most wannabe writers actually achieving sucess.

If you take the time to fully charge the internal battery, you might get an hour out of it. Then take a newly charged battery and place it in the battery pack and you might get another two (this is far shy of the 6.5 and 10 hours promised). And if you want the unit to listen to audio books, it will prove frustrating. If you pause for more than a few seconds, it will turn off; leaving you to start the chapter or the book over.

As I read MAXIM, I find myself laughing at some parts, fascinated at others, ogling flesh at still others. In short, reading MAXIM takes away boredom by presenting articles covering a range of topics.That stated, MAXIM would never have become the number one mens magazine in the world if it did not appeal to the intellect. If you understand the humor in the magazine, you probably like MAXIM. If you don't get it, you might find much of the writing pointless.Anyone who has not taken the time to read the magazine from cover to cover (okay, not the fashion section) is advised to do so. That inclues the little comment boxes and photo one-liners. Invest that time and you will expand your mind, understand the magazine's appeal and likely want to read MAXIM again the following month."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAX-EM","review":"JOKES, SEX, GIRLS, CLOTHES, GADGETS...if your a man, Maxim is for YOU...I'm only 17 and I have had a subscription since i was 16, and let's just say Maxim is extreamly hilarious and informative...Stuff magazine may get some hotter girls (such as Jennifer Lopez), and their paper may be more expensive in quality as opposed to Maxim's but Maxim is not bad...The girls are great and the context of the magazine is excellent as opposed to the thin, female semi nude pics and fluff contents of other men mags...I will soon be in college and I will continue reading Maxim, it's a great magazine...I have to get my address changed once I find out my dorm room...(haha)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"This is just not that good.

I had a dim recollection of thumbing through a few issues of Maxim at newsstands and feeling a bit of danger as I snuck a peek at some partially clad women within. Well the minute I started receiving this silly periodical I was put in my place BIG-TIME! On the cover of one of the first issues I received was that no-talent, teenybopper sister of Hillary Duff who is trying to glom on to her more-talented sibling's sucess to advance her own \\"career\\".... what's her name?... Hailey! Ewwww, I know Hillary Duff's sisters name, purge me, exorcise me! Anyway, with the exception of a few truly stunning and somewhat nude women sprinkled occasionally throughout the various issues, there is nothing much to look at or read here.

As a guy's girl, I always get alot of laughs out of Maxim, it's sense of humor is right up my alley, and the type of humor I'll never see in a women's magazine!

I thought Maxim was more like a \\"Men's issues/health/style/etc.\\" type magazine. It's soft porn, mostly. The articles are uninteresting and poorly written. In fact, it feels a lot like reading a 15 year old boy's school homework, if he could write with no inhibitions nor worry of getting in trouble for honesty. I would know, I'm a teacher, and this magazine has the sophistication level of just that, a 15 year old boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Equal time??","review":"I certainly do hope one of these days that Maxim magazing will get women who are small-breasted equal time.That's all I have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't received this yet!!","review":"Ordered a subscription to this magazine over a month ago.

Who else is going to package such useful nuggets of information as how to avoid dying in a plane crash, how to make the perfect italian sausage, and where to get a bunch of cool consumer products that I should probably be using (brainwashed you say...maybe, but at least I am well groomed!). Maxim really is the total package, all wrapped up into a neat little magazine with the occasional scantily clad hottie thrown here and there for effect. If you are a female and have not read Maxim, you need to do so immediately if you ever want to understand the short-attention-span prone psycosis of the average guy (think cosmo for men)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still haven't recieve any issue since i order last month!","review":"Yeah, i havent recieve any magazine since i place a subcription last month from this company, if you can find other online publishing i highly recommend going to that route or just buy a physical copy at your local magazine store.

Now I'm deployed so it's likely that someone probably saw the Maxim mag and took it. The delivery date is set for June 29th so we'll see what happens.

The articles in the magazine are hilarious and the pictorials are fantastic. Its a wonderful thing to have along on a long road trip or a boring wait in an airport terminal.The articles range from silly \\"How To\\" articles about making liquor in prison to well-researched journalistic gems about terrorism or Saddam Hussein's sons. This magazine doesn't disappoint.If I had to come up with a negatice aspect for Maxim, I'd have to say that there are a few too many advertisements with men in their underwear for my taste. It seems as though lately, there is a lot more advertising but the quality of the articles and pictorials has remained consistent so its really not that important.Needless to say, my wife wasn't very happy when the first issue arrived but now she's a regular reader.

Sometimes the magazine will try to be educational with a \\"smart person\\" kind of article, the effort is appreciatted, but who will read it anyway?Bottom line: Funny, but don't use it as a guide to your love life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this ... mag off the shelves please!","review":"Maxim started out as a great British mix of babes and guy reading style mag, with nice covers, interesting women featured, with nice photography and humorous articles. Since it split into two versions (US & UK), the US one went completely downhill. Less of a mag (but bigger than the UK because of so many ads) the photography of this magazine has to be just about the worst of any of the men's magazines on the shelf. Just look closely at any cover on the shelf. The women do not look human, they look like animation. WAY TOO MUCH AIRBRUSHING IN PHOTOSHOP guys. I love looking at women, but real photos please, not digital nightmares. An awful looking mag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"I totally agree with Matthieu.

Beutiful girls are better in their natural form, and generic human beings are not so interesting after all.

It's too bad they can't play up the silly humor a bit more while leaving the abhorrent juvenileness out. The images are generally trashy and sometimes airbrushed to the point that it looks fake and ridiculous--they could improve the quality of the photos a LOT.Admit it, you would probably hide an issue if you ran into anyone you actually respected.

Maxim is...well...cool! It's obviously aimed at teenage-30 year old guys. It has good taste by not having any nudity, sure many picture are provocative but the magazine never borders on \\"porn\\". Nor does it rely only on the pictures of famous celebrities. It always contains good articles and offers advice towards improving your sex life. Basically, if Maxim is porn for men, then Cosmo is porn for women. It's not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Men's magazine","review":"It's easy to say that \\"Maxim\\" is for the men who are too embarrassed to ask the clerk at the bookstore for \\"Playboy.\\" But in many ways, this is \\"Playboy\\"-lite, especially with its pictorials. However, \\"Maxim\\" really does live up to its slogan and does contain just about everything a man is interested in. Each article is well written, and the magazine covers the realm from sports to sex, movies to music, and so on. Especially worth getting are the issues containing sampler music CD's, which feature some of the most promising up and coming bands and artists. The CD that came with the 1997 debut included then such unknown artists as Matchbox 20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best men's magazine out there","review":"Maxim is by far the best men's magazine out there today.

And the price is right too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a WOMEN!","review":"Hello I am a women and I would just like to say this magazine is rockin, not only does it appeal to men, but whenever I am in the airport or traveling I pack along Maxim, this magazine is packed with funny antidotes and great things to read about the opposite sex...

Maxim should be awarded for being a top selling magizine while writing the same articles in each monthly issue. Articls tend to be about Women, beer, gagdets, and other semi-useless and fully useless crap. Some peices become blatently offensive, like in one article, Maxim was examining the things we gave Japan and the things Japan gave us. Japan has given us plenty of electronics and cool things for cheap, while Maixim proudly proclaims that we (america) gave Japan two nuclear bombs.

I won't renew. The magazine does have pictures of some beautiful women, but that's not enough to recommend it. The interviews are some of the most insipid I have ever read. They tell you nothing about the subject of the interview, but only about the interviewer himself. The snarky humor throughout the magazine just makes me want to beat my head against a wall. It is tremendously stupid. It reminds me of listening to young teenagers talk. It's just absolute nonsense. I hear my brain cells dying when I read this magazine. The snippets of information throughout the magazine are geared towards the ADHD set, who can't stay focused on one subject for more than 30 seconds. Don't expect any depth or details on any subject, and the things they choose to write about are \\"retarded\\". In short, Maxim is toxic bubblegum for the brain. It's like MacDonald's food. There's just no reason to consume it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes for Great Packing Material","review":"Certainly, this magazing will not make you smarter, but every once in a while there is a piece with some wit.

Finding something to read here isn't exactly easy, by the way. Most of the magazine is comprised of ads. On the other hand, it's these ads that make this magazine so cheap.

At first Ethan irked me and I just wanted him to get over it (his revenge). Then nearing the end Ethan was more understanding and responsible toward his family, and he grew on me. Then it was Grace who needed a good slap! She was too impulsive and ALWAYS running off and getting into the most absurd situations . . .Now, I like Kat Martin because she is simplistic (overly so, at times) and basically gives her readers plenty of sex (honesty from this reviewer). But, the woman needs a new editor! The writing contained tons of errors, the most glaring being that she does not capitalize titles for nobility. It should be the Earl of blah, blah! At one point Grace is called Lady Sharpe (her husband's last name, not his title), names are often mixed up and countless other errors occur that just added to my annoyance and made this novel unenjoyable.Not that it was completely horrible, but it seemed like a rough draft instead of the finished product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts well, but very dull second half","review":"Ethan, the British privateer (and earl) who yanks Lady Grace off another vessel in 1805, makes one very dashing hero -- as long as they're at sea. The relationship that develops despite his belief that Grace is the mistress of the traitor who sold information to the French -- information that led to Ethan's long, brutal imprisonment in France -- is spritely.But once they're back in England, it's as if these two lively characters never existed. He broods. She pines. He's hostile and distant, denying himself the physical relationship he had once enjoyed. She's bored. As are we. I also read The Bride's Necklace, the first book in this trilogy, but this is probably the last Kat Martin I will try."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil's Necklace","review":"Rather than give away the story or any particular parts, let me say this book stands alone well even though it's part of a trilogy.

With its dated language and pre-PC attitudes toward sex and gender roles, it portrays a simpler time. However, when it describes trading and the risks of falling in love with a position and believing that the market is \\"wrong\\", it is as topical as the internet bubble.While reading it, I couldn't help but compare it to Arthur Hailey novels like \\"Wheels\\" or \\"Airport\\", because this is the story of an industry told through the eyes of real people with their own foibles, loves, and idiosyncrasies. Laura Jadwin, nee Dearborn, tells most of the story. Her inner conflict between self-centered materialism and desire for \\"perfect\\" love forms the backdrop to the financial saga enmeshing her husband, Curtis. All in all, this is a good read but may move too slowly for some people--except for the climax of Jadwin's corner of the wheat market, which is as fast-paced as a Clancy novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"ooops!

Robert Peterson limits his teaching about hell to what he can find in the Bible, thus making his book a true divine revelation of hell. While all about us, those who claim the name of Christ are either denying its existence (universalism), or its eternality (annihilationism), Mr. Peterson sticks to his guns and gives a careful, exegetical defense of hell. Not since W. G. T. Shedd's \\"Doctrine of Endless Punishment\\" have I seen such a valuable addition to the literature on this subject. Besides his careful exegesis of the relevant Scriptures, Peterson also interacts with and refutes the writings of men such as Edward Fudge, John Stott, and Clark Pinnock. If you can only afford one book on hell, this is the one to buy. You will find it indispensable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tour de force which has little to do with Olson or his art","review":"The author belies a hostility towards his subject early on in the book by referring to him as \\"Charlie\\" as though he was the cop on \\"Bad Boys\\" who had caught the guy in the video who had obviously done something which gave him the right to speak condescendingly to him. In Clark's own mind Olson has become an unworthy father who he has to beat down. Wierd ! Totally misses the point of Olson's art which is that each page is different and a unique attempt at truth. Shows too how the Thruway West (oh Gunslinger) has obliterated belief in an actual earth of value. Which Olson's actual text does manage to keep alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"impossible to casually peruse, but invaluable to the serious","review":"This text has been and still is tremendously illuminating to me. Though I have read it as casual reading a couple times, I have found it most useful when digested a concept at a time. The explanations while thick are neccessarily so. Professor Cheng has throughly described each motion and it's application. A very complex task indeed. Each time I work out I pick a section of the book and try to refine that portion of the form. Each time I am amazed by Cheng Tzu's ability to turn a movement I have made thousands of times into something new and amazing. I highly recommend this text to any serious student of Tai Chi. I also warn any novice student that they should start with one of Cheng Man Ching's more elementary texts. This one is difficult to comprehend if aren't already familiar with Cheng Man Ching's style of Tai Chi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, the standard","review":"This book, the original written by Zheng Manqing (Cheng Man-Ch'ing), covers taijiquan (t'ai chi ch'uan), Chinese medicine, physics, philosophy, sensing hands (push hands), and practical self defense applications.Professor Zheng walks the reader through the 37 posture form from a self defense viewpoint, where people are attacking you from various directions using various techniques, and the postures, or slightly modified postures, in the form are the responses.It is a great mixing of wu (martial) and wen (literature) - highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brothers keeping the peace","review":"This book starts a whole new era of fantasy.

The humor is NOT, and the cliches are tedious. Sheridan is wasted as the wisecracking wife who laughs too much and too loudly.

That's what I expected: Not a great cinematic masterpiece, but 90 minutes of mindless entertainment. Unfortunately, this was not at all what I expected. The movie is about a guy with hallucinations and then goes berserk, killing people in a diner. This scene is a couple of minutes at the end of the film, and up until that point it's s a bad attempt at some kind of psychological thriller.Don't get fooled by the title, the plot description or the fact that this was written by an Oscar winning screenwriter.

There is no more lively sensation than that of pain; its impressions are certain and dependable. Marquis de Sade (1740-1814)What a riveting book! This is my first James W. Hall novel and it I loved it. His strong, bold, vivid characters, often border on the audacious and bizarre. In \\"Red Sky at Night\\" Hall pulls you into worlds of paralysis, paraplegics and pain. And as Marquis de Sade said \\"there is no more lively sensation than that of pain\\". The Key West setting combined with the madness, murders, mayhem and macabre characters, makes this book a top ratebeach read. Strongly Recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasue and Pain","review":"Although NOT for the faint of heart or squeamish this incredibly powerful and visceral thriller cements James W.Hall's place as one of the absolute best writers around. His ability to create incredibly complex characters and so throughly convey the trials they have to endure give so much emotional depth to his novels that simply classifying them as thrillers or mysteries does not do him justice. Combine this with his gift of being able to transport the reader to the point of actually feeling as if you are there in the Florida Keys and you have the makings of a great novel. My only warning would be don't start this book if you have other plans (you'll postpone them!) or want a good nights sleep. This book will stay with you long after you have finished the last page-enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and morbid","review":"I have been a fan of James W. Hall for quite some time, and of his main character, Thorn. I could not finish this book- the massacre of the dolphins, the sadistic and Nazilike \\"experiments\\" on the old men, and Thorn being at the mercy of the evil doctor, a childhood friend of Thorn's. This book was too sick, morbid and sadistic to qualify as your typical escapist thriller, and not well-written enough to qualify as top novel material. Take a pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"eminem","review":"Bears by Online Book Review Justin Botham Courage strength and stamina are just of a few traits of that the characters showed in the book that i read. The book that i read was about a kid, his brother and his dad and the went on a canoe trip up north to Canada. Before they left for Canada they had to pack food that was freeze dyed and and had to pack everything that they would ever need on the whole trip. They packed stuff like orange juice, meat, water, clothes and medical stuff. When they were canoeing they would have to go from portage to portage and when the water ran out they would have to backpack all of there gear to the next lake. One night there was a big storm and a tree fell down and landed on his dads and older brothers legs and this kid had to save his dad and brother in the middle of no where. If you would like to know what happens with this kid and his brother and dad i would suggest that you get the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Plains Invaders","review":"What can I say?

It is obvious that they haven't even researched the abandant resources of Albanian cooking.2) The translation is far from professional, making it difficult to read.3) The book is hard to follow because the instructions are vague, e.g. 1 package of x means nothing as a package can have various sizes.4) Having visited Albania numerous times, and having an appeciation for their delicious cooking, I find this book nowhere near an Albanian cook book; e.g. the apperitives list is incorrect, with nothing in the list being a real Albanian apperitive. Erroneous content consists throughout the text, mainly as a result of authors' lack of culinary knowledge (turkey stuffed with chestnuts - never heard in Albania!!!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"a classic example of mismeasurement due to category error","review":"This report represents a classic example of limited inquiry in academic pursuits by relentlessly ignoring category error (insufficient definitions) as challenged since the early '90s by Mandel (Businessweek 5/18/94) and others (Edupage 2/21/95).

The explanations are not clear.I bought Cormen's Book, and that one treats every subject with better form. The only reason I need this book is because my teacher directs us to exercises from this book, otherwise I would not use it for my class, as I can learn anything with more ease from Cormen's book.Recomendation: Buy Cormen's book instead of this one.

It did little to help me understand anything but general ideas. Reading this book is like reading a volume of mathematical proofs. The authors speak in symbols.What makes it much worse is that every page makes multiple references to other portions of the text that aren't on the facing pages.

But unfortunately the 3rd (current) edition is a major disappointment. On the positive side, the coverage of graph algorithms was expanded; on the negative side, is everything else! The explanations are consistently worse than in the second edition. The description and explanation of Quicksort is particularly bad, in fact it's so horrible it should be ripped out of the book and thrown away. About the only use the book now has is as a source of exercises for professors to assign to their students -- fortunately, the exercises are almost entirely the same as in the second edition and are still the best set in any algorithms text.I have only one thing to say to the author; if it ain't broke, don't fix it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"i took a computer algorithms class with the author of this book and i have to say it was possibly the worst class i have ever taken. The course was based heavily on the textbook (after all the professor was the author) and i found it extremely difficult to understand most of what was written in this book. The chapters are comprised of general, vague ideas that did not help in understanding the material unless i was probably a graduate student.

Always a cheap one until last year when my kids bought me the Cuisinart for my daily smoothies. My big complaint is that if the glass jar isn't seated just right the plastic drive blades at the base and on the jar spin the plastic right off! I returned one unit for replacement thinking it was simply defective. I was careful making sure the jar sat correctly but I continued to have flubs then recently stripped the blades in the base again. Based on what I've read others have had this problem with the Cuisinart and replacing the blades would be a bugger. I think I'll go back to my economy blenders."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE !","review":"This thing is an absolute piece of crap. The spout that pours the mix out manages to spill half of the contents. If you look at some of the better blenders the spout is shaped like a U so that it directs the blend. This thing just spill everything.I have a juicer, and I used this thing to blend in bananas and other stuff. When I tried to fill a glass with it most of the contents went in the sink. I have a 10 dollar blender that does as good of a job, and puts stuff in the glass. I just wonder if these people actually tested this product before unleashing it upon the public. I would NEVER recommend this thing to a friend... it is sitting in my trash right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap!!","review":"I purchased the Cuisinart SmartPower 600 watt blender (CB600SIL) from Costco and since it was my first Cuisinart purchase I expected nothing but the best. Over the course of about a month, a lot of crud started building up inside the metal parts of the top part of the processor. I was unable to get this crud out, and when I called to complain, Cuisinart sent me a new blender top. Yippee! I thought. Then one day about two months later it stopped working. Stopped completely. Doesn't even work at all. Doesn't even light up. I called Cuisinart and their attitude was, well, too bad. I feel completely traumatized. I have never purchased an item that stopped working so quickly after I purchased it. I cannot believe this big reputation company makes such a crappy piece of equipment and then has the nerve to sell it. I will never buy another Cuisinart item again."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap parts ruin this blender","review":"This blender has great power - which is why I bought it and the price was decent. The base (where the motor is) is nice and solid and metal cased. The glass jar is solid and huge. The part which I have BIG complaints about is the bottom part (which you screw the jar and blades into) This part is made of CHEAP THIN PLASTIC plus it is very very difficult to screw on tightly (to prevent leaks when blending) and even more difficult to unscrew once you finish use and want to clean it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Blender for Smoothies","review":"I've had this blender for a while now and I absolutely hate it. I use it almost exclusively for smoothies made of frozen fruit and juice (no ice); for smoothies it's a real problem. The blades stick all the time. It blends the bottom fruit without getting to the top. Worst of all, it DOES NOT POOR WITHOUT SPILLING. I have no idea how ANY company could design a blender without some kind of pouring lip. This product should be pulled from the market and redesigned. Don't be sucked in by the Cuisinart name. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buying Refurbished Was a Mistake","review":"I purchased this model refurbished from Amazon. When it arrived, there were scratches on the base. I would have thought the base would have been replaced during refurbishment, but oh well, I can live with that. From the first time I used this unit, there was an electric burning smell when running the motor for just a short period of time - I didn't put any major strains on this unit. I though maybe this smell was just normal when the motor was running, but it just died after about 4 months and 10 times of use. Also, the motor base is stainless steel as stated, but the handle and jar collar are just silver plastic. The jar collar can be difficult to remove when trying to access the blades for cleaning. When making smoothies, it did develop that annoying air pocket around the blades that keeps the contents from blending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase This!","review":"I would like to reiterate what several other reviewers have commented on. This blender was loud from the start and within a couple of months of daily smoothie-making, the motor started struggling and smoking. It turns out that the \\"smoke\\" was actually the smell of the cheap plastic cutting assembly, which ultimately melted down. This was the shortest-lived blender I have ever purchased, though certainly not the cheapest. Like many others, I assumed the Cuisinart brand name was linked to quality. I won't make that mistake again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoked and died after 6 months","review":"We loved this blender and was very handy. Unfortunatly, after 6 months it smoked and died.

The first one I exchanged under warranty but now that this second one is having the same problem and it is outside of the warranty, I WILL NOT be buying another one of these.The second complaint I have is that pouring anything out of this blender is a disaster. It is pretty much a guarantee that you will spill it all over. This one product makes me not want to buy Cuisinart products ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but that's where it ends...","review":"We just re-did our kitchen and went with all stainless steel so I bought this blender because it looks so good. But it's not very good as a blender. Our old, cheap, drugstore blender did much better.I have to leave it on about 4 to 5 times longer than the old one and there are still chunks of stuff. And I'm talking bananas, not ice. Then when you wash it the bottom of the glass part is a huge cup when turned upside down in the washer. As a result it fills up with filthy water until you take it out and empty it. Also the handle will fill with water and it s l o w l y empties while the machine is running and soaks the counter top. I will not buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Udo keeps rocking!","review":"Accept was one of the greats of metal when metal was king in the 80's. Frontman Udo Dirkschneider has continued to deliver the goods since Accept left the music scene in 1987. If you like U.D.O., you will like Masrecutor. Herr Dirkschneider plays the same style of pre-grunge driving metal which he has always done. As always, he manages to assemble a talented crew to back up his trademark vocals. Some might find this sort of thing formulaic but if it ain't broke, don't fix it!

It refers to anarchism that had not been imported from elsewhere.) This gives a good summary of several different anarchist traditions in America, starting with antinomianism among colonials and later religious non-resistants, up to the anarcho-individualists like Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner. The last chapter compares them with the imported anarcho-communism of Emma Goldman etc. The book is short and treatment is often summary, but it makes a good introductory guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aimez Moi - so subtle","review":"A bright, soft, golden scent; rich, but not overpowering.

Little House in the Graveyard?","review":"If you're fond of pioneer stories, be warned. This is not \\"Little House on the Prairie.\\" In fact it's not a pioneer story at all, but a book about death, dying, the agony of grief, the bittersweet comfort of memories, and the importance of family ties. Given most publishers' current mania for hitting kids between the eyes with mature issues, they've succeeded here. Perhaps one day they'll again realize that kids want to escape reality with excitement, mystery, and adventure, not be bombarded with mature themes, or complex social issues. Espeically irritating were the jumps between modern and olden times so frequently that the reader was never drawn into either period. No sense of atmosphere was evident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"This book is an excellent resource both for the student first coming to Rawls and the experience philosopher who wants to know more about his theory.

It can be an excellent deck for both those who are analytical and those who just prefer to let the imagery spark their imagination and intuition.The only criticism that I have about this deck is that I question the claim to Celtic nature. In fact, the only thing that definitely touched on Celtica was the use of the Triskele drawn into some of the cards.Overall, a definite buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Celtic Dragon Tarot","review":"I've never seen a deck as responsive as this one.

And if that reviewer had read the book completely, maybe they would understand this IS NOT a Tarot deck based off of christian beliefs. There is nothing christan about this tarot deck at all! therefore, no devil card, and a few others. These cards have really been accurate for me. I recommend them for any Dragon Path follower who wishes to further their connection with Dragon-kind. They really will help you gain a more benefical connection. Not recommended for narrow minded people."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANCIENT KNOWLEDGE HAS RISEN","review":"I am sixteen years old, and I have been reading the Tarot for three years. This deck is very special, and you can feel it the first time you hold it.I can honestly say this is a very attractive deck. Each card is beautifully illustrated and acts as a doorway to the untapped potential of the Tarot.The book that comes along with the deck is very informative, and gives a few lessons on candle magick, and how to tap into the vast knowledge of these astral enigmas that are thought of by many as fairy tale creatures. It includes step by step instructions, candle color properties, and a list of stones to add a bit more \\"magick\\" to the spells and readings. It deserves five stars.I strongly believe that you shouldn't order decks. Search for your own special and personal deck. Try to feel for it, and it will call and draw you in. This is just something that I believe everyone that wants a Tarot deck should know. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk aobut a Great Deck!","review":"Goodness, the Crowly Deck is my ultimate favorite, but now the Celtic Dragon deck ranks pretty near. Talk about amazing illustrations and the meanings are pretty clear as well. The book helps a lot. Although I wish it could go into more detail like the Crowley handbook, I am still more than satisfied with this deck and its explanations. I have been using it for about 2-3 weeks now, and it has yet to give me a wrong reading. Its terrific. Also, I don't reccommend to begginners of tarot. Thogh this deck is great, you should have a bit more experiance. But, if you already own this deck, than my suggestion is to research tarot in general. It might help you get a better feel. Any questions, feel free to email me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jupiter's rings??","review":"Having an affinity for dragons and all things Celtic, I thought this deck would resonate with me, but it didn't. The colors are too washed out, her descriptions are different from those of other decks, sometimes seeming contradictory, and it drove me nuts that she kept referring to \\"Jupiter's rings\\" - it's SATURN that has rings, not Jupiter. She just lost credibility with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bunch Of Junk","review":"I really hate this deck, it's an insult to dragons everwere. For One she knows nothing about dragons and seems to have this fantasy notion that dragons are like herself; feminists and believe all men should dress in little skirts. I'm frankly sick of D.J.

My very first reading with this deck scared me silly! But it was very accurate and for the first time I felt that I was \\"intune\\" with the cards. If you are a dragon lover then this is the deck for you! After purchasing and using this deck I've found that some of my other decks are starting to \\"talk\\" to me.

The backs are poorly designed and make it easy to tell when one card is reversed and when it is not when face down; and the book itself offers no meaning to a reversed card. This cuts out fully half of the meanings of the cards and how they are to be read.If you are looking for a beautiful deck, then this is most certainly it- but if you want an actual divination deck, it's suggested you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"this deck is exactly what i was looking for. and its energies are way more potient than any other deck ive had the oppertunity of having a look at by far. 5 stars.

It tells you what your training will probably be, and gives you tips on how to do some physical training, with alot more information on other things.

If you like the \\"Contemporary\\" look, you'll like this desk. It took a few hours to put together, but it's pretty straight forward. The only complaint I would have is that the spot for a printer is fine for a small or even medium-sized printer, its not designed to handle a big printer (I have a fairly large 4 function printer). Between the weight of the printer and the inadequate support (for that much weight - 35-40 lbs), I wont put my printer on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice desk","review":"I received this desk yesterday and so far I am quite content with it. Assembly was pretty easy and intuitive. The parts even had stickers with numbers on them to really make it easy for dummies like me.

The new capacitative touch cap is exactly what this svelte little writer needed. It's so thin for a tri-function pen. People are usually really surprised when I switch colors since it's thinner than some single-function pens.This is actually my second Tech3 pen and I noticed Cross changed the spinning mechanism in the pen. It feels more solid (it was already very smooth), but it will only turn in one direction now. This kind of annoyed me because I used to keep it centered between black ink and mechanical pencil and go back and forth between the two. This new mechanism will allow me to extend one tip and retract it again, but if I want to switch, I can only progress forward to the next color, but not back. A minor inconvenience (and probably more of a convenience if you're not like me and don't memorize the order/positions of tips) on an otherwise flawless product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Multi-function Pen with Great Balance and Feel","review":"The multi-function abilities of this pen is what originally caught my eye in the office supply store.I purchased this on pen Amazon over 2 years ago and still use this pen every day.I use off brand refills as they are cheaper and can be found in colors other than red and black.In terms of the balance and feel of this pen I couldn't ask for a better design.I am knocking off one star because the eraser cap (or just the chrome part) can easily be lost and the pencil mechanism can only hold a few pieces of graphite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great feel","review":"Love the multifunction of the pen.

So when I was in the market for a new pen I naturally viewed what Cross had to offer and was not disappointed. The Tech3+ is a lightweight pen for the multitasker on the go. The ease to go between pen to red pen to the stylus on the top of the pen make it easy for me to be able to go from my Nexus 7 to paperwork to spreadsheet audits with relative ease. The smooth black finish also makes the pen rather stylish in my opinion. Access to low cost, standardized Cross refills also makes the life of the pen far more cost effective in the long run. I will definitely be recommending this pen to coworkers and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Pen, Terrible Writing","review":"The pen has great weight and functionality.

The pen portion does everything well; red, black, pencil. It feels excellent in your hand and is solidly built.

This one is my favorite so far since I can not only take notes with ink or pencil, I can redline documents as well. It is well constructed like other Cross pens, and with a modicum of care it should last you for years. It is easy to operate with a twist you go between black ink, red ink, and pencil mode. For those features I think it is reasonably priced and I recommend it for anyone that uses black ink, red ink, and pencils to write on a regular basis. A nice Valentine gift for men or women. Be sure to put it back in your pocket because everyone likes this kind of pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close, but no cigar","review":"A handsome pen with three tip options, pretty easy to grip, does a valiant if ultimately hopeless job of making my nerdiness a bit more covert. I believe this pen is made for Cross by Yasutomo and Yasutomo has lots of experience with this type of multipoint mechanism. However, this particular version of the mechanism is largely plastic and suffers for it in durability. The first one of these pens I owned seized up after about a year and attempts to lubricate it (with WD40) actually seemed to worsen (partially dissolve the plastic?) seizure. These make nice gifts for people who tend to lose pens within a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my needs","review":"I used to carry different pens and pencils in my planner, making it very bulky.

Since the very first day, I am very comfortable with it an any situation. It is true that you cannot feel it as solid as an only ballpoint or mechanical pencil, but quality in general is fine. All metal and good mechanism. I don't think it will be broken in few time.Be careful refilling pencil leads not to break them. It would be helpful if you can take out the one you are using by pushing the button until you can pull it and then, dessasembly the pen to fill others.Balance is perfect in the middle!

The feel is solid and has the perfect balanced weight. The continuous spinning is a great feature too.

Well, I recently sent 2 of these pens back to Cross for repair. They aharged me $10 per each pen, and what I got is JUNK. They were not repaired, they hardly work, the rotating mechanism does not work, it is a complete lie that they are guaranteed.

I enjoyed reading this book. Ann does a great job of portraying lower-class life in the 40s to the reader. The emotions of the characters in the book soon became mine. Ann uses a lot of details and flashbacks. At times they can be a little confusing, but they are generally helpful to describe what the characters are feeling. One thing I didn't like about the book is that it ends a little too abruptly. Otherwise this book is a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Street","review":"I enjoyed reading The Street. It allowed me to see through the eyes of a struggling african american. It provided a way to see and understand more clearly some reasons for racial divisions. The ending of the book was also a surprise. Its sudden twist with no happy ending reminded me somewhat of the ending of the novel Of Mice and Men."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book to put you to sleep","review":"This book is about an African American mother and her struggles to fight poverty while raising her eight year old son. The book starts out slow and continues this way. Although the author picks up the pace of the book in a few places these are few and far between. The book as a whole brings a good message but is so riddled with over detailed flashbacks and descriptions of characters and settings that this message is hard to follow and is sometimes lost in the detail. If you want to read this book do it while consuming large amounts of coffee or while you have a case of insomnia it's the only way you will get more that a few pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranoid","review":"This book is for the paranoid. This book of eighteen chapters had a one main theme. Everyone was out to get her. She was ruined because a man couldn't have her. She missed her big break because the a man wanted her. There where some other topics. They lead back to men wanting her. The final chapter was aburpt but expected.The are many redeeming quality of this book. She explained economic and racial conditions at this time of history. The book was full of vivid imagiary and indepth charchaters. The novel dicated a chapter to each person, or family. This made the reasoning for the ending clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Wordy","review":"This book gives deep insight to the lives of Afro-American people in the 1940's. Ann Petry went into a lot of depth on the reasons for the actions of the main character, however I thought that she went into too much detail when describing most situations, while other points were not described so that the reader can understand the main character's actions. At times, she would go into so much explanation that the reader would lose track of what is happening in the book. She used flashbacks to help explain the main character's thoughts, but in doing this, she lost the reader. The flashbacks are helpful in explaining, but are a little excessive. Yet other information, such as the influence that the grandmother and father, is not explained to the reader until later in the book. The main plot of the book did make the reader understand what it was like to live in the 1940's, but it could have been done with much less explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"me in my sad story","review":"This book was a long winded tail. That documents the life struggles of a poor colored woman. The story was overly dramatic and I felt no real connection between myself and charactors in the book. The book is so slow and excedingly discriptive, that you can read ten pages and get nowhere. A positive aspects of this book are found in the under lying story. A story of a white upper class family, that shows not only do the poor struggle in life but we all do at times. This portion of the story helps to give a little more valitety and balance, in that it give you a look at both sides of life. I do think that petry's story was heart felt and meaningful to her but it has no real appeal to those who don't want to be depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate this book","review":"i didn't like this novel for two reasons: primarily it is incredibly overdramatic and secondarily, it's basically 400 pages of whining about being poor. i feel that the use of flowery language has covered up a very poorly thought out book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down.","review":"I can't believe the amount of time wasted on reading this book. It ended terribly. The whole time I'm thinking she'll get out of the street, but no in an abrupt end the author turns her into a murderer who deserts her child. Yes, it does a good job of explaining the way the world looked from the Black point of view... but I don't think anyone would want to be represented by the main character. I am so disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"About a year ago, I was given this novel as a gift. My busy work and life schedules prohibited me from reading it until a few days ago. Once I picked it up, I could not put it down. What a wonderfully written story. This novel is a must read. I am still devastated and heart broken over the ending but a story doesn't have to have a happy ending in order to be good. Ms. Petry writes such vivid and colorful descriptions. The picture she paints educates the reader to the reality of life in the 1940's for black people. This one will touch your heart and soul. You will cry and ask yourself repeatedly if Lutie and Bub will ever be able to leave 'The Street'. I strongly recommend giving this one as a gift to someone you know. I know I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"old classic","review":"The street is about a young woman trying way out, for her and her son.

Living as a single mother with a young son, Lutie strives to give herself a better life by moving to the street. Her daily struggles and the people in her life show what the street has to offer. The book gets off to a slow start, but soon the characters emerge and the book is hard to put down. The use of imagery and vivid detail allows you to feel as if you live on the street too. This book gives you a better understanding of life and how things aren't always fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing, but good","review":"I thought that this book was really well written. The great description that the author goes into made me feel like I knew the characters personally and wasn't just reading about them. By the end of the book, I knew the characters so well that I felt could accurately predict how they would react to the given situations they faced in the book. Whether it was Lutie or Mr. Jones, I almost knew what their actions were going to be before I read them. That understanding of the characters helped me get into the book and keep me interested in every page. The book is quite depressing at times but that is necessary to express the ideas of the story. What Lutie faced everyday in the story is what a lot of people face in real life. It was the truth and reality of the book that appealed to me and is also why I would highly recommend this book to all of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review Of The Street","review":"The Street, by Ann Petry, is a worth-while read. While reading The Street, you are able to view the surroundings around the main character, Lutie Johnson, through not only her thoughts, but also those of other characters. The street is a character in itself, in this story. It is to blame for all of the problems experienced by the people that reside in the buildings that line its sides. Problems that range from lack of money, to sexual frustrations, to utter lonliness, all of which are lined with the feeling of total hopelessness. Most of these problems revolve around the main character, Lutie Johnson, in some way. She has been forced to move to this street, because she has no money, her husband is cheating, everyone believes she is compiled of every stereotype that exists, and her son needs a better place to be. You feel for the poor lady as hope after hope and dream after dream are shattered as each day goes by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"Though I approached this book with some trepidation, thinking I would have nothing in common with its characters, my fears were allayed after a few pages. Petry's insight into the psyche of her characters creates a haunting picture, for her characters often reflect aspects of everyone's personality at one time, from the crazed manics to the stoic and determined. Even the street itself, personified here, becomes a timeless reminder of the darkness within the human soul. The plotline and literary devices employed by Petry are effective, drawing us deeper with each page into her own reality, which, though fictional, seems entirely plausible given the depth of her insight and detail. The story of one woman's struggle to better herself despite enormous odds and her subsequent end remind us never to take our lives for granted, and to appreciate the struggles of those that came before."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review of The Street","review":"The Steet by Ann Petry is an emotionaly powerful book that was much ahead of its time. Her writing is in a sort of vernacular style, but with very vivid descriptions. Though worded relatively simply, Petry is able to describe details in a way as to give the reader a constant mental image and understanding of all of the story's events. She effectively engages the reader by shifting the perspective to include the feelings of all the main characters. This book was ahead of its time in that Petry is able to describe in great detail the power that situational factors have on different people. This is something of an accomplishment considering that social psychology was, at the time that this book was written, a new science. Overall, this novel is a timeless classic that should be enjoyed for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Street - Ann Petry","review":"The story is a naturalist view of Harlem during the 2nd world war.

Learning about the lifestyle of inner city people back in the 1940's was very intriging. From the casino lifestyle, to a rich family, and back to life on \\"the street\\", this book never lost my attention. As you read this book, you travel through the minds of three people who are all caught in some predicament or another. it is interesting to see how it all turns out in the end.

Endings are not always happy, and this book did not have a happy ending, but too many African-American women do not have a happy ending to what is supposed to be the perfect family, the perfect situation, the satisfying life. I was just a teenager when I read first this book as a requirement for my English class, and I vowed to own it. Anyone interested in the struggle of Black women in recent and current American society should read this book. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realism at its best!","review":"This work gripped me from the get go in a way that only a few other novels, such as \\"crime and punishment,\\" have. Each time I picked it up I was astounded by the clarity and energy of Petry's writing, and found myself wondering why I had not discovered her work before. That other reviewers have found it difficult to follow the plot reflects in no way on Petry's prose. There are a few lengthy flashbacks which are integral to the books insights into urban culture. I did not find that these detracted from the story, as they were as key to the development of the plot line.\\"The Street\\" is a great piece of fiction, that should be much more widely read. Petry makes a number of sociological observations that reach beyond the time of \\"the street,\\" and remain disappointingly relevant today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, although a coupla very famous and popular sketches were omitted from this collection","review":"Not a bad compilation, even though the opera singer sketch and a coupla other oft-played sketches were somehow omitted.

Barry Lawrence's book far surpasses the existing biographies out there because of his tireless efforts to get to the truth and squash the rumors. In this biography, River's story is told by his friends, family members, co-workers and there are even some touching rememberances from people who only met him once. River had his flaws, as we all do. However Mr. Lawrence's book brings out all the elements to River's personality, not in a gossipy, tabloid way , but in a respectful, insightful way. The reader gets a good sense about who River was from those who knew him. I applaud Barry Lawrence's thorough research and his dedication to honoring River's memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishingly In-Depth","review":"In Search of River Phoenix: The Truth Behind the Myth really is an amazing tribute to the memory of River Phoenix. That's not to say that this book is a one sided look at River's life through rose-tinted glasses. It certainly isn't. Barry Lawrence is not afraid to examine and dissect the controversial aspects of the young actor's life. However the book never strays across the other side of the line into sensationalism.The level of research, time and dedication of the subject matter is obvious throughout this astonishing book and bring to life the unusual world in which Joaquin Phoenix's big brother inhabited.This might well be not only the most interesting and factual biography on River Phoenix but possibly one of the most meticulous biographies ever written about anyone!Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Some things about this book seem off to me. It has to do with the way the book is written, the way it quotes other books, and the way it presents certain facts. You will find typos and some factual mistakes throughout the book, too. Plus, it devotes pages and pages to quoting fans' \\"supernatural\\" experiences with River.I'm someone who is in fact actually open to the supernatural, but this is not what I was expecting to find here, and most of the testimonies presented sounded plain weird and out of place. I felt second hand embarrassment at moments. Stories from random teens who think River's ghost came to see them is not the kind of thing I would expect to see in a biography.Still, I wouldn't say it's an awful book. There are some things that are interesting about it. But it's not revolutionary, it's weird in a not so good way, and out of all the books on River that I've read, it's far from being my favourite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth Appears To Be Elusive","review":"The \\"truth\\" that unfolds in this book is nothing more than propaganda (from family and friends) masquerading as truth. After reading this you would think River was a Sage or even a Saint. Drugs destroyed his life; not Hollywood. There are many sensitive souls in Hollywood who manage quite well without polluting and killing them selves with a lethal cocktail of illict drugs. Sad thing is Generation X doesn't want to take any accountability for their poor decisions. Everybody else is at fault.River Phoenix's brother (Joaquin) who had the same whacked out parents and unstable childhood hasn't destroyed his life with drug addiction. The fact is when you make bad choices you have no one to blame but yourself. The guy had it all and he blew it...big time. In the end he deceived quite a few people; including himself. Like Icarus he flew too high and plunged to his death. Another life annihilated by Hubris..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of River","review":"Few books begin their journey to publication with the foundations of Barry C. Lawrence's IN SEARCH OF RIVER PHOENIX: THE TRUTH BEYOND THE MYTH? with a dream out of nowhere? yet a powerful dream in which the dead actor River Phoenix asked Lawrence to discover the truth about his life led to a years-long,in-depth probe of River's short life and many films: a probe which was to involve Lawrence with River's closest friends, family members, and fellow actors. You don't have to be a River fan to appreciate IN SEARCH OF RIVER PHOENIX: it reads like a novel, with all the drama, action, and yes, even intrigue . Lawrence's goal was to dispel the veil of myths surrounding River's short life, and reveal the realities and facts of his controversial short life and career--and Lawrence achieves this and more in an exciting blend of drama and documentary: classic docu-drama translated to print. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"He was a HUMAN BEING!","review":"I'm glad I purchased this book- I held off for a long time because I did think it was a bit pricey but after reading it I'm glad I did.

There are many surprises about River's life especially concerning his very unusual childhood in South America, Florida and numerous other locations. Especially the troubling stories about the family's religious background and the consequences that had on River. River Phoenix was not the standard Hollywood movie star with a background anywhere near normal. He had many personal values that he followed, values that he was forced in some cases to abandon and thereby compromise his own personal integrity. I think \\"in search of River Phoenix\\" gives the reader a very good impression of this. I would definitely recommend the book to everyone who are fans of River Phoenix. But also to people who want to know more of the dark side of Hollywood, and the horrible consequences stardom can have on young actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE PERFUME, TRADITIONAL","review":"This is an excellent perfume.

My brother had asthma when he was younger so he is very finicky when it comes to perfumes. The scent is easy on the nose (I'm a girl) and not overpowering like some men's perfumes are. The only thing that confused me at first was that several sites did not list the perfume as Hugo by Hugo Boss. Instead it was listed as Hugo Boss period. There are two divisions - Hugo and Boss - so it is very important to separate the two. Anyway, I would buy from this seller again.

Even though her marriage was more or less over, AND her hubby was having an affair of his own, that didn't make her decision to commit adultery a right one. Because of that, I couldn't cheer Deanna and Ben on; all the characters, in my opinion, should have ended up alone. \\"Summer's End\\" is a quick read, but only mediocre at best; old-fashioned romantic types like myself won't appreciate the adultery angle, and those who value good grammatical skills will wince while reading this book, as Steel apparently doesn't make good use of a proof-reader and/or editor.

I'm surprised that this one wasn't made into a TV-Movie (i.e. Once in a Lifetime, The Ring, No Greater Love, Fine Things), but I still liked it. Deanna was very realistic. She was in a marriage that was slowly falling apart, and the only thing that was keeping it together was her daughter, Pilar, who died as a result of a motorcycle accident. She met Ben Thompson and found fullfillment with him; Marc-Edouard was already having an affair with a woman named Chantal. I thought that he was a jerk for doing that to Deanna. But when it was all said and done and when I finished reading the book, Deanna had discovered that she was pregnant and that the baby was Ben's. At last she could have a happy life with someone. Keep up the good work, Danielle!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First Track NOT Original","review":"The first track: Alternating Bit, it COMPLETELY taken from a track from the movie TRON, composed by Wendy Carlos.

Manifest Destiny follows the adventures of a young Theodore Roosevelt in the Dakota Badlands as seen through the eyes of the local inhabitants. Sometimes a geek, sometimes a genuis, but always tough, the future President is a far cry from the Rough Rider throughout most of this book. An immature, rather spoiled, sickly young Eastern dude matures into manhood after losing his first wife, his mother and political battles. The book chronicles TR's Dakota Badlands trips and the differences the locals notice in him each trip. The book is written as novel (and compares favorably with L'Amour for you Western fans) and is an excellent read.

I think that this film should be the staple of every \\"INDIE FILM BUFF'S\\" library, with it's undercurrents of existentialistic philosophical squabblings, Rousseaunistic Individualism expressed in a cunning Boroque style, and DALI SURREALISM ETCHED FOREVER INTO THE PALLET OF MY MIND'S EYE.

Some themes that were brought up in the movie were family, quincea?era, and immigration. What I liked about the movie was the social events because it showed events that may show up in real life. My favorite part of the movie was when Marta's cousin stepped on her foot.What I didn't like about the movie was the acting because it was too dramatic.

The movie dealt with illegal immigration. I disliked this movie because it gives soft feelings to illegals by baseing the story of an illegal family trying to deal with their problems while other illegals are doing the same and gettting away with it. My favorite part was when the town tightened on immigration patrol. It was my favorite part because justice was served plus, I dont like illegals because my whole family came to the United States LEGALLY. Plus this family didn't have any working papers to let the U.S know that they were working here, even if they wanted amnisty \\"forgiveness\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching yet interesting","review":"I watched this movie because, it was part or our curriculum called quinceanera in our Spanish class. The three major themes were that Marta helps her dad a lot, there is strong trust, and there is loyalty in family. I liked the actors because, they were really good and they were very serious in their acting or their part. My favorite part in the movie was when Marta's youngest brother said, who is Richard stand in the pledge of allegiance but it was for which it stands. I think everything was good in the movie. I would recommend this movie for people who aren't from the U.S. and could get deported if they don't have real forms that are illegal so get real forms.reviewed by: Mo Sal"},{"rating":"1","title":"Which way to believability?","review":"The aliens in this book are not the problem. The problem is the human interactions with each other, and the simplistic and unbelievable reactions to events that unfold. Shallow human characters defeat the high potential the premise had. It's hard to believe most of what occurs. Without being able to buy into the story, I simply had no interest in what happened. A forgettable book. Even allowing that it is fictional, credibility is stretched too far. The \\"aliens\\" were more convincing than the humans, who are unfortunately necessary to the story. I don't see the basis for the praise this book gets, though I have enjoyed other books by Simak."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Childish Exercise in Wish-Fulfillment","review":"Way Station is long-winded and silly to the point of being embarrassingly childish. Simak piles on coincidence after coincidence and wonder after wonder until you are infuriated at the degree of credulousness he expects from the reader. His narration is ponderous and repetitious, and he feels a need to explain the obvious--often more than once. He and his editor appear to have a problem with subject-verb agreement. As a fifty-year lover of science fiction, I am amazed that this book won the Hugo Award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it!","review":"Do you like thought provoking sci-fi with interesting, innovative plots that are relevant to life's many questions, a fast paced plot, and well fleshed out characters?

Its beauty lies within the subtlety of the ideas and and simple humanity found throughout. I have read and reread this book over the years, and each time the story seems to change in my perception.

(if you can find a copy)","review":"Possibly the finest SF novel---ever! My brother and I have dicussed this book many times. This, with todays technology, would be great to see on the big screen. Not for it's special effects, they would be secondary, but for the story. It is such a shame this book is out of print because so many Sci-Fi fans are being deprived, unless they are lucky enough to have someone tell them about it, of a true masterpiece of science fiction. Simak peaks your interest from the very start, then puts you on an emotional roller coaster that really never ends. This book is clever, exciting, thought-provoking, and most of all, fun! I actually have a hardback(stays on the shelf) and two paperback copies. The first one is so worn, I retired it and the other one will soon gain the same status. What does this tell you? Find a copy (more than one if possible) and experience one of the greatest Sci-Fi books ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful SF","review":"Clifford Simak was a newspaper writer who also wrote SF. His profession was obvious in the way he always grabbed your attention with the first few sentences. The Way Station is probably his finest novel. It shows a deeper level of character development and empathy than is customary in most SF. The story is about a man living in isolation on his home planet Earth, while maintaining a way station for citizens of the galaxy, unknown to earthlings. The loneliness of this portrayed brilliantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total and utter garbage!","review":"The author of this book should really be sued under the Trades Descriptions Act for hyping an end product that is incomplete, inaccurate, and utterly fails to fulfill the objective outlined in the blurb.I was wanting to look at how Flash MX hooks to servlets and was looking forward to getting an understanding of this by examining the client-side and server-side code but guess what? The source code isn't on the CD! Even though the availability of the source code is much trumpeted in the pages of the book and on its cover.Absolutely disgraceful.

I have read over 20 Flash books in my day and consider myself an advanced Flash user but I couldn't make heads or tails of what to do with this book. Basically, it forces you to type out code without explanation and when you are finished, it never works. Don't bother with this waste of time and money.

I was literally excited when I first started readingthe material, only to drift further away from the previous, afew pages in. Basically, I became more and more frustrated as Icontinued reading. Why? Well just check the other reviews aboutthis book. You have about 30% who are saying it's a great bookand 70% stating that the book is filled with errors and missingfiles. I just wonder where the 30% came from and if theyactually purchased and tried to use this book.I'll put it to you like this.

With ActionScript layer(This is where the whole chapter goes downhill). The figures such as 2.1, 2.3 don't match with what is going on in the steps. The steps don't match what is on the CD.

VERY HARD TO READ. I'm an intermediate actionscript programmer and hard a hard time following a good bit of her code and then the explanations aren't even worth talking about. It also is very out of date now that 2004 is out, whereas the really good flash programming books are still useful. peace out-"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it zero stars I would","review":"I can only believe that those who gave this book more than 2 stars either know the author or work for the publishing company.

It's so bad that I felt compelled to review it still for those who may find it on another site.

I am not sure if it is for advanced user either. Step-by-step instructions are not exactly clear. Author never really explain why she do thing the way she does. So, I alway feel like I am blindly following her instructions. The worst part is that she put the instructions on one page and then put the samples of Actionscript on 3 pages later. So, I always have to flip the page back and forward. VERY VERY irritating! I am often too lazy to write a book review, but this book is just so bad that I have to write my first one. I STRONGLY suggest people NOT to buy this book. You probably will learn more by going to the Macromedia Flash developer site than spending [money] on this truly badly organized book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, Badly written","review":"I am in Chapter 3 now and the frustration goes on. First of all, I have to spend half of my day installing the supporting database and java class files that needed for the backend part of the book, which I have to download from the website since it is missing in the CDRom. And that I have to manually install since the auto-installer program doesn't work on my machine. Inconsistent labelling of components as you go through the chapters, which makes it confusing. Images of how your work would look like after several steps of instructions don't agree.The way it is written right now, you would not get the optimum benefits from it, as it confuses you, which is too bad because it is one of those few Flash books that focused on Web Application development.It badly needs a re-write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I just started following through the step by step instructions in this book, which begin in chapter 2. The first two pages instruct you to start with a base \\"fla\\", then give you 14 steps to follow. A snapshot of the timeline is presented in the book as what it should look like at the end of the steps. If you follow the steps, your timeline will greatly differ from the image in the book, and from the \\"finished\\" timeline on the CD. One or two differences on the first set of instructions would be bad enough, but I stopped counting at 11. It's a shame - this type of book is just what I needed, but now I'm reluctant to continue. I would be embarrassed if I were the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept - poor delivery","review":"Thankfully, the publishers fulfilled their end and supplied the missing .java files. Too bad the author didn't take the same initiative. Almost a year later, the books' 'support site' consists of the same message, 'coming very, very soon'.

The format and layout of the book is well thoughout with plenty of easy to read screen shots, code samples and notes. More importantly the projects are detailed step by step and the author does a great job of showing you the reasons why things are done so you always understand the big picture of the projects.If you are looking at extending your Flash skills to more advanced development this book is a MUST HAVE. However if you are mainly focusing your skills on UI development and asthetics I would still strongly recommend this book so you can better understand the complex process of application development and working on large projects.To the author: Great Job!

I was impressed by it though some of it went over my head. No I am even more impressed by how credible the world building is. There are plenty of humorous elements like the fake articles by the likes of Tom Wolfe and Hunter S Thompson.Most of this book is concerned with world building and setting the scene for further volumes. Compared to actual comics it is much more realistic and consistent.Virtually all of the stories work though some especially towards the end of the book are a little prosaic.I really enjoyed it and for once the reality was better than the memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Highly recommend for fans of sci fi and comics.

You want to dupe people into buying a 23 year old book in eBook form for more than the original paperback book? $9.99 is outrageous for any book that is already in paperback and even more outrageous for a 23 year old book? How many trees did you use to publish the electronic bits? Zero. How many man hours did it require to convers to Kindle format? Zero since the computer converted it once and you were done. This is nothing but greed in my opinion. And for the rest of you folks who try and comment on my comment because it is not about the story, get lost. You are all feeding the Greed Machine if you buy the electronic copy of this book for $9.99 in my opinion and I don't care about your remarks.

Great read overall though."},{"rating":"2","title":"One big, essential prologue","review":"Wild Cards is a great series. This, of course, is not by far the best book in the series; as it mainly serves as a 400 page introduction; but for such an involved and sprawling saga, perhaps such a thing was necessary. The huge back story had to be chronicled, and there was little other way to introduce such a large gallery of significant characters other than to devote chapters to each without getting into a consecutive story. Even so, this book sets certain events in motion that DO eventually put it into the bigger picture and link this with the two following books as somewhat of a trilogy. Overall, very well written, great characters, and Martin edits it exquisitely; making this shared, multi-author book seem like it was all done by one person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Good","review":"I really enjoyed most of the stories, but as some people said some are better than others. The Lewis Shiner one especially bugged me, it didn't seem like it was written in the same world as the rest. It was annoying to be reading about people affected by the virus for 200 pages, then all of a sudden there's demonic possession and witchcraft. On top of that I just don't think Lewis Shiner is very good, his story was confusing and just not very interesting. I hope he doesn't contribute to the rest of series much. if he does I will probably skip his chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping This Pays Out","review":"The Good:Well written. A consistent world, and a consistent feel, even though the vignettes are by different people. Imaginative. Makes you wonder what life could be like if you drew an ace. Makes you glad if you haven't drawn a joker.The Bad:It reminds me of a series of Alfred Hitchcock or Rod Serling stories. That in itself isn't bad. But as the collection appears to be something of an intro into the world. All the characters are central characters, and because they all stand out, none of them do. This is most of the reason for only two stars. I couldn't invest into any one character, because all the stories are about different people. In a way, it reminded me of a soap opera. Too many connections to invest in.The Nice:I found myself identifying with Jet Boy most, which I guess is reasonable, because he was simply talented, not genetically altered.Anyway, I'll put V II on my list, but it won't be on my urgent list, if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't love it...","review":"This book started out ok, but the middle and end were very disappointing. I never found the love story to be very believable, nor the decisions made by Miranda. I couldn't see the relationship of the two main characters lasting. They were so different in every way, with no shared views, and they didn't even really seem to be in love! The ending was totally illogical. I would have given one star but I did enjoy the beginning of the book so I gave two instead.... plus at least it wasn't boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a super book!!!!!!","review":"Not only is this a romantic story, but it is also a thrilling plot.

The characters were not realistic. Miranda was headstrong to the point of stupidity, and Shadow Walker wants revenge against the white people and that's about it. These two did not make a good couple at all. They came from two entirely different worlds. I found it impossible that they could ever have a chance of living happily ever after. Their love just wasn't realistic at all. The ending was abrupt and poorly developed. I loved the rest of the series, but this one was a huge dissapointment.

I am not a cook, and was looking for something relatively easy to understand. Things that I normally eat made over in a low fat or fat free form. Most of the recipes in this book I have never heard of. I would NOT recommend this book for those somewhat finicky eaters out there. If you do choose to order this book order a dictionary of cooking terms to go with. The other thing I did not like about this book was the first half (almost) of the book that preceded the recipes contained advice and information on dieting that was very controversial and was NOT recommended by several health magazines. With all the organizations out there trying to sell you on their diet plan, this was all I needed to find out a cookbook was throwing advice out too!

The best clip is set in the late 1960s and deals with how the board of educatoin in New York tried to bring different types of children together dispite their cultural differences and the many types of immigrant famililes they came from. The othet ourstanding clip gives you a history of NBC Radio in the 1930s and 1940s - with nothing other than New York as the setting in common.

I like that it's slightly waterproof, because I'm often running around outside even when it's raining. I haven't had any problem with this bag yet, and it's been a year and some change."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic GooGoo album","review":"This CD is more tuned and smoothed out since their last one, A Boy Named Goo. This CD made the goo goo dolls really come out into the center stage with songs such as \\"Iris\\" or \\"Black Balloon\\". The one thing is that one of the things other cd's lack is the instinct to play great songs the whole cd. The Goo Goo Dolls do not throw a bunch of trash in between those great songs. The Goo Goo Dolls paint a picture with gripping lyrics tuned by jonny r's rough and talented voice. The group mixes the beautiful and traditional acoustic guitar perfectly with the booming of a electric guitar. This is a got to have classic for all alternative/rock fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing follow up to Boy Named Goo spells success for trio","review":"Just a totally amazing track! From the almost mournful sounds of Black Balloon and Iris(my favorite)to the rockin sounds of Robby Takac screamin out January Friend, and then to the pop tracks Slide and Dizzy with Johnny Rzeznik on vocals, this cd is almost as good as their best selling Boy Named Goo, but not quite. It is still an amazing album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dizzy Up The Girl","review":"Wow is all i can see, this album defines the Goo Goo Dolls in one, they are lyrically and voacally stunning. If you are looking for something actually contains some real feeling and passion in the words instead of the usuaual \\"Hit me Baby One More Time\\" then check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great follow up","review":"This is a great album by a great band. My only problem with the Goo's is that they continue to let the bassist sing some of the songs on their albums but never release them as singles, why because he is not good. THe best song by far on the CD is bullet proof, but of course they won't release it because their pop fans would freak, it is a rockin' tune, much like their older stuff. The pop songs are decent also, so if you like the ones on the radio you will like thsi CD.....the best tunes are 1. Dizzy 2. Slide 3. Broadway 5. Black Balloon 6. Bullet Proof 11. Iris"},{"rating":"2","title":"new to the goo","review":"love most of this cd. i do skip over some of the raw harder cuts (robby's voice is too much) and there is plenty left to listen to. i do not purchase a lot of rock, but this is one of my favorite cd's. love the lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good melodic rock, Great Cd","review":"If you like good rock you can sing along to, and beautiful rock ballads, Then this is the album for you! Songs like \\"Acoustic #3\\", \\"Dizzy\\", & their next big hit \\"Broadway\\" are very good & catchy! Plus it also contains the monster hits \\"Slide\\", \\"Iris\\", & \\"Black Balloon\\" Buy it if you love good melodies & lyrics! Alot of people knock the Goo's for going mainstream, but what they don't is that music is a buisness just like the food buisness, & if only you & a few others like your product your not gonna sell it because people won't buy it if don't sound good! So far over 3 million people have bought & liked this Cd, So The GOO'S MUST BE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Headline: THE DOLLS SELL THEMSELVES OUT!","review":"Yes, it's true, one of the greatest alternative bands around have sold themselves out with their commercial success 'Dizzy Up the Girl'. With this album they have jumped into the pool of mediocrity. Please don't buy this album, and get the wrong idea of the Dolls. This is their worst album by far, although they started out as heavy rock 'Goo Goo Dolls' and 'Jed' they have become a more mellow band 'Superstar Carwash' and 'A Boy Named Goo' - which I prefer. Anyone who thinks this is the best Dolls album is wrong, because this can not be classed as a proper Goo Goo Dolls release, because the music on this album is nothing like any of their other stuff. If you buy this you should regret it, but if you like commercial sell outs, go ahead and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Goo Goo Dolls' CD Yet","review":"This CD is by far the best CD the Goo Goo Dolls' best CD. They sound a bit different than on the older CDs, and lightened up on the distortion, this CD is a must if you are a Goo Goo Dolls' fan. There is not a single song on the CD that I can't like on the CD. From the explosive beginning of \\"Dizzy,\\" to the beautiful song \\"Hate This Place\\", tops even \\"A Boy Named Goo\\". I stongly reccomend you get this CD, no matter what music you like."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Goo Goo Dolls are the best band there is!!!!!","review":"I bought this CD because of Slide and now I love all the songs that John Rzeznik sings only. My favorite songs of John are Black Balloon and Slide. I listen to his songs almost everyday. John's songs are just so good and wonderful and I can't get enough of his songs. Especially Black Balloon and Slide. John is definately my favorite singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Music all the way!","review":"I love the Goo-Goo Dolls and I just found out about this online buying,so I decided to check it out.

I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest cd of all time!!","review":"I really love this group ever since they played that song Name. But I think that this new one that they have out now is the greatest thing that I heard in a long time. People say that they don't like the The Goo Goo Dolls now because they have brought acoustic guitars into their music but I think music is music so don't diss this band. I really love the songs Slide and Black Balloon. You should really think about buying this cd because you will be sorry if you don't. You will be sorry if you don't because by the time you try and get it they will be all gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"I just saw the Goo Goo Dolls in concert on April 21st and it was amazing.

A couple left something to be desired, however.Overall, though, it was a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uh, this is the best!","review":"This is a very good Goo Goo Dolls CD. Especially with Iris, Slide, and Broadway. I think you should get it! This is my dad's. I listen to it a lot.1. Dizzy - As a matter of fact, my dad doesn't really like this song, just that I do. Good song. 2. Slide - This is better than Dizzy. Still not the best. 3. Broadway - Now either this is the best song or Iris is. Because this is like one of the good four songs. 4. January Friend - I thought I knew the lyrics, but I didn't. It was \\"she said let's pretend...\\". Anyway, good song. 5. Black Balloon - Forgot about this one. I think this is all right. 6. Bullet Proof - I definately forgot this. 7. Amigone - I think, but I forgot it too! 8. All Eyes On Me - I didn't forget, that this is a good song. 9. Full Forever - Great song. 10. Acoustic #3 - Forgot. 11. Iris - Probably the best in here. 12. Extra Pale - Don't like it much, but it's okay. 13. Hate This Place - Better than track #12. Good song."},{"rating":"1","title":"It deserves no attention","review":"Drivel, straight-up pop sappiness. Horrid lyrics, mediocre musicianship. I couldn't even believe \\"Slide\\" even got radio play. I can understand \\"Iris\\" though I can't stand that song either...it tugs at the heart-strings of any sentimental person. \\"It's our song\\"...seemed to be the phrase every couple in the USA seemed to be saying when the song \\"Iris\\" came into a conversation. How sweet, that it's everybody else's song too. The sooner this song is forgotten, the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"These guys are the worst.

To claim this is alt-rock demonstrates a complete ignorance of the genre. Alt-rock at its lamest doesn't get this lame. If I could award no stars I would. What's wrong with you all? You are all old people in young peoples' bodies and it makes me so sad that you should settle for so little. Shame and pity on you all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes well with......I dunno, Pokemon","review":"Pardon me while I clean up my vomit to make room for more vomit. Still trying to understand the garbage these kids are listening to these days. They call this alternative rock, and by that I think they mean alternative to real music. This music should be on sesame streets \\"let's get funky with the alphabet\\" hour or whatever they call it. Blank tape has more substance than this music. This group sounds like part of the mainstream corporate giant consisting of hundreds of talentless bands just like this one good for only one thing, killing good music as we know it. Ok kids, this music is ok for now, but once you get potty trained it's time to move on. That way you won't need someone else to help you remove crap from your cd collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"dizzy up","review":"I don't listen to this kind of music as I really hate the whole radio/alternatine scene. I worked in a music store when this album was released and must have heard it 5 or 6 times a day as we had to play new releases in the store. Although there is no talent in this band vocal or instrument wise, the music made me reminisce about high school days. Anyway, this was a flavor of the day type band who has been forgotten about by now. It was obviously a group created by music execs to have some radio play, milk every dime that it was worth and then thrown out like old chewing tobacco. It's such a shame how music is being ruined like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I just saw the Goo Goo Dolls live a couple of weeks ago, and decided I had to get this CD. It's great! Every song is a winner, pick it up today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THE GOO GOO DOLLS!!!!!!!!!","review":"The Goo Goo Dolls are my very favorite band and this album is great. They have so much talent and they really use it--they're not just some wishy-washy group who plays a little of nothing and makes a CD. Johnny has such a beautiful voice. His songs are the best. GET THIS CD! THIS IS GREAT MUSIC!!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone will like it","review":"This cd is amazing. John's vocals are amazing and Robby's interesting. It starts with Dizzy, sounds like old Goo Goo Dolls until about a minute in when the band reveals there new style. John's power ballads are amazing and the orchestra adds a nice touch. If you like pop, Rob's four songs might annoy you but they grow on you. They add a nice contrast to the album.Favorites: Black Balloon, Iris, Bullet Proof"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible c.d.","review":"This c.d. is wounderful, I loved Dizzy up the Girl from the first time I heard it and it is amoung one of my favorite c.d.'s. Every song is exceptional even though some stand out above others: songs like acoustic #3, black balloon, Iris, Broadway and amigone. Acoustic #3 is my favorite song, because it is so sad. I also really like the songs sang by Robby. they may be very different from Blackballoon and Iris, but the c.d. would be lacking without them.The Goo Goo Dolls deserve a lot of credit for this c.d., more than most profressional music cridicts give them. Especially when no talent boy bands, like N SYNC and BSB get rave reviews that are very undeserved.Dizzy up the Girl is a great c.d.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is an excellent CD.

Sorry everyone, but I'm going to be in the very small minority here and say that this was one of the WORST CD's I've ever heard. Every song sounds the same. Just moaning and whining over and over. I'll give these guys the benefit of being able to twist one song into 50 others."},{"rating":"2","title":"AmAzInG!!","review":"I really think this CD is one of my favorites ever. It's up there with my Sarah MachClaughlan and my Counting Crows, and Beatles CD's!My favorite songs are \\"Dizzy,\\" \\"Slide,\\" and the not-heard-of \\"Amigone.\\" Overall, there is a song to fit however I am feeling. I love turning the louder songs, like \\"Amigone\\" up really loud and singing as loud as possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":":)","review":"this is a great cd. great vocals especially! the lyrics are a little weak but it is made up for in the vocals and tune/beat. every song is good and addicting! if you don't like the goo goo dolls, then that's your problem. if you do like them, try third eye blind too."},{"rating":"2","title":"great effort","review":"For a lover of mainly pop music, this CD was a welcome bit of variety. The songs are all heartfelt and exude honesty. My personal favorites are \\"Slide\\" and \\"Black Balloon\\". I also like the rock/pop of \\"Iris\\", the effervesence of \\"Dizzy\\" and the 1980s-style gem \\"Broadway\\".For a bit of a break from the commercial meaninglessness that dominates the music scene, try this CD. You'll be pleasantly suprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NO CHEESE, please. it's not the Backstreet Boys or anything!","review":"Dizzy Up The Girl is so cool! Some people think it's just another cheesy boy band, but it's not. If you want proof, just listen to Dizzy,Broadway, January Friend, or even the songs that people confuse with \\"Quit Playing Games With my Heart,\\" like Slide (which, might I add, is NOT cheesy!) Besides,John Rzeznik is SO hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is 5 star plus!!","review":"I can't even tell you how much I love this CD. It is the best!! I got it about 2 weeks ago and have been listening to it nearly none stop since then. I love all the songs, except for the ones Robby sings on. I just don't like his voice much, but maybe thats just me. This band must be extremely talented to put out such a great CD. Don't pay any attention to Fred. He probably hasn't even heard their music, he's just judging them by the Howard Stern show. Come on!! It's Howard Stern. Anyway, go buy the CD. You'll thank me. And feel free to email to tell me how much you love the Goos!!(I especailly love Johnny)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Goo's","review":"The Goo Goo Dolls have been around for a very long time and have provided us with some great music along their long trip. Somewhere along the way though, they came to a point when they decided to write something that actually got people's attention, that cd was Dizzy up the Girl. This cd is and in my opinion will always be their best cd they have ever created. I know it's important to try and create better and better music, but i'm not sure if the Goo Goo Dolls can pull it off. They can sure give it a good try though. The Dolls have always made good music and will always make good music until some unforsaken monster decides to break them up!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is a great CD that still bears up to repeated listenings. Very rarely can you find a disc with as many charting hits as this one has. On top of that, the rest of the disc is also well crafted. If you look at their GH compilation that was just released...a good portion of the songs are from here. This is the best effort to date for the boys from Buffalo."},{"rating":"2","title":"it rocks!","review":"To tell the truth, I didn't even like the Goo Goo Dolls when 'Name' became a hit a few years ago, but after a friend suggested that I get Dizzy Up the Girl, I went ahead and bought the album. I didn't think I'd like it at first, but I was really surprised. I bought it at the beginning of the year and it remains my favorite CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goo Goo Dolls - quality stuff!","review":"I think the Goo Goo Dolls are great!!! John Rzeznik has aUNBELIEVEABLE voice (he should sing all the songs, no question) and Ithink he's really innovative with all the crazy tunings he uses on guitar (I saw the GGD in Baltimore, and he has a rack of guitars behind him, he's constantly changing, he was even changing during songs!). The songs, Bullet Proof and Acoustic #3 (this song should be longer) are really good, and you can't lose with Iris, Black Balloon, Dizzy, and Slide (I never get tired of them). All in all, a great album, I just can't wait to see what Johnny comes out with next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lousy Replacements imitation.","review":"As a diehard Mats fan I really have trouble accepting the Goo Goo Dolls. Yes, Nirvana proved you could rip off a band's style (The Pixies) and still make good music and The Replacements themselves showed that trying to make a hit record does not have to be a sell out (The under rated \\"All Shook Down\\" and \\"Don't Tell A Soul\\") but the Dolls manage neither of these feets. The singers rock star asperations are barely hid beneath the super glossy production and over emotive lyrics. While many of the songs are very catchy, especially \\"Iris\\", none of them carry any realy emotional weight to back the musical force. So it all comes out sounding very big and hollow and much too professional and calculated. They might have a good, even great, album in them somewere, but they need a lot of changes for it to happena ny time soon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I went to the music store hoping to get a good ska/punk CD. However, the CD's that I was looking for were not there. I saw the new Goo Goo Dolls' CD, and kind of felt called to it. I still liked Iris, despite being overplayed on the radio, and I had fallen in love with the song Slide. So I bought the CD. It is fabulous, except for a couple of songs, particularly the ones not sung by John. Slide is the best song on the album. However, Black Balloon is not far behind. It is a beautiful ballad, that is even better than Iris. Buy this CD! You will be surprised (and I am a little ska friek!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boy Named Goo Two","review":"Their last CD was their best. If you must buy this, buy it. But don't get your hopes up.

After finnaly listening past \\"Dizzy\\" I herd all kinds of wonderfull songs such as \\"Slide\\", \\"Black balloon\\" and \\"Broadway\\". Even my parents ( who scorn all my other music) couldn't help taping there foot and addmitting that they are a really good bamd (currently my dad knows every word of \\"Broadway\\" and \\"Iris\\".

I was convinced that the band was simply trying to play off of the soulfull \\"Nirvana/Alterna-Grunge\\" image like so many other bands before it, and quickly fade away....where is Bush now?Imagine my suprise when a friend of mine set the record straight by playing this CD for me one night. Both of us are fairly picky about our music and don't jump on the top ten band wagon easily. Doubts gave way to a huge smile as I realized that I was listening to one heck of an album.Perhaps not suprsingly, my \\"perfect single\\" would be the underplayed \\"black balloon\\" Invoking a world turned upside down when everything had just been figured out, it seemed like the perfect theme song to a \\"college years\\" compilation for generation x or whatever the mass media wants to call us.Despite overplay of \\"Name\\" and their earlier works, do not turn down this recording.

Johnny's voice is the voice of the Goo Goo Dolls, his songs, his lyrics are what work, what sounds beautiful, and all his songs deserve 5 stars. They comprise about 3/4 the CD, therefore, the other songs that the other guy sings, which are all terrible compositions that just insult the sweet sound of the other songs don't fit on this CD, with this band, I'm perplexed. I don't get how they have this amazing CD, that is going on like one of the all-time classics, and then they interrupt it with his high school band-like crud that sounds worse than filler, it's just foolish souding. I think that they're old time friends, and that Johnny probable allows it because that's how the band keeps it's peace, but dang man, I think they should go. Just take the other songs and you have a 5 star CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty at it's best.","review":"Dizzy Up The Girl, possibly the best of all the Goo's work, meets tainted beauty with perfection. The lyrical genius of such hits as \\"Black Balloon\\", \\"Iris\\", \\"Acoustic #3\\", and \\"Broadway\\" are enough to bring me tears. Rzeznik has an extraordinary talent when it comes to conveying the most heartfelt emotion through song. Also, if you're looking for something a little more upbeat and poignant, then you have selections such as \\"Dizzy\\", \\"Bulletproof\\", and \\"All Eyes On Me\\".Regardless of style, however, the Goos successfully deliver a beautifully inspired album, which will leave you with addictive tunes stuck in your head for hours upon end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply one of the best albums I've ever owned...","review":"What can I say? These songs don't wear down your ears, and each time you listen they get better. These are songs you'll be singing in your head all day when you are away from the radio.Even my 3-year-old adores this album, and knows all of Johnny's songs. I can't necessarily say I am a big fan of Robby's songs, but there are a couple I can live with. Robby is a GREAT backup singer that blends well with Johnny's, but Robby is just an okay lead singer that wears a little old.This album is well worth the money, BUY IT!

Musically, the Goo Goo Dolls (what is UP with their stupid name, anyway?) are a fairly decent band -- they're one of the more talented crap bands on the radio these days. But then... Rush is, musically, a very talented band. That doesn't mean I like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dolls are Back!","review":"I was struck by the beauty of the song Iris last spring when the single first started playing on the radio. I had never really known the Goo Goo Dolls before that. I had heard the song Name, off of A Boy Named Goo, which is one of the prettiest melodies of the 90's... but I had never heard much else about the Dolls. Then I heard the single Slide. This prompted me to buy this album, and I certainly do not regret it. The songs Black Ballon, Hate this Place and Broadway are very well-written and well-sung songs. John Rzeznik's style is unmatched in the world of popular music. Also, the Goo Goo Dolls' new drummer, Mike Malinin, is very talented and certainly gives this album a well-defined drum base. This is my favorite album, by any artist. I certainly recommend anyone who loves alternative and/or rock to buy this album. You will not be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"what can i say?","review":"ok, i love this album. if you ever buy a goo goo dolls album it should be this. the thing that gets me is that i can relate to this album on so many levels. buy it cause if you dont then youll never have truly lived"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather bland and disappointing","review":"This CD is pleasant enough, but is ultimately too bland and calculated to appeal to anyone looking for any substance whatsoever. The Goos have made an album that attempts to appeal those who became fans because of the hits, \\"Name\\" and \\"Iris\\", and perhaps they have succeeded, judging by the number of 5 star ratings given to them. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that they aren't breaking any new ground. The songs are calculated and despite the soulful singing, fail to really fulfill what anyone looking for anything beyond a radio-friendly tune is looking for. Have the Goos sold out? Possibly. Is Dizzy a terrible album? No. \\"Iris\\" and \\"Slide\\" ensure that it has its merits - but for really compelling, enthralling music... look elsewhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take my CD, please!","review":"I got this album last X-mas as a present (at my request though). I have listened to the CD two, maybe three times. Besides the songs that got radio play, \\"Slide\\" \\"Broadway\\" \\"Iris\\", I can't get into the rest of the album whatsoever. It's true, this is pop rock and it isn't good. I feel embarrased that I had a relative get me this album for X-mas. I wish I could give away this CD to someone who wants it, but that would violate review guidelines.If you want good pop rock, check out Third Eye Blind. I got into their self-titled album from front to back.You CAN'T get into this album. And if you can, then you need some serious psychiatric help. This album is very uninspiring and unimpressive.

In a word: DANGER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland fickle pop from the Goo Goo Dolls","review":"Here's another band trying to cash in on the currently popular trend of \\"bland rock\\" popularized by the likes of Matchbox 20 and Tonic. Nothing to like about this group except, if yr a girl, a few pretty faces...the music is too dull and predictable to actually be enjoyed. This group used to be decent too, sounding a bit like The Replacements...now they are just after 15 minutes of fame with some lame Bon Jovi-inspired power ballads.

Just listen to the first three records \\"Goo Goo Dolls\\", \\"Jed\\", and \\"Hold Me Up\\". Sadly those days are long gone and the Goo's see fit to be the new darlings of ballad radio. Well, I'm sure they're gettiing all the money and women they want now that they've 'made it\\"; it's just a shame they had to give up the great rock and roll they once played. Fans of their early stuff, check out Feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this thing on?","review":"This used to be one of my favorite bands. Now, however they have reduced themselves to a paper cut-out clone of matchbox 20 or something along those lines.

I really did not expect much from it. In fact the only reason I bought it was because of their one song \\"Iris\\".But once I got home and popped the cd into my stereo I was blown away!! Every song is beautifully written not to mention the great melodys that accompany those lyrics. I now listen to it daily, one song you must hear is \\"Black ballon\\" --> you may have seen the video . But that is by far the best on the cd next to \\"iris\\" of course. You could drown in the haunting melody and thought provoking lyrics in this song, heck on the whole album.And that is why I gave the Googoo Dolls a score of 5 stars*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal CD","review":"This is one of the best CD's I have ever bought, if not the best.

The broad selection of topics addressed by Foster reflects the diversity of cultural themes that define Argentina and its porteño citizens. The Dirty War, Mafalda, and the role of public performance protest are all addressed in a scholarly fashion - allowing for a discussion of popular culture in a unique and academic format. I recommend this book to anyone with a base knowledge of Argentine culture and history interested in examining at a closer level of investigation the social/political components of recent Argentine cultural development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Wordy, Not Enjoyable","review":"A very difficult read. I am college-educated, did OK on my SATs, consider myself intelligent, but found so much of this book went right over my head.

The bottle provided is also difficult to put in the doll's mouth which makes it a bit messy, we wound up putting the doll's mouth under the water faucet just to get water inside. The doll does warn that it has to go pee pee but only after some of the water drips out onto your floor or on you. Its cries are annoying and loud, so overall I would not reccomend this doll as an effective potty training tool. After my frustration of trying to use this doll to help my daughter train, I was very disappointed for shelling out $25 on something that wasn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK!!","review":"I got this for my daughter's 2nd birthday gift and I wish I had opened it and tried it out before I gave it to her. The doll won't stop saying it has to go and when you put it on the potty it makes the done noise but nothing comes out so you put the bottoms back on and all of a sudden it says it has to go again. I ended up taking the batteries out of it and just letting her play with the doll. She loves the doll and takes it every where we go so I hate to return it since see would be very upset Darla was not here. I almost need to contact the company get one that works and then send the bad one back. Overall I would never of given the doll to her in the first place there has to be one that works better for this age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS DOLL DOES NOT WORK!!!","review":"If I could rate this doll with no stars I would. I was so excited to get this doll for my daughter, because we started to potty train her. I thought this would be the perfect doll, because it's electronic, boy was I wrong! I could not get this doll to pee no matter what I did. The water would go in, and nothing would come out. When I laid the baby down, all she kept saying is \\"mommy pee pee, pee pee\\", the poor thing couldn't get it out. I couldn't get her to stop saying it. My daughter kept looking at her butt to see where the pee was. I actually felt sorry for this doll, so I took the batteries out. I boxed it up, and returned it to the store. If you are thinking about buying this doll, don't do it. It is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best baby my daughters ever had","review":"This is the best doll I have ever boght my daugter it does everthing it says on the box and much more its so cute and loveable unlike a doll I bought her on christmas and it was a love me chou chou doll my daughter liked it at first but then its face got dirty the first day just by the childern rubbing on its face and it did not do anything really but just sit there and it cost about hafe the price more than this great new doll baby darla.

This movie shows the prejudice against others of a different background and social status. Maricela's mother is a teacher who must work as a maid in the United States. Maricela is plagued by memories of the day her little brother ran away from her and was killed. The biggest issues deal with social justice and the ability to accept other cultures.

'ruleta rusa' has a cool beat to it, different, spices up the cd a bit. and 'dicen por ahi' makes you feel soo bad for talking bad about someone. imagine if you talked bad about an ex beau and he found out...how would you feel?? this is his best cd by far, there are soo many great songs and lyrics.

It started out well, and the acting was good, but by about half way it felt as though there was just nowhere to go with the story. I was getting sick of the cat-and-mouse thing between the teacher and the deaf girl. I wasn't satisfied with the ending the film had either, although I was relieved when it did come to a close.

I am a great fan of Acoustic guitar music, and this type of album certainly has a place in my collection.

Brilliant writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aunt Irma visits the IT Crowd basement","review":"Jen Barber's PMT pushes her over the edge bringing Aunt Irma to the IT Crowd basement office. Its catchy though because Moss & Roy wonder if they too have PMT!This is such a great episode with great characters and twists.There's even an actual website devoted to Moss & Roy's PMT problems......[...]BRILLIANT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the IT crowd","review":"My husband and I love watching the IT crowd. There isn't really another sitcom out there quite like it. My only complaint is that season 1 only had 6 shows. Now we have to buy season 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Amusing....","review":"I was introduced to this television show only recently and I can honestly say that this show is really great. The characters are interesting and the story lines are very humorous. I would definitely recommend this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"The IT Crowd is Amazing","review":"The IT Crowd is one of those comedy's that you can keep watching over and over again it is so hilarious. If you like the Office you'll love this show. I first watched this show online before it was released in the US, and after 2 years I finally was able to get it, so overjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome British comedy","review":"This show is hilarious, in large part to the diversity of the characters. The misadventures of Jan, Roy & Moss are the funniest things to come out of Britain since Spaced. I totally recommend this dvd to anyone who enjoyed the British version of the Office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Brilliant and Hilarious. I have worked in the IT sector for over 10 years and this show defiantly has some of its roots in reality. Great fun and funny. I bought all the DVD and watched them more than once. You cant miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Typical English comedy: random and unpredictable, but intelligent and well-timed. The three leads interact well and the supporting cast features short appearances by some great English comedians. Combines a bit of Dilbert office humor with dork jokes and the hilarious pathos of a normal \\"career-minded\\" woman trying to make something of her department of two misfits."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE IT CROWD","review":"THIS DVD IS A MUST HAVE FOR FANS OF COMEDY. FROM THE MOMENT I TURNED ON THE VIDEO I COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comedy","review":"I am writing a review for The IT Crowd. This is a great television comedy from England. Well written and acted. This is a great series to add to your collection if you are into Technology at all or Office space type comedy. I cannot wait for season 2 to come to video in the next couple of months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aunt Irma gives it two thumbs up!","review":"Normally, you have to appreciate British humor to watch these kind of shows. The IT Crowd is pretty much a combination of Dilbert and Office Space that delivers alot of dry humor. If you work in IT... You MUST watch this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, but DVD is missing features","review":"First off, let me say the show itself is great and very funny, and deserves five-stars. The only reason the DVD didn't get five-stars is because it isn't perfect. Namely, it is missing two features that appeared on the UK version: audio commentaries for each episode and outtakes. It doesn't make sense really, considering the UK version is also one-disc, so I don't think it was a space issue. And what's worse, when BCI Eclipse was going to release it (which they sent out review copies for) it included them! So, if you really like the show, and have the ability to watch a UK DVD, you'd be better off getting that so you don't miss anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest show on TV","review":"No, the DVD isn't out as I write this, but I want to encourage North Americans who haven't seen the show to check it out on BBC America. This is the funniest show I've seen for years. My husband will get me this DVD for Mother's Day if he knows what's good for him. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-till-you-cry IT Crowd","review":"There aren't too many things that make me laugh until I cry - the IT Crowd is one of those things though. British comedy at its finest. Had to buy a copy for my brother the minute I saw the US version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomely funny!","review":"A friend of mine turned me on to this show by showing me the pilot/1st episode on Netflix. When I saw that the actor who plays Moss was going to be in an upcoming movie, I decided to start watching the rest of the I.T. Crowd!Hilarious! Moss' mannerisms, Roy's over the top voice and reactions, and well I could honestly do without Jen... :)Well worth the buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very British Humour","review":"This is a very funny series and is quintessentially British. The writing is clever and the ensemble cast blend perfectly. I would not compare it to the British version of The Office, where a lot of the humour is pretty subtle, as I think this is more of a typical sit-com and should have more universal appeal. You can always watch some of the episodes on youtube before deciding to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This is one of the funniest shows I have ever watched. You have to like British humor, and never watch it with the kiddies around. I started watching this on Netflix streaming and decided I had to have it in my collection. If you like British comedy, you might also want to check out Peep Show and the Mitchell and Webb Look, both by Mitchell and Webb.Happy viewing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful series","review":"I loved this series. Took this season with me on a flight, and made the time just fly by. (no pun intended there....:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Commentaries NOT included on US release","review":"I purchased this DVD primarily for the commentary on every episode which is listed in Amazon's product description. I'm very disappointed to receive the DVD and find that these commentaries are not present. You have to buy the UK version to get all of the extras for season one of The IT Crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch. Extremely unfunny.","review":"If you have ever watched the (vastly superior) series \\"Extras\\", and can recall their spoof of a horrible British sitcom (titled \\"When the Whistle Blows\\"), this is exactly the kind of series they were making fun of. Obnoxious laugh track, every single joke is utterly too familiar, and the characters are stock sitcom prototypes. In other words, watch this only if you enjoy bland network television. Repeat warning: contains obnoxious laugh track. And oh yeah, their idea of a geek joke is to remind someone that they need to hit the power button on their computer for it to work. *groan*"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE! Don't waste your time and money!","review":"DISAPPOINTING to say the least. This is a pathetic British comedy that just isn't funny or entertaining. But if you like bad Britcoms, you will like this one.An example of GOOD BRITCOMS: One Foot in the Grave; Jonathan Creek, Cracker; As Time Goes By; Hetty Wainthrop Investigates (mysteries), etc. BAD BRITCOMS: Benny Hill, etc. You decide.Too bad, because the premise of this show could have been funny, entertaining, and made for great tv. Pretty much the only funny thing is everytime their phone rings they answer by saying IT Dept ... have you tried turning on or shutting off your computer? The odd guy with the glasses could have been an awesome character. If this series is a spoof, I get it, but it's not a very good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not funny","review":"Based on all the reviews here I went ahead and netflixed Season 1 of The IT Crowd and 5 of the 6 episodes were completely unfunny, some even painfully so. One episode was kinda funny, but the rest were simply terrible, the 3 main actors are really bad actors, no comic timing, relying on yelling to try and make things funny, which does not work. I am a British humor kind of guy but this was not good, maybe if you are an IT nerd or something, but for Brit humor I'd stick with The Office or The Mighty Boosh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, though not a 'professional' ukulele","review":"I am a guitarist, have been for sixteen years; I wanted an inexpensive ukulele to bring with on a motorcycle trip and thought a baritone would be great, I don't have to re-learn tunings and fingering - perfect! This one was better than expected, where else can you spend $30 and get a 'playable' instrument? This thing should cost twice that for its quality. Some people complained about the uke not keeping tune - tune it, wiggle vigorously on the strings, tune it tomorrow, and in the next day or two the new strings will hold tune as good as any other. I loved this thing! Played it every day, which brings me to my one drawback: The wound strings wore out before two weeks of playing. No problem, my local guitar store stocked a high-quality set of US made strings for six bucks, and they should last much longer. So my $30 purchase truly cost me $36.Overall, very happy with this, and for the price, not afraid to take it across country by motorcycle. Perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy cheap, get cheap","review":"The Rogue Baritone Ukulele KC is made in China and is very inferior. One fret was too loose to fix, all frets had limits to how tight they could be turned, strings had poor support, strings would not hold tuning, even when good frets were tightened, sound quality is very poor. I have an old Martin that was always easy to tune, held its tuning, produced great sound, and had very good frets and supports. I recommend this Rogue ukulele to noone, and warn potential buyers to walk away from the item. I am sorry that Giardinelli \\"Musicians' Friend\\" carries such equipment, because it diminishes the company image. Jim Moore drjimmoore@harborside.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"I bought this instrument aware of some of its faults. I'm used to new stringed instruments not holding its tune, but have never seen it untune right before my eyes. Stretching the strings didn't help at all. After giving up, I put it back in the included bag, figuring it would take a while until it could work as intended. A couple of hours later I heard it untune in the bag and then a bag; the bridge flew off. I guess that I'll get around to fixing her one day, and to be quite honest, I had her even less than that, but I'm really thinking of returning her despite the nice rich barritone sound I briefly heard before she literally flew apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cheap -- find another model","review":"My short relationship with a Rogue baritone uke included: a) string buzz that could not be fixed and b) tuning machines that break right in your hand. I suggest you save your money and buy something a bit more expensive, perhaps a Lanikai baritone. Or a Fortune if you can find one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and overrated.","review":"A bit dated and for my purpose, which was traveling from Santo Domingo to the Samana Peninsula area, it was very outdated. Not bad for a general country map but you can get almost the same map free from the rental car company {Avis in our case}. Also one side is completely blank and could have had city and/or area maps in detail.Save yourself some $$$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good articles, pretty pictures...","review":"All the women they feature are usually 40+ but they look fabulous. The articles are good and many are about staying healthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well over 40 and LOVE this magazine......","review":"Who doesn't want to look her best???? Yes this magazine does use space to talk about clothes and looking good. One of my favorite fashion pages is where they have three different readers/models wear an outfit and comment on it. All the women are over 40 and the comments aren't always flattering - it seems real. There also is some serious commentary and subjects broached that overall appeals to women over 40 and other intelligent people. I don't believe that if you are a woman over 40 you will regret subscribing to this publication. Just flip through an issue at the newstand and you will be convinced."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much botox","review":"Love the idea of a women's magazine targeted at over 40 y/o. But with the number of articles and advertisements for botox and aging creams and plastic surgery and how to look and act younger; it just doesn't feel good, or like a magazine for intelligent, accomplished women - at least not ones who aren't struggling to look younger and spend yet more money on invasive procedures while subscribing to society's view of older women not counting...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend..","review":"Bought this as a gift for a woman in her 50's and she loves it! She also reads Oprah's magazine, but finds that this one is much better, the articles are really good, and there are far fewer ad's. She said she would pick this magazine over Oprah's which surprised me.. Great gift!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Boring and ho-hum. Magazine styling of 15-20 years ago. Where is it written that older women should settle for less than contemporary styling? Why would we aspire to be like or compete with celebrities? Cancelled subscription after 2 issues. Disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"New magazine to me, and worth it","review":"I recommend this magazine, especially if you are over 50 years old.

I was getting so tired of all the publications aimed at the young I thought I would try a magazine that has leanings toward the mature woman. Even though this magazine is good, to them a mature woman is 45-54. Well, I am hoping a magazine publisher will learn that the women 55 and over are still fashion conscious and would love to have fashion tips, makeup recommendation, specific aging problems addressed--hair thinning, sagging skin, etc., The things people don't like to talk about or even see, sweep under the carpet, but are very real to those of us experiencing these changes.

Not all of us feel like drudges if we get along with our mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, siblings or friends or if we enjoy our sex lives or our choice of lifestyles. Lighten up! I tried repeatedly to cancel the subscription and it just wouldn't cancel. Finally, it ran out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When I ordered More I expected a magazine for the AVERAGE woman over 40. Among other things I had hoped for fashions for small women (2 petite) who don't want to dress like teenagers or \\"20 somethings\\". Instead I found mostly outrageously priced clothing - $1,385.00 for the suit, $555.00 shoes and $350.00 for the clutch bag. This was far from being the most expensive ensemble pictured. Even if could afford this kind of money for clothing I couldn't justify spending it when many families can't even afford food and medicine.

If there is a way to cancel at the More website, it is very well hidden. I don't want any money, I just don't want to receive the magazine anymore. At the bottom of the More homepage is the name \\"Meredith Corporation.\\" At that website I was able to go to the customer service and fill in my address info and was directed to a page that allowed me to fill in info to cancel. The confirmation said to allow 7 days to upgrade my account. Hopefully that will take care of it. Just a note-many magazines pass on subscription info to a third party and that is who you have to deal with in many cases. I wanted to post this info at the More website but I would have had to open an account with a magazine I was trying to cancel in the first place. Hope Amazon allows this to be printed. Good luck to those trying to cancel."},{"rating":"1","title":"More...fluff","review":"I found MORE to be thin, advertising-laden fluff. Many of the ads and articles concentrate on maintaining a youthful appearance and attitude. The fashion features use young models instead of fit, healthy women 45 and older.

I subscribed and have seen size 2 ad models, anti aging ads, 6 inch heels,weight loss crap...all the things that the patriarchal society and culture have prescribed for women forever. This magazine had an opportunity to produce classy, upbeat stories about our new image as we age, and instead it's like 17 magazine for middle-agers.

Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These \\"additions\\" (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context. It is like getting both a classic and a pictorial history book rolled into one! The text is easy to read. My daughter is now 9, and reading the books on her own.

However, the book presents a lop-sided, biased and unfair characterization of Cuban-Americans and CANF supporters and a shallow overview of the complexities and the tragedy of the Elian Gonzolez case. The child's mother gave her life so that he could know freedom and have a better life with his Miami relatives, who sincerely loved him and cared for him as did many members of the local community. The authors chose to be selective in what facts they presented in order to portray the Cuban-American community in negative light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"Brilliant!!!

Very interesting account, somewhat Freudian, but very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE ABUSES OF DR. B","review":"While this book is widely embraced by educators, psychoanalysts, children's TV programmers and others, it is important that people reading it know some background about the author, Bruno Bettelheim. I suggest you read Richard Pollak's \\"The Creation of Dr. B,\\" which deals with Bettelheims suspect credentials and methodology. For an even quicker primer, look at the Amazon.com on-line reviews of another Bettelheim book, \\"The Empty Fortress,\\" a completely discredited and misguided work that blamed autism on \\"refrigerator moms\\" and poor parenting, thereby setting back appropriate treatment of this condition and hurting a generation of families and children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take with a LARGE grain of salt","review":"I've noticed that one reviewer pointed to Richard Pollak's biography of the author, \\"The Creation of Dr. B,\\" as a source of information on Bruno Bettelheim's legitimacy as a psychoanalyst (or lack thereof). I would second that recommendation. Before reading \\"The Uses of Enchantment,\\" one should be aware that large portions of this book were brazenly plagiarized from other sources, such as Julius Heuscher's \\"A Psychiatric Study of Fairy Tales: Their Origin, Meaning and Usefulness.\\" Several passages were lifted directly from this work, published in 1963 (more than a decade before Bettelheim began writing \\"The Uses of Enchantment\\"), and barely even paraphrased. Heuscher was cited only once by Bettelheim, and not for any of these virtually direct quotes. I would think long and hard before taking anything Bettelheim attempted to pass off as his own work seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"The deepest, most richly-layered poetry I have ever read.","review":"This poetry takes some time to master, but it is well worth the effort. It recounts the rise and fall of Arthur's kingdom from the point of view of Taliessin, the court poet. The non-linear lyric pieces are a perfection of the craft; especial standouts are \\"Taliessin's Song of the Unicorn,\\" and \\"The Queen's Servant.\\" Perhaps if enough people become familiar with this hard-to-find classic, it will reappear in print!

Raid 0 copies files on a server to two drives so a back up is really there if one drive fails. (With these single drives when it's dead, you're dead.) SO, great to exchange files and store them short term. Just invest in more if you are looking at backing up your business or important files. Mine areactually used for lab user folders so they can move files from microscopes to the check-in terminal without seeing any difference. This cuts out USBs with viruses being pluged into lab equipment and save an enormous amount of trouble. Smaller drives would easily work for this, but occasioanly for servicing it's nice to be able to back up temporarily to these drives. In short it gives better flexiblilty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffalo LS500GL, Solid Performance","review":"Been using the Buffalo LS500GL after having bad experiences using the NetGear SC101. The Buffalo is a very solid performer. Does just what it advertizes. I use it for all MyDocuments between a wireless laptop and a wired PC. It plugs into one of the ethernet ports on the wireless router. Set-up was literally a 15 minute snap between the 2 machines both running XP. I just simply mapped the Buffalo drive to both machines and use its IP address to get into the user interface. You really dont need the install disk unless you want to use Memeo. Its very fast. Simultaneously I can have streaming music playing on the PC while uploading and downloading pictures from my camera on the laptop with no apparent degradation in performance.

The unit would power off automatically or just stop communicating on the network without any notification. A hard reset was required every 2-3 weeks. I've called Buffalo Support a number of times and besides the customary 30 minute hold, they are less than helpful. The same answer applies that there's is nothing similar reported and just do a hardware reboot.Two days ago the fan went. Buffalo will NOT replace the device unless it's been purchased less than a year ago. If it's a few days older, as in my case, you're out of luck. There is NO repair service so the unit becomes an expensive doorstop.In short, the LinkStation has been working inconsistently for a year and there is no recourse or repair whatsoever after 365 days.Use caution when considering this device or even BuffaloTech as a vendor.

Gladden was admittedly a major player in the development of the \\"social gospel,\\" a sort of close cousin to modern liberalism, but even as a theological conservative there is great value here.

The first, and longest of the three stories (and in my opinion most entertaining) deals with the Dark Knight's hunt to stop a lunatic Scarecrow from his usual agenda of striking fear into his victim. The second involves a hostage situation with the Mad Hatter serving as the antagonist, and the final story is a play on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Without spoiling too much, the first story deals with romance/love, the second with Bruce's mother and the third with his father. Great because anyone can pick up and read.

The second story is based around the Mad Hatter and his obsession with Lewis Carrol's \\"Alice and Wonderland\\". Finally, the third story is a batman christmas carrolesque story in which batman learns a life lesson from three spirits who take the form of people who have greatly influenced him throughout his years.

I sent the set back to Amazon because that side was actually blank and reordered the DVD set. The new discs just arrived and the packaging is slightly different. The documentary is now listed as being on side A of disc 3 and it was indeed there. There is now nothing listed for side B.Thanks to Amazon for the great return policy and amazing turnaround time.

I was recently looking for some things to occupy my time preparing for a surgery that was going to have me off my feet for a few weeks. I purchased Gilligans Island the complete collection. What a complete dissapointment this purchase was. The video quality was ok but on most shows the sound was altered so that the men did not sound like themselves. The sound of the voices of the men was lower in tone and just was not normal sounding. Additionally, the sound was out of sync with the video which made you feel like you were watching one of those old Japanese movies where the english voices were dubbed in after the movie was made. Overall, a poor duplication of a classic TV show. Save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I got the first season of Gilligans Island as a Christmas present.

My only complaint is that I would like to have the Colorized version of the 1st season.

I bought this set (and the other seasons) to bring back those good memories and share them with my daughter. She loves the show and we watch two episodes together at a time. The humor is a welcome relief from the sarcasm, potty-humor, and sexual content that dominates so much of television today. Today's kids still laugh at Gilligan and Skipper being stuck to the side of the Minnow, the duck that won't fly, Wrong Way Feldman, etc.The pilot episode is a hoot to watch (I am so glad that they changed to the Professor, Mary Ann and Ginger), and the commentary by Sherwood Schwartz is a treasure trove of information.This is a must-have for anyone who wished that they could be one of the cast-a-ways \\"here on Gilligan's Isle!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family entertainment","review":"We subsribed to Deja View on our cable network and my son (who's 10)seen a couple episodes of of Gilligan's Island.

And this isn't because the series was bad -- of course it was, one of the campiest television programs of all time, but that was part of it's charm -- but because once the network began airing the series in color, the earlier black and white episodes were largely forgotten by both the fans and networks alike; few, if any, markets were eager to syndicate the monochrome episodes when there were more than enough color ones to fill the time-slots. Which was their loss and ours, because these 34 episodes are among the finest produced during the show's three-season run. Definitely recommended for fans of the series, color or no color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift for a fan!","review":"I got this for my husband and he was ecstatic.

Massie has a grand subject -- Peter opened a long-sleeping Russia to the West, founded St. Petersburg (a beautiful city built, somewhat like Venice, basically on a body of water) and fought many wars. People must have kept great diaries back then because Massie is able to recreate events at court and battles from multiple points of view, lending the book a novelistic richness. Equally impressive, since the book is as much about Peter's times as it is about him, Massie pauses to include mini-essays about the many places and types of things that Peter the polymath was involved in. So you get a brief sketch of the Netherlands at the time, or about popular torture techniques of the day, that don't break up the overall narrative flow. It's a long book but a great read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Biography I've Ever Read","review":"I have read many biographies in my life, but this is by far the best. Part of the reason is that Massie weaves a fantastic story full of details and part of the reason is that the subject matter is so interesting. While this book is long and quite dense, when I finished I couldn't wait to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biography at its best","review":"This is the most fascinating, fast-paced and thoroughly researched biography I have read in a long time! While depicting this intelligent, practical, and often unsensitive and cruel man, Mr. Massie has also succeeded in portraying for us the complex, war-ridden and changing times in which he lived. He depicts the rapaciousness of contemporary politics, the miseries and hardships of war, the greed of the rich and powerful... but without unnecessary sentimentalism, and without (as far as I could ascertain) straying from historical fact. His human subject remains interesting and many-faceted to the end. In writing this great and ambitious book, Mr. Massie has given us a work of epical dimensions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter the Great His Life and World","review":"Massey did an excellent job.

I had no idea it was so heavy - weight is not listed for books on Amazon. The paperback book weighed over 2 lbs.! At over 900 pages, I will not read it in just a few days and I wanted to be able to take it with me on vacation. So I purchased it for my Kindle instead.That being said, Massie has crafted a fascinating read that extends well beyond the confines of 18th century Russia into all of Europe. He interweaves details that transport the reader into the life of those times. Although accurate, this does not read like a history book - more like a beautifully written novel.I have not yet finished this book but I will hate to see it end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for kindle","review":"With a hefty 1000+ pages this novel would be difficult to read if not for my kindle.

Massie's writting is wonderfull, but the quality of the publishing is shamefull. This book is so shodily put together that the pages fall out as you turn the page! I could read the odd numbered pages in the book. But when I turned the page it came out in my hand, so I read the even numbered pages outside of the book. Inspite of the trouble with the book itself, I enjoyed the writting. The story of Peter the Great was well told and I learned things I never knew about the man and his country. I just would like a company with some professionalism to buy the writes to print it and print a copy of Mr. Massie's words that is worth buying. I went to \\"a major book store\\" in my area and the copies they had for sale were just as bad. Is a putting a copy of a book on the market that is so poorly crafted it can not stand up to a single reading stealing? It may not meet the criminal definition, but it sure fits the moral one; don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter the Great bio","review":"The font size selected for this paperback edition is entirely too small for my eyes, so it is completely worthless to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is absorbing to the point that you have withdrawals when you are done reading it. It is an instant classic chronicalling not only the Russia that Peter inherited and changed, but also the European and middle eastern empires of the time. Peter is a very interesting and important person as was this time in the history of the world. This book puts you in the middle of the massive social and economic changes that Peter the great made to bring Russia into the modern european world. The interactions between Peter and his people and the struggles that they fought is enough to make this a great book but the deep coverage of the details makes it an excellent book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read","review":"Without a doubt, this is the best book I have ever read. It is immensely entertaining and informative. Robert Massie's descriptions and detailed portrayals provide a clear picture of Peter's life and times. Even though I read this book a decade ago, the scenes and stories still seem almost as real to me as personnel experiences. Peter's employment as a shipwright in Holland, his torturing of mutinous soldiers and dental patients, and wars raged against the Finns and Tartars still bring vivid images to my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating Picture of 17th Century Russia","review":"Peter the Great is a well written book about an unusual and engaging character.

How many times have you said that about historical nonfiction?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and excellent biography","review":"Robert Massie does an excellent job regardless of the subject he writes on. His masterpiece on Peter the Great is a dazzling 700 page ode to Russia's rise. Peter the Great helped to expand the borders in all directions of Russia and built his namesake St. Petersburg. His interest in integrating with Europe and establishing a navy are all well covered in this book. It all focuses on the Great Northern War with Sweden which gives the Russians a coast on the Baltic sea. Everything about this book is well done from the writing, to the research to the organization. I highly recommend it for even those who are casually interested in Russian history. You will not be disappointed by reading this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Literature","review":"Peter the Great was a larger than life figure and Massie does a fabulous job describing him and his world in this book. Massie, who is one of the most readable historians I've ever come across, incorporates incredible research and a flair for storytelling to make this both academic and exciting. I began reading the book hoping to learn more about Russia and Peter the Great, but Massie is much more ambitious than that and describes the socio-political climate throughout Europe during Peter's era. It provides a wonderful history lesson and is certainly as thorough as most semester long European history classes. I cannot recommend this book enough to anyone interested in history or enjoys exciting stories about heroic emperors, wars, politics, and foreign cultures. Do not let the length scare you off, this will be one of the best historical books you ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best history book ever","review":"I teach history and have read a lot of books.

Not that it isn't fascinating and full of facts, it's just a little repetitive at times and prone to lengthy asides about characters other than Peter the Great. That said, I can't put it down but then I have always been drawn to books about military campaigns, and there's lots of that here.

I find them mildly amusing (especially the whoopie cushion), but I also find them troubling. I like the premise -- two kids writing their own comic books, their principal turning into an underwear-clad superhero -- but what bothers me is that in the kids' comic strips, the author has purposely misspelled dozens of words, as if ignorant children have written the captions. For the adults this is cute, but for the children who read these cartoons over and over again these misspellings will become fatally etched in their memories.

My children found the whole premise silly and the whole concept vulgar. I must tend to agree. There is wonderful children's lit being written today. Why does it have to be this?

Buy it. I was entertained by the movie from start to end. But there are a few things in the process of the story that will make you say \\"huh?\\" , for example the \\"collector\\" sets up very clever deadly traps in the victims home.., reminiscent of the SAW movies..., creates hidden triggers and trip-wires that can set them off..., but... inexplicably... dumps about a dozen huge klunky metal bear-traps in the middle of the living room floor. The bear traps are totally out of joint with the care, precision and cleverly hidden placement of the other traps. Anyway... it's a small issue, and doesn't detract from the movie.

He never even whispers a word but emits animalistic sounds of rage and pain that would loose the bowls of the most stout-hearted man. However, I did wonder how he had the time to set up all his elaborate traps.The backstory is weak and there are a few arbitrary characters but the core of the story is solid.After watching this movie don't be surprised if you find yourself double and triple-checking your home security system every evening!Every horror fan will enjoy The Collector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Poor acting, poor directing as the horror effects were mediocre and the sequence of the events were kind of slow and boring.To be extremely honest I didn't complete it because it was that boring and dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collector","review":"What an awesome movie ,I haven't jumped like I did with this movie in many years.! Hold on to seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"House Party...","review":"A safecracker (Josh Stewart) breaks into a large home in order to steal a huge, uncut gemstone. Everything seems fine until he realizes that he's not alone in the house. Alas, a spidery killer has already arrived, spun many traps, and taken hostages. What's a thief to do? He needs the precious stone for a debt, and the family being held captive is obviously doomed without his help. He tries to escape, but finds many obstacles and hidden surprises. This will be a long, hellish night. Perhaps his last. THE COLLECTOR is a fast-moving chiller w/ a very creepy madman! This guy (Juan Fernandez) is the best I've seen since Beatrice Dalle! A true hunter / killer on a mission! This is one vicious movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off Tha Chain & Tha Hook","review":"For those who like slash and suspence,,this is tha one for u..the only thing I didn't like was that the low lighting was too low during 95% of the movie..I guess low light added to the suspence....I was gonna give 4 stars because of low lighting,but the Movie is tooooo interesting and action filled.....Perfect show for slasher flick fanatics..."},{"rating":"2","title":"JigSaw on the Loose","review":"When you see this film you think of Saw due to all the gadgets, traps etc. All windows and doors sealed shut, you're trapped inside trying to save people but one false move can cost you a body part (if you're lucky)A thrilling movie and I see a part 2 in the works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collector","review":"Another film sent right to dvd. These films tend to be better than some think. So what is this films about? A guy breaks into a home to still a jewl and ends up not being the only person breaking into the house. Fist off, there were more traps in this film than there were in Saw IV, V, and VI combined. They were very clever and very cool. Lots of suspense and blood/gore scenes as well. The collector is a creepy SOB who you wish would get what he deserves. You can kind of figure out how it's going to end after a certain scene, though it doesn't always look like thats whats going to happen. it's a fun sadistic film to watch late at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"no subtitles","review":"That's not equal access to deaf or hard of hearing people because I am deaf myself and can't view this film since it does not have subtitles so i automatically reject this movie since its inconsiderate of others."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Torture porn","review":"I like a good slasher movie as much as the next guy but when you don't have a very good plot and you start focusing more on the torture of people, then you lose me. Yeah, there are some good shocks in this one but my idea of entertainment is not seeing someones lips sewn together or seeing someone mutilated....on screenThese guys took the Saw formula and went with it and they need to take some script writing classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"new fav movie","review":"i loved this movie it is one of the best suspenseful thrillers i have ever seen, didn't really mind all the blood and gore"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"This movie is very well made. The atmosphere is excellent, its super creepy as a horror slasher flick should be, the effects are awesome and the story is well played out and leaves in open in a great way for a sequel the likes of Halloween II. Very pleased and look forward to part 2."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"I rented this movie, along with alot of others, and i was kind of in a rush to return them, so i had to watch this one, in a rush, so i don't know if that is what not making me like this film, or what. But, Evrything was too fast paced, and alot of things didn't make sense. I Think i will stick with my B Movies :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Collector","review":"I saw this film at the theater. A BIG let down. Completely predictable, and the plot doesn't make much sense considering the time-frame in which all of the things in the film took place. This film might be scary/spooky if you just started watching scary movies or you are a child. At least I only spent $4 on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pollector","review":"Americans, dumb teens and all around sadists are the only ones who probably will \\"enjoy\\" this mindless pile of dung.Yes, this film is pretty inadequate. This torture nut wasn't a \\"collector\\" of humans; all he did was mutilate them to death. The plot is so paper thin, however, that having an execrable torture killer is rendered virtually meaningless. Well, he had some pretty insufferable special traps all over the house and tortures the family throughout the film.The film is not scary, in fact it's laughable at points. If you ONLY want to see torture with zero atmosphere, suspense, or true scares then go for it.It's extremely sadistic and gruesome. It's rubbish like this that does a disservice to the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A plot-hole filled disasterpiece","review":"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie when it was in theatres. So, i just rented it exclusively at blockbuster and was just terrible. The movie would have been better if it were more realistic. The way all the traps were set up, it would take a mathematical genius for hoursto do that! And some how the collector did it in the blink of an eye. So, there were many more plot-holes, and idiotic things in this movie. Don't buy it, rent it first. The only thing this movie proved is that it doesn't take a lot of money to make some gore scenes. I will credit the movie for it's hore scenes. Basically, if you're looking a story lacking, pointless gory mess, then this is the movie you'll want!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to the horror genre","review":"I have watched a lot of crap movies and my day, but this takes the cake. It is completely stupid with not one element that you can even latch onto to try to pull some semblance of enjoyment out of it. If you want to watch useful gadgets, rent a Terry Gilliam movie. If you can honestly say you enjoyed this, then you must celebrate mediocrity to a fault. This is a barley D- movie. I am also of the opinion that the SAW movies should have stopped at one and that they are just as bad as at the jail bait factory we call Disney channel now. Instead of wasting 90 mins on this crap, read a book and celebrate feeding your brain some substance for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"The fact that there is a 4 star average out of over 40 reviews for this movie really has me concerned for society, and what the future of horror movies could possibly turn into. Ive seen some really bad horrors in my time but this one fights for the top spot. Nowhere in this rambling nonsense was there even the slightest attempt to make the audience connect with any of the characters. There was no beginning or end. It was what should have been one 10 minute scene in the middle of a movie just stretched to 90 minutes of anti-climactic uninspired obnoxious torture scenes. You never find out anything about who the killer is or why hes there. And what little story there is with the remaining characters is completely irrelevant to the movie. This does not compare to saw at all. Saw had meaning behind it, everything happened for a reason. Each characters existence was explained. I would rather watch Jeepers Creepers or The Happening on repeat than have to sit through this garbage again"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE COLLECTOR","review":"This movie sucks. The acting is bad the camera and editing is bad and the plot sucks. I knew a movie like this about a guy breaking into a house would be hard to make interesting, you need really good acting which it doesn't have, and the camera angles musical soundtrack and everything else about this movie doesn't help it. I rented this movie for four dollars, and I wish I could get my money back. I barely made it through the first five minutes This movie is not worth watching. Anyone who gave this more than one star probably has something to do with its production."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO MANY HOLES!","review":"This movie is terrible. There are too many things not explained, and so many questions you wonder like how or why? It's a terrible plot, too low budget, and not really all that impressive either.

Perhaps the translation into English has casued this, but the book is a hodge-podge of dates and names, the latter often tossed off as if the reader is already famliar with them. There is nearly nothing about the daily lives of the millions of people involved in this long period of human history, as the narrative, what there is of it, flits from decade to decade. A fine example of why many people hate history. Perhaps David McCullogh should turn his gaze toward Rome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored me to tears","review":"I think everyone who knows me know that I love history. Even so, this book was one of the most dry, tedious things that I have ever read. This book exhibits exactly what the problem is with the way that history is taught in schools today. It was page after page of unpronounceable names, meaningless dates, and useless terminology. There was not even the slightest attempt at making history a continuous flow, connecting the dots or making it interesting with narrative. In addition, the author seemed to focus the most extensively on the most complex and boring aspects of history such as economics and population numbers. Mind-numbing. The only reason it gets even two stars is because it contains some good material that I can use as a reference later when bare facts and figures are needed. Lots of information; no presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"unacceptable conjdition","review":"I was promised a used but unmarked text.

In other words, I add tracks, and they do transfer onto the device, but the device doesn't see them. I know they're there because I can look at the files via Windows Explorer. But they're not there if I try to access them on the device itself. So basically I'm stuck with what's on it, and it's only 56% full.I'm going to do some research and buy an ipod or something else.

The recomended reading appendix has led me to seek out the books of several authors who I would not otherwise have read.The book is full of atmosphere, arcane ideas and oldschool art work.

Seeing how true rap music almost doesn't even exist with the advent of hip-hop, do yourself a favor and get this cd.

This CD is basically side 1 of the now impossible to find (trust me, I've tried) 1987 XXX posthumous \\"Live\\" album, and the \\"I Hate The Rich\\" single. But that's more then enough.

The 70's did provide listners with an excellent array of artists. But with Steely Dan, we are left with yet another lounge jazz-rock band, whom you are better off spending $4 for a screwdriver at your local Ramada Inn's bar and listening to their house band, than spending the $12 it costs to buy this, or any other Steely Dan CD. In simple terms, the music is corny and generic beyond belief. And the lyrics are reminiscent of an elementary school's poetry fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply one of the best albuns ever recorded in music history","review":"I love Steely Dan, it is perhaps my favourite band of all time, as far as music is concerned. With reference to the lyrics I simply have no opinion as my knowledge of english language doesn't allow me and I find it quite difficult to understand. But that doesn't matter to me at all. The music is superb, the arrangements are fabulous. This sweet music that mingles rock, jazz, blues, soul is simply awesome, to my musical taste. And then in this album we have, apart from the genius Donald Fagen & Walter Becker, the collaboration of some of the greatest musicians of all time such as Bernard Purdie, Tom Scott, Chuck Rainey, Larry Carlton, Steve Gadd, Don Grolnick, Michael McDonald, Victor Feldman, Joe Sample, Wayne Shorter, just to name a few. No more words needed. Just hear it, you'll be fascinated just as I was when I first heard it many years ago.

If you are new to the Dan get this! The only album by Steely Dan that you should avoid is 'Gaucho'. It came right after 'Aja' and it really isn't that great.

I never paid much attention to Steely Dan during the 70's, due to the fact that I was \\"caught up\\" in the Bee Gees.

It's got a snappy chorus and excellent lyrics (\\"They call Alabama the Crimson Tide-- call me Deacon Blues\\")Definately not one to be passed by, this album is a must-have.

When I ran across this SHM-CD version of Aja and read about the Super High Material description I thought I'd take a chance and buy it thinking that it could sound almost as good as SACD. Well guess what, I was right, in fact I was absolutely blown away at the level of resolution this CD possessed. I have a high resolving stereo system and have been an avid audiophile for over 35 years and know when I hear something exceptional. I had Aja in record form, cassette, and cd form and was quite familiar with this recording but not until I heard this SHM-CD version was I finally satisfied with the sound quality. I am now in search of other SHM-CD's, they rival SACD and any cd player can read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best album","review":"Ask yourself this, if you have a decent \\"classic rock\\" station in your hometown: when you look at the track list to Aja what songs do you see that you might have heard played?Chances are you will have said \\"Deacon Blues,\\" \\"Peg,\\" \\"Josie.\\" Dig a little deeper and you might have heard \\"Home At Last,\\" \\"Aja\\" and \\"Black Cow.\\" Heck, I know I have heard \\"I Got The News\\" on a deep cuts show or two. That's every durn cut on the album. That's how classic this set is.Yes, it is the height of the California sound- smoothed out jazz flavored mellow weed influenced yuppie music, but damn if there has ever been any record that goes down smoother. This is math music, every note laid down precisely. No room here for the wonderful noise of punk that was bubbling up at the time.And unlike say, Gaucho or Everything Must Go, Aja manages to inject some real soul into the music. Simply put Aja is Donald and Wally at their best of best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musicianship Wins Every Time","review":"By far - the best Steely Dan album of them all.Great songwriting combined with a who's-who list of some of the finest musicains of their era equals a classic that will be played and played by every generation that has an ear for musicianship at it's highest level.Witty, humorous, cutting, biting, sarcastic, jazzy, funky, rocking.Aja is all of that and more.This album finds \\"a groove\\" beginning with the opening track and never wavers.An often overlooked classic that should be in every collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Probably the best record of all time for it's genre in my opinion.

The sound quality is little better, if any at all, than a standard CD. Given the fanatical devotion that Steely Dan has always shown to recording quality, I just can't believe this is a representation of the master tape. So while I highly recommend the music, this version is just too much money for too little quality. Buy a standard CD and use the savings to get some of the other fine SACD and DVD-Audio Steely Dan (and Donald Fagen) offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Album Of All Time?","review":"I think the title of this note might very well be the case. Every song is (painstakingly) honed to perfection. It sounds like I'm just gushing but I swear to bog it's true. I have loved Steely Dan and William Burroughs and all of their post-human sickness since the age of 13. I once planned to have Deacon Blues played at my funeral.

I urge every older person out there to share this album with someone below the age of 25. My mom did and I am glad she did. However, (here comes the fickle part) you should really play this album in the original album order to get the full effect (program your player in this order: 2,3,7,1,6,4,& 5). Nevertheless, when America is surveyed for the great things accomplished in this century, this album will hopefully make that list...along with John Coltrane's A Love Supreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you do not own this album, YOU MUST PURCHASE!!!","review":"Back from a time when music was actually music.

I really disliked this movie because it lacked any excitement in my opinion. The one part of this movie that excited me was the end of the movie. In a way I do beleive that the director did give clues to the ending due to all the unrealistic things that happened to the man. There is very little dialogue in this movies and i think that is something that contributed to making this such a movie. In the movie the only type of music was an old, boring type of singing which added to making this one of the worst movies i have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge","review":"This short film was not real interesting to me because it had very little dialogue. The surprise ending was not real good. The director did give a few clues away for the ending. I think the film could have used more dialogue. The film needed more speaking and less music. I would not recommend anyone to get this video. I would recommend someone to make the film better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film...Terrible Reproduction","review":"I first saw this film (16mm) when I was in school. I was delighted to recently discover that the original was available in more modern formats. My delight was short lived. One would think that in this \\"digital\\" age a reproduction would be as good if not better than the original...WRONG! The reproduction is shadowed, faded, scratchy- sounding, and overall, certainly NOT worth the money. I sincerely hope that someone with a sense of cinema history and the necessary technological skills would take-on the project of creating a competent reproduction of this film to prevent its loss to future generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man's last breath","review":"Much like \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", this movie explores that last bit of resistance or fight to avoid death and progress on to the after life. The movie uses the geometry of the surrounding countryside, sound and contrast, to illustrate the emotions and pain of the last instant of life. The movie ends with the opening of a gate to a beautiful plantation representing a returning to home or heaven. The movie is best viewed first then viewed once again after reading the short story \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\\". My two favorite sequences are when our main character gives up his pocket watch symbolizing a seperation from his earthlyness, and finally the return home through an arched grove of trees leading to a purly gate opening to a plantation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better DVD version","review":"For those fans of this film looking for the highest video quality, the best option is probably the DVD version released in France, containing \\"Occurrence\\" and the other two Bierce stories also adapted by filmmaker Enrico. The French DVD has very high video/audio quality, and of course nearly all dialogue in the filim is spoken in English.

There is a disclaimer at the beginning of the film that suggests the distributor has done its best to get a clean copy of the film. I have a hard time believing that this is anything other than an old kinescope film shot off a TV monitor back when it aired on the Twilight Zone and then fuzzied up to remove video artifacts. Scratches are to be expected, but this film is so dark as to be nearly unwatchable. Even the free version on YouTube is better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"It depends on your audience but...","review":"The DVD starts with the warning that the film is old and the DVD has not been cleaned up in any way. Gee..it would help if that warning was right next to the title on Amazon. Some scenes were hardly visible onscreen. As an adult, I could appreciate some of the scenes and look past the murky audio and blurry visuals, but I dreaded even attempting to show this to my eleventh grade students. They HATED it! It was an interesting interpretation for its time, but the part where Peyton runs toward his wife and runs toward his wife and runs toward his wife and...ad nauseum...it looks like a 60s hair commercial. \\"The closer she gets the better she looks.\\" I know what the director was trying to do, and it may have worked back then, but my kids, were moaning, \\"Come ON, already!\\" It's worth a look if you have some film students who will appreciate the effects and directorial choices, but do not buy this in hopes of clarifying the original story for your high school students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst digital copy of a great film.","review":"The original was a personal, formative, esthetic milestone.

It was this film, which aired as the last \\"new\\" episode of the original classic TV series way back in 1964. Along with its Oscar, it also won an award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1962. Rod Serling's tacked-on narration for the \\"Twilight Zone\\" airing is just as appropriate today as it was back then: \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge--in two forms, as it was dreamed, and as it was lived and died. This is the stuff of fantasy, the thread of imagination...the ingredients of the Twilight Zone.\\"It may not have any explosions or erratic editing for the kiddies, but it's a great little film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Oscar-winning film!","review":"This DVD (which I'm returning) contains a very poor, degraded copy of the Oscar-winning film, as editted, dubbed and re-titled for \\"The Twilight Zone.\\" The lack of the ORIGINAL film (not repackaged for TZ), or any of the original credits makes me seriously question whether this is even an authorized release. Only the TZ-style onscreen credits remain. Very disappointing presentation of what is otherwise a beautiful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT FILM THAT WILL REMAIN WITH YOU FOR A LIFETIME!","review":"I am 36 years old. I read the book and saw the movie when I was in the 9th grade. I am ordering the book here on line and have not seen the movie since then. The fact that I remember this story so well after all of these years should be proof enough that it is truely a work of art. It served our class as the perfect forum for discussion, and a fine example of literary expertise. Though it is a very short work, it captures all of the power, suspense and drama of a feature length film.

In any case, it is so dark that almost all detail disappears. In some sections it's hard to make out what's going on at all. This version was produced by Monterey Media.

This is not in doubt, and historian's tend to forget the American ones. Tarleton's record HAS been misinterpreted over the centuries, but I felt that the author spent too much time trying to exonerate his idol from obvious charachter flaws. The bottom line is that the British Legion used very harsh tactics during the war and the commander WAS responsible for his men, whether he was there or not. I found myself thinking of the excuses used at Nuremberg in 1945-46. The author did dispell many of the myths but the idol worship needed to be toned down a bit.

Although his escapades could at times rival those of Indiana Jones, he would not be admired today for his secretive collection methods (he refused to divulge where some of his artifacts came from, making collectors who own some of his pieces today -- myself included -- only guess at their actual origins). Although not the greatest autobiography, the book is interesting in that it explains much about the approach to archaeology in the late 19th and first half of the twentieth centuries, with Ilton typical of the many less-than-professional \\"history hunters\\" of that era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews before you buy","review":"Not a retro.

I, for one, find it quite a refreshing turn that Martel has the depth and creativity to find such different topics to write about with such command.There is no doubt that sex (and quite explicit for that matter) plays an important part in Martel's foray into understanding the dichotomy of humanity. However, he is not covering any unknown territory. If you can read the sexual content as part of the larger context of identity crisis, you will find that Martel is absolutely compelling, even illuminating about human nature.Why should a reader cheer Pi more than the protagonist of 'Self'?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Indulgent Beyond Belief","review":"I am a Canadian living in Los Angeles and had read Martel's earlier books of short stories which don't seem to be available here. I enjoyed them and looked forward to reading a full novel from him. I was gravely disappointed. Martel seems to think very highly of himself and it comes through in the writing. Stick to short stories, Mr. Martel, and try to return to reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riding The Coattails of Success - Sellout","review":"I loved Life of Pi. But this book felt like a sellout. I felt that the only reason this book was published was because Life of Pi was so successfull and the gods thought to capitalize on that success. I'm extremely dissapointed in Yann and will think twice about buying anymore of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I read \\"Life of Pi\\" and found it creative, although I didn't agree with some ideas. So, I decided to read another of his books, expecting better.To put it out honestly, you may as well find the worst porn pictures and it would equal this. Most of this book is sexual stuff I hate to even think about. Swears are constant, and unless the author is trying to show the worst the world has to offer, or hell, I am truly disappointed. The idea of having the main character have his gender changed overnight may be okay, but this has even homosexual displays in it. The \\"show don't tell\\" rule should NOT apply to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say imaginative critiquing?","review":"Ms Loewenstein is one of those talented individuals who is able to read verbatim Gloria Steinem in the very words of Shakespeare. This talent she artfully employs in her treatment of Charles Williams. I'm Jewish and a great fan of Charles Williams, one of the authors Ms Lowenstein critiques.Williams, accused by some Christians of being a womanizer, occultist and universalist, is converted by Ms Loewenstein into a femalephobe, witch-hunter and Jew-hater. She does this so convincingly that those unfamiliar with the genius of his works believe her. If you are interested in spirituality and philosophy, or just looking for a crackling novel exploring the dmz between life and death, I cannot more highly recommend this author's works (I of course mean Williams's works, not those of Lowenstein)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Documentation of Anglo-Irish War","review":"Most certainly one of the best books pertaining to the troubles from 1916-1922 to have survived over the years.Dan Breen in great detail describes his ascendancy to the top rung of the organization then known as the Irish volunteers (Later the IRA) in his native county Tipperary and the ensuing life on the run, the inevitable price to be paid for his part in the Soloheadbed Ambush in 1919, which arguably launched the Anglo-Irish War. His description of some of the leading characters of the day, most notably Michael Collins and Eamon de Valera, are as valuable as his tragic insights into the Civil War following the Peace Treaty of 1921, including his tireless efforts to bring peace between both the Free State and the Republicans.I have an extensive library that includes masterpieces by Ernie O'Malley, Tom Barry, and Pat Deasy, among others, but I still believe this might be the best account yet, always worth re-reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all downhill since Screamadelica","review":"Don't know why I still give each of Primal Screams new releases a try , since everythings been getting progressively worse . It's nice when artists grow and mature but these guys seem to have gotten caught in some sort of terrible electronica trap .

In their furious desire to embrace a band 'that matters' they have grabbed on to the incoherent and hypocritical adolescent rantings of Bobby Gillespie and co. The first four tracks on this album are of top quality, if somewhat derivative of the Stooges and Velvet Undergound circa White Light/White Heat. They also owe a lot to Mani's exquisite driving basslines, honed in the early 90s with the Stone Roses. After that however, it falters badly. A terrible attempt at white-boy rap with 'Pills';a jazz-rock fusion which Soft Machine would have been ashamed of; a remix of a track already on the album; and the inclusion of a MBV remixed track which had already been released a year ago. Album of the year? I really don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORIGINAL BUT LOUD AS YOU-KNOW-WHAT","review":"There is some stuff on this album that sounds like nothing else out there - the best way I could describe it would be funky dance music with ridiculously huge basslines and major overdrive fuzzbox guitar coming through a noisy as hell broken amp sound. Basically, it sounds like Screamadelica meets Loveless turned up to 11. So if you appreciate hearing some new thing, get this disc. HOWEVER, this is one noisy album and you won't be listening to it on repeat. In other words, it's easier to admire this than to actually enjoy it. If you thought PSYCHO CANDY or LOVELESS were hard on the ears - forget it. They sound like those New Age whale tapes compared to this. I listened to this record cranked up on a discman, and it made me stomach sick it was so harshly produced. So get it but don't listen to it through headphones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"killl all hippies","review":"No seriously kill all Hippies. Bobby and the boys continued right where they left off with Vanishing Point, but with a total venegence-borderline terrorism. This record rocks man. Total anarchy, destruction, frustration, angst, and just a smiggeon of hope for a better place. This is a great cd to work out to and paint to. If you dig intelligent techno, chaotic punk, dirty grunge, and buttload of angst do yerself a favor and check this album out."},{"rating":"2","title":"XPLSV!","review":"On Primal Scream's latest disc, we discover that Bobby Gillespie's three favorite words are \\"f-ck,\\" \\"sick,\\" and \\"syphilitic.\\" I don't know whether I've heard the word \\"syphilitic\\" in a song before, but Gillespie manages to sing it at least 6 times on 3 different tracks.Primal Scream have been putting out work for a few years now, and, at a point in their career when most bands are sinking into oblivion, they've offered up what many consider to be their best album yet. It is a determinedly angry and surprisingly fresh set, ripe with social-not to mention colorful-references. Definitely worth a listen, as long as you don't mind the odd run-in with syphilis and whatnot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attacking the fibre of society on the dancefloor","review":"From what I've read this is a return to form for Primal Scream. This album being my initiation to the band, I have no foundation from which to launch an opinion on *that* topic. However, in regards to this album: it is one of the best albums of the new millenium, hands down. There's a reason why the artwork for the album is military in style. The mission of this record is to attack whatever notion of music, dance or otherwise, you had, completly destroy it, and then rebuild your beliefs from the ground up. The album as a whole sounds like a war, albeit a pleasant sounding one that you can carry on the dancefloor. You'll shake your booty with \\"Kill all Hippies,\\" \\"Accelerator\\" (which was seemingly recorded in a metsl trash can), \\"Swastika Eyes\\" and \\"Keep Your Dreams,\\" and at the end you can bet your vision of music of 21st Century music will be nearly parallel with Bobby Gillespie's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year","review":"Best album this year by far... Mind numbing industrial techno noises mixed with full on rock 'n' roll. I only give four stars as 2 versions of Swastika Eyes were included, and they're a bit too similar for my liking... With guest appearances by the Chemical Brothers, Bernard Sumner and Death In Vegas this was always going to be one top album. My personal favourite is Swastika Eyes, it reminds me a lot of New Order, but there isn't a duff track on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Fury","review":"I have all the Primals CDs and Screamadelica was always unquestionably the best. I've been praying every time a grab a new album from them that something like the experience of first hearing the beats and notes of 'Slip inside this house' would happen again. Vanishing Point didn't quite hit the mark except perhaps with Kawalski and their other albums... well. um. Ok, so back to the present, i knew they could do it, this albums was so awesome that when i first listened to it on the new speakers in my car i blew out the odometer. Listen for the Jet engine sound rising in the background of Song 2 for two minutes and the organ sounds rising and falling to begin swastika eyes. i can't sit down when i listen to this. If you love the Boos, MBV, Death in Vegas or the Chemicals you know your music, and you WILL love this.

If you are looking for a guide book to the Sea of Cortez, this book has little to offer.

The three main threads of his complaint are the ecological devastation, how the native peoples were taken advantage of by the various colonizers, and how his one year old marriage seems to be on the rocks. When he talks about the stark beauty of the land, it is always in the same breath with how badly the place is getting ruined.I read the book when I was in Baja California Sur in May, 2003. The place was beautiful, the weather was great and the people were extremely friendly. The book's doomsday predictions were very much out of whack with the reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homage to ego","review":"Not just whiny, but pretentious. The writer is a good adventurer.

The stories about Jackson's children and her trials with her old home are charming, but the overall effect is achingly dated. Was there really a time, not so long ago, when women cared deeply about whether they served coffee in mugs or demitasse cups? If so, hurrah for women's lib.This book is good for nostalgia, if you want to remember a time when moms stayed home with their kids, couples played bridge, and the most rascally thing a kid could do was throw rocks at the neighbor's boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the going got tough, she got going!","review":"Shirley Jackson had three highly animated children which she, more or less, kept in check. I admired the way she told her trials in an always up-beat slightly humorus but usually exhasperated style. That is a main point that made me want to keep reading. It was not a dark dramatic book ,which it very well could have been. While reading, it really made me want to \\"keep my chin up\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appeals to those with children","review":"I bought this book after reading an intriguing review on it, it's an \\"oldie but a goodie.\\" The dialog between the mother in the story, who is also the narrator, and the small children is priceless. Humor abounds....and parents with small children will feel they have \\"come home\\" in the description of the daily activities. Having this book written in the 50s only adds to the charm and whimsy. This is an excellent read, and potentially a sleeper since it was written a while back in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I have read many of Shirley Jackson's mystery novels and loved all of them!But, when my mom suggested that i read this book and said that it was funny, i thought she was being sarcastic, but i laughed from the time i opened the book until i read the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite!!","review":"First read this in high school. My sisters and I used to read the chapters back and forth to each other and get hysterical. Shirley Jackson had an unusual family and certainly knew how to present them to the reader.

This is a lot of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My least favorite Sabbath album, but still good.","review":"After the great Vol. 4, I knew that Black Sabbath couldn't quite get up to expectations for the next album. And although this album is good, there are a fow songs I could live without.One thing I have to say is that Rick Wickman was both a bless and a curse for this band. He performed and really helped on some great tracks (Sabbra Cadabra), but also played on absolute ...(Who Are You).That said, there are some good songs, like the title song, National Acrobat, Killing Yourself to Live, and Fluff. However, there are some really pretensious songs that are just out of place, like Who Are You? The song's synthizisers are enough to drive one crazy. Also, Looking For Today is just bland. It feels like a throwayay. And Spiral Architect, despite having a great intro, sounds too 70's arena rock to me, especially when the band kicks in.All in all, it's a decent album. Nothing too great, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these guys kiding. They got nothing!!","review":"Ive never heard more anoying music in my life.Are these guys trying to play music.

The album is pleasant, far from awful, but not as good as we'd expect. The title track is the only real standout, some of the others tracks like Killing Yourself to Live are ok, but don't really count as classics. The Best stuff on this one can be found on We Sold Our Soul For Rock n Roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow decline...","review":"This was the beginning of a long, slow decline for an early Sabbath fan like me. I remember eagerly buying the vinyl when it came out in early '74 and was a mite dissappointed at how silly it sounded....The title track is a ridiculous Spinal Tap type of tune that skipped after all the times I scratched it with the needle. The only tune of merit (IMO) is Sabbra Cadabra which should always be included on any Greatest Hits CD that they release. The rest is just endless vamping...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy sabbath release","review":"This review is for the shm sacd. I can't figure this release out. I mean it is all over the place. A song starts out soft and then gets louder towards the end. It's almost unlistenable. I'm guessing it was the original recording based on the insert that mentions DSD being transferred from the analog master tapes. The whole thing isn't a total waste but damn near close. Not worth the current price tag. Paranoid and the first release are far better sounding and very recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Awesome!","review":"While not as entertaining (at least to me) as the previous Vol.4, this one is definately one for anyone's metal collectoin. Definately one of Sabbath's most diverse records, though. The synthesizers and string arrangements comliment Sabbath nicely on songs such as Who Are You? and Spiral Architect. And the harder songs such as the title track, Killing Yourself To Live and A National Acrobat all live up to Black Sabbath's metal tradition. Tony Iommi was, is, and forever will be the master of metal riffs. Looking For Today I like because of its lyrical content; it's the complete and un-varnished truth! and Sabbra Cadabra's piano break-down at the end of the song just wraps the song up nicely. Overall, I would sya if your a fan of metal and like a little diversity, this one's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another 5 star CD","review":"With the exception of Fluff, I liked every song on this album. The title track was obviously a classic. I'd have to say that Spiral Architect was my second favorite song. Tony Iommi really flexed his acoustic expertise.

This is not useful if you are trying to teach your kids to read or increase vocabulary.

I had hoped that this experience would be different. Not only is the book too wordy, but the entire story was a disappointment. There are so many other great books out there about dysfunctional families that this one pales by comparison. I can't imagine any family as close as the Mulvaney's are at the beginning of the story reacting to the tragedy like they did, namely Corinne and Michael, Sr. Truly loving parents stand by their children especially after a tragedy like Marianne suffered. The other major complaint I have is that it reads like a Russian novel... every character has at least one nickname and sometimes two! This novel could have been edited down to half its size and still have gotten the message across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Get To the Point","review":"This book drove me crazy. You must read 100 pages to fine out what the book is about. It's obvious that the author likes to write and write and write. Meanwhile, the reader gets lost more than once wondering what is going on!! I did not like the Mulvaneys. What kind of mother would send her only daughter, a true victum, away and stay with her selfish, drunken husband? It seems as though she did not have any compassion at all! And this was a GOOD family???? I just finished \\"Sing Me A Bawdy Song\\" and it is a truly great book that moves along.

I'd have a hard time recommending this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping for much more","review":"When I opened the book I was very excited to start reading this book. I was quickly bored and found myself struggling through it. There were few parts when I was intrigued and happy I stuck it out, but I was bored shortly after that. I wasn't a fan of the writing style, which didn't help much. I did find the family dynamics and how the events played out interesting, but it was lacking a hold power for.

It is the story of a family that had respect, a father that wanted to be a considered somebody, a mother that didn't solcialize well and children in their teens all trying to fit in somehow. The characters are all very well developed. The situations and time passing changes are truthful and yet unexpected.The trouble with this book is that a college professor should know that a book written by one person can not be all knowing. It makes me wonder if Joyce Carol Oates actually wrote this piece of work. It is not her style and certainly not the quality of work one would expect from someone teaching others in a higher education capacity.This book has a message and gives a great deal of food for thought, and even has characters in it we can all point to as someone we know or are, but who really wrote it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through","review":"Some reviewers have describe this book as \\"tedious\\" and \\"over descriptive\\". I must agree with them, it took me over a month to finish this book, not because of lack of time, simply because I just could not get myself motivated enough to finish it. The first 100 pages are rather boring, I don't believe such a \\"perfect\\" little family exist anywhere as she describes this family in the first chapters. This book did hit home though, especially towards the end. Mrs. Oates is a brilliant writer and I am not questioning her writing, but this book was rather long and not engaging enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flaws Abound","review":"Oates creates a family where the wrong people are supported, potential is crushed, the foolish in heart roam without thought of the harm they inflict on others. All of the complexities flow back to the main theme of the book; that the father must be shielded from the indelibale truth that he cannot protect his daughter from a horrible event. The rape that takes place is a violation of each element of the Mulvaney family, and each person in the household accquiesses to the mothers plea for the father's life to be restored to normality.All throughout this book, I wanted to scream, shout and claw my way into Oates' world, as the Mulvaneys problems seem so simple to fix. But the simplest solutions are never followed in this tragedy, and the theme of coming home becomes a rendevous with the mistakes of the past... and for the Mulvaneys, they are too bitter to contemplate.Buy this Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I finished the book out of a sense of obligation","review":"My sister gave this to me as a birthday present knowing that I had enjoyed books that seemed to be of a similar nature in the past. Unfortunately, this book was tedious, took forever to develop, and then scattered itself in a manner that caused confusion and broke the events into pieces that diced any interest I had developed in the characters and their lives. While this is by no means the worst book I have ever read, I can't say that I would ever read it again or recommend it to another. In fact, when I move at the end of the month, I can honestly say this book has a very good chance of winding up in the pile to go to Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably boring","review":"This book was so boring, I can't believe I read the whole, long, drawn out thing. I kept hoping it would get better, but trust me, it doesn't. I agree with what others have said; underdeveloped characters that you don't really care about, too much irrelevant detail, too much getting off on tangents that were hard to follow. I wish I would have read the reviews before reading this book, but my husband gave it to me as a \\"gift\\". The best thing about the book is that it's so boring it's a good remedy for insomnia. And, to make a boring book worse, the parents who were first portrayed as a good mom and dad who really loved their family, behaved in a disgusting manner toward their raped daughter. It was too revolting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carol, What Were You Thinking?","review":"Unfortunately, this was the first book I have ever read by Joyce Carol Oates. It will probably be my last. By no stretch of the imagination could the people at the beginning of the book have turned out to be the ones at the end of the book. Sure, people change. But that much? Oh, please..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare Me More Oates","review":"It is hard to say what I found more more irritating -- this tedious and overwrought saga of the most boring family since \\"Father Knows Best,\\" or Joyce Carol Oates ability to describe paint dry in fourteen pages or more. WHERE was the story? How are we to believe that any family, especially one brimming with such simple-minded goodness as her Mulvaneys, would so unanimously and wordlessly banish their \\"beloved\\" daughter because she was date-raped? (or was she? this too is vague) How long is the reader expected to believe (or care) that this family's absent-minded sort of denial be considered plausible as a storyline? Is this neverending story meant to \\"explain\\" the father's alcoholism?? Does the family, perhaps, just implode from pure shallowness? If Joyce Carol Oates were to participate with actual humans someday, she might not, so desperately, need to lavish her endless windblown vocabulary on such superficial fiction as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful Reading","review":"I am having a terrible time reading this book through completion. The character development is slow and unrealistic. I am half way through the book and there hasn't been any time spent on focusing on the personal trauma felt by the daughter. Instead, the author continues to focus on the pitiful patriarch and his inability to love his family unconditionally. It is doubtful that I will read another book written by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Although the author is well read and this was an Oprah pick for her book club, I found the book disappointing. It's tedious to read, and many \\"facts\\" are wrong. The characters were very weak - I could not feel sorry for them. The mother and father were very ineffective as parents and in their own little world, especially the mother. The father banished the daughter after the rape as if it was her fault. The daughter as the victim was also in her own little world and not someone you'd expect to act like she did when sexually assaulted.I found the the book left a lot of unanswered questions. Fans of Joyce Carol Oates may like the book although I doubt it, but I could not recommend it for the general reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Were the Mulvaneys","review":"This is a wonderful book. It will make you laugh, cry, and really think. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Felt Like I Was a Mulvaney!","review":"I would like to say that this is an incredable novel! It is so well written, filled with details and vivid pictures, that actually went through many of the emotions with the characters. I don't want to give anything away, but it is an emotional workout. I loved this novel, and will continue to recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Painful... don't buy into the hype","review":"For all the great reviews this book has received, I found it to just be terrible. The writing was overly descriptive and the characters shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help! I'm drowning...","review":"Without doubt this must be THE most depressing novel I have read to date. The only words that come to mind to describe this tedious tale are: bleak, grim, dreary, cheerless, desolate, gloomy, dismal, sad, dragging endlessly on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"The beginning of this book is promising, and as always, Joyce's prose style is captivating; however, the novel soon descends into what has become almost a cliche in the last ten years or so - disintegration due to sexual violation. Personally, I'm tired of reading about it. I'm quite sure there are deep, interesting, even tortured individuals and families in this world who manage to be so for reasons other than incest or rape. Even when faced with those particular difficulties, I am sure that most manage to live rich and rewarding lives without resorting to further emotional or physical violence. I'd rather read about people with the mettle to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?!","review":"I hated this book. Way too long, and totally unrealistic. I find the incident that took place was a ridiculous reason for a whole family to fall apart.Boring, boring and boring.With so many other great books out there, why spend time with this one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't say you haven't been warned!","review":"Words from earlier reviews like, \\"torturous,\\" \\"boring,\\" \\"depressing,\\" are apt descriptions of this book. Was Ms Oates' editor sleeping? This book needed a half dozen more rewrites in order to sift out the nuggets of good writing that get lost in so much angst. I did not accept the complete disintegration of this family. If you must read this book, I found that reading the chapter openings and closings and skipping over the middle sections helped me follow the storyline. But once I read to the finish, I was still baffled and disappointed with \\"We Were the Mulvaneys.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so good....","review":"I read this book for two reasons: i generally like books by joyce carol oates and as a former english teacher i like to keep up with what is being read by the masses and usually oprah's book club books are very popular. i was so disappointed. this book was way to long without the language being intresting. while the subject was good, and one we should look at over and over again in our country, (the subject i mean is one of denial) ms. oates just didn't do justice to the idea that grew in her head. the repetition of animals confused me. how was she using them in this story? were they supposed to be the common bond that kept the family connected? most of the characters were certainly nicer to their animals than to each other. was it a way to show their emotions? i don't know. very confusing. i finished the book because i always try to but i have to admit upon finishing my thoughts were not \\"good one joyce.\\" rather they were \\"whew, glad that's over.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Snoozer!","review":"This book was so disappointing. Putting the shoddy grammatical and spelling errors aside, (did anyone proofread the text before it went to press?) the story is quite disappointing. The author describes things that we really have no need to know about - and does it at inappropriate times of the story. We don't care what color the ceiling was when Marianne was three. Give us a break! The ending is absolutely stupid.Never has so much been written about so little.Do yourself a favor and skip this Oprah book - you'll enjoy \\"House of Sand and Fog\\" or \\"Drowning Ruth\\" much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Winded and Boring","review":"This is not my type of book. She is long winded and her thought process is such that one thought is started at the top of the page and at the bottom of the page she is on to something else and the first thought was never answered. I have tried several times in the past to read her books. And her writing style and my reading style just don't match up. I thought the story line would be good. But its so fragmented that I lost interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, but plot doesn't really thicken....","review":"The author is a great writer. It's a sweeping novel and she touches several subjects. The storyline is great and believable. It makes a person think twice of families that you see that seem so \\"perfect.\\" However, I was a little disappointed - the book was rather anticlimactic. Other than that, it was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"At first, I wished I could give this book zero stars, thinking it had absolutely nothing to offer. However, I did at one time wish to finish reading the book, just to see if it EVER got better. After almost an entire year of letting it sit on the bottom of my nightstand pile while I found other books vastly more interesting, entertaining, and rewarding, I've finally given up on finishing the last >100 pages. It's just not worth the time.We Were the Mulvaneys is dismally depressing, without any apparent purpose. I think most people would be hard-pressed to find a single character for whom they felt any affection or lasting interest.I think it's notable that there are nearly 800 used and new copies for sale, starting at a penny. I paid $1 for my copy at the local library sale. The book is headed back there now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing...","review":"This book generated a lot of hype, due to being a Oprah book club book. I don't think it lived up to the hype. I found much of the plot somewhat unbelievable. I felt as though the reader never truly got to know any of the characters, nor did I grow to care or relate to any of them.Much of the book dragged, only to rush at the end to conclude the storyline and tie everything up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underestimated","review":"Ok, I'll admit that I got rather bored with the first 150-200 pages, but the family's history was an important and necessary part of the book. I had to force myself to read for awhile because the story seemed so uneventful, but that was needed to learn the characters and feel close to them...feeling so close to the characters enabled you to really feel their heartache and happiness. This is an amazing book that brings you through a family's life which began almost sickeningly perfect then dragged through horrific pain, separation, resentment (and pretty much every horrible thing you can think of) and ends making you feel relieved and overjoyed. Honestly I can't even do justice to the book....just read it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get To The Story Already","review":"I found this book to be very confusing. The author creates to many flash backs and after a while you really don't know what's really happening to any of the characters in the book. I know alot of people love animals and so do I, but did she have to go on and on talking about all the animals, who cares. This could have been a wonderfully told story if the author didn't drag on and on talking abouh nothing. I am still trying to finish the book, even though I am not happy with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poked Along","review":"My first time to read Ms. Oates, and unforunately, I was rather disappointed. The story when on forever, the plot lines when all over the place and I never felt much compassion for any member of the Mulvaney family. Way too much description and not enough detail in story content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad","review":"I am pleased to see that I as not the only one disappointed in this book choice. I have reached page 79 and have still to reach the point where my attention or imagination is caught. So far, there are many parts of the story where I get the impression that the author needs to fill up her quota of words. The many lists meant to flesh out the family and their background seem to me to be just that - lists. I am hanging in hoping to reach a point of interest. But so far the book is incredibly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubbish!","review":"What a horrible book! I love to read but getting through this book was nothing short of tedious. I kept waiting for it to get better . . . it never did. First of all, the structure of the chapters made the story move painfully slow. The book constantly back tracked to years past. It made it difficult to muster up any emotion for what was happening to the family because the emotion kept getting lost for me by the story lines changing. Secondly, I never \\"took to\\" any of the characters. In most books there is one character or another who readers can relate to or take a liking to. That never happened with this novel. And lastly, the sentence structure was poor which also made it difficult to read. Sorry, Ms. Oates. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"First book I've read of Oates and now my last.","review":"I could just repeat some of the other one star reviews. This was the first book I've read by Joyce Carol Oates and I probably would not have read it if it had not been recommended by a \\"friend\\". It was one of the most tedious books I have read. I felt that the characters were shallow, that there was practically no wisdom or perception in the book and I have to say I found myself aghast that the father would reject his daughter, supposedly the apple of his eye, because she had been raped. I'm sure Ms Oates is very talented and has much better but with so many Pulitzer Prize and Nobel prize winning authors out there, it's highly doubtful I will read anything else of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put it down before finishing","review":"2/3 through the book and I couldn't stand it any longer! I usually finish a book but it was torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah, please!","review":"My last name is Mulvaney, so naturally I picked this up out of curiosity... Great name, terrible book. I love to read, and usually can't put a book down until it is finished, but this book moved so SLOWLY that I could hardly bear to finish it. I would get this from the public library if you MUST read it. Better have a cup of coffee ready."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving quickly and violently within a family, love contains.","review":"Marianne, the cheerleader and lovable peace-maker in the Mulvaney's, brings the family to doom and destruction through a violent and terrifying experience. The family acts as victims powerless in their approach to this heinous crime committed to their sweet daughter.Joyce Carol Oates shows how each member of the family through distinctly unique methods express their feelings toward the crime, the criminal and the victim. The Mulvaney's show more passion in punishing the perpretrator then consoling the victim.One of the most tender scenes occurs when Muffin, Marianne's dying cat, succumbs in her arms. And her friend, later her husband, relates that Muffin was not the only one that loved her. The Mulvaney's through unending love and pride in themselves triumph to come together in the closing. This family faces life so realistically that you can see it happening to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressed on the farm","review":"Reading is a form of relaxation for me. I love getting caught up in characters and a new world. This book made me extremely depressed and angry. I felt it was NOT a realistic way of dealing with the problem of rape. I wanted to throttle every character in the book except the animals. Rape is real. You deal with it. And move on. For this to ruin everyone's lives was totally ludicrous. I realize we have problems in life but this book truly blew them up. It gave me a serious migraine. It might have been more interesting if the author did not go on and on and on about the most minute things . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It was choppy, the author was all over the place with details that were not needed. And to top it off the parents in the novel made so angry. What kind of woman stands by and ships off her raped teenaged daughter to some cousin she barely knows, all to make her drunk husband happy. And then all he does is stay drunk, lose the business and farm, then dies.Save your time and money and skip this Oprah pick"},{"rating":"1","title":"Achingly slow and full of unnecessary detail","review":"I was upset as I read the positive reviews for this book, wondering if those critics were paid. I have never read a book so achingly slow-moving and tedius, so full of unnecessary details. Oates foreshadows an interesting event, and takes pages and pages building up to it, but as I pour over details, I keep losing interest. Why this was chosen as an Oprah Book Club selection, I have no idea. I hate to put a book down, but I think I'm going to have to end this long-winded torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read It! You'll Hate the Mulvaneys!!! One star is too many!","review":"Just AwfulIt seems I only write reviews when they are negative, but I think this is because I feel so cheated when a book is so horrible that I actually feel angry for having invested my time and money in it. I feel I want to warn fellow readers so they don't make the same mistake I made. This just may be the most long-winded, boring, disappointing book I have read in a long time. The characters were not believable. However, they are gutless and heartless. Imagine abandoning your own daughter because she is the victim of rape, or any crime for that matter. Imagine the daughter accepting this as though she deserves to be treated in such a fashion by her own family. The storyline went nowhere, and the author prattled on and on without ever getting to the point. I stubbornly kept reading in the hope that at some point it would finally draw me in, but NO SUCH LUCK! In addition, the ending left much to be desired. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless tearing at the heartstrings","review":"This book is like a bad soap opera. Supposedly \\"good\\" people make completely incomprehensible choices in service of a poorly thought out plot.The character of Marianne was especially laughable - all the author's effort went into trying to make us feel bad for her sob story instead of painting a believable character. Marianne is the idealized martyr: never angry at the family that inexplicably turns against her. What planet was this girl from? What planet was the father from? It is hard to believe natural selection did not do away long ago with a gene pool without any noticable coping or reality-testing skills.The sad part is that Oates is actually a good writer. I'm not sure what possessed her to write and publish this pathetic tear-jerker."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Oprah's Book Club thinking???","review":"If I borrowed this book from the library, it would have been returned after the first 25 pages. Since I bought it, I tried to give Oates a chance. So much unnecessary, mundane details...you find yourself scratching your head and detemined that \\"SOMETHING has got to happen soon!\\" Well, it never does. I found it extremely unrealistic and dull. Difficult to relate too and unlike most of Oprah's books, never draws you in..."},{"rating":"1","title":"an Oprah disappointment","review":"The primary appeal for me of Oprah's other recommendations has been strong, engrossing characterization. After reading \\"I Know This Much is True\\" I carried the main character around in my head for weeks afterwords. In this book, however, I never came to care at all for the characters. This was particularly frustrating when there were major plot turns (a family disowning a much beloved daughter) that made no sense to me based on the bits of information I'd oreviously gleened from the characters.I concur with another author who stated that the style of moving back in forth in time (which I enjoy in other books) was incredibly annoying in this book. I skipped ahead and skimmed significantly more than I have with any other book.Up to this point, I've felt confident that an Oprah recommendation meant a book I'd be engrossed and engaged in from cover to cover. Not this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraging and sad","review":"Happy family eaten up and torn apart by teen daughter's rape.A bland read, totally forgettable, monotonous. Long and gloomy, little dialogue, tedious, overly descriptive.... Discouraging and sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"I found this book to be very difficult to finish.

If you have a choice between this book and another one...I'd go for the other one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Story","review":"I loved the book. I can't believe it has not received a higher over-all rating than a three. It was realistic, it moved my emotions and held my attention. That is all I have to say about the book. WONDERFUL READING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I finish this book?","review":"I'd heard great things about this book from many different types of people, so maybe my expectations were set a bit high to begin with. But goodness! Talk about a depressing story! And it's not even one that really keeps you locked in. I plowed through it just hoping that I'd find out why people had recommended this to me, and never quite figured it out. I didn't believe in the characters' reactions to the events that occurred, or feel emphathetic to their situations...at all. I had more of a \\"oh, give me a break\\" type reaction from chapter to chapter. Read this book if for some reason you need a downer, because this will definitely do it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster - Walter Dean Myers - By: Lisa Mills","review":"In Monster, sixteen-year old Steve Harmon is in prison for his alleged involvement in a murder. Wanting to be a screenwriter, Steve dictates much of the novel in the form of a screenplay. Like many of Myers' works, this novel is set in Harlem. Themes focus on fear, violence, decision-making, family relationships, and morality. Interestingly, Myers conducted approximately 600 pages of interviews with imprisoned youths prior to writing Monster. In the novel, Steve Harmon never confesses to the crime. However, he cannot write anything in the novel that might suggest his involvement, since the prosecutor might use this information against him. Throughout the book, Steve's primary focus is being released from prison by whatever means necessary. Is this wish granted? Read the novel and find out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH!","review":"For all the hype on this book being a #1 bestseller for several months now, I thought I would have enjoyed it more. I can't even say I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting, inspiring family tale? No. But still a great read","review":"In reading some of the blurbs about this book in the first few pages and on the back cover, one is led to believe that it is an inspiring story about the power of love and the strong bonds of family. I enjoyed this book very much, but I didn't find anything terribly redemptive or inspiring about it. Aside from about the first 50 and the last 20 pages of this 450 page book, it is a sad tale of the Mulvaney family's downward spiral after something terrible happens to daughter Marianne. What I enjoyed most about the book was the author's incredible talents as a storyteller; as one review put it, it seems as though the pages we read are mirrors of real life that the author's prose so perfectly captures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to hold my interest","review":"I found it very difficult to read this book. Usually when reading a book, I can identify with, or LIKE, at least one character. In this book, there was no one! The parents were self-righteous and cold, the brothers were too involved and selfish to care about their sister, except for how the episode affected them, and I lost all respect for the sister, when she would not admit to what happened to her. I felt that she should have thought about any other women he might hurt in the future, and tried to protect them. Like everyone else in her family, she only thought about herself. I have really enjoyed each Oprah book I have read, but this one disturbed me. For the first time in my life, I quickly skimmed through the book after the first 100 pages, and I was able to pick up the storyline! I wish I would have bought another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It took way too long to read this book","review":"Like the title says, it took me forever to read this book. The only time I picked it up was when I had nothing else better to do! This was an incredibly long book that failed to keep my interest. The author writes from the point of view of the youngest son, but fails to really capture anyone but himself and the sister. Hardly any detail was given to any of the other characters in the book. I was definetly disappointed with this being an \\"Oprah\\" book, as most of her selections I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Were the Mulvaneys","review":"While this is not the best written book in Oprah's Club, the story, the character developement and reality of those characters is magnificent.

Unfortunately, it's so slow moving and non eventful, I can hardly stand to finish it. The author jumps all over the place, and from person to person. The character who experienced the rape is hardly dealt with at all. I would NOT recommend spending your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious, frustrating and overwritten","review":"Reading this book was an exercise in frustration. Oates takes three pages to describe an event that could have been summed up in two paragraphs. But beyond that, she never made it clear why the family fell apart. We saw how happily \\"perfect\\" they were prior to the tragic event (cutesy nicknames and all) and then how they fell apart at the seems afterwards. But we never saw WHY. That made the entire second half of the story almost implausible. By the time I got to the end, I was less concerned with what happened to the characters than I was with just FINALLY finishing the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long for such a frustrating story","review":"I had a difficult time finishing this book. The story could have been told in half as many words. I never came to care for any of the characters, they all seemed flawed and weak to the point that I didn't care what happened to them. The rambling style of the narrative is difficult to follow at times. During the first 100 pages I kept waiting for \\"something to happen\\" - but it never did. The end is too neat for such a messy book. I finished the book only as a challenge to myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooring","review":"I have discovered that I am usually disappointed by the books recommended by Oprah.

But it was so badly written that I was able to skim pages of drivel -- long, rambling descriptions that did nothing to advance the story. One example in particular that stands out in my mind was several pages describing the clocks in the house, all the clocks, and how much Marianne loved the clocks and the various sounds they made. Whatever symbolic significance those clocks had could have been expressed in a paragraph instead of 2-3 pages of rambling.I thought the made-for-TV movie starring Beau Bridges and Blythe Danner was much better than the book.This is the first Oates book I've read. I won't be eager to read any more of her novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I read was boring","review":"Thank goodness I got this book from the Library and didn't spend good money on it.

Did Ms. Oates quit writing this two-thirds of the way through and let someone else finish this book? Several of the characters were set on a major collision course and she just dropped the ball! That happily ever after ending was a major letdown. I thought Judd might commit a murder; perhaps Marianne wasn't raped after all; maybe she did instigate that sexual encounter; maybe it was with Michael Sr. since he wanted her banished; what mother banishes a daughter that's been raped?! Give me a break. This story could have been riviting until the last page, but I had to force myself to read the last third of the book.

The writing is needlessly detailed. The character development and story line are not believable. And none of the family members are likeable.

I may pick it up again and try to finish it, but for now I am moving on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE!","review":"I have never been so bored in my entire life! From page 1 I thought WE WERE THE MULVANEYS was an awful read, however, because it was an OPRAH book I thought I would give it a chance. So on I read and the book only got worse and worse. Sure there were a few parts here and there that kept my interest, but overall I could not wait for the end. I know I could have just put it down and stopped reading it all together but I thought, just maybe there would be a big payoff at the end, but the only thing I was left with was DISAPPOINTMENT!!! I urge all of you not to WASTE your time like I wasted mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"I've greatly enjoyed most of Oprah's Book Club books, but this one has been a huge disappointment. I've never read so many words to describe so little action or emotion. Some books you're disappointed to finish, but with this one you keep plodding along toward the end, and then wonder why you bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suicide Inducing","review":"This book is one of the most depressing novels I have ever read. Yes, it is very well written. Oates is a masterful story teller. But the main characters, the Mulvaneys, (with the exception of Marianne) are the most self-absorbed, shallow, deluded and cruel family members you could ever meet. Their actions are inexplicable and unforgivable. Possibly most annoying, the epilogue is so different from the rest of the book and so out of character for this family that it has the tacked-on feel of a bad Hollywood ending. It would have been much more realistic if the book had ended with the episode before the epilogue. If you need to be convinced that life is a dark lonely place and that you can't depend on anyone, including your closet friends and family, this book is for you. If you need a reason to commit suicide, this book could be it. Otherwise, steer clear of the Mulvaneys."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Were the One-Dimensional Mulvaneys","review":"I could barely make it throught this book. If Ms. Oates had spent as much time on character development as she did with the excruciating details of the Mulvaney's homestead, she might have had something. The farm animals have more personality than the people. Whether it's the cheerfully shallow mother, or the superficially gregarious, loving father who turns into an alcoholic ogre, I just couldn't feel anything for these people.Then, to top it all off, the author wraps everything up neatly in a one-chpater epilogue that seems to ignore the magnitude of everything else that's gone on in the book. It seemed false and jarring after the agony of a book rife with boring details."},{"rating":"1","title":"too cluttered","review":"Okay, I will be the odd person and admit that I did not care for the book. I found the text to be too choppy and disjointed. On more than one occasion, I was confused as to what exactly was going on in the story. Finally, after struggling to get at least half way through the book, I flipped through the remainder just to find out what the heck was going on. I love most of Oprah's list but this is one of those few that I wish I had not purchased or wasted time on..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Novel 101","review":"Usually, a master of the craft of writing fiction, in We Were the Mulvaneys, Oates has created a textbook with which to teach the elements of fiction. I felt manipulated by this book. All the trite devices were included to jerk the reader's emotional strings. The characters did not really breathe but went through their paces. Like a painter working from photographs, Oates seems to be working from popular media, reworking tried and true images. A dark and usually uncompromising writer, Oates appears to be toying with the traditional family saga. The final chapter was obviously added on to make the book more palatable and marketable. This plot and these characters needed a less cerebral and calculating author. Had Oates more of an emotional investment in this book, she would never have written the final chapter. Fewer books would have sold but at least the book would have had more integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch, such a painful read!","review":"...This was just like a made for TV movie, complete with bad actors, an unlikely scenario and severe depression (with a half-baked after-thought \\"happy ending\\" that came much too late for relief).Boring, overly descriptive, long, and most of all DEPRESSING!!!!Joyce Carol Oates, never again!

How did a highly focused, introverted, antisocial boy-genuis become a therapist and loving family man? It seems like there might be several missing chapters in this story.I will give the author credit for developing a wonderful sense of place. I felt like I knew that farm, and the selling and leaving of it was believable enough.Every time I read one of JCO's novels, I promise myself never to do it again.

There were several times, as I read, that I wondered why a particular chapter was there in the first place - it added nothing and wasted my time.

One of the worst books I have ever read in my life.This book was WAY too discriptive. She had to descibe everything to the smallest crack on the wall. What's worse, the story, characters and plot were unrealistic, boring, and the way the family handles the daughter getting raped made me think what planet this family lives on.The narrator (who is supposed to be the youngest son) is nonexistant in the story.

It may be the last. At times the story was hard to follow due to not knowing in what time of the youngest's child's memory this was coming from. I read a review on the back cover, and from it assumed, things would work out OK. The dysfunction is very real in many families today; however, I feel it would be better if we could have some meat to handle the process of healing. I would not recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad I spent the money!","review":"For the most part, everything Oprah recommends, I read. For the most part, I am satisfied when I am done. But \\"We Were The Mulvaneys\\" is the exception. Never have I been so frustrated, so angry and so bored within the pages of a book! What happened Oprah!? What happened Ms. Oates? Did you both fall asleep at the wheel?This drawn out, unlikely, pitifully ill-written book made me wish I'd used the money for a manicure, instead. Ugh! How sad that this author is permitted to get away with so many blantantly obvious grammatcial errors.The ONLY thing that put a smile on my face was realizing that I was not alone in my opinions.

Somewhere inside this book was a halfway decent idea for a story, but it gets lost so fast in a waste of detailed descriptions of every character that ever had any contact with this family. I kept thinking that maybe the story would get better, get back to Marianne and what happened to her. But it doesn't, it just drags on and on about the mental unravelling of this family. I found it so totally depressing, and was happy to see that other readers felt the same way. Don't get me wrong, books don't have to be happy go lucky for me to like them, not at all. But this book has a heaviness about it that makes it painful to endure."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Were the Mulvaneys","review":"I was very dissappointed in this novel, especially the end that led you up a mountain and the dropped you instead of reaching the top. The story jumped around and was poorly written and too detailed in ways that were unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"This was the most depressing book I've ever read.

Read Jodi Picoult instead for some great reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, Unrealistic, Bad.","review":"What a tremendous disappointment! I must agree with other reader-critics: the book is no darn good. Chief complaints: the characters are underdeveloped and behave in ways that run contrary to what development existed for them. The story shifts from character to character, leaving huge plot lines lost in the transfer, never to be revisted. The moment one character begins undergoing change or growth, they are abandoned until the overly tidy happy ending. When you 'meet' these characters again at the end, the how's and why's of how they got there remain unanswered. It's just bad writing-- surprising from a writer seemingly so well respected and prolific. I put the book down several times out of sheer annoyance with the stylistic sence of Oates-- I finally plowed through to the end, no happier than when I had abandoned it. You're better off reading an as of yet unread Toni Morrison--an author who weaves characters around each other with far better precision and dexterity."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely unbelievable","review":"Whoever the Mom and Dad characters are at the end of this book are not the same ones the author was writting about in the beginning. The author is truly expecting too much of her readers if she expects us to believe almost anyones parents would behave in such a disgusting manner. Least of all not the paragons of parenthood, the Mulvaneys, that she describes in such loving detail in the beginning. While the incident of rape is indeed tragic it would not rip a family with a foundation like the Mulvaneys apart. This book was depressing. I kept hoping it would get better. The end just made you want to get counceling for the daughter who for 12 years blamed herself for her rape. The Mom and Dad became pathetic losers with no sence of decency toward their daughter. Save yourself. This book truly was a workof FICTION."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unbelievable Family","review":"Although I haven't read Oates for years i was an ardent fan at one point in my life. \\"We were the Mulvaney's\\" was a huge disappointment. Oates still shows her amazing descriptive skills,but I did not believe one character in this book.I did not believe that the parents presented the way they were in the beginning of the book would ever have reacted to the plight of their beloved daughter in that way...especially the mother. Oates does not prove her point that lovable quirky people can turn into clueless monsters in the face of trauma. Thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Long Tale of Woe","review":"This story was soooooooo long that about 3/4 of the way through I was thinking \\"enough already\\" ~~~ I enjoyed the picturesque farm country and the image of \\"small town life\\" BUT all I can say is: how times have changed!! I can't believe the lack of emotional support given to the rape victim (the Mulvaney daughter) in this book. It was hard for me to imagine parents, especially the mother, feeling the \\"shame\\" for themselves and doing absolutely nothing to help their daughter. Although, the book semi held my interest and I did finish it, it was pretty slow going at times.. I closed the book and said \\"so long\\" !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unredeeming in all aspects","review":"I've never said I hated a book before I read this one. It was dark, the characters stumbled through horrible lives and everything always got worse. I felt exhausted and black, and bluewhen I finally dug my way through this turgid book.I usually give books to friends for a reread and this is the only time a threw a book in the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving - not believable book","review":"This book is filled with unessasary bulk... It just goes on and on with too much description of things that are not even important to the story line. Then when things finally start to get interesting the pointless descriptions come back. I wanted to skim through most of this book. If the author took all of that extra \\"stuff\\" out it might not be half bad except for the fact that it is not very believable. At the beginning the author builds up the characters to be one way and by the middle they are suddenly completely different. If you can put all of this aside, the book does have its moments and you can occasionally get into it (although it can be very depressing and frustrating). Overall I would say this book is worth reading if you like books that take a while to get into and if you are willing to look past the unbelievable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Were The Mulvaney's","review":"I personally didn't care for the book. It is a very slow read and took me forever to read it as i could not get into it. Not one of the finest books for Oprah to put in her book club.This book was about a family who was torn apart based on something tragic that happened to one of the family members. It is about betrayal, loyalty and mistrust. The story unfolds as Oates writes about what happens to the family in the years after the tragedy. The family, in my opinion, is very strange and did not react the way that a normal family would react."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably The Most Depressing Book I've ever Read","review":"This book was SO depressing. Also,I was so upset at the way the parents treated the daughter by banishing her after SHE had been a victim. I found it especially unbeleivable thet the mother, who was portrayed as so loving and strong could turn her back on her child when she needed her most. Also,Oates style of writing in long, long run on sentences was extremely irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I think this was one of those books that you either loved or hated, and I definitely did not love it. I just found the family so despicable in their handling of such a delicate situation, and although I'm sure this kind of thing happens far more often than we'd like to believe, that doesn't make it any easier to take. In my opinion, it started off well, and then just dragged incessantly once I got halfway through it. So it wasn't just the subject matter - if the writing had been different, I would have found it much more palatable. I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Family Undone","review":"Denial and dysfunction tears apart an American family in Joyce Caorol Oates' We Were the Mulvaneys. Set in 1970's upstate New York, the tale centers around the Mulvaneys - a family who is living the American dream of wealth and prominence on their own little slice of heaven, High Point Farm. Using her considerable gift for visceral prose, Oates paints a painful portrait of the fall of the Mulvaneys after the rape and subsequent exile of their \\"perfect\\" daughter. Oates' understanding potrayal of violence and its depersonalizing effects compels the reader to stay with the Mulvaneys -to empathize with their defects and come to a place of forgiveness with the entire clan. This is Oates at her best: holding a mirror up to show our strengths and vulnerablilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down and Out on the Farm","review":"Is it possible that such a strong, capable family could disintegrate over date rape? Yep - I guess in J.C. Oatesland it happens. In the 1990s I suppose everyone would be in intensive family therapy, but this novel is set in a time when rape did reflect on the victim. I disagree with readers who have said the family was just too perfect for the first 100 pages. Haven't we all known of families filled with high achievers?My disappointment with the book was that Judd was not as strongly characterized as his brothers and sister. In spite of that, this novel was a page-turner. Reading Oates' books makes me feel as though I've picked up a rock from the garden and looked underneath. In other words, she writes great fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"It had it's ups & downs","review":"This book was one of the better. I've read about half, with the other half on my bookshelf (in line to read). It was a sad story though. And I almost had a hard time believing what was going on. But I guess I could imagine something like this going on...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about veering off the subject!!","review":"I have read most of Oprahs recent books and loved them. This one is the exception. I couldn't read beyond page 40 because she writes about an event and then gets sidetracked and goes off for pages and pages about another detail. The trick is to keep you in suspense but I felt it extremely frustrating. I never was able to find out what happens to the daughter because it probably isn't until page 200! I felt like I was talking to one of those people that will tell a story, build it up, go off on different sub-stories and then finally gets to the end and you are so happy that the story is over that you want to make a point to not carry on a conversation with that person again. This book reminds me of the John Irving style of writing and if you like his stuff you may like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't like it","review":"As soon as this book became available, I wanted to get it. I am so suprised at how disappointed I am in the novel. We were the Mulvaneys was a long, dragged out story about a disfunctional family that never sees closure. Sure, that I how life is sometimes, but each character develops into a complete pile of nothing. I found myself avoiding the book, not wanting to drudge through the pages for another day. This is usually not the case with me. I wanted to complete the story and found it an incredible effort. I shared it with my book-buddy, and she had the same reaction.Sorry Ms. Oates, it's just a matter of taste I think. See you in your next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Detour from Joyce Carol Oates, and I love it!","review":"Joyce Carol Oates has departed from her usual style with \\"We Were the Mulvaneys\\". Unlike many of the readers who reviewed this book, I loved it. Oprah Winfrey said that the story still haunts her though she read it over a year ago, and I can see why. The characters are real. You can almost feel and smell the texture of their lives. I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days. Great work Ms. Oates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much detail!!","review":"This was one of the worst novels I have ever read.

Maybe she needs a break..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhhh Come Onnnnnnnn!!!","review":"Oates is brilliant for the most part but this book made me wonder! The Muvaneys are about as unrealistic as they can get! Oates' elaborate descriptions of Marianne's mother baking pies, pies and more pies in such detail emphasizing the \\"perfect\\" family is less than perfect and borders on obnoxious hyperbole!It is true the storyline is one of the devastation of date rape; she overemphasizes the \\"cutesiness\\" and later the unraveling of this upstate New York family as the book progresses. The ultimate ending is nearly laughable! I threw it across the room!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and frustrating","review":"I found this book very disappointing.

I could not believe that the father in this story completely ruins his entire life and the life of his family just because his daughter got raped. I hated all the wimpy characters in this book also. None of them were believable and they never redeem themselves. I honestly wanted to just put this depressing book down a million times, but once I start something, I finish it. I am so sorry I wasted my precious time on,as another reviewer said, \\"a total waste of paper.\\" I have enjoyed so many Oprah picks. She really let me down on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible and boring","review":"The downfall of the Mulvaneys, after Oates' careful, exacting, boring description of them up to this point, was implausible, unbelievable. The parents she had described would just simply not treat their children, especially Marianne, the way they end up treating them. Seemed very naive. Has Oates had children of her own? The way she writes of the parents turning away from their children one by one makes it seem that she knows little of this bond. I would not recommend this book to anyone, and will be choosier henceforth and not as willing to read an Oprah selection just because it is an Oprah selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite add up","review":"I'm a medium-sized fan of Oates—American Appetites and Because it is Bitter, Because it is My Heart are favorites. But this saga misses the boat a bit. It never seems logical, or even probable that the father would exile his daughter for being raped. Though this book is set in the 1970s, it feels more like a 1950s morality tale. It takes that \\"things fall apart, the center cannot hold\\" thing too far, making a seemingly ideal family go from Leave it to Beaver perfection to the mean, wacked out folks they become due to one incident...terrible as it may have been. ... I kept reading and reading and was left dissapointed by the end. Like some romance novelist, Oates sews everything neatly up. If the Mulvaneys got that messed up by the earlier rape, they probably won't keep their stuff together either."},{"rating":"1","title":"LONG AND DREARY! SPARE YOURSELF!","review":"If you think this book will improve as you turn the pages, do yourself a favor and PUT IT DOWN NOW! I've read many, many books in my life and I have NEVER read such a dreary story; not dramatic, or tragic, or compelling, simply dreary. None of the characters seem to have any inner strength, you will wish you could go straight to High Point Farm and shake them all up! The prose is LENGTHY, to put it kindly, and trails off into unknown territory just when you think you might be getting somewhere! UGH. Unfortunately, it took me almost 300 pages to realize that the plot would not EVER take a turn for the better, and I felt compelled to stick it out. A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oates Seeks Revenge","review":"Ms. Oates has a deep seated contempt for the middle American family. With this story Oates expresses her contempt by concocting a family that for all their initial outward success cannot connect with, much less help, each other. The author believes that families cannot overcome obstacles and heal from their wounds. She depicts middle American families as jealous, competitive, and especially from a Mother to daughter, unloving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book crawled along at a snail's pace.

That was a first for me as I am an avid reader and usually enjoy Oprah's Book Club selections. This one, though, was really off the mark and very disappointing. The characters were never fully developed, the story line was way too draggy, tedious, and predictable and Ms. Oates' use of punctuation, especially her constant overuse of hyphenated adjectives, drove me NUTS! This is the first work of Joyce Carol Oates that I have read, and I must say I was quite surprised at her lack of ability to write a crisp, compelling story and her writing style in general seemed amateurish. My advice to anyone contemplating reading this book is don't waste your time, there are much better books out there to curl up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unredeeming; implausible; unjustified","review":"I keep thinking I ought to like J.

I enjoyed Ms. Oates style filled with 'wordy' descriptions. But then she vears off in this totally unbelievable direction and she lost me. I just can not believe this fun, happy, highly affectionate family would react to the daughters rape in the way described. It was truely infuriating and I came to hate these parents, esp the Mother. It may have made some sense if it had taken place in the 20's or 30's but in the 70's women were no longer to be blamed! I really can't understand the choices Ms. Oates made and though I saw it through to the end it held no truth or satsifaction. It is too bad, I really wantd to like this book, the only realistic character in the book was the cat, Muffin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and depressing","review":"This is one of the most unrealistic and depressing books I have read this year. The author gives no background or reason why the characters would act in such ridiculously stupid ways. Why would parents who loved their daughter treat her the way they did? Why did the incident with Marianne change her family so dramatically, and alter their personality? Is this book saying that all of us can become thoroughly despicable characters if a tragedy occurs in our lives? Or is it saying that these people were thoroughly dispicable from the beginning and we just didn't know it until the tragedy occurred? I kept reading the book hoping there would be some reason given for the actions of the family, but in the end there was none. There was just a sweet little family reunion where everyone was so, so happy again, like at the beginning of the book. I hope nothing bad happens after the reunion, because who knows what this barracuda in disguise family will do."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP!

If this was representative of Oates' writing I won't be reading her again. The characters were without depth. The situations were created without subtlety. And I found the shifting point of view irritating: if the youngest son would have been the consistent storyteller the telling of the story might have been improved. Had I seen \\"Day-glo\\" once more I'd have thrown the book away!Maybe it would have been less tedious if it had been around 150 pages shorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern American classic","review":"This book should be listed as a modern American classic and Ms Oates as one of the finest contemporary writers of fiction. It is a superbly written piece that it going to keep me pondering and thinking for weeks to come. A tragic tale of a family's elevated perception of itself and its inability to deal with any event that strays from the ordinary. I am sure that if I read this again in a few year's time, I will find even more within its pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please spare yourself - don't buy this book","review":"This is definitely the worst Oprah book I've ever read. Not one of the characters has a single redeeming characteristic. I wanted to slap some sense into all of them. Had there been one single person in the book that you felt some sense of bonding with it would have made a difference. I read the whole book because I hate not to finish something I've started, but it was dreadful and I hated every minute of it. Usually when a book is good you hate to get to the end because you'd like to see the characters you've grown to appreciate continue. Not so this book, I was so glad to be finished with it.Spare yourself - don't buy it or get started on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern-Day Reprise of Dreiser","review":"This book is hauntingly familiar to Dreiser's \\"An American Tragedy.\\" Four children, their parents and a marriage are all sacrificed on the pyre of the parents' self-perceived image in the community and Joyce Carol Oates is an author who is powerful enough to make us feel their initial disbelief and subsequent pain following \\"the incident.\\" I found Michael Sr. to be the most dislikable character because he used the rape of his daughter to justify his own very despicable behavior when he was needed the most and the daughter to be the character most deserving of our compassion. This is a book that will make its readers take a good, hard look at the depth of their own meaningful relationships to see if they would survive a devestation of the magnitude suffered by the Mulvaneys. This book is about people who prefer to maintain appearances at all cost and the cost is, indeed, very dear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greater expectations","review":"I had great expectations for this book. And perhaps my strong reaction to it it the result of Oates excellent writing skills. The book is well written, the story interesting, as well as the prose. However, I became very frustrated with some of the characters. Especially the mother, who in my opinion, is only a strong, loving woman, when all things are wonderful with her man. When the going got tough, she simply got rid of the evidence-in this case a human being, her own daughter (who needed her mother to help her through a crisis in her life but was sent away).I don't often read books more than once, but I will read this one again - now aware of what I am getting into, perhaps I will get more than frustration out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"Completely enjoyed this book. Compelling & tragic. Gets you from the beginning and you just want to know all about the Mulvaneys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good -- perhaps not for everyone","review":"Although I found the story to be heavily (almost overly) detailed and full of flashbacks, I appreciated the way that Oates allowed the reader to get to know each character intimately. How sad that a family so close and seemingly unbreakable could let tragedy stand in the way of strength and healing. Any book that makes me want to jump inside the pages and react to a character or situation -- have my say, punch them out, hug them, tell them they are wrong -- is a book that has heart. Throughout the book I felt a closeness to Judd -- the baby of the family -- as I am. His eagerness for information and acceptance touched me. I felt sympathy for Marianne, although she certainly didn't ask for it. Corrine and Michael Sr. were a mixed bag -- if only they could have be realistic in their expectations of child-rearing and life in general! Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a story -- but not to anyone looking for immediate fictional gratification."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad tale of family crisis","review":"What a tragic story this was. . . not to say I didn't enjoy it, I did very much. I do wish though, that Ms Oates had enlightened us a bit more on what Mike Sr. was truly feeling, I would've enjoyed some of his internal dialogue to maybe give me a better idea on what he was feeling. For a father to completely shut down like that and refuse to see his daughter, I wanted to delve into his mind. I've read several books by this author and have tremendous respect & admiration for her talent. Here she explores family relations with a keen eye for the mundane trials and tribulations of family life. All in all I would recommend this book, it was an enjoyable read and the characters were well developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"If This Is Reality, Then I Live In An Alternate Universe","review":"First of all I like JCO's writing, but this book stunned me with its characters, all of whom seem to make the most horrible decisions in life. I was frustrated and angry with every single one of them all through the book. I cannot believe that people would respond in this manner to the ordeal of the daughter. I am sad to finish many books because I know that I will miss the characters that I have just spent hours with. When I finished this book I had a different feeling. I said good riddance to all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that needed to be written","review":"This is a very good book about how deeply a family can be hurt by the actions of one bad person. We all know that rape hurts a victim and can scar them for a very long time (if not all their life) but not many think beyond that. What that sort of horrible thing can do to an entire family (brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, grandparents) is beyond most peoples comprehension. And then there was WE WERE THE MULVANEYS.The Good: You become attatched to the characters, especially Mary Ann. When the book was over, I wanted to know about what happened to her later on in her life. The characters really come to life. I also like the fact that the bad guy pays, even though I would have liked to seen more done (brutal, I know, but he deserves it!)The Bad: I wanted to hear more about Mary Anns marriage in the end.The Ugly: There are some very off the wall comments made every so often that are in italics that really interupt the flow of the book. That part just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Boring Snooze Snooze","review":"This book had potential but quickly lost any fire it had from the start....I will be more careful when choosing which Oprah books I will read from here on out. I was looking forward to this book and was disappointed..big time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major, Major Error in Fact - No Backseat in a Corvette!","review":"Next to the last paragraph on page 155 of softcover edition: Marianne refers to the \\"shadowy backseat of the Corvette.\\" This is where she was supposedly raped.To my knowledge, there has never been a Corvette with a backseat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah who?","review":"Too bad she has recommemded this book. It may be worthy but I'll no longer waste my time reading anything she recommends after, The House of Sand & Fog, Beloved and The 5 People you meet in Heaven. None of those books had any usefull information or were entertaining. But they did bring suicidal tendencies forward in my mind. 1 person in our book club was chosing the books 9 out of 10 dropped out and will no longer read anything Oprah endorses."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Sucks!!!","review":"Don't bother reading.... Wonder why its online used for $0.01? This book was 400 pages too long and not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for a better book.","review":"I'm a third of the way through the book, and page after page, I keep wondering when the story will go somewhere, when the characters will move me, when will the storyline develop. It's become a tedious read, as I have no feeling - like or dislike - for the characters. Perhaps because none of them are believable, and there's a shallowness that oozes through most of them. I finally decided I need to find out if other readers had my experience, so I came online to read some reviews. Now I know it's time to move on, to pick up the next book on my shelf, and donate The Mulvaneys to the thrift shop. The last book I read was Wally Lamb's \\"I Know This Much Is True\\", and while I know that's a hard act to follow, life is too short to waste it on this kind of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Drawn Out and Depressing","review":"I like, many others extremely disliked this book. I started this book in January and put it down about after the first 200 pages and do not plan on picking up again. I refuse to subject myself to the long drawn out character development etc. This could have been an excellant book but Ms. Oates refused to tell the story, but instead subjects readers to endless pages of details that are so compeletly inconsequential that it gives me a headache to think about it. Please save your money - or better yet I will sell you my like new copy for a buck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We Were the Mulvaneys","review":"I have never before read a book where I actually did not care what happened to any of the characters. It left me angry and empty. A total waste of time and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"too depressing","review":"I read this book and thought it was incredibly depressing. I found that by the time I was 3/4 of the way through it, I was dreading picking it up! I really did not like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"This is a thick book and the only two reasons I picked it up at a rummage sale were it was 50 cents and it had been one of Oprah's selections. Within an hour of reading, I had made it to the middle of the book. I hate overused descriptions so I skim through them. I skimmed so much that I almost had the book done when I couldn't tolerate it anymore. The story has been done better by more and has come to the point it is overdone. I sold it in our garage sale for 50 cents. I lost an hour of time but I didn't lose any money. I will not be reading this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too lengthy","review":"I got to the third chapter and gave up. This was way to lenghty with detail of things that I could understand wher the author was going with this. I was recommended this novel with a warning that it was a tradgic story. Since I enjoy reading heavy conflict, and coupled with it being an Oprah pick, I thought for sure this would grab me. But it didn't. I would recommend this to those who don't mind reading multiple pages on dear, etc. Otherwise, skip it for a more enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Title: We Were Weirdos from Another Planet","review":"This book was so ridiculous and uninteresting, I couldn't even believe it. All of the characters were greatly underdeveloped, and while Oates attempted to tell this \\"story\\" from the perspective of the youngest Mulvaney, she failed terribly. This book is supposed to be the youngest boy's attempt at writing the history of his family. However, within the first twenty pages the one and only conflict for the Mulvaneys begins, yet Oates totally underdevelops everything and makes everything just plain uninteresting. There was truly nothing tragic about this book except for the fact that it was published and hyped up by Oprah to make it worse. Take my advice and do not waste any money on this book -- if you're that curious, go to the library, I'm sure they'll have a ton available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would anyone finish this book????","review":"Even more importantly, why did someone make a tv movie off it? This family appears to be close-knit, loving, and rich in faith but a catastrophe - when the daughter is brutally raped - tears it all apart. The father becomes hateful, abusive, and cold, the mother wrings her hands and cries but stands by and lets her daughter be victimized yet again. How can any reader have sympathy for \\"parents\\" like this who are anything but loving? This \\"loving\\" family punishes the victim. I had no sympathy whatsoever for these characters and found myself hoping the dad would get offed and mom too for her spineless lack of mothering when her child needed it most. The author's purple prose detracts from the story as well. Can't recommend this one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"we were the mulvaneys","review":"a dull read. tv movie was much better, guess i should have watched the movie and skipped the book. usually i like oates' writing, but not this time"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Were the Mulvaney's","review":"I loved this book and have reread it several times. The time period of the book is when I was just a young girl. While the Mulvaney's are not Catholic, they remind me of Catholic families I knew during that era. Some things could only be aluded to, but never spoken about. Keep two copies at home just in case a friend wants a good read. I'll always think about the Mulvaney's. Thank you, Ms. Oates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged cut way to much","review":"The book is quite good but the abridged audio cuts way to much of the flavor of the story and looses the characters motivations. Abridged books are in my opinion a waste but this one is a bigger waste that most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!!","review":"I was so disappointed in this book! Reading generally brings me great relaxation, but not with this book. I could not believe how the case of rape was handled and how the rapist was dealt with. This book is 450 pages long and could be 200. The author went on and on about trivial things. I continued to read the book thinking it would get better, but it never did. For those who have not read this yet, don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rather Frustrating Read","review":"Although the story is captivating, it just takes forever for Ms. Oates to tell it. The reader ends up knowing more detail about the characters than they probably know about themselves. After wading through it all, the ending is rather rushed and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Were Them-Mulvaneys","review":"It is a wonderful book that says a lot about the human condition, at least I think. Disfunctional families, etc. And how it can all come back together. I cried at times reading this book. The sadness carried over until Oates brought everyone together in the end. I saw the Movie, which was not too bad as movies go. JC Oates is a great writer, and I think this is one of her best for the masses. It's just a wonderful story that says an awfull lot about life, and how preciously fraduel (sp?)it is for all of us.It's a good read - Joyce Carol Oates is a great writer.Barry"},{"rating":"1","title":"This edition is not worth purchasing","review":"Our library owns the original edition of this book, but I wanted a copy to have available for patrons to check out and read at home. I bought this edition because it was inexpensive and I believed it would be a suitable copy. I was wrong. The printing is horrible and it's very difficult to read. The photographs are not legible at all. The text is readable, but blurry. This edition is advertised as 'digitally remastered,' but it's actually digitally ruined. Do not buy this edition, search for a used copy of a previous edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"College book purchase 2","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter and was pleased to get it so quickly. It was also in good condition as described. Hope all of my purchase go so smoothly! Great Seller. Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sold as a book + DVD + 3 pack CDs ... but only the book came","review":"The seller offered a return for refund..I ordered a replacement book online, but it came damaged and I ran out of time, so I decided to keep this book for class. It cost an extra $20 than if I had just bought the book without the DVD or 3 pack of CDs..very disappointing for a music class and a book called LISTEN... I'm not listening !It would be better if the seller would refund half the cost of the book, since that's all that I got, the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD was ripped out","review":"Everything arrived on time packaged in a bubble-wrap sort of envelope, which is fine by me, but the DVD included with the book was missing. In the back, the holder for it was obviously torn out. Great price, but I need that DVD for my class. It isn't just an \\"extra\\" sort of thing. Will be returning once another copy arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't come with the required CD's","review":"This book doesn't really do you much good without the CD's and they did not come with it. dissapointed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Projects seem nice, but text needs more work","review":"I've already built two of the projects from this book. However, I had problems with both. The authors seem to have stock in the woodfiller companies as they are consistently advising you to put screw holes through visible faces. There were parts missing in the list of materials from one project and the diagrams didn't match the finished product. Some of the ideas seem a little tacky, like the Grandmother Clock. Overall though, there are some good ideas, and it's a great way to get started. I can just see a beginner getting frustrated as pieces don't fit or don't work due to the mismatched diagrams and lack of instructions. I think a little more proofing on the part of the publishing company could have really cleared this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Many Worlds of Beloved","review":"This book is a wonderful book. I highly recommend it for a rainy day or a quiet evening. The book is filled with tragedy as well as suspense.When reading the book you begin to feel for the characters and realize how bad they had it. The pain you feel for Sethe when she takes the childeren into the barn is just awful. As well as the many other strugggles she encounters.I again recommend this book to anyone. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"The way this book paints the picture of slavery is magnificent, and it really makes you think of what kind of animals some people were. But the way it is painted is the only good thing. This book is quite disturbing and almost terrifying. The character of Beloved is a stupid side plot. What she represents is good but keep it that way. I don't need all the sidebars about her beating Sethe and screaming in the nude, and having relations with Paul D. If you like that kind of stuff then its perfect for you, but maybe you should settle for Roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern tale of ancient struggle","review":"The key to understanding \\"Beloved\\" lies in the ability to apply the self-awareness of nurtured spirit and mind of a XXcentury woman to the life of ex-slave in post Civil War Ohio. The colored community and the realia of slavery are portrayed with genuine realistic mastery, but the manner of rendering of spiritual struggle and inner lives of the main characters left me with a sense of underaccomplishment. I rated the novel 4 stars because I am convinced it is an involving and provoking reading. Just don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bunch of Nonsense","review":"I thought this book was the weirdest think I had ever set my eyes on. I was confused in the beginning and then I became bored with the whole story."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STAR. TOTALLY BAD","review":"I guess if you are Toni Morrison, you can submit a pathetic piece of writing and call it a novel and still people will go to great length to qualify your work as a masterpiece, a must read, even select it for some of the highest awards. This is snobbishness at its best.....and I say poppycock to all this!! And shame on Oprah for pushing this book...I realize that friendship has its demands but one should also know what the limits are!! That being said, I truly feel that it is regrettable for our society that this important episode in the history of slavery will remain unknown to a large majority due to the complex and largely unaccessible style of this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is overdone, repetitive and BORING.","review":"Don't waste your time reading this one! It is a struggle to finish because the events (and vocabulary) are repeated over and over. Also, the descriptive narrative is overdone and BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be stupid....","review":"This book left me very confused and asking a lot of questions. I watched the movie and I was still confused and asking a lot of questions. I JUST DON'T GET IT. I don't think I will read another Toni Morrison book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't NOT put it down","review":"Awkward, boring, poorly written, nearly incomprehensible.I admit I did not get to page 75 - so maybe I shouldn't even write a review. But even getting to the point that I did, took extreme perseverance.I know the critics all fawn over this work - but honestly, I hated it - or the part that I did read. Every other sentence it seemed, had an awkward phrase - things like: \\"Pleasantly troubled...\\" and \\"a snowy look\\".What could these weird phrases mean?I know what an icy look is - but a snowy look?I've been troubled - I'm troubled right now - but it isn't pleasant.Two phrases from memory - but the book is innundated with writing like this.Didn't work for me at all.Don't bother with Beloved."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry.","review":"i heard toni morrison on mpr today and she seemed like a very nice and intelligent lady. i wished that i liked this book, but it just wasn't for me. i would not bother rating it, if not for the fact that i just heard the new york times picked THIS as the best book of the last 25 years! first of all, there is no such thing as the best book of the last 25 years, or 100 years, or best book overall of anything period. books are way too subjective an experience to make such an outrageous claim. if the new york times wanted to say this is the favorite book of our editorial dept. over the past 25 years, we could all live with that. i, of course, want to love every book i start. i don't have time to pick up books i think i would hate. so i did have high hopes for this book. it just left me puzzled as to why it is getting such over the top praise, i am sorry to say. oh, well. maybe it's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a phony book","review":"The book is an absolute sham. Toni Morrison seems to try too hard to render compelling situations by compelling writing. Except: the writing is technically constructed and hopelessly lacking in artistry. The idea of the \\"ghost\\" is stolen. There's nothing original about this book except for its tremendous lack of originality. Potential readers: don't waste your money, read (even) Anne Rice instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I have loved all of Oprahs picks but this one waes BORING. The authpr has no flow in this book. Just drags on and on--couldn't wait to get to the end. So tired of hearing about s;avery-- why not the plight of Ellis Island emmigrants.
