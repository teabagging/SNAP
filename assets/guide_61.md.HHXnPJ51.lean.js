I intend to begin another book by Mary Pipher, \\"Hunger Pains\\" which I hope will help me and others understand the eating disorder epidemic in this country. Although I somewhat resent the portrayal of \\"most girls\\" as victims, for the most part the book was very inspiring and very, very accurate.

I certainly went through much of the torment highlighted in this book; and wish to assist my daughter (age 9) through her rough times ahead. I wish my parents read it; I hope my ex reads it.

Perhaps in repressed farming towns in the Midwest where no one finishes high school, teenage girls live their lives like that, but not most of the population. It was depressing and insulting that she believes teenage girls are so stupid and susceptible. Besides, all that, the references in it to pop culture are about fifteen years old.

I would call her tone along the lines of militant feminism. Granted society screws us up some, but it can't be held liable to the degree Pipher maintains. I am skeptical of a woman from a stable home in a small Nebraska town who creates theories that she claims are applicable to the rest of the US.

You press the little button on the front of the battery, and a gauge lights up to show you how much power remains. That in and of itself is an *incredible* feature.Also, these batteries maintain a charge for a very long time; it took me weeks of use (in several projects in my new home) to finally run a battery down.

Had he been brought to trial early, he too would have been hung. He certainly was aware of his mother's situation; althought I believe she may have been the only innocent.

While interesting in its depiction of Civil War Washington, ultimately, the book is a disappointment in that the characterizations are flat and stereotypical as Mr. Robertson dispenses with historical truth in search of a good yarn. The Lincoln assassination and its participants can provide enough grist for an enjoyable and plausible historical novel (as Mr. Robertson describes his work) with only marginal manipulation of history; thus the wholesale manipulation of history results in a work that is, at the end, an unconvincing and uncomfortable perversion of the historical fiction genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.

The factual material is far more interesting than anything Mr. Robertson twisted around to fit into his \\"novel.\\" John Surratt's true story as a confederate courier (not photographic assistant to Mr. Gardner as this story has it) would make for a far more compelling story. I found it disturbing that for the story's sake, Mr. Robertson had a sexual affair go on between Booth and Mrs. Surratt. The true story of Mrs. Surratt's probable innocence would itself be worthwhile reading. I could go on with examples (but I won't). Don't waste your time or money on this book.

Through e-mail, the reader learns about the back-stabbing, bureaucratic bungling, and sexual escapades of a group of people working for an ad agency that would do anything to land the Coca-Cola account. I laughed so much when Carla and Zoe were fighting over the PA job that promises more money. And who could forget David Crutton's frustration with e-mail?

The best part, though, is the author bio: \\"Matt Beaumont worked at several London advertising firms before he sold his first novel.

Like many of the other reviewers, I was wary of the fact that the book is written entirely as a series of inter-company e-mails. However, Beaumont pulls it off fantastically.The key element to the humor is the duplicitous nature of the main characters. In the personal e-mails to each other, we see what they really think, and in the business e-mails, and to contrast, the business e-mails are all brown-nosing and have the forced quality of many official e-mails.There also several running jokes, such as the agency president's e-mails getting diverted to the Finnish office, and the many amorous liaisons among the underlings.What I found surprising that Beaumont was able to flesh out the characters so well.

You have the loony left wing creative talent unwilling to work on controversial accounts, you have the generally nutty creative director, the sexually predatory male cohort, backstabbing and backbiting galore, cat fights among personal assistants, and a big boss who is an abusive terror. While I know many people who found this book funny and entertaining, I didn't. I actually found it rather boring and predictable once the story took off.

There's a very big difference between adding more drama and depth into Schubert and changing the nature of his music although. His 9th is a very good one, but his other effort, especially his 5th, can be a chore to listen too. For a set that's heavier than Beecham's and Abbado's but not as heavy as Bohm's I highly recommend Wand's and Blomstedt's set, Blomstedt in particular conducts with broad tempos like Bohm but is much more lively and intelligent."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great series of books for winter or summer reading","review":"these books are a gem! great characters, no wild bedroom scenes, just good old fashioned detective work by a 60 something year old woman who knows how to entertain her friends.

The album seems more pop than rock, and the Celtic elements, which drew me to the band in the first place, are not as prominent on this album.There are a few great tracks, such as \\"Slow Air\\". Several other tracks start out promising but don't deliver by the end. The collection of songs is more diverse in style, but it makes the album as a whole feel somewhat disjointed. Scott Long's fantastic pipes are lost on many tracks, and Dan Stacey's fiddle work on the album doesn't fully demonstrate his exceptional skill.I have been a huge fan of Seven Nations for many years. I am warily waiting for their next album with high hopes.Recommended: Seven Nation's The Factory"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did we wait????","review":"This is the worst Seven Nations cd in their collection. Believe me, we have traveled 3000 miles to see this band. We know good, great Seven Nations. Unfortunately, we now know BAD Seven Nations too. It sounds as if they all recorded their parts individually while a producer sat around mixing the tracks! The harmony that once joined this band together and made them so strong is sadly missing on this cd. Scott Long's wonderful pipe playing is no where near as strong as it has been on past albums. Dan Stacey's fiddle can be heard but isn't as showcased as it has been on prior cds and while Kirk McLeod's soulful voice still leads the troop, it hits a rather sour note with what sounds like a hit for minor harmonies but shanks to the left!While we will still remain on the top of their fan base, this one will probably be available soon on Amazon under the used category..and cheap too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1950's Vancouver, Skid Road, Heroin and Logging","review":"I picked this book up on the Vancouver ferry as something to read by a local author. It turned out to be a very enjoyable read. Trower writes in an almost autobiographical style that makes you feel that the characters are real people doing real things. The topics covered in the book seem to be very down-beat--the endless cycle of logger's lives between Skid Road, the Logging Camps, Booze and Heroin, but the book is far from down beat. The characters are well developed and believable; they are treated with respect and each play an interesting roll in the story. The story-line weaves about through themes that let the author illustrate the life and times very well, and in the end conclude with an ending that fits the story yet is creative enough to make the reader happy. All in all, a very good book about an odd-slice-of-life that is interesting to see recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"An excellent soft core erotica film with high production vales and good acting.

The producers and director did well by this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great writers!","review":"Sixty years ago, Traven wrote books that taught you everything you needed to know about what Mexico and, indirectly, America were doing to Mexico's indigenous populations. Though often translated awkwardly from his original German into English, Traven's prose sings. As a leftist who fled a death sentence issued by the post-World War freikorps of Bavaria, he sympathized with the Indians of Mexico, learned their language, and told their story in such a compelling way that it will change the way you see the world. Traven is best known for writing \\"The Treasure of Sierra Madre,\\" but his so-called jungle books, like \\"The Carreta,\\" are perhaps his real masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Healing the Hardware of the Soul","review":"This is a wonderful book.

Full of snappy dialogue and marvelous period detail, the plot rattles along. The characters aren't fantastically deep, but they're entertaining, and Cornwell does a better job with women here than in some of his other books. While the mystery plot isn't wildly original, the book has more than enough unique qualities to keep it interesting. The descriptions of the gallows and the penal system are grim and the denouement is breathless. I was especially impressed that Cornwell managed to write this very successful book without ever resorting to what's arguably his greatest skill, huge gory battle scenes. It's an entertaining book and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Romp by Cornwell.","review":"Mainstream historical fiction writer Bernard Cornwell gives us a romp this time, and a good one. This is in essence a detective story set in London, full of likeable good guys, adorable female sidekicks, annoying male sidekicks and not so intelligent bad guys.The setting and descriptions are exceptional. You feel you are next to Ryder Sandman trying to solve the mystery. This does not have the roaring battle scenes we are accustomed to see in Cornwell's books, but have plenty of action and twists.If you like historical fiction and are looking for a little light entertainment you will enjoy Gallows Thief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gallows Thief","review":"I am currently reading the book and am enjoying it.

I thoroughly enjoyed this fast moving historical fiction/mystery set in early 1800s England. The main character, Rider Sandman, a hero from Waterloo, is down on his luck but finds himself investigating a murder that no one wants solved. The \\"murderer\\" has been tried, convicted, and sentenced to hang, but Sandman discovers that the condemned is most likely innocent. The book is part mystery, part history and lots of fun. Its an easy and enjoyable read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. If you like historical fiction - get this book! Mr. Cornwell really makes history come alive with the story of the Newgate prison, the politics and class divisions of early 19th century England and, if you are a cricket fan, this book is definitely for you!I hope this is the first in a series of books with the same characters; they are very well developed and the ending is primed for a sequel. Also, I would really like the stories of some of the secondary characters to be told (especially Sally's Highwayman brother)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pages Of Entertainment","review":"Bernard Cornwell is best known for several trilogies and the Richard Sharpe series; with the historical plots typically centered on famous/infamous battles.That is why Gallow's Thief is particularly interesting, since it is a mystery set within an historical framework. Do not think for one moment that you will budget small amounts of time to get through the book.Cornwell draws you into solving a killing through the main character, Capt. Sandman - a veteran from the Battle of Waterloo - and his band of \\"merry person's,\\" including a woman whose brother is Robin Hood.The writing is concise and poignant to issues confronted in society today. History does repeat itself, especially when it comes to the wealthy manipulating the legal system."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book for the beach... and not much else.","review":"This novel is long on period detail, full of amusing slang from the London underworld of the 1800's, replete with stock characters and is the kind of story you forget almost as soon as you've read it. Having authored the incredibly engrossing and believable Richard Sharpe novels, and some other series not as good, why Bernard Cornwell ventured into the field of \\"period\\" mystery is the real mystery.He is a much better writer than this novel would have a first time reader of his work think. Altogether the kind of book that you'd take to the beach. If you lose it in the sand and don't get to finish it, no big deal. One thing: If you're interested in cricket, the game not the insect, you're going to learn more about it than you ever wanted to know. (For a better explanation of this unique game, I'd recommend \\"How I Won the War\\" by Patrick Ryan, which has the added advantage of being humorous.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Exclusion of Art From Thinking: A Guide to Critical BS","review":"As a Freshman in college enrolled in a critical reading and writing course, this book was one of my assigned readings.

It seems he has never heard of compatibilism, the dominant philosophical view, and doesn't actually understand determinism. The real problem though is that he tells us we should believe in free will because it is necessary for us to have control over what will happen and what we believe.Now really, telling people to believe X because it would be really useful if X is true? That is critical thinking?The other example, this one really bothered me when in college, he tells us that it is really sophisticated to realize that things don't have to be just good or bad.

Even on the low setting, this will make the room hot! I think with this one, you have to do some experimentation. You'll have to play with it a bit to get it to where you like and have it stay at where you like. Basically, if you're only trying to heat a closed space like those I mentioned above, you will not have to worry about getting enough heat, it gives way more than enough, I would say the only problem is figuring out how to control that heat."},{"rating":"2","title":"We really like the Honeywell Mini Tower Surround Heater","review":"We really like the Honeywell HZ-2200 Mini Tower Surround Heater for use in different areas of the house and/or garage (next to husband's workbench or when working on cars).

It does not make much noise when running, allowing conversation, TV viewing or music to be heard. The heater is small and light-weight, storing easily in a small spot when not in use. It's short and attractive enough to not be an eye-sore, yet powerful enough for a single heater unit to heat our large Family Room w/ its cathedral-ceiling.

My old heater put out more hot air with more force, but it didn't seem as safe, and I often felt like I was being 'toasted' on one side. I prefer the even heat of the honeywell.Two cons: I wish there was a grip or handle on the top, so it could be easily moved. I also don't like the placement of the air-intake slots. Air goes into the heater right above the dish shaped base, and if any dust or hair has collected in the 'dish,' it gets sucked into the heater and stinks.

My only disappointment was that the older surround heater I own has a switch that allows for changing from surround to front heat only.

I followed the instructions and still the same results. This heater also claims to be a 360 degree heater but I can only feel alittle heat coming straight out the front of the unit.

Well, it only works if it tips forward or backward. If it tips over on either side, it will continue to run.

I plugged it in, turned it on, and then turned my back for a moment. After a few seconds, it became apparent the fan wasn't operating, and something smelled like hot electronics. A quick check of the controls gave the heater just enough time to start to burn, producing a nice cloud of very acrid smoke that stunk up the entire house. If it had waited another 5 minutes to fail, I probably would have been out of the room, and it could have started a serious fire. Avoid at all costs! As a firefighter, I should have known better than to buy a cheap heater, especially without doing any research. These things cause fires all the time.

This book, however, is a mere 200 quarto pages cobbled together mainly from a series of technical papers. The language and style are classically dull, dry sciencespeak. Although said by its editors to be designed to appeal to a broad audience, it's strictly for bear bionerds. The clothbound version is even more outrageouly overpriced at $120! This thing is obviously aimed at people who have government grant money to throw around. And disregard the star at the head of this review; the software won't allow less than a one-star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical...yet understandable","review":"The authors did a wonderful job of compiling years of scientific research into a natural history book. This is definately a book for the more scientifically-oriented community.

The author is very self-absobed and somewhat pathetic. I think all she really wanted to emphasis just \\"how bad off\\" she was/is. Was she looking for sympathy? I just wanted to shout \\"grow up and get over yourself\\" while I was reading this. The footnotes made the book appear to be a poorly-written thesis (I don't think she went to college - too worried about her weight.) She also contradicts herself. She claims that she's a feminist yet all she really wanted was to be the thinnest. Thinness was the only important thing to this person. It probably still is, or she wouldn't have written her memoir. She seems to want to immortalize it."},{"rating":"2","title":"i loved this book","review":"this book is one of the best books that i have ever read. it took me inside the life of a person that had anorexia and bulemia and it showed me how she lived. i never knew all of the struggles that someone went through just to feel that they look good. i recommend this to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasted","review":"I have Bulimia and a friend suggested I read this book. I've had Bulimia for about 4 months and \\"publicly\\" well with my friends anyway, 1 month. I read this book and i can honestly say I know EXACTLY how she feels.

Marya Hornbacher has written the best book I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trigger indeed","review":"I have to agree with some of the other posters--while excellent, this is definitely a triggering book. Please be careful when you read this--depending on where you are emotionally, it could very easily trigger anorexic or bulimic behaviours and emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening account of an Eating Disordered mind","review":"I was recommended the book by my best friend, who herself is (was in her terms) an Anoretic. This book gives a brutally honest and often frightening account of what goes through the mind of those with eating disorders, something i can never truly understand - although i really wish i did. The story is written in such a way as to involve the reader to such an extent that you feel that you are in the room with the author watching her life unfold in a more and more disastrous manner. I feel like i've gained so much insight into my own friend, that i have so many questions for her, did she feel this, did she do that. It honestly scares me that my friend is like that and gives me all the resolve to go on with my future plan of graduating from medical school and specialising in Eating disorders. Maybe i can make a difference, but understanding is key, and this book helps give you that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comforting","review":"Hornbacher has created a touching memoir with this book. Not only is it extremely easy for victims of eating disorders to relate to her text, but she explains the emotions of eating disorder victims in a way that allows the victims to comiserate with her and those individuals who know a person with an eating disorder to get an idea of where this self destruction comes from. However, the best part of this book is the end. This is not like other eating disorder memoirs where the author or narrator asks for the sympathy of the reader, rather, Hornbacher almost forces people with eating disorders to get a grip on their situation and get help, to learn from her terrible experiences before enduring them themselves. An excellent book that I had a hard time putting down and missed when it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was brilliant","review":"This is one of my favorite books. Depressing, I know. But Marya Hornbacher has an amazing ability to be honest. And people with eating disorders don't always recognize how they feel, and the people around them tend to not have a clue, so this book really informs the sufferer and the friend, confidante, reader, whoever, how this person is function and why they do what they do. She doesn't necessarily tell you how you feel, if you are a sufferer, but she does unabashedly look at herself and it's a liberating read in that sense. However, she is still very dark at the end of the book, and that does seem deterministic, but really, I think as hard as it is, it's also curative to see someone work so hard to get better. And work so hard even if the steps are so small. It helped realize how I felt and how it's not going to be easy, but life is worth living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This book tells the never ending fight of its author against Anorexia and Bulimia. She is an extra-ordinary person because even though she is suffering from this illness, her dedication towards her studies, work, are 100% It is very difficult to find people with this attitude. Her description of treatment is crystal clear, you can see all those things in front of her eyes. Her narrative power is also amazing. If you are suffering from this, then this book will give you valuable insights to various medical problems connected with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathological","review":"This book has the feel of someone boasting about just how bad and pathological she was. In reality, she was not recovered and was still in the grips of her eating disordered thoughts and mindset. (Significant personality pathology as well). Warning to those who are easily triggered--this book is not right for you. This book could be useful for professionals wanting to get an \\"insider\\" perspective of someone with severe symptoms. However, would not recommend this book for eating disordered sufferers who need to recover. This book would likely set you backwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Eating Disorder Bible","review":"This book makes me absolutely sick. I remember reading it in Jr. High as I was struggling with anorexia and bulimia and remember getting so many ideas from it. It basically tells you how to become the best damn anorexic/bulimic you can be. It's overly verbose with awful anologies- and not truthful- the woman was sick when she wrote it. I would never recommend this book to anyone- eating disorder or no."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD INFLUENCE","review":"I have struggled very badly with an eating disorder for almost 5 years. I have been in and out of hospitals time after time and this book almost taught me new ways to feed my addiction.

She shouldnt of put the tricks or how she did what she did in this book....It shows and teachs kids how to have a problem that will one day kill me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, still there...","review":"It never ceases to amaze me how totally and completely self-absorbed anorexics and bulimics are. Marya Hornbacher is no exception and \\"Wasted\\" is her own personal tribute to how dramatic and special and sick she was and still is.As a former bulimic, I was hoping to read an honest and insightful account of eating disorders, from the perspective of someone who has \\"been there, done that\\" and is now moving forward in recovery. Instead, Hornbacher is obviously still wallowing in her ED... \\"been there, still there\\".Hornbacher, in all her self-induced drama, still has not \\"gotten\\" recovery. She's still wrapped up in her own little epic, which doesn't include anyone but herself and her thoughts and her body. It's such a shame that she's missing out on all of the wonderful EXTERNAL things real life has to offer.I hope the readers of this book (especially the young women dabbling in ED behavior) can recognize that Hornbacher is NOT a model of what recovery looks like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Book","review":"As a recovered anorexic I found this book very disturbing. The books serves as a \\"How To\\" guide on eating disorders. Anyone with an eating disorders knows that there are certain \\"Tricks of the trade\\" which are very dangerous. This book spells out each of the tricks Marya used while in treatment!! This book is very dnagerous for anyone with an eating disorder. Please, I beg you, do NOT let a loved one with an eating disorder read this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a loving favor: do not read this book","review":"If you suffer from anorexia or bulimia (or are looking for inspiration to develop an eating disorder), do NOT read this book!It's depressing and pessimistic. By the end of the story, Marya seems to think she has \\"recovered.\\" But, yet she is far from that point! She has merely achieved a new kind of relationship with her EDs. When you recover, you learn to feel good about yourself and your place in the world. Your focus will be on the adventure of life and the opportunities you have before you . . . not merely your body.Trust me, I recovered from 14 years of severe bulimia.I found this book very uncomfortable and pitiful, quite honestly. I'm more inspired to run screaming away from her tiny, self-obsessed, self-destructive world toward health and happiness and love. You need hope, inspiration, and encouragement to conquer this war!Please, instead, try \\"The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom\\" by Don Miguel Ruiz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Insightful read","review":"This is such a raw account of a battle with anorexia/bulimia; Marya really offers a crude look into the mind of someone with these struggles. I spent most of my adolescent years struggling with these same issues, and this book brought insight to the issues many of us have dealt with. For the first time, I felt like my problems were put into words and someone understood. It was a read I could relate to and found so interesting. Marya is such a gifted writer, the way she strings words together makes this such a beautiful, interesting read! I completely recommend this, especially if eating disorders are something that have struck your life or someone's life who is close to you in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I have been battling with an eating disorder off and on since I was a teenager. The author of this book put into words, what I could not. She creates a realistic, vivid and beautifully illustrated picture of eating disorders. I rarely become engrossed in a piece of literature, but when I reached the bottom of the last page...I wept. She had told my story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is phenomenal. Truly an honest and vivid account.","review":"I've been battling my ED for 10 years now, and haven't read anything that even comes close to this realistic, terrifying and gripping novel. Marya Hornbacher writes with such honesty and emotion - I connected with so much of it personally. It was truly a scarey, intense read - alternately inspiring and saddening. But the truth is, I guess we will always be recovering (hence, no happy ending) if we get that lucky. I hope I do. This book gave me a realistic picture of what the outcome of my big mess of an eating disorder may turn out to be. I may continue to battle the same thoughts and behaviors forever, but, like Marya, maybe I can find some peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Deceived","review":"This book is really a \\"How To\\" manual from a woman who wants to capitalize on how sick she was and to some extent still is. Don't get me wrong, she is a fabulous writer, but this disease is cunning, and wily and longs to get it's accomplishments spotlighted. I would like to see Hornbacher amazing gift for the written word utilized otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"This book should be in the collection of everyone who ever suffered an eating disorder or someone who has dealt with a sufferer. Marya is so candid and open in this book and you feel with her on the journey. She provides hope and inspiration.This is such a far cry from the typically dry, clinical self-help books on the market, often written by those who have never suffered."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted...and adrift","review":"I was floored by this author's talent; never have I read such an eloquent portrait of the hell of eating disorders, one I barely survived.As a survivor, though, this book infuriated me. There is no perspective, no critical eye -- her prose is brilliant, poetic, and brutal in its honesty, but it the voice of a woman drowning. I would not give this book to anyone fighting an eating disorder. It is replete with triggers, and is, at its worst, a disquietingly unchecked glamorization of self-destruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had no idea.","review":"I have friends who have struggled with eating disorders, but I never had much of an idea what they went through. I never thought of eating disorders as being as \\"serious\\" as say, cancer or alcohol addiction. Marya's book changed my mind about that.Now I can't go to the grocery store or listen to women talk about food without wondering at the underlying messages and feelings involved. I don't have any eating troubles myself, but I do identify with a lot of the feelings she's expressed surrounding her issues with family, friends, anger, self-image and depression.I really respect Marya's attempt to tell the book honestly without tidy bows, flowers and rainbows. I wish her the best in her continuing recovery and eagerly await her next memoir, due out this April."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good!!","review":"So much of myself was in this book I was drawn into it...I have to say she clearly had the story of our lives down pat.."},{"rating":"2","title":"DISEASE","review":"JUST LIKE ANY DISEASE, THIS IS ONE THAT PEOPLE SCREW UP.

Not only does the author chronicle her painful lifelong battle with eating disorders, offering us an inside look at the causes and motivations, but she also helps us to question our society's obsession with dieting and food.

Read it because it'll open your eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted: A Memoir of Anorexia and Bulimia","review":"This book is boring to read.

She glorifies herself, using completely self centered descriptions. She also tends to drone on. Also, as others said, very triggering. It pushed me into binging again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review.","review":"I love this book because I can relate to it so well. I am female, competitive and have low self esteem issues. Marya Hornbacher writes about the same characteristics she has herself but on an entirely different level. Ms. Hornbacher has the ability to describe things EXACTLY as they were and exactly how she feels at that moment in the Interlude chapters. This book gives the reader an insight on how eating disorders can erode a ridiculously talented young woman (I am still amazed that she was only 22, 23 years old when she wrote it). It is not a snapshot of all eating disorder victims (quote: \\"So I get to be the stereotype: female, white, young, middle-class. I can't tell the story for all of us.\\") and should be read with the thought in mind that eating disorders can happen to anybody- the disfunction of the mind can happen to people you love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"Yes Hornbacher can write but this book was disturbing for me. It was as though she was trying to tell people how to be better at their ED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted: My Time","review":"I don't know what it is exactly about this book that I didn't like but I thought it was awful. When I read the reviews and page excerpts I thought I would like it. I was wrong. I just got the feeling that Marya is the snobby, pretentious type and I couldn't get past that. I know what it's like to have an ED. Her writing style is terrible. I don't recommend this one to anyone who wants to read about eating disorders."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful","review":"This book was stunning. I completely disagree with some of the other reviewers who throught it was a how-to manual. The point, in my opinion, was to elucidate and drive home this excruciating and highly secret behavior for those of us who haven't been exposed to the despair of bulimirexia. If it opens the eyes of parents who have been telling their children to watch their weight to a potential outcome of their own behavior, so much the better. If one parent decides to reevaluate their groceries, their plumbing, or their frantically excersizing child, that would be a good thing. If therapists can learn from Marya's manipulative behavior and better assess and treat their own clients, there is benefit for everyone.I appreciated the opportunity to experience this book. I suspect it was a difficult and humiliating process to write."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth reading","review":"A very honest, intelligent, and realistic approach to the causes and progression of eating disorders. Great read, I couldn't put it down! I do wish, however, that the author would have delved more into the symbolic/spiritual aspects of eating disorders and the cultural burdens of womanhood. I highly recommend books by Kim Chernin: The Obsession and The Hungry Self"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book~ can be triggering","review":"After reading many books on the subject of eating disorders, I found this book to be one of the best. Having suffered myself from an eating disorder for the past 12 years of my life, I can relate to Marya's mental anguish. However, if you are in recovery you must be careful when reading this book. I found this book to be triggering. At the same time, it was comforting knowing that I am not the only one who battles with the \\"voices\\" in my head. But the comfort this book provides could be detrimental to your recovery. Marya, if you read this review, I think you are incredibly brave to write your life story about your disorder.

At first I didn't think it'd be that good, but I absouletely love it! It's the best eating-disorder book I've found. I found I thought I was Marya, and I got so attached to Marya's character I wanted to brag I knew how to pronounce her name before I even opened the book. I reccomend this book for everyone, except someone who is trying to recover from an Eating Disorder, because this is a Trigger Book where anyone who has ever had an eating disorder might want to not eat for a few days or something.*Red Ribbon*"},{"rating":"1","title":"recovery need not be as bleak and limited as this portrait","review":"Hornbacher's story is written in such a way that anyone with eating issues can find themselves within her struggle. The medical consequences that Hornbacher discribes are enough to make anyone think twice about self-destructive behavior. However, Hornbacher is hardly one to present recovery. Recovery is running for an hour a day on a treadmill then blacking out? Recovery is eating cereal for dinner sometimes on bad days? Don't sell yourself short of Hornbacher's vision of recovery with \\"just being all right.\\" Genuine freedom from eating disorders can be possible, and Hornbacher does not accurately reflect those who have been afflicted with an eating disorder when she implies that the disease is always something you will act upon on occasion for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A How To Book For Those Who Want An Eating Disorder","review":"As a psychologist with a hospital based eating disorder treatment facility, I am writing to warn all parents that this book should not be allowed to enter into their homes.

I appreciate what the author tried to do; however, this book is one of the only banned books on our inpatient units due to the damage it has done and continues to do.

But you tell it too well. What you have written is a how to book for anorexia. ANy thirteen year old can pick up this book and know the ins and outs of being anorexic and all the little tricks you pull to fool doctors along the way. How do I know this? becuase I am an anorexic and this book triggered the hell out of me. It didn't inspire me to get better, it made me jeoulous of your so boldly advertising your lowest weights. How could you not think that that would not automatically set off triggers in anorexics minds? Your book I know was banned from teh ED hospital I went to just for that reason. what a thing to be proud of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eating Disorders: True Insight","review":"Marya Hornbacher writes about her life's revolution around eating disorders in Wasted, a memoir of anorexia and bulimia. Throughout her life, Hornbacher faces family and health struggles as well as internal conflicts ranging from promiscuity to an addiction to crack cocaine. All of this influences her dependency on eating disorders.At times, Wasted is comparable to a girl's diary, filled with pages of poetic ramblings. The book would draw restless page skimming (which would result in equal understanding) save for Hornbacher's talent for writing with intense verbs and perfectly constructed sing-song sentences; readers roll down each page with a strong sense of imagery.Wasted is for anyone who has considered eating disorders as an option to relieve self-consciousness, or anyone interested in the psychological side of eating disorders. It's not for the light-hearted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal truth","review":"Marya Hornbacher holds nothing back as she shares the gritty details of how mind and body meet near destruction when they play with the unrelenting world of eating disorders. Few writers dare to bare all, as Hornbacher has. She shows in depth knowledge and genuine concern for society and others who bear the burden of eating disorders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wasted(a great book)!","review":"I think this book was great,it shows that even the most normal looking people can have an eating disorder,whether rich or poor,old or young.I really liked this book!It was very helpful to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE BOOK EVER!","review":"I work at a book shop and have the oppurtunity to read many books. Until \\"Wasted\\" I had not found one that I could call my favorite. Marya tells her story in a way that I could totally relate to. Her style of writing is one I found easy to read and able to stay with. Although this book is not for everyone, anyone with eating problems would easily relate. I know I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice goes to hell and halfway back:)","review":"I wish I knew Mayra. I felt a kinship to this person on several different levels. Looking into her struggle is horrifc but necessary. I read lines that I felt shocked by because I wasnt sure if Mayra/author or I had written that line which described a person so much like myself. I've been to the land of anorexia and have had to try to listen to people who want to help me who them selves dont know that much about it. I have suffered with B/A for three almost four years and I've been trying to not think of how it will cetch up with me.

This is a great step-by-step guide for how to destroy your life using an eating disorder, and it doesn't offer the alternative of getting over yourself and working hard in recovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A how-to book for prospective anorectics and bulimics","review":"Absolutely do not allow any female under 20 to read this book. The author is not recovered nor does she pretend to be. You can almost hear her ask \\"do I look fat\\" when she gets a look at herself on the cover. This definitely makes eating disorders look like an attractive option to young women in search of some drama and attention. Sure the author has an eating disorder, but hey she's thin! She gets dates and great jobs! She also gets a heck of a lot of attention from her friends and naive,trusting and long-suffering parents. This reads like a pre-quel to Drinking, A Love Story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather a memoir of deception, sex,drugs,and an ed........","review":"By reading this book, I began to wonder if others not affected by eating disorders who read this book, will get the wrong idea about \\"us.\\" I am bulimic. My issues and the majority of people that I have found have nothing to do with living a life of drugs, sex, and deception. Though I suffer with this illness, I will not be bound to menal institutes all my life. I will graduate and I will succeed. I am offended that this book was only titled what it was, where it should have included other issues. This book portrays an image of \\"us\\" that is very distorted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricks of the trade: How to become Anorexic","review":"I rushed to buy this book when it came out in hardcover, I devoured it in three days. But as I was reading it I kept having diminishing thoughts about myself. This book gives intimate details of how and what an anorexic does to become thin. I was once an anorexic myself and yes, you never completly recover. When writing a published book that goes out to millions you need to focus on what needs to be done to fix the problem called low self esteem in young women. I also have wrote a memoir of sort where I rely all my doings when I was anorexic but I would never share this with anyone. Because I would not want to be the inspiration for another girl to go through the torture that I went through. I think this author did this more for publicity and personal gratification than trying to help others become aware of what things need to be done to prevent deathly mental illness."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Dream is not the answer","review":"Oh please please please do not look to the American dream for the source of eating disorders. While media representations in support of the so-called \\"American Dream\\" of skinny girls and muscled boys may encourage or provide support, eating disorders and other disorders of lonliness are symptomatic of much deeper issues than \\"I want to look like that.\\" No one starved him or herself over a magazine cover alone. I beg anyone practicing this faulty thinking to reconsider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, good grief","review":"This book is awful. Like many of the other reviewers, I have also had an eating disorder--I struggled for 9 years with bulimia. I was looking forward to this book, but unfortunately, it really does reinforce the popular stereotype that people with eating disorders are rich, spoiled neurotics looking for attention from parents and classmates. Judging from Ms. Hornbacher's present-day interludes in the book, she's STILL on the same schtick. She beats the reader over the head with a nobody-knows-the-trouble-I've seen refrain, because of course, none of us can contemplate the pain she's gone through. But this is a young woman who was surrounded by loving, caring families, friends, etc...and brought her problems on herself. The way she glamorizes her eating disorder (and her \\"epic struggle\\") is not only irresponsible but disgusting. Wonder what follow-up book we'll get in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped and overwritten.","review":"I picked this book up as I was requested to do so. People have been telling me for ages that Wasted is a wonderful, mind-opening book.I will admit, that some of the information the author gives is good. Some things I wasn't aware of. However, the book was boring.Within the first few pages in the footnotes, she sets out to tell the difference between anoretic and anorexic. However, she uses the same wording in examples. This leads me to believe that she has no idea what she's talking about, or she isn't very good with words. In turn, this tells me to be cautious while reading this book.I did enjoy the book at some points, but other times it was a drag. She's a boring writer, and does too much to defend her own actions and neuroses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written","review":"This book is amazing, it keeps you captavated from the time you start to read it. Im recovered and the things she discribed are so very true. If your looking for a book on eating disorders this is one of very few to read. Dont listen to the negitive reveiws for this one, Its well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I have had an ED for 13 years now and am trying to recover. I read this book and is made me so sad and scared. I was going down that same path! I knew I was going to have to change how I think and eat so that I do not do anymore damage to my body. This book really made me think. Its only been 2 months since I read this book and already I have gained some weight back and I am getting better each day. I owe a big thank you to this book and writer for opening my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt Marya's pain and frustration down to my soul.","review":"Wasted is a chilling, dark, cold and powerful book to digest. It was as painful as it was enjoyable for me to read. It was the first book that I have read on Anorexia and Bulimia in which I totally could relate to the author. I feel like I know Marya. The one thing I know for sure is that we have known a similiar hell and will live with remnants of that hell forever. The contents of this book are real and the delivery is ingeniouse. You cannot help but feel her pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intimate and Beautiful","review":"The honesty of this book had a profound affect on me the first time I read it. Its something everyone should experience, Not for her downward spiral necessarily, but for her ability to take us on her journey in such a touching way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably an accurate description of the life of an anoretic","review":"My sister, who is now in her 40s, struggled with anorexia for about 15 years. Like Marya, at some point, she just got better. She attributes a \\"cave man\\" diet for her recovery, but like Marya, I wonder if she just kind of grew out of it. Back then, no one really knew how to treat anorexia, and the blame was pretty much placed on the family situation. I wish that this book had been written back then,as I see so much of what Marya was doing in my sister's habits - like mixing all of the food in the house together and eating it and binging. I might have understood her a little better. This is a riveting account of what I can vouch for, second hand, at least,is a very accurate account of anorexic/bulimic behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle edition only","review":"read hardcover and loved it. kindle utter rip off. at least one typo per page. lazy. for price they cant be bothered to proof read...marya would be horrified"},{"rating":"2","title":"So...Real","review":"okay. how can I say this? this book is so real that sometimes, i had to keep this book away from me reading it. It seriously made me gag just thinking about what she was doing to herself and i was making faces while reading her descriptive details of her eating disorder. How can she do something so terrible to her own body and mind for 10 something years?Read it if you always complain about your weight and body image.

It is not necessarily a happy ending, but it is nevertheless an ending that provides a sense of hope. I have a significant other who has been suffering from bulimia for nearly 15 years and this story gave me terrific insight into this disease and the terrifying power that it can have. I personally found this much more rewarding than an academic self-help book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cathartic reading experience","review":"Wasted is a difficult book to read for somebody trying to win the battle. I speak from experience! I cried and cried but it was a cathartic time for me and I felt a huge grief come and go. It is a book not just for sufferers and Hornbacher often has a rather blackly humourous way of describing her experiences. IT IS A CHALLENGING BOOK TO FINISH IF YOU ARE STILL SUFFERING. APPROACH WITH CAUTION."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reflection of Ourselves","review":"I know that I am not the only one who saw a great deal of herself in this book. Unlike some, I did not read it with the intent to learn new tricks. However, when I did read it, I learned some good ones. This book did not scare me as it did so many others. It calmed me, rather inspired me. It is a terrific book, but I must advise you to read at your own risk. It is definitely a story that will spark emotion, just be sure you are prepared to deal with those feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"painfully honest and frightening","review":"The seriousness of the subject matter and the author's intensity with which she expresses herself is sometimes overwhelming. I felt like skipping some of her hospital antics and experiences to find the \\"happily ever after\\" ending. It's amazing she is so articulate, introspective and knowledgeable. Thankfully she has written about her illness in a way that might actually scare others on the same path."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"This memoir is absolutely spellbinding - the elegant writing and deep-found intelligence of the author make this true story impossible to put down. Particularly for those who have suffered from eating disorders, Hornbacher's brutal honesty and courage in addressing such a taboo issue and emotional state are not only relatable but inspiring - may you find solstice in her words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely helpful","review":"As a college student recovering from anorexia I always felt alone and that no one in the world understood what I was going through. That is, until I bought this book. Hornbacher writes with such genuine, thought-provoking and touching words...that I now feel like this is a disease that I can keep overcoming. That there are people out there that have overcome the odds and beat this horrible thing. Hornbacher's easy to read narrative provides deep insight into the disease and hope for recovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Review Before Reading...","review":"As someone whom has recovered from a 13-year struggle with Anorexia and Bulimia and a person now working in the field, I urge you to please consider your situation prior to reading this book. Marya Hornbacher's ability to bring a person into the mind of a sufferer of an eating disorder is intense - which can be useful to a support person of someone whom is struggling. For a person struggling, this insight can be detrimental. I would beg that although the eating disorder would lure you into reading this book - please consider how challenged you are with the eating disorder before reading it. I found this book to be instrumental in my recovery; although, I was in a position to desire recovery. Feedback from others has been that for those not in that spot -- this book will act as a trigger. Please refrain from reading this book until you are in a position to utilize the message as a means for recovery rather than one to feed into the eating disorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotional page turner.","review":"This book is amazing. It's real, raw and definitely reels you in. It's very descriptive, disturbing, emotional, and heartbreaking. It took a lot of guts to write this book, in all it's detail and length.

A hard and painful, yet real true book with lots of feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"An excellent and disturbing account of one woman's lifelong struggle with a combination eating disorder.

Begins with some solid psychological points, that leads into subpar chapters of rules and cliches, and then ends with even worse trading techniques and methods. These are very basic, very well known and essentially useless trading methods that any respectable trader should already have seen.

The seminar ratified what I concluded after reading the book, \\"this fish smells.\\" The spokesman Velez talked slick, dressed slick, and was slick down to his pin-stripe moustache. His partner Capra was noticeably silent and I realized quickly why. Whereas Valez was vaguely familiar with the workings of the market, Capra had no prior experience. It's amazing how little they both knew. It appears that these two rascals have done one thing successfully and that's duping the unitiated and hungry wannabe trader.

When I asked Mr. Velez about performance, his tone completely went from having a good time to negative by intentionally trying to smooth over not answering me while maintaining the confidence of the audience. Realizing that performance is a \\"sore subject\\" with Pristine, I explored their performance on their website and reviewed every week's postings and found there were more losses than gains.

If the strategies in this book really work, I would love to see the backtesting results for them in the book.

But if these guys are now so well-off from their mastery of trading, why could they not afford a decent editor for this tome. I honestly have never read more poorly put together prose. Misuse and misspelling of words, so much redundancy that they must think the reader is dumb or has zero attention span, supercilious quotes sometimes repeated accidentally in neighboring paragraphs, and a really really low density of information. If I had wanted a tongue lashing combined with a sophomoric pep talk delivered from an arrogant role model, I'd by a Rambo tape. I have no axe to grind and have not lost money using their services.

This book is a simple summary of basic technical concepts that have been around for some time, and has oddly enough conveyed old techniques as if they were new. The major well known trading firms such as Goldman Sachs & Merrill Lynch have spent millions unsucessfully so in trying to develop technical approaches that work consistently but with no success, which leads me to be very curious about a person in their early thirties who claims he has over twenty years of experience, and was evicted 27 times. If a trader wants to learn, its too bad that there is no true due dilligence filter for the public. Reader beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoke and Mirrors","review":"Seldom have I come across such a self-serving tombe such as Velez and Capra's new publication for \\"Master\\" day traders. In my view, the only \\"mastery\\" exhibited by Mssrs. Velez and Capra lies in promoting themseves and their company, Pristine.com to unsuspecting, beginner day traders. Unfortunately, over 80% of day traders end their trading endeavors in failure. Rest assured that this book will likely increase this percentage. To be fair, the book contains certain core principles inherent in basic equity trading, but the authors' self-promotion and lack of substance keep this book in the novice category. Mr. Velez prides himself in being evicted 27 times. With this book, readers should anticipate a 28th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I am a professional trader for the past 3 years.

I am sure that market makers could care less about checking a chart pattern before they make a move.and furthermore, a monkey is not showing any brilliance when the dart he threw at the stock pages hit a stock that went up that day..it could have just as easily been a chart association. Hollywood once more guys..nothing of real substance..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tools and Tactics for the Master Day Trader","review":"It is one of the most complete books on this subject I have read.

If you want the same information, at 1/4 the cost, buy \\"A Beginner's Guide to Day Trading Online\\", and \\"A Beginner's Guide to Short-Term Trading\\", both written by Toni Turner (who was trained by these guys). It contains basically the same material except you don't get the non-stop annoying sales pitch for their other services. And being a journalist, Toni Turner's writing style is much better and much more readable than these guys.You might also want to ask these folks for their performance, their track record.Then if you still want to buy this book, go for it, it's your money to waste. All I'm suggesting is that you do your homework, consider the alternative first."},{"rating":"1","title":"New York Cowchips?","review":"I have been trading for years very successfully and often find it quite amusing to read books that are about trading. Off the top, I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but I just have to believe that since there is absolutely no hard evidence that any of these techniques really work...they must not....there is not even any backtesting test results which is also not not even respected in the industry...Just show me the real statements of the authors as evidence that's all...and I would pay big money for all of their services in a New York minute....I am going to use this book in the next local cowchip throwing contest....just goes to show that there are also cowchips in New York...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moving Right Along","review":"The book is very interesting with regards to common usage of moving averages and candlestick chart patterns. I have studied many trading systems over the years beginning with the futures market. Whereas I totally respect the difficulty of publishing books, I am still waiting for a credible track record or some third party proof that the system really does work. There are no such representations in the book which makes it difficult for me to give the authors any serious consideration. It is also somewhat disturbing to find that the author was evicted so many times in a very short period of time. To me there is a clear lacking of basic truths as there is commonly found on Wall Street. I guess I will be moving right along to hopefully find authors that truly have credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Purpose of This Book Is To Trap More Cusotmers","review":"This book is full of sales pitches.

The only thing you will get from this book is wiped out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's Fooling Who","review":"I lost a great deal of money following these people's services....When I looked at their website, I thought that Velez's July 14th caption on their website was hilarious...The Quote of the Day For - July 14, 2000Online Trading Expo interviews Oliver Velez ...We focus on education in addition to pulling money out of the markets. It's one thing to follow a guru or follow a newsletter and make money off of someone else's ideas. It's another thing to learn what the proper tools are and to acquire the proper knowledge so that one day you don't need to rely on gurus. Our services, newsletters and seminars are designed to build independence...Somebody or agency needs to call their bluff....After looking at Velez's picture, I feel like my car is being stolen....This kind of organization should not be allowed to operate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers comments regarding the first 5 chapters of this book. Those chapters are certainly the Holy Grail of trading, not the few techniques introduced later which are helpful no doubt but certainly not the win-all, which if you read the first 5 chapters you will know that doesn't exist.I found that this book was well complemented by David Nassar's two books and home study course, (How to Get Started with Electronic Day Trading and Rules of the Trade).I would highly recommend this book to anyone who day trades, swing trades for part time or full time, but please do not make the mistake that other reviewers have made and think that this book is the only book you will need to read to be successful! It just doesn't work that way! Happy hunting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance verification","review":"The book is more centered on entertainment than trading. There is no concrete way of verifying that the supposedly sound methods even work.

I think the author would make a good fiction writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wade Cook the Second","review":"Unfortunately, I am one of those American suckers who ate every little bit of pie Mr. Velez was feeding the crowd...I find his talk very slick and persuasive...however the performance cost me over $150,000...Thanks to Mr. Capra & Velez...it will be a long time before I retire...someone ought to retire them....such as the NASD or the SEC...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible","review":"Incredible how this book focuses on selling services rather than how to trade. I feel as if I'm an incomplete, un-educated trader after reading this book. The author would have you believe that a successful trading career is futile without subscribing to Pristine's services. There some valid points and interesting facts, but not enough substance. There are several successful trading methods in existance, this book makes if sound as if there is only one. All in all, an ok book if you know absolutely nothing about trading, far to meanial for anyone with any type of experience.

It's all right here within these review pages.Some people just want to see and hear what they want even when the truth is staring them in the face.The author(s) state that 'Master' traders find the 'greater fool' and then sell to him/her.The condescending prose of this book reveal that these guys have now graduated. They now know where the 'greatest number' of 'greater fools' are and have moved beyond the securities markets.They are 'Masters'.Who then, do you think the greater fools might be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned this book after reading the first 200 pages","review":"I couldn't take it anymore. Every paragraph tells the reader that he must join the Pristine Chatroom. My questions to the authors is, \\"If your chatroom and stock picking services are so great, and you have a limit of 500 people in your chatroom, which has been established back in 1995, why do you only have 60 members in the chatroom? If your service was so good, I am sure there would have been a wait list to get in your chat room.I saw one of the authors give a presentation in California last month.

I am a second generation marketmaker and am very successful at daytrading. I must say that these people can sell to novice wannabe traders but would never be able to stand the rigour of Wall Street. Anyone on Wall Street would laugh at the claims of these authors particularly with regard to pattern recognition. This simply does not work. Furthermore, these individuals claim they have in depth knowledge about how to protect their traders interests from those of market makers, but they gave me wrong and ignorant answers to me at the show. Its just unfortunate for those ignorant wannabes that would buy any services from these bogous amateurs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"This book was a huge disappointment.There are much better books out there written by \\"real traders\\" Those who have more experience on Wall Street.

Mary Colter was a gifted architect, who designed many beautiful places, with some of them being at the Grand Canyon. She was also the chief architect and decorator for the Fred Harvey Company from 1902 to 1948. She created buildings that blended into natural landscapes.

If you want to give her a spin, I recommend \\"On My Way to Where\\" as a musical and accessible entry point into her work. On the other hand, \\"Mary C. Brown and the Hollywood Sign\\" seems to map sonic territory that is probably best left unexplored. This is a strident-sounding LP powered by an incompetent mix that does nothing to grace Dory's naturally-thin voice. I doubt that the increased sonic resolution of a CD would improve the situation. That's bad enough. Worse, the psychologically-loaded word play that makes some of her other albums so charming seems to coagulate into a pretentiously-introspective dirge on \\"Mary C. Brown and the Hollywood Sign\\". Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting but Hot!!!","review":"This salsa is the best tasting salsa I have ever had, however, the heat this salsa brings to your mouth is so intense that I recommend this to only someone who can really take fire.

It was very repetitive and rather boring, although I would say the last ~50 pages were the most suspenseful. Maybe that's because I knew I was finally at the end of the book and I was excited to get it over with. I kept waiting for it to get better; never did. Plus the overuse of italicized words drove me nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy of the first Bourne novel","review":"I had to put this book down several times before being able to slog through it. Expositional and boring dialogue, ho-hum plot, and unlikeable characters. When Bourne's wife has the stupidity to follow him to Paris to \\"save\\" him only to admonish him for being a stone cold killer in front of his colleagues, it becomes laughable. Couple that with the fact Bourne has to do everything for the bimbo, including grabbing her purse from the gunshot scene at the hotel and you almost wish she'd been offed. How is this tripe possible from the man who wrote The Aquitane Progression? It truly seems like another writer. This book is completely unworthy of it's predecessor, The Bourne Identity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only slightly entertaining","review":"This book is a disappointment. I enjoyed the first two books, the first being the best and the second alittle less, but wow does this one bite.The plot is very very poor, once again Carlos is after Bourne only this time it really is Carlos. It is just not well written the plot is too thin and the characters are stale.I had a hard time putting down the first two books and now I am having a hard time finishing this one. About two chapters left and I am free!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up Identity and Supremacy","review":"The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy are two of my favorite novels. I have probably read each of them four or five times. I'd just as soon forget about Ultimatum, it doesn't have the hard core, kick butt Jason Bourne that we want to read about and it's a limp way for a story about a hero like Bourne to end. Go ahead and read it if you like Bourne, like I did, but it's definitely not in the same class as the first two. Bourne has lost his steam and edge and is just... can I say it? A fumbling broken old guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish the first 100 pages...","review":"The dialogue just ruined it for me. I was surprised at how bad it is. Robert Ludlum is a well-known author. What happened in this book? I couldn't finish the first 100 pages. It was THAT bad.

Despite having fairly moderate expectations (I just wanted some easy summer reading) the writing is so awkward - never mind the ridiculous 'dialog' - that I felt embarrassed for the author for writing it and for myself for having spent money on buying this waste of trees. I am not a book snob but there has to be a bare minimum of competency when it comes to being a bestselling author. The Bourne Ultimatum reads like it was written by a high school student for a middle-school audience. I have tried about a dozen times to read this thing but I start to giggle each time a character talks or each time there's some sort of plot exposition (and there's a lot of this). Character development? What's that?I do have one thing to be thankful for and that is I will avoid bestseller's lists and authors.Great read? Seriously? In what Bizarro World do you live in?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long, Too Repetitive, Too Much...","review":"This is a sorry conclusion to the Bourne series. The character of Jason Bourne, as established in The Bourne Identity was absent from this book. In his place, what we find is a man who not only suffers from old age, but a significant loss of intelligence. He stumbles through the whole book, reacting emotionally, complaining, and being outsmarted by everyone he comes in contact with. The final showdown with Carlos the Jackal is another disappointment, with a young kid being the final hero, because \\"Jason\\" was too injured, too dejected, too shortsited, and too old to finally to the job himself.I was truly disappointed in this book and don't understand why it continually gets good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"very huge disappointment for fan of the films","review":"From the very first page of this book, I knew there was trouble.Instead of making me want to delve in, the first page teaser confused me, and it was badly written.I was extremely hopeful and forgiving as I forced myself to read more and more of this book.It seemed more stupid and silly and bad as I read more and more of it.In desperation, I turned to the Amazon reviews to see if I was missing something that I could correct and then go back to read the book and enjoy it.The bad reviews only re-inforced what I already sensed.There was no saving this jumbled, badly written, uninteresting story.The movies must be totally re-written by a good writer who understands how to tell a story"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing like the movie of the same title -","review":"very disappointing. Only the title of the book, was used for the Bourne Ultimatum movie.The author is NOT Robert Ludlum, although his name is plastered all over the cover for advertising purposes.The author who does write the book does a terrible job of encapulating technical details. He obviously has not done enough research on the main characters, the technical gadgets and the finer details of the \\"spy\\" items in the book. For example, he tries to describe a \\"drug runner\\" offshore speedboat, and COMPLETELY misses \\"the boat\\" on what the capabilities are, the cost of the boat, and the technical aspects of it.It is obvious the author of this novel sits behind a chair and lives out his life through his TV set and picture books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making a Purchase","review":"The entire process of ordering and paying for, and receiving the book \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" was very easy. It was good to be able to get such a fine product without leaving my home. Thank you for your prompt service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ludlum series","review":"If you have read any of the other Bourne books (Identity, Supremacy) you have to read this. Not saying it's the best out of the series, but it's neccessary for closure. It's vintage Ludlum with all of the plot twists and global conspiracies, but as someone said before, the Bourne books introduce a new view on things. You can relate to David Webb and Ludlum does an excellent job building layer upon layer of psych complexity that makes this character seem so real.One tip: DO NOT READ THE BOURNE SERIES STRAIGHT THROUGHTake a break between books. I went straight from one to the other in a matter of days. I truly feel I would've enjoyed them (especially this one) 10x better if I would have taken a break.So do yourself a favor. They are good books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the three","review":"This book is seriously flawed. Utterly implausible plot, unconvincing dialogue, seriously stupid characters.

I like the various plots and it actually made me wish that the movies had followed the books much closer. Having said that, the movies were quite good also, but the Bourne Ultimatum gave me so much more in the form of plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please read to yourself","review":"This is my first Robert Ludlum book so I am not familiar with his writing style. I like the Bourne movies but this plot does not have anything to do with the movie and, quite frankly, does not seem very intelligent or exciting. But the WORST part of this recording is in the reading performance. Even a mediocre book could be illuminated by a good reader. Who is this Darren McGavin? Most of the time he reads in a very bored manner, taking a big breath and then reading through the passages as fast and monotone as he can go making it difficult to follow what's going on. Then if he finds something he thinks is interesting, he slows down a little to mumble through the character parts. How can you tell anyone apart? All the characters are mumbling, disinterested, foreign, coughing old men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"This is a shameful attempt at literature. I've never understood the obsession with Robert Ludlum. I find him to be insanely over descriptive and nausiatingly over-dramatic. I did enjoy The Ambler Warning and The Bourne Identity, but this is just awful. The dialougue is pitiful and unnatural. The movies are better on every imaginable level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Trilogy","review":"Okay, the movies are entirely different from the books. The first book rocked. The second was pretty good. \\"Ultimatum\\" is a overwritten waste of time. Bourne makes some pretty stupid mistakes, the plot twists fall on the side of unbelievable, and the dialogue is awful. This hardly seems like the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a good thing","review":"The first two (Identity, Legacy) are beautiful page-turners. However, in the third installment, the Jason Bourne vs. David Webb struggle becomes a dead horse. You can only carry that split so far in a plot line before the man either must end up in an insane asylum, or integrate the pieces and move on. While a desparately wanted the saga to continue, I would rather not have seen it end with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost one too many.","review":"The third book of the Bourne trilogy just does not stand up to \\"The Bourne Identity.\\" He lost his character! He never comes close to bringing Jason to life, and making him real,and yet,larger than life, like he was in \\"The Bourne Identity.\\" This book calls to my mind the question of who really wrote it. I get the same feeling from Tom Clancy's later works; they do not ring of the author's metal There are so many mistakes in this work,and it is so cluttered-up with half explanations, and under developed situations and characters,that it would hardly rate a C- in any college creative writing class.I was very hard-pressed to complete the read,very sorry to say. It is about twice the length it should be,given all the flaws,requiring the reader to really work hard to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"the bourne ultimatum","review":"one of the worst books i have ever read. not near as good as the bourne identity. bourne should have killed carlos in the first book and saved us from the bourne ultimatum."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book, great movie","review":"In short the movie was much more interesting and suspensful then the book.

Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this person fit into this story, again?","review":"This was the first time I've read any books in this series and the first in this genre. I have inadvertently picked up a second, third or even fourth book in a series and can't wait to get my hands on the others. Not the case here. I continued reading because my cousin gave it to me and we have the same reading preferences. I was also convinced that it would get better in the next chapter. It never did and it took me over a month to get through it when it should have only taken a few nights at most. There were some good and likeable characters in the story, though. But, at the same time, there were too many characters that didn't move the story along. I am giving this book two stars only because I managed to get through it but it is quite forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diane Mott Davidson does it again!","review":"Diane Mott Davidson's latest installment in her wonderful \\"Goldy the Caterer\\" series is a real winner. The story line is both charming and intriguing. She weaves a fine mystery around a wonderful array of characters including a welcome return of Goldy's protege, Julian Teller. If this weren't enough, the loving description of food preparation and included recipes made me torn between reading the next chapter and running to the kitchen to try Goldy & Julian's latest creations. I highly recommend this book, and the other seven volumes in the series, if you've missed them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-Cut","review":"I read almost every murder mystery novel that comes out. This was one of the rare ones that I couldn't even finish. It rambled on with the secondary plot endlessly and was way to cutesy. If you have nothing else on your shelf it may be a good past time, other than that, there is more suspense in a Julia Child's cook book."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely depressing","review":"If you enjoy reading a book where everything turns out bad, you'll like this one! Personally I do not care for this type of scenario. There needs to be a few things to feel good about. The motivation of the competitive caterer was fairly obvious from the get-go. The 14 year-old son is extremely tiresome most of the time. He needs to know the awful truth about his jail-bird father. Why in the world doesn't Goldy level with him? No respect garnered for her on that one! This is so not true-to-life! I had a hard time finding the motivation to finish this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No focus on the murder","review":"This is the first book I read by Diane Mott Davidson. I was disappointed. The victim was murdered to early in the book. The author didn't build the charaters before the murder happened. The story line had too many other things going on besides focusing in on the murderer. I even considered not finishing the book. The last few chapters were good when everything started coming together. I would not read another book by Diane Mott Davidson."},{"rating":"2","title":"at the top of her form","review":"\\"Prime Cut\\" is Diane Mott Davidson at the top of her form, and the recipes---although fattening and non-too healthy!---are scrumptious in this book.

This one was a little harder to read than the other ones, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it! I read my first DMD book on my honeymoon because the title caught my eye \\"Dying for Chocolate\\" which described me since I had been dieting to fit into my wedding dress! I have tried many of the recipes included in the books. I have read every book since and look forward to reading any subsequent ones! Ms. Davidson, if you read this review, I live next door to the person who's sunroom addition you refer to in this book, and got the biggest kick out of reading your rendition of it!

Most of the characters in this book are, to say the least, quite rude in nature. Goldy is continuously sabotaged by her quite stupid extended family. Obviously she never got around to telling Arch the difference between right and wrong (maybe Goldy doesn't know the difference!). The entire book is contrived and pedestrian. The plot lines are the usual Goldy versus everyone else and food is the solution to all problems. This series needs a rest as it is becoming nothing more than an ongoing soap opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set, But Don't Buy It","review":"The English Concert's Vivaldi recordings are THE period instrument versions to own, but this fine compilation has now been been superceded by the newer, 7-CD box that includes all of the English Concert's Vivaldi recordings.

What impresses me most about Rick's playing is his incredible range, his creativity in improvisation (the ability to pull off continuous, \\"fluid\\" strings of musical ideas on an instrument that makes it difficult), and the energy with which he performs. This CD captures the \\"singing\\" quality of Rick's sound and showcases many of his talents in several styles of playing (bebop, classics, ballads, funk, etc.).

Then I put in this CD and wondered why they bothered recording it. Talk about cruddy sound! I should've just stayed with my \\"Out of the Blue\\" CD because that's about all this is, amazed that they must have been lip-synching to it because this CD has that tin-can sound like it was recorded off of some distant PA system.I'm a big ELO fan but I feel like \\"I was robbed\\" on this one.

It only came out in hardcover because the publishers knew Ms. McDarmid's name would sell, no matter how very awful the book is. It's hard to believe that the author who wrote A Place of Execution, a truly brilliant mystery novel, could also produce such drivel as Killing the Shadows. Cliched (this is the break we've been waiting for!) and cluttered with poorly written \\"romance\\", this book is the written equivalent of a teenage slasher flick. Serial killer running around and all the potential victims acting as stupid as humanly possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midday Shadows","review":"This mystery has merits, but the author would have done better to have set most of it at midday, when the shadows and the book would have been shorter.As I read I had the sense that for its merit (modest) and its purpose (to turn my mind off at a busy time of life,) I was spending far too much time getting to the end. I skipped from about page two hundred to about page four hundred (!!!) with no ill effects. I must have missed something, but it all seemed fairly complete. Verbum sapientis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious need for proofreader","review":"The extremely inadequate proofreading of this book made the reading very tedious and detracted from the story itself. There were egregious errors on every page, for instance multiple uses of \\"die\\" rather than \\"the.\\" If the Kindle for Mac version I received was scanned from a printed copy I am surprised the book ever made it into bookstores. I'm not sure what Amazon can do to redress this issue, but I hope someone will look into it.

The side trip to Spain could have been missed out completely.I can't say I am sorry to have finished reading 'Killing the Shadows' as I found it tedious and uninspiring. Hopefully Ms. Mcdermid's next book will be up to her usual standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad voice...","review":"I found Vari Sylvester's performance a bit disappointing. Her voice on this audiobook is too monotonous, most of the character are read in the same tone so that listening to her can become tiresome at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Val McDermid is fantastic","review":"Val McDermid is one of Britain's most popular crime writers. I loved the premise of this book - famous novelists are being murdered in the manner of their books. Very cool idea. Fiona is an interesting character in that she is not a cop, she is a scientist. By the end of the novel, she is such a fully fleshed person that you are excited and scared for her in a way, for example, that you can no longer be for characters like Kay Scarpetta or Tempe Brennan who have escaped death's clutches one too many times to make any future novels suspenseful. The fact that the ending is formulaic - what else could it be? - does not detract from the genuine enjoyment of the story. If you are getting bored of Minette Walters and Ruth Rendell, try Val McDermid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I'm a big fan a Val McDermid but this book was really bad and I'm sorry I paid for the paperback and didn't get it out of the library where I could have returned it without guilt, instead of feeling compelled to finish it. The main character, Fiona Campbell, wasn't particularly likeable, and the rest of the characters were pretty stupid. A serial killer is killing thriller writers and the police don't figure it is a serial killer well into the book, and even then that doesn't make new potential victims put their guard up for very long. Annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really baaad book","review":"The characters in the book act and talk so stupidly, while supposing to be brilliant. The plot is convoluted. The motives are unbelievable. It's repetitious. It's a waste of time. After enjoying the first quarter of the book, I plowed through the second quarter, before giving up in disgust.It's not logical.For example, after two writers have been murdered, the good guys figure out a connection to a third having gone missing. They illogically conclude because of the connection, that #3 has been abducted. Where did abduction come from?

His version is not the best but among them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, but buy the individual albums","review":"The music on this CD is all of the highest quality. The music on the second disc, the Dvorak and Elgar, are the two high points in the cello concerto repertoire. Unlike some of the reviews have suggested, Ma's playing is top notch. In fact, I consider his Elgar to be a rival to Du Pre's. Previn's conducting in the Elgar is the best I have ever heard from him. Ma and Previn bring out the resignation and melancholy in a way that is sure to bring tears to your eyes. The Dvorak is also very good; like the Elgar it is a resigned and very moving piece. The other concertos are also very good, especially the Schumann, it is simply that the quality of the music cannot match the Dvorak, and certainly not the Elgar.But if you want to buy these concertos, go with the albums they came from. The quality of the music is too good to buy simply a sampling of the music. Unless you cannot afford to buy the whole set, stick with the individual albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid thelogical food for the soul","review":"Teaching Luther's Catechism IIby Herbert GirgensohnGood and interesting study on Luther's Catechism - recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROCK HARD AND STALE!","review":"This is one of my mother's favorite candies in the world.

The writing is what grabbed my attention and held it throughout. M.L. Malcolm's words flow beautifuly, painting a stunning portrait of a troubled hero. Leo Hoffman has a gift for languages and uses this to lift himself out of poverty and, ultimately, to flee for his life to Shanghi during WWI. Malcolm's hero is one of the best I've encountered; he compromises his integrity out of his desire to protect his wife and daughter, as well as a desire to \\"better\\" himself. The imagery is breathtaking, from the gleam of a button, to Leo's heartbreak when leaving his beloved Martha. Silent Lies is, quite simply, a beautiful book. Let Malcolm take you to from Budapest to Paris to Shanghi. Let Leo Hoffman win your heart. Read Silent Lies; your only regret will be that the book has to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A literate, highly enjoyable page-turner","review":"\\"Silent Lies\\" is nearly impossible to put down. If you enjoy human drama on a sweeping scale, this novel has it all: action, intrigue, and passion played out among fascinating characters. ML Malcolm brings a breathless story to life with great skill as she transports us around the world from Europe to Asia to America during the war-boom-bust-war years of 1900-1940. I can't recall ever reading a novel where such a sweeping plot was delivered with such fluidity and concision. The pages practically turn themselves, and yet the many details of time and place that make the story live and breathe don't feel lost or rushed in the process. This is a remarkable achievement. Oh, and did I mention that the tale itself is fantastic?ML Malcolm has written a literate person's guilty pleasure. \\"Silent Lies\\" is a masterful combination of quality and fun and deserves great success. Buy it, and help to insure that a sequel comes soon. I can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, detailed and fascinating","review":"I bought this book with reservations.

But his plans backfire when he sells some stolen diamonds to a nefarious Shanghai gangster. The book is set in pre-World War I Budapest, and Shanghai in the 1920's and 1930's, and the author makes full use of the dramatic settings of those two scandal-filled cities. I found \\"Silent Lies\\" reminiscent of the famous film, \\"Casablanca.\\" It's full of intrigue, history and passion, and one could see Leo Hoffman stopping into Rick's cafe for a drink on his way to his next adventure.

In a small, impoverished village in Hungary, we meet a little boy, Leo. He is different even then, having unique skills that will serve him well throughout his life. We follow him to a sophisticated adulthood first in Europe, then in Asia, and marvel as he is struck again and again with loss of loves and lives. One wonders that he can continue, but always he does. He is a survivor par excellence. The narrative is never less than fascinating. The dialogue is never less than sure.

I let my friend, who had never heard any of Unearth's song before, watch this DVD, and he said something along the lines of \\"that's just noise\\"! And from just watching this DVD, you'd get the impression of Unearth actually just being pure, plain white noise. Which is a shame, because they actually write some interesting, complex metalcore tunes. And the backstage stuff isn't very much of a bonus either. So is three live songs with horrible sound quality and about a minute of backstage footage worth it? Not unless you're completely obsessed with Unearth.

All I can say is there was nothing better than the chemistry between Amanda King and Lee Stetson - Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner were terrific in their roles and made me want to watch them when the show originally aired, despite how I was all of 8 years old (seriously, I remember being a kid and staying up to watch this, and despite how I probably didn't understand half the content when it originally aired that is how much I appreciated the show even back then).Simply a great show, particularly when Amanda would explain to Lee what \\"mother and the boys\\" were up to.

Excellent commentary on women's position in society in the 80s - an important time for women as well as other minorities. A super fun look at the past. Solid acting, great comedic timing as well as suspense and even romance. Truly classic TV. We enjoyed every minute of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for DVD release","review":"In an effort to find decent shows/movies, I have gone back to the 80's and been able to find some of the online episodes of Scarecrow and Mrs. King.

It is extremely disappointing that a quality show such as Scarecrow and Mrs King has not been released on DVD. I echo sentiments already expressed: Please release all four seasons on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scarecrow & Mrs. King","review":"Why is every other TV show on DVD except this one. It's great.

They are releasing programs that only lasted one season on DVD. For some unknown reason, the people (whoever they are) are in no hurry to get SC & MK out on DVD.This was a great program that had a little of everything in it. I also thought it was one of Kate Jackson's best roles. She and Bruce Boxleitner had such chemistry. The only problem I had with the program was that it ended so abrubtly. I would have liked to have had at least one more season, but I know that was during the time Kate had BC. Anyway, I say its time to get a move on and get it on DVD. You won't make any money until you do. I guarantee you will find that it is a goldmine once it is released. You won't be able to keep the fans supplied fast enough. I am ready to sit down and watch some good SC & MK, so get busy and make it available to me. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Lee and Amanda!","review":"This was a great series.

I ordered a set from TV SHOW MEDIA, tvshowmedia.com and I am still fighting to have this \\"firm\\" either credit my VISA account or send the DVDs. But now I'm not sure what to do? If so many viewers want the show, and if the show has not been released, then what's going on with the offers on Amazon's own site? If the DVD sets are legal, then why haven't fans found them?

With the same sincerity, frankness and heartfelt committment she shows in her fiction, Paley shows us a world full of activists, ordinary citizens, cops and politicians. She has been involved in anti-war activities since her youth and, now in her later years, shows no signs of closing her powerfully observant eyes. Testimony about her experience in Viet Nam during the American war and after is an important contribution to historical studies. She shows no regret for her activism, which is great relief to this reader (tired as I am of seeing the 60s generation back off from their earlier work) and remains unapologetically truthful. A great inspiration for all women who live and work for 'the people'."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story of a Troublemaker","review":"This book tells the story of Grace Paley's journey through her life as an activist, a mother, a daughter and a friend.

The only real quirk is that whenever you digivolve there level gos back to 1. When you start you have 4 groups of digimon with 3 in each group.

I think I've read almost all of them and, with the exception of one or two, loved every one of them. But Match Me If You Can is by far my favorite. I think it must be the one-liners in this story that captured me. That and Annabelle's drive to succeed even when faced with defeat. Heath Champion is man who needs to fall a few rungs down the ladder, and watching love smack him down to the ground is by far the best. After all, it takes love to furnish a house and his so needs furnishing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun romance book!","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author, and I suspect I'll be picking up some more. The author includes just the right blend of romance and humor. The lead characters are likable, if somewhat dense, as they usually are in this type of book. They have to be dense in order to stay apart for most of the book for seemingly no good reason. Heath, the high-powered, workaholic sports agent and Annabelle, the idealistic, romantic matchmaker are a classic case of opposites attract. She balances him out perfectly. Though they never met until Heath hired Annabelle to find him a wife, they have a circle of friends in common. Many of Annabelle's strong, supportive female friends are married to men in the sports field. The book also has a subplot going on featuring Annabelle's rival matchmaker, Portia Powers and Heath's assistant, Bodie. Their story is just as interesting as the main one, and they'd make a great book themselves. I highly recommend this light, fun romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Author","review":"Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one of my favorite authors.

Her writing skill rises above those of almost every other author in this genre. She makes me feel like I personally know each character in her books, whether I like them or not! Her gift for dialogue is unmatched.That said, this book had the same problem as \\"Heaven, Texas\\", in my opinion. The pacing was off enough to affect my enjoyment of the book. Phillips let Heath be oblivious to his feelings for Annabelle too long. It become grating that he was so clueless to what was right in front of him. It had some great tension, however, and some excellent steam, and I'd like to occasionally reread some scenes, but it's not a keeper for me - hence the 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entertaining Match","review":"Annabelle Granger inherited her grandmother's matchmaking service and is determined to be a success in the business world. Sports agent Heath Champion is her first high profile client but she's in competition with another agency to find him a wife, and to complicate matters she becomes jealous of the women she is setting him up with.This is a light-hearted story with light-hearted romance between several endearing characters.

I especially liked the relationship between Annabelle and Heath's clients. It was a great story, so much more than a typical romance.All of the characters felt fully developed and like they had a point to the over all story. Sometimes, extra characters feel thrown in to make the story longer. This was totally not the case.The dialogue was sharp, witty and realistic. Everyone had a happy ending and it was just great.

No one writes a better romance than she does--hence her consistent successes.MATCH ME IF YOU CAN has all of the hallmarks of a SEP book: clever plot, funny twists, terrific dialogue and one of the more endearing heroines in recent memory.Nobody does it better than SEP, not with clever repartee and engrossing characters, alpha males and touching heroines.For fans of the author, MATCH ME IF YOU CAN will not disappoint. For new readers of her work, it will make a swell introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I have read this book before but I purchased it on my kindle so that I didn't have to borrow it from the library again!

I read it casually but still found myself thinking about the central characters when I was away from the book. The prose was sound with a rhythm that is easily embraced. The banter between the two main characters is very well done and was engaging enough to keep me interested in the eventual outcome. The relationship of Annabelle and Heathe does fall victim to obvious contrivance but other elements, such as a second romance was very well done. I also enjoyed the story's pacing, which did not seem rushed but had a pleasant 'pulse' throughout. I recommend this story for its contagious flair and enjoyable writing style. Also, I highly recommend the beautifully timeless novel, Anna's Trinity by Howard Cobiskey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This was the 1st SEP book I ever read, and it was so good I dedicated myself to reading ALL of her books!

I looooooved this book. No perfect hero or heroine--just perfect for each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I read this book about three times and its a good one but I can't shake the feeling that Heath fell for Annabelle out of the blue. I didn't get a sense that it was a gradual process. When he blurted out \\"You want fun, I'll give you fun.\\" it came as a shock to me like, \\"where did that come from?\\" A better approach would have been for the author to have Heath's life perspective change so that we could see that his values had changed thus we could see his attraction to Annabelle. There was nothing wrong with Annabelle...it was Heath's screwed up perspective of his life that was wrong and the author did not show his transformation.Otherwise I really did like the book but I did not like Dean Robillard nor do I wish to read his story (although I will if she writes it!). Dean seemed like a sissy boy to me; not attractive and uninteresting.I wish this story focused more on Bodie and Portia as they burned up the pages with their dialogue and heat.

Put on your softest sweats, foot lotion and sockies, lip balm, some aromatherapy on your ear lobes and across your forehead, grab this book and disappear. It's so perfect watching many characters grow, change, fall in love, have great and clever dialogue--just put this on your keeper stack and trust 113 reviews that you can't go wrong with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want a Heath Champion!","review":"I just finished reading this book and I loved it! I honestly wanted it to continue on. The romance between Heath and Annabelle was something you could tell would probably happen from the begining, but the way the story reached that point was very clever and witty. I know that SEB usually adds new characters into her books, but I want to hear more of the Annabelle and Heath saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Find!","review":"Warm summer day, nothing to read, popped in the library. I always go to the new book area and there was this book by a writer I had never heard of. The first chapter had me in stitches......and continued throughout the book. I am not a reviewer who reveals the story, rather just recommend and let the reader discover the joy to be found in reading this particular book. This is only my second review, was driven to share with others how marvelously entertaining this book was. It reawakened my desire to find similar books. I've just received Heaven, Texas by the same author and ready to dive into it. Reading this book will be a gift you give yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect summer read","review":"I've been a SEP fan for years, so it's no surprise that I raced right out to buy this book. Once I opened it, I was hooked. I literally couldn't put it down. Even though I was on vacation, I ignored everyone and simply sat on the beach and raced through the pages. This book is pure, absolute, unadulterated fun. I loved the characters and found myself often laughing out loud. I can't remember a better contemporary romance. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Warming and Lovely","review":"This was one of the first SEP books' I read and I loved it!She is a great writer and this book is touching and funny. Emotions are so well described and the characters handled with such care and attention, that I was hooked.It is a must read for anyone looking for a feel good book (although, there are some \\"serious\\" scenes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best","review":"If you're an SEP fan, then \\"Match Me If You Can\\" will not only not disappoint, it will thrill you. I truly believe it is one of SEP's best books yet. The plot-B romance is by far the most interesting one she has created to date. I think her descriptions and characterizations are the best yet. Portia Powers is so vivid, she leaps off the page. You'll see her and her type at grocery stores and schools and office meetings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possible New Series with these Great Characters","review":"I don't know where I have been to have missed this SEP book. I have read all her stories, some more than once. I was perusing through the library and found this SEP hardcover and grabbed it. Boy am I happy I did. This is such a fun story. I loved the characters and can easily see their personalities fit into the real world. I hope SEP takes these two new characters and continues on with their story. This is one of the reasons I love to read SEP she rewards you for staying with her. You remember little bits that she brings into her books from when she first started writing the Chicago Stars-based stories. Some of those one-liners just made me LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"I purchased this polish today after seeing several on the shelf and came home expecting to be blinded by silver light. I rubbed I poured I rubbed some more. I let it sit for the minute as recommended, rinsed and only slightly better. I thought maybe it was that vase I was working on so I tried another. Same thing. This product is O U T of my kitchen, There are better out there with better and QUICKER results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I got engaged on Christmas morning and I saw that the metal was made of .925 sterling silver. So I immediately got online and tried to find the best silver cleaner because I know without the proper care sterling can and will tarnish. So I found this on amazon and was impressed with the longevity of the company and the reviews. I got this as well as the jewelry polishing cloth. I have never seen any ring shine so bright in my life! No one, and I mean no one, has any idea that the metal is sterling and that the diamonds are cubic. This cleaner makes your jewelry shine and you will not be disappointed. I would not necessarily use this on the stones itself, but the polishing cloth is amazing for that. I am not a big fan of liquid, runny shiner because it often makes your jewelry tarnish faster. This polisher is liquid but it is seriously thick and it creates a protector border to keep the jewelry intact. I say get these products because it is the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Products I've Used","review":"Based on the 100% approval of 25 people, I bought this product. The product not only didn't do a good job, it actually made a slightly tarnished urn look worse. I spent three times as much effort and time using this product on a couple of pieces, with less results. I thought I must have been doing something wrong so I used my Wright's silver polish. Presto! Perfectly shined. On top of this, the Hagerty bottle smelled so bad that when I threw it out, I had to remove it from the kitchen trash container. I'm going back to my Wright's silver polish; it's so much more effective and easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best silver polish","review":"This was recommended by a shop owner who sells silverware.

Actually, too much -- plus having to purchase all the other stuff that goes with it made my polishing a little too pricey for my tastes.

Live and learn -- it still does a great job and is a value for the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for heavily tarnished silver","review":"I used this polish on antique silver cordial glasses that I've neglected to polish for at least a year. They are heavily tarnished. I applied the polish, buffed off and repeated. This polish simply made the tarnish shine. I don't like polishing silver...it's one of my least favorite chores. So, going through all this work with poor results is very disappointing! I will look into a home remedy silver dip, such as hot water with salt and baking soda before purchasing another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best silver polish","review":"I grew up using this, then I lost track of it. I moved and didn't find it in the stores where I shop. Well, welcome 21st Century! Just get on-line and find the good products. I have used so many different kinds of silver polish in the past several years and threw tens of dollars out the window. Most of them really smell bad and they don't even do a good job on my silver. They don't get the tarnish off and my hands and fingers were sore trying to make them work. I got so sick of wasting my time - and breathing that foul air. Finally, a bell went off in my head and I went on-line. I'm back with Hagerty Silver Polish. No kidding, I dare you to find a better silver polish. And, it won't ruin your nice stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hagerty 10120 Silversmiths' Silver Polish, 12 Ounces","review":"Good silverware polish. I've been using it for years.

But to be fair most of their singles were their greatest pieces of work - so it works out pretty well! There're a few OK songs (i.e. not up to par with the best) but LUCKY MAN, BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY, THE DRUGS DON'T WORK, etc. more than make up for the very few mediocre ones.If you're already into The Verve this is a worthy purchase - as a \\"newbie\\" it's the perfect place to start. Highly recommended to fans and non-fans alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, this is music.","review":"Many stateside listeners know The Verve only from the song \\"Bittersweet Symphony,\\" or perhaps the album Urban Hymns. For these listeners, there is a wealth of great music to be found on this greatest hits album. Songs such as \\"This is Music\\" and \\"History\\" are easily on par with the better known tracks from Urban Hymns, such as the gems \\"The Drugs Don't Work\\" and \\"Lucky Man.\\" Fans will surely have favorite songs that didn't meet the \\"singles\\" requirement for inclusion on this album. For me, \\"So Sister\\" would have completed this 5 Star effort. However, it's pretty safe to say that this is the best of The Verve, and therefore some of the best music around. If you already own all of these tracks then you might be dissapointed with this package--there are two new tracks, but no live or rare material (thus, the label \\"Singles\\"). Still worth the price of admission for Verve fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish!","review":"this book should be dismissed as pure fictional gibberish.

Pletnev really knows how this masterpiece should be played. Especially, the final movement is deeply moving. I have listened several recordings of this symphony, but I've never heard a better final mvt. After listening this CD, I found the Jansons - Oslo recording a little bit monotonous than this one.This CD is also coupled with wonderfully played \\"Marche Slave\\", 6 piano pieces, music from The Sleeping Beauty, and The Seasons, but it's still 1 CD price. Great deal.Rating 1 star only because the recording volume level is low? Don't be bothered with the poor rating below. You will never disappointed if you have a decent CD player (& headphone).

The melody and technic caught me in every track. In Korea, there is not so many CDs about Pletnev. This Tchaikovsky CD is in Korea, but it was very very disappointed to me. Aboveall, the volume is very low. I can't hear the sound of this CD with my portable CD player at highest volume level.

Based on the other reader reviews, it sounds like maybe the earlier entries in this series are better, but I didn't make it past the first chapter in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible \\"mystery\\", unedited, looks unfinished","review":"This looks like a draft. None of the characters you follow in the first few chapters appear in the last few chapters. Every sentence is noun, verb with no variation, no clauses. The first mystery, a teen girl's body in the garden, is completely ignored halfway through and never looked into! The second mystery, lots of cash in the bookcase is clearly a case of a manipulative lawyer scamming them, but never looked into again. The third crime seems to hinge on their only clue, it was done with a jeweler's wire. But this is never found nor attributed to the person arrested. And the running gag of trying to build a homemade post office at the station is not only pointless but also left hanging at the end.None of the characters do anything natural. None of the dialog is worth hearing once, but it is repeated at least three times each (and once five times), apparently to fill the pages.

Jill Churchill is an amazing writer that has more or less disappeared from bookstores, urging me to book this book via Amazon (lucky for them!).

I am living in Europe and my friends (between 25-45 and even 80y old family members) all await me to lend them my last J Churchill book. She scores higher than Dan Brown among my university/college educated friends and colleagues/assistants. At least J Churchill, unlike most american novelists (incl Dan Brown) doesn't cite unaccurate foreign language sentences or even less accurate geographical/economical facts in her books.

The murder seemed to be secondary to endless babbling about Robert and his postal center idea, or who was getting a dress hemmed at the tailor. The ending kind of came out of nowhere with no real reason. And the other mystery just seemed to be completely dropped without any explanation or resolution.Though this series has two main characters, Lily has always seemed to come across as the star...but she was barely present in this one.

This volume should be read after reading a few biographies, particularly; Hamilton, Burr, Jefferson and Washington. That background will help in understanding Jefferson's sometimes subtle digs and jabs at his contemporaries. There is a self-serving side to the Anas, but that is the nature of almost all personal accounts and easily identified with some prior reading.One can watch the growing corrosive effects of \\"party\\" on politics - each side, Federalists and Democratic Republicans, exaggerating the vices of the other and hyping the virtue of their own philosophy. Eminently readable, but keep Wikipedia handy to look-up numerous 2nd and 3rd tier players that T.J. will reference.Interesting also that the editor places his name on the same by-line as Jefferson.

The \\"scholarly\\" writing is confusing at best and totally lost me at worst. As much as I try, I cannot find anything about this book making it worth recommending to others. Goodrich's theory (theories?) rambles all over the place, she goes on and on about phonetics and linguistics to the point where even the most dedicated reader must be bored to tears, and it makes me wonder exactly what the point is that we are supposed to get from the book.

Well, Malory describes a place much like this, so Arthur must have been here\\" (as himself) \\"...forgetting of course that, assuming Arthur even lived, the story would have taken place about 1000 years before Malory was born.\\"Goodrich is not a careful scholar. She is not even realy a scholar, if these are her credentials. Nor is she a good enough writer to provide much other than confusion to a standard reader of Arthurian material. This book, and those that followed, are a hopeless tangle of badly put together theories that bear as much resemblance to Arthur as \\"Braveheart\\" did to William Wallace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off topic and lots more","review":"The author is a very talented writer, but she fails to stick to what she is originally trying to explain. The farther the chapter goes the more off subject it gets. Furthermore explanations about certain things are placed in totally wrong chapters. The author also doesn't give background information for those who do not know a lot about this topic. Even is you know the Arthurian stories, it is difficult to grasp at what Mrs. Goodrich is talking about. Since she states what she wants to analyze and then starts analyzing without explaining the situation. In cocnlusion, if you don't have to waste then don't bother reading this book.

When she mentioned 5th century Vikings, I nearly threw the book across the room but decided not to.

My reason for giving this DVD one star is technical. Rather than creating a new master from film elements, this DVD was created from an existing full-screen SMPTE television broadcast master. As a result, you miss all of screen left, all of screen right, and a portion of both north and south. \\"SORCERER\\" is one of my all-time favorite action films and I can only hope that Friedkin and company release the original, theatrical wide-screen version of this thriller. I am so disappointed by the technical failings of this DVD that I won't buy it unless/until it's re-released in the theatrical format."},{"rating":"2","title":"SORCERER coming to Blu-ray end of 2011/early 2012","review":"This has been an all-time favorite since I saw it at Scottsdale's long-gone Kachina Theater in 1977. Like many fans, I've found the pan-and-scan DVD that's been around for over a decade underwhelming, but as it's the only way to watch this overlooked masterpiece, I've put up with it.Great news for fans: William Friedkin is currently supervising a new Blu-ray edition of his film, which should be ready for release at the end of this year, or early next. Stay tuned for Amazon pre-ordering when the official release date is announced!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STUNNING REMAKE OF \\"THE WAGES OF FEAR\\" BADLY FORMATTED","review":"DVD COMMENT BY GANGARUNNER: One of the most intensely realistic thrillers ever made and William Friedkin's greastest work. Also the greatest REMAKE ever made. But is it formatted in WIDESCREEN with extras and maybe COMMENTARY? Heck no, it's FULLSCREEN with no extras. This movie would get 5 STARS but I give 1 STAR to the STUDIO for releasing this MASTERPIECE in FULLSCREEN. If ever a film begged to be LETTERBOXED, it's this one. I know this film did not do well in it's initial release, but it's obviously a CULT CLASSIC, now. I guess Friedkin is too busy doing another EXORCIST REISSUE- THE VERSION YOU HAVEN\\"T PAID FOR YET. What a crime.Maybe Criterion will redo this the way it should have been done. Don't fail to check out their version of the original classic, THE WAGES OF FEAR. A WORD OF WARNING-it's in French."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie - Poor DVD","review":"This is one of those movies that will forever suffer comparisons to the original. I saw it on it's original release and have never forgotten it's very stirring images. I have waited a long time to get a worthwhile home video version, but this DVD is not it. For a start they should of released a widescreen version. Even though it was shot in 1:1.66 (not 1:1.33 as someone said) ratio as lots of films are it was obviously not intended to be shown, theatrically at least, in that ratio. Hopefully Universal will return to this film someday and give us a restored anamorphic widescreen Special Edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting movie","review":"I watched this movie in the theater in the 70's and liked it then. I could never find it on Netflix so I bought it. The movie starts a little slow but it pcks up speed as the story unfolds. If you like action movies I would recommend, but this isn't for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grew Up in most of MOvie","review":"Nastalgic. I grew up near St. Peter and Pauls church and where a lot of movie happened in the Port Section of Elizabeth.Flashbacks to days as an altar and the creepy priest in the movie. That was one guy I thought would be another Sandusky. GO FIGURE- he actually quit the priesthood to marry someone of a different sex. Strange ain't it? LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roy Schieder at his best","review":"This is the movie that made me start paying attention to Roy Schieder. Playing a mobster on the run, he finds himself in Latin America hiding with no money, no comforts and no future. He gets a chance to improve his future by taking on a task that is fraught with danger and pushes his nerves to the limit. Great DVD to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated suspence thriller!!!!","review":"Not only was the film deep, and insightfull to the inner soul of a human being in the situation of, in a desperate attempt to be free of the self made prison of these four criminals. To drive accross trecherous terrain of primevel forests of South America in trucks loaded with dynamite so unstable with the nitro leaking from the sticks of death. one wrong move and BOOM! The music was absolutely incredible. Tangerine Dream did a soundtrack that scared the **** out of me!! Don't forget, all this was brought to us in 1977! I was very young and left an impression in my brain! This movie is the prime spark for me getting into Digital Synth Music. All actors were intense and suffered much for the shooting of this film! A MUST GET for armrest gripping viewing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps we will never see a proper version","review":"I hate giving this masterpiece a 2 out of 5 but it is the DVD that is in qeustion...not the film. Will a full aspect ratio version of this gritty film ever come out? Will we ever see a remastered copy? A Friedkin commentary? Probobly not. We see mounds of BAD films filling the shelves with dir. commentary and making of's. They have transfers that are impecable, yet worthy films are set aside, mastered from rotting prints. We know that Sorcerer is NOT a marketable DVD, the profit margins are too low. But when we see special editions for forgettable films that made little to no money at the boxoffice, it makes one wonder how these companies view their provocative films, what their scale of worth is.Maybe, it only adds to the film's flair; forgotten, but wicked, wicked cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hidden Aspect Ratio on DVD, unfortunately not correct.","review":"I really wish that it were true that the original ratio is there, but just squished, as stated by Gary E. Maisack (Sorry Gary. Honest mistake, I'm sure buddy. ) But anyone with this DVD can check it out for themselves. The frame has been cropped and this is not a wide-screen version in any form. The proof: the picture on the back of the DVD. Look at the actors standing around. Go to the same scene in the movie and voil��: one actor is now cropped out, another is only half there.The only reason I point this out: Demand a Blu-ray of this great classic! Universal Studios put out Flash Gordon on Blu-Ray, but not this work of art. It's still in it's VHS release format. Shameful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"Ah, a great film as a combat veteran of Iraq , i can understand the impact of stress these guys went thou. As i loved the book , and the film Wages of Fear , i found that this film was head and shoulder's above it.While i dont understand why it was named after one of the old army trucks , it still remain a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Widescreen!","review":"This is not a review. I personally love the film. I want to help clear up some misleading comments from an earlier reviewer who states this film is not available in widescreen.This film was shot in 35mm with an aspect ratio of 1.66-1. The first time I saw it was in '93 or '94 on VHS and that WAS widescreen. Amazon even offered a widescreen VHS version before the selection was unavailable for a time, to be replaced by the version they sell now.These are not speculations, they are facts. Why the distributors choose to release the DVD and the newest video in fullscreen format is beyond me. Perhaps the same people who are responsible for the \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" release mess had a hand in this mediocrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Wages of Fear\\"","review":"Yes, it's true. I enjoyed this film more than I did \\"Wages of Fear\\". I think it's much more suspenseful, for one thing, especially the rickety bridge scene. That was some incredible movie making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a little trip...","review":"I've seen this great film on the big screen three times and was blown away each time. Excellent cinematography, intense characters, and dismal settings catapult you into the the story for one hell of a ride. This looks and feels like a documentary, making it a real nail-biter. The eerie and haunting soundtrack by Tangerine Dream is so trippy, years ago I would've freaked out!. If you know someone with a huge tv screen have a Sorcerer party. Definitely at the top of my dvd collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic movie, mediocre presentation","review":"After having seen \\"Wages Of Fear\\" I was eager to see \\"Sorcerer\\", and as great a movie as it is, the DVD is presented in full screen format (yeccch!) and apparently transferred from a substandard master. I wish I could give two ratings, one for the movie itself (5 stars) and another for presentation (less than 1 star) but the rating system doesn't allow this so until a newer iteration appears, my rating will have to remain as it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive Parenting Book","review":"Have an uncommunicative teen who is raging for his/her independence?

It was a fun show---adventure, tongue-in-cheek laughs---that took itself just seriously enough.The only two things I regret---that it did not last longer, and that IT IS NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD!There have been quite a few releases of shows that lasted one season or less, but this one has slipped through the cracks---and it obviously has a fan base that will buy the DVDS---so get up off your seats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Husband is one happy Monkey!","review":"Since I have known my husband, over 20 years, he has talked about Tales of the Gold Monkey. I had never watched it, but he had loved it. So I added to my watch list for years on Amazon, and like magic I received an email in Feb letting me know it was being released in June, it arrived on my husbands birthday. He opened it that morning, then came home from work early so he could watch it. He's so happy and enjoying watching every episode!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, clean action, adventure, humor, and entertainment--what more can you ask for?","review":"The tales in this series are treasures because of the story line and also the actors--some of whom have departed this plateau of existence.

Look forward to the rest. Also, received the order in a timely manor. Tks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun show","review":"If you're looking for period accurate or more of Indiana Jones this series might disappoint. If you're looking for a fun filled adventure show, this is the one for you. The flying scenes and the characters are good for the period. Some of the plots could be a little thin. Thick or thin, this show is always fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun show, poor audio","review":"This is a fun show with a very likable cast. But the transfer leaves much to be desired. The video is only so-so... but acceptable I guess. The main problem; the audio transfer is really sub-standard. There is something wrong with the dialogue and effects mix. I don't know if it's a compression issue, or the original audio off the master tapes was poor to begin with? But this audio is not DVD-quality. The best way to describe it would be it sounds like audio off of an old, cheap VHS tape recorded at EP (lowest quality) speed. This issue seems to be on all the sets. I returned my initial set, got a replacement -- the replacement set had the same problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little known TV show I never missed","review":"When this show came out I was going to school for an Aircraft MaintenanceLicense, to work as an Aircraft Mechanic. In this little known TVseries, Jake Cutter was living my dream. Operating a Flying Service in theSouth Pacific, with a Grumman Goose Aircraft. He was like a flying IndianaJones. I guess thier was'nt anything real great about this series, I do'nteven know how long it lasted, but at that point in my life each episodewas straight out of a young aspiring aviatiors dreams. If they come outwith the whole series I'll have to buy them. I'm sure they can transportme back to a time when I still dared to dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales of the Golden Monkey","review":"I grew up flying in the goose and enjoyed it very much. When this TV series came out, it brought back many wonderful memories. I am so glad I bought the complete set and have enjoyed many hours watching The Tales of the Goldern Monkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"No CC, No subtitles","review":"My wife and I loved this show when we watched it in 1982. When we found out it was being released on DVD, we couldn't wait to get it. However, we are both a bit hard of hearing, and must rely on closed captioning, or subtitles to be able to follow the dialog. Alas, TOGM has neither CC, nor subtitles, rendering the DVD set useless for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese-tastic!","review":"While the plots were nothing original--one was directly copied from Magnum PI--it was mindless fun. It was one of those series I wanted to like more than I actually did.

I've watched several of the episodes here and there (I think USA had the series on at one point back in the late 80's) But to this day i've never seen the pilot past the seen where John \\"Higgins\\" Hillerman knife's Sam (the hot handed blue suited Guy Jake fights on the dock) I had the storybook for years before it finally fell apart and am looking to buy a new copy.This was my favorite series and I wrote several of my own adventures with this show in mind I'm looking forward to Legends Never Die as the fight that introduces Jake's old buddy is hysterical. This was Stephen collins first major role I think after Star Trek The Motion Picture (He played Commander William Decker) and long before 7th Heaven.Anyone who's a fan of Indiana Jones will love this! I plan to buy two copies and give one to my nephew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeahhhhh, finally released on DVD","review":"I have been waiting so long for this brilliant show to be released. It is just so much fun, I love everything about this show. I did buy a 'Dodgy Set' about two years ago, cost a fortune and the quality was to say the least, extremly poor, but I watched it anyway, that's how much I love this show, so roll on June....Just waiting for 'Hawaiian Eye' and 'Surfside Six' to be released, it's the simple things in life that put a smile on your face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that's some GOOD monkey!","review":"When I was a kid growing up, my brothers and I used to wait every week for this show! Yes this show actually came out before the Indiana Jones franchise, but further more it was a shout out to the days of old where if you couldn't go to the movies (our small town had no theater) you could still enjoy the swash buckling theatrics that only showed up on the silver screeen.If I had to recommend this to anyone (and I do) I say sit down and watch it with your kids (espcially young boys) and relive the days when morals, adventure and fun didn't involve an X-box, Wii or even a Playstation. Besides you got a one-eyed dog! What more could you ask for?

Many of us saw this show in the early 80's, and on USA channel in short lived syndication, and loved it......C'mon , you know you did. It took a long time, several websites, and several pettitions to get this to DVD, and believe me it will be well worth the wait. This was, plain and simple, a great example of pure adventure escapism drama on TV. Fun to watch, and great to be a part of week after week......while it lasted. Indiana Jones like?......sure......but with a flavor all it's own. The characters made this show likeable, watchable and unique. Tune in and check it out......it's a fun ride !!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Shopping","review":"Don't bother looking any further for a guide, Bradt outdoes them all. Zanzibar, while extremely laid-back and peaceful can be a bit complex, if only because it's on the other side of the planet (for 99% of the world, anyway). The author does a fantastic job of explaining the nuances, accurately rating and describing the various tourist facilities, and helping to acclimate the reader before arrival (He's also not too shy to review his own book, I see).

I admit I continue to squirm through these bloodfests as if addicted. But if this is entertaining, then I think our society is truly sad. I've sworn off the spate of \\"torture\\" films like the many SAWS, HOSTELS, etc., and I should have sworn off this one. There's nothing truly entertaining in this blood soaked brutal movie, where young people are sadistically murdered and then eaten. And of course, there will more than likely be a WRONG TURN 3 because the world is still full of we horror addicts who just gobble them up (pun intended). But if like me you're getting sick of them, let's make a secret pact to avoid these unredeeming assaults on human dignity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would like to give this a -5!!!","review":"Horrible!

Lynch has produced a respectable gorefest that continues the simple themes of the original. This time, however, a hint of media satire has been thrown in, along with a mean machine ex-marine.

Instead I highly suggest that you purchase \\"A Guide to Elegance : For Every Woman Who Wants to Be Well and Properly Dressed on All Occasions,\\" \\"Entre Nous : A Woman's Guide to Finding Her Inner French Girl,\\" and last but not least, \\"What Southern Women Know (That Every Woman Should) : Timeless Secrets to Get Everything you Want in Love, Life, and Work.\\" Of course anything by Judith Martin is right on track, as well!I collect old magazines and this fits in with what was being written in women's magazines in the '50's.

The info seemed outdated in terms of what is considered proper ettiquette these days and also in terms of a woman's role in society. Perhaps some of the most basic facts of etiquette from this book still apply, but I don't think anyone raised with even a modicum of manners will learn anything new. Look for a newer reference and one with specifics if you really want a book on etiquette."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS Tape","review":"This movie was a favorite of mine...

Every track isn't on point production- and hook-wise, but every single song brings it lyrically. For me, the mark of a great CD is three excellent songs, and this one has at least four: Cypha 911, Know Me, Creature Double Feature, and Love Life. There are other good ones. Interestingly enough, this compares favorably to B. B. Jay's Universal Concussion (which is better-produced and more solid musically) because Cross Movement avoids what I see as B. B. Jay's mistake of focusing too much on himself and his talents.

This is a carefully researched, densely plotted, richly characterized novel which is packed with incident and conceived and executed on a grand scale. It vividly brings Africa and its people to life. It would make a good film and is likely to appeal to those who like to be transported from their armchairs to another time and place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A somewhat flawed edition of a fine novel","review":"A unique evocation of what it was like to safari in Africa in the mid-19th Century. The author's \\"voice\\" allows us to saturate ourselves in the colors, textures, odors, sounds, and sensations of a trek through wildest Africa. I've never read anything quite like this, in terms of transporting the reader far from the here and now, to a long-vanished world. The novel also tries to do justice to a long-forgotten historical figure, the explorer Speke, whose untimely death and rivalry with the much-more-famous Burton have conspired to cheat him of almost all credit for his incredible exploits. But the character you won't soon forget is the narrator, \\"Bombay,\\" whose vocabulary and viewpoint are quite unique to English literature!

The compelling nature of the text keeps these from being as distracting as they otherwise might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curt front hitch","review":"Hitch is great and does everything I need.

They do come off easily, though I'm not sure how long the stickiness will last and how many times they can be removed. However, I must live with them where my grandson placed or re-paint the walls.

This alone makes it a new ride in of itself. The opening episode, a-la Hearts Of Darkness documentary on Apocalypse Now, is funny and a mood-setter for the season.As a native Colombian, I did feel disappointed that Entourage also failed to depict Colombia properly. Seems like they followed the stereotype of the small town-village setting (that we do have, but in the rural areas) to make it seem as if the entire country is so underdeveloped. Because of the satirical and comic nature of Entourage, I let it pass. Just a thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Show slows down a bit this season","review":"4.2 starsDidn't dig this one nearly as much as season three, mainly because there wasn't enough of Dillon and Piven, my reasons for watching the show. Vince and Eric are pleasant enough, but really not that funny. And I watch this show to laugh, so the Medellin story line gets a little old due to its semi-seriousness. I also got more than a bit tired of the Walsh character, who might be accurate as a type but really isn't very funny and grates pretty hard after a while.Nonetheless, the writing is still strong and there are enough solid laughs to make it worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entourage the Complete Fourth Season","review":"I bought this DVD for my daughter for Xmas and I know she is going to love it. The price and shipping are wonderful. thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable but does get kind of repetitive","review":"I enjoyed this season just as much as previous ones, however I do feel the series is running out of steam. Stories get kind of repetitive, there is no real character growth. Ari, Lloyd and Bill Walsh carried this season for me. Unlike many reviewers, I liked the first episode very much.I also don't look for any kind of moral message in this show. I am a woman and it is obvious that women in this show are mainly portrayed as sexual objects. However, it seems to be a reality in the world of money and fame. Instead I like getting an insight in the world of filmmaking. I never thought it was so complex...On a negative note, what I don't like about this show is a huge number of dropped story lines. It wasn't that noticeable in previous seasons, but this time it stood out for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most disappointing release of the year.","review":"Virtuoso caught my ear on his 12-inch single \\"Incinerator\\", which was extremely dope.

Somebody told me he had released an EP, and I later found a copy of it. But when I heard it, the dire truth hit me. On this EP Virtuoso tries to do his own version of \\"Hard Knock Life\\" and it sounds terrible to hear him spit over jiggified, Swizz Beats-like production.

I have to say that J. D. Tynan far exceeded my expectations and I highly enjoyed her wit and humor. The dialogue itself was incredibly real. I felt as if I were in the room with these characters. The detailing was not overly done like a lot of new authors tend to do. It was subtle, yet again, I felt as if I were in the same room with these people.The story itself was GREAT!

Still it has it moments.Caravans of Mars is similar, giving some detailed information on the Eastern desert of the Aetheri/Elysium wastes and introduces several NPC's and the Shaman profession (about 4 1/2 , 4 & 4 pages respectively). The rest is an adventure with the characters travelling by caravan across the Eastern Desert. As with the other adventure, the adventure runs on rails and needs tweaking to make it more enjoyable.

Not funny. It seemed like it would have been much better had it been made with the budget reqired for a modern funny movie.One really great thing was to see a woman in a lead role who looks absolutely average.

This was the Markets' last album before they went on hiatus in 2006. Unfortunately, I couldn't disagree more with the first two reviewers. While I really liked Digidogheadlock and Osc-Dis (haven't listened to 010 yet), this was a massive disappointment, not to mention it wouldn't play in anything in my house (a byproduct of the copy-protection which almost always accompanies Japanese CDs nowadays). There was far too much screaming, even moreso than other MCM albums. Oddly, one of the quietest songs (She Loves It/Explore the New Day) is on this otherwise loud album. Let It Rip is a remix of the song of the same name from the Japanese \\"psytrance\\" group Joujouka (they're not psytrance, they're not even close to psytrance, they're not even trance! But enough about Joujouka. You can read my reviews of their products when I post them). Only a few good songs here.

It contains LOTS of extra material from the smash hit series 8, and is full of beautiful cast and CGI pictures. Best of all, each script is introduced by the king of smeg himself- Doug Naylor! Some of the behind the scenes stories are utterly hilarious(anyone who's read 'Rubber Mask' will know what I'm talking about!). Mr Naylor also shares with us smeggies the troubles Red Dwarf went through in the three years between series 6 and 7. This man has my undying respect and gratitude- and Red Dwarf will never die!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time has passed it by","review":"In the four years since this book was published, beading as a craft and art has made huge leaps forward. The speed of advancing talent is pushed by avid dedication of beaders and advances in bead technology (the uniformity of delicas and the variety of finishes and colors, for example.) Leaps like these left this book behind. This is a simple book that helps beaders achieve simple projects. There is almost a naive, \\"let's get married on the front porch\\" appeal to the beadwork.If today's bride is a beader, she wants to showcase her talents with impressive pieces. The bride who is not a beader will pass over these projects as not being elegant enough for a wedding day.Beginning beaders might want to try beading on memory wire or stringing fresh water pearls, both are projects in this book. But there are other beginning books that provide more information and a better foundation."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I just bought this book and I find it totally useless.

Based upon the catalog image and description it looked like a sure thing.Unfortunately, what we got instead looks like a cheap imitation. Our primary gripe is that the hair on our product is far shorter than that shown in the catalog image, resulting in hair that, especially for the face, is too short to brush into any shape resembling a Yorkie. Instead, the hair is frizzy and stands straight out on the entire body. The head shape is wrong for a Yorkie too, looking more like a schnauzer. I feel like I've been taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Pictured","review":"While the photo online is rather cute, the item I received bears no resemblance whatsoever.

Worse yet, a lot of the quilting is sloppily done. There are examples of crooked and misshapen quilting on almost every page. I feel that the quilts in such an expensive book should be examples of expert craftsmanship. Of the 60 quilts, there are only about a dozen that have any visual appeal at all. Most of these successful quilts are the ones where she did a lot of free-motion stippling, which at least adds a little depth. The author does have some great design ideas, but they are limited in execution by her dependence on the machine. You should at least look at this book in the store to see what she does with a log cabin."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Quilt as Desired\\"","review":"This book is the only one I've found that does a really good job of showing how the quilting can change the appearance of a quilt, by showing the exact same piecing with different quilt patterns. The photography is excellent and the subject fascinating. I don't mind at all that machine quilting was emphasized..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"Great book because it shows the same piecing with different quilting patterns to provide visual opportunity to see how the quilting really does \\"make the quilt.\\" Beauty is in the eye of the beholder so it also reveals how creative you can be. I didn't mind that it used machine quilting because anything a machine can quilt should be able to be hand quilted for those who have the time and wish to do so. I don't think it takes away from hand quilting at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Mid-Atlantic Travel Guide!","review":"Chriss Slevin and Leah Smith travelled 4000 miles to research \\"Dirt Cheap, Real Good\\" and all of the hard work shows. This thorough travel guide of the thrift shops and other stores specializing in highly discounted items is broken down to six road trips that start in Washington, D.C. and travel to Delaware, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and other places surrounding D.C.\\"Dirt Cheap\\" is a really fun book, and the restaurant recommendations included in it are a real treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just thrift stores!","review":"You may purchase this guide looking for some stores to stop into, but what you'll find instead is the makings of a thrift vacation. The authors outline great roadtrips to surround the highlighted thrift stores, so you'll know where to stay and eat as you thrift your way around the mid-atlantic region. They even throw in some other activities besides thrifting in case you go into bargain-hunting overload. It's a pretty genius idea and a totally original take on road-tripping. I highly recommend picking this book up for a new perspective. Plus, they do give you all those great stores to stop into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirt Cheap, Real Good is REAL GOOD","review":"I bought DIRT CHEAP, REAL GOOD for a weekend trip to D.C. and I was blown away by the thorough research the authors had done on thrift shops in the area. They not only tell you where to go, but also include information about what to expect in terms of price, selection, and even atmosphere. The writing is lively and fun, and the book is illustrated with photos of many of the stores. This book is a gem for true connoisseurs of thrift stores and American popular culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and Entertaining","review":"Great trivia, wonderful to amuse guests at a party with your bizarre musical knowledge and the real scoop on some musical \\"urban legends\\".A fun and easy read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"I got this for my sister who loves to read and love pop culture.

Examples of his paintings are presented throughout the story, and readers learn what influenced the works at different periods of his life. The author's own cartoons, interpreting events in the story, are very funny. Both big and small kids love them. One of the very best children's books about art we have ever read. Venezia's entire series is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blame Lion's Gate.","review":"I saw a pretty healthy compliment of DVD copies of this film on the shelf at Bl0ckbuster a week ago.I guess Lion's Gate has a thing for distributing really bad low budget horror films.This particular film was conceived, written, and directed by a guy who clearly should not be making films. And to top it off, he plays the lead in the film. How's that for retarded?And to make it even worse, some of the credits info on this webpage are incorrect (who the f uck is Ralph Baber?), leading consumers to believe that this \\"sequel\\" was made by the same director of Dark Harvest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely, Positively, HORRIBLE!!!","review":"Bought this video at a movie store that was going out of business for around 49 cents.

Where are the scarecrows???","review":"0 STAR:For most of the first 45 minutes of this movie,it was about a father looking for his 2 little girls in a corn field. Was this the movie producers way of trying to make a movie as fast as possible? It seems that they gathered some people in a local neighborhood,including the little kids and made a cheap movie. And on top of all of this I didnt even see one scarecrow. Listen dude movie producer,a corn field cannot be scary without scarecrows!!!!! I could no longer take it anymore and I fast forward searched the rest of this boring movie and was upset that I didn't do it sooner. The first Dark Harvest movie was actually very good and it showed some scary looking scarecrows. I dodn't notice any scarecrows in this movie and I thought the cover of this dvd misleaded me. Horrible movie,not worth the $10 I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"Alright! This was just stupid. It has some dad looking for his daughters in a maze cornfield. That's basically what it shows through the whole movie. Didn't even finish it, it was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, Give the guy some credit","review":"I have to say the DVD cover lured me in. The design is great, although there are no killer scarecrows in the film, pity. I am giving the maker of this film some credit because he managed to capture autumn so well on film. The shots of the corn fields, the autumn trees, the fall wind, and the dreary skies are great. Plus, Halloween is my favorite time of the year, and he captured the mood perfectly. I would tell people who are big fans of this time of the year to at least look at it for the scenery. The 2 girls lost in the field were just terrible actors, and I agree with one reviewer who said the 'screaming into the camera' part was so annoying. Yet any film taking place during fall and Halloween in a cornfield has my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope Cowell reads this.","review":"I was actually thinking about writing Mr. Cowell a letter but this will have to do. If there was an award for worst movie ever written, this one would win hands down. I laughed through all of it. It looks to me as though you were given a camcorder for your birthday and you decided to make a movie. A low budget is no excuss for something this bad. I don't just blame you, your editor needs to take a little more time figuring when to stop showing so much corn.Don't even compare this movie to the Blair Witch project. That one had something going for it. I can see you spent more money on the cover of the DVD then in the making of the film. I think it's sleezy what you did, \\"Trying to hop on the back of what-ever success Harvest Moon 1 made.\\" and showing a scare-crow on the cover and having no such thing in the actual movie.I'd be ashamed to be apart of that movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful....","review":"As a owner of the first Dark Harvest film which I thought was merely a OK film, I was anxious to see Dark Harvest 2 thinking maybe it would be a better movie than the first. Wrong!!!!!!! This movie was terrible from beginning to end! A cheap attempt to make a horror movie. This movie gives you the effect that an amateur with a hand held cheap video camera walked around filming this movie. The acting was horrible and so was the plot. It made no sense at all and after 15 minutes, I was tempted to stop watching but out of curiousity, I suffered through the whole movie. You get sick of seeing this man searching for 2 girls lost in a corn maze. I'm very glad that I only rented this movie and didn't buy it. It would have been a terrible waste of money!!

After we watched this piece of trash we decided that the director clearly wanted to make his point. He wanted to direct and put out the worse movie ever. Actually, if you think about it Bill Powell is a genius. It's a low budget movie which anyone with a camera can film and he made money off it. He probably didn't make much but I think I might try and do the same thing. Why not?

There's a couple of excellent tracks and arrangements on this indie label release from Twilight Souls Music. Michael Poss' vocal phrasing and his style will most likely appeal to the Harry Connick, Jr., Linda Eder, and Johnny Mathis crowd.

Bring me back to the days when music was more about how much money you have, how many women you can have, and how much jewellery one hand can support. Curtis, Marvin, we need ya!

The cuts that really stick out are \\"wait a minute\\" the beats are hott!!!! \\"no more\\" because he explains how he can just bounce back from a sad relationship with lines like \\"Ray J don't love you, Ray J don't need you.\\" Then comes the sex filled anthem \\"wet me\\" which is personally one of my favorites. Ray J pours his heart out on \\"Takin' Control\\" lettin' a girl know how much she means to him.Then there's \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\", this Rodney Jerkins produced hit is very uplifting. All of the others songs are straight up party joints I think that is whathe was mostly going for , which is to keep the people moving.\\"Out Tha Ghetto\\", which features his KnockOut Ent. artist Shorty Mack, is song about keeping it all together.Lastly the ultimate jam, \\"Where do We go From Here\\"is an all out tight ballad that is explainin' the strains traveling can put on a relationship. This album is definitley not a game. Do ya thang Ray J!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word - Awful","review":"I don't know how stuff like this actually sells but it probably will. It's unfortunate but if people really listen, Ray J just doesn't have much lyrical talent and probably doesn't have a good enough flow to be a force as a rapper.

The title of this album may sound like a warning, and it is. It is advice that Ray J should have taken! His try-hard gangsta R & B act doesn't work as he is not really hardcore (anyone who is remembered only as Brandy's brother can't really be hardcore!)

I had to break it down and explain what the fairy in the story, Velvet Rose, wanted to accomplish, but the complexity of the verbage didn't bother her so much. She had plenty to feast her eyes upon in the wonderfully imaginative pictures to keep her occupied while I read. Plus, I believe that her exposure to such language and vocabulary can only be good for her in the long run. She will ask me what the word 'plight' means and I am most happy to define it for her.

As far as the Shostakovich quartets are concerned, the Later BQ are brilliant performances, and my first choice for this music:(1a) Virgin Classics: #2,3,7,8,12 (2-CD)(7243 5 61630 2 7) The Virgin Classics set is a selection from the original BMG/Melodiya disks:(1b) BMG/Melodiya:(74321 40712 2) #1,2,4(74321 40713 2) #3 + Two Pieces for String Octet + Piano Quintet (with S.

I love the fact that there are 5 different segments that I can do in whatever order I want to. Hot Cardio Mix & Tango Toning Twist are my favorite sections. If you really get into the groove and move you will feel it, especially in your hips and waist.I like Stella beacuse she seems to enjoy the workout which makes it easy for me to forget that she sometimes says right when she means left and that the music is a little low sometimes. And those are the reasons I give it four stars instead of five. However, that's not something that doesn't bother me at all since I've done it a few times and now know which way to go and what to do.So if your like the latin style dances this should definately be a dvd in your collection along with Stella's Sizzling Salsa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good workout.","review":"I like this video workout. I did the whole video and felt that the time just flew by. It is pretty fast paced and her cueing is not the best, but I don't find her at all annoying like some other instructors. I bought the crunch salsa video and I couldn't do that one at all. One of the background people drove me nuts. I know - such a stupid reason, but I just couldn't work out to that video so I gave it away. But I liked this one and can see myself doing it once a week. I say once a week, because it's a little too light of a workout for me. I like more of an intense cardio workout and this is definitely not the case. I would say that you need to have knowledge of a basic cha-cha step and merengue step. If you know how to do these two steps, this workout should be ok because she does move quickly. And I find it fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners!","review":"The step explanation is poor and the instructor goes too fast, as if she were in a hurry to fit everything she has planned in 10 minutes. I could not follow her at all and ended up discouraged and quit after 2 minutes. The instructor must think that just because she says, \\"You can do it!\\" repeatedly her audience can \\"osmose\\" the complicated steps she presents. This 10 minute solution is no solution at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not incredibly impressive...","review":"As an individual with 18 years if dance experience, I had expected an individual tapped to make a dance oriented exercise video to be more impressive. Sandoval (the instructor) gave unclear direction at several points in the workout. Also, the choreography left something to be desired. Some of the moves, SHE frequently performed incorrectly because the counts were not consistent with the music. I have really enjoyed the 10 minute solution series, but this was a bit of a letdown. If I had trouble doing the moves, I would assume individuals without training would as well. Granted, I have a more discerning eye and am probably more interested in correct execution...still, I found this DVD frustrating at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she crazy??","review":"OK, first off - I gave this DVD 2 stars because I actually liked Stella. She seems personable, and is not annoying. However, she goes WAY too quickly. True, I do not have any previous experience in latin dancing, but I know how to dance - this was just too much!! She would barely get you through the moves before she started the next one. I just could not keep up with her. I also did not feel as though I was really getting a workout from this - maybe if I wanted to learn latin dancing, but I assumed it was a workout DVD? Maybe she goes too fast that I am not getting the benefits from the workout, but I do not like. I went with the Daily Dozen w/ Denise Austin instead for my quick workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"Very little instruction concerning the dance steps before working into the cardio routine. I was frequently tripping over myself and rewinding the dvd to see what I was doing wrong. Overall, this exercise dvd was a lesson in frustration.

Still on the hunt for a good Latin dancing exercise dvd..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Effective","review":"I thought the cuing was just fine. It was fun and I've lost inches from my midsection and 6 lbs. It'll take awhile to get bored because every time I do it, I notice a little different style she adds to it.

I usually don't like exercising to solo person, but Stella held her own by herself. I like this dvd. A lot of the moves she did in this dvd, she did in her Dance Off The Inches Sizzling Salsa dvd workout. I tend to catch on to dances quick. I like that she repeats the dances. Repetition is always good in a dance workout. It helps the person learn the steps and before they know it, they will know it like the back of their hands.I'm glad for my Core Rhythms workouts as well. They have helped me with this workout as well.Stellla has another dvd that's out already or coming out. I hope to get that one soon.I recommend this workout to anyone that loves doing latin dance workouts.The workout goes so fast. To me, it didn't feel like I have done a 50 minute workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it!","review":"Unless you are latin and already are familiar with these dance steps- you will be totally lost. The instructor does not take enough time with the basics before she adds elements. I was very frustrated with this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fast","review":"I bought this DVD because I'm a huge fan of the 10 Minute Solution DVDs. I liked all the ones I've bought. However, the instructor in this DVD seems to be dancing by herself and is not in tune with the audience. She goes too fast as if though she's in a hurry to complete this in 10 minutes. I got very discouraged trying to follow it the first time. Not recommended for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could Return","review":"I bought this video thinking it would be easy enough to catch on to, but I was disappointed. The steps were way to complicated and the angle of the camera following the instructor made it very difficult to catch on. I have another workout video which I love and just wanted something to add to my collection and also add some variety. I'll be sure not to pick up these 10minute videos again. I also didn't like that only she was on the video. I like when there are a group of 4-5 ladies making it fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst dvd i bought it","review":"I was excited when i received my new dvd, i have back problems so, somebody recomended do dance exercises, so i bought the 10 minutes solution latin dance. But when i did the chacha segment it was to fast for me, and i got bore. I did better on salsa, but this dvd don't impressed me and the music is too boring there is no real latin music at all. Than God i didn't paid a lot of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good look at Muay Thai","review":"I'm surprised by some of the reviews here. I was really impressed by Master K and his teaching. The students on the tape are a pretty typical class - a few beginners, a few average guys and a couple of really tough looking guys I would not want to meet in the ring. The instruction is solid, especially if you have some experience. I really liked the little tips and tricks that Master K tossed out throughout the two videos. A few times I had to rewind and listen again because his accent is a bit hard to understand, but that wasn't a problem most of the time.The reviewer who wrote that the filming was random and shot with a camcorder must have some kind of axe to grind because the filming is excellent quality for a martial arts vidoes. I've seen some amaturishly filmed tapes and this isn't one of them. If you're into Muay Thai or looking for some supplemental full contact training, check out this tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I just started taking kickboxing (Muy Thai) and thought this would be a nice supplement to my in-person training, but I was disappointed to see that there was very little instruction, and lots of random shots. I was expecting an explanation of each move, and some sequences that you could follow, but this video was not made like that. Although the instructor is a true master of the art, the video people that made this are true amateurs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is Master K??????","review":"I have trained at a real Muay Thai camp and have to say that Master K is not exactly what I would call a household name in Thailand. In fact, he is pretty much unknown. That does not make him a bad teacher, though. What I was not impressed by was the athletic ability and the shape his students that he used to demonstrate the different techniques. Most of them were slow, sloppy, and looked incredibly amateurish. To me, that speaks volumes about the quality of the instructor. The video quality as well was very poor. It looked like someone took video from their Camcorder and then ran it through their VHS and voila! I would recommend going to a camp in Thailand or Fairtex here in the U.S. if you are really serious about Muay Thai."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable collection","review":"In these remarkable personal essays Lopez is son, brother, father, husband and friend; the human condition (and within it the \\"Latino condition\\") is inseparable from family and friends, for without them we have nothing. For Lopez, as one critic has pointed out, surfing is a powerful metaphor for staying alive and being true to yourself in a society where identities are so easily washed away. Lopez's quiet compassion, insight and honesty manage to make more meaningful thunder than many of the trendier, louder essayists writing about the American scene today; and anyone who likes the work of Mary Helen Ponce, Ilan Stavans and Richard Rodriguez (or for that matter Joan Didion and Truman Capote) should try this book, and, if they like it, to make the effort to track down Lopez's fiction, which has appeared in these excellent Latino short story anthologies: MIRRORS BENEATH THE EARTH, PIECES OF THE HEART, IGUANA DREAMS, MUY MACHO and CURRENTS FROM THE DANCING RIVE!

I was so impressed with Tony Beckley's performance in When a Stranger Calls that I decided to seek out his earlier roles. I stumbled across this British horror fim, and watched it a few times after that. It was so bad... it had me laughing out loud. I repeat, this was a long time ago... so my mind may be playing tricks on me. It concerned the story of a young man (Tony Beckley) and his overtly religious, massively psychotic, domineering mother. It explores how his longing to do good? drives him to kill young women so that he can \\"save\\" them. The corny music and funky clothes only add to the hilarity! Patrick Magee (of A Clockwork Orange fame) is once again over the top... & too cool for words as a mad priest. I only hope that I described this flick correctly.

The photography was beautiful, though with such an exciting and groundbreaking adventure, I found the accompanying narration and facts sadly lacking in detail. Just as an interesting section would begin, like in Sudan, the narration and film skimmed on and provided nothing of value. Had I realized how cut up the film was, I would not have bought it. It's only 47 minutes long and much of it is spent covering the characters instead of the Nile. I wouldn't buy again or recommend it to others unless they wanted to see the scenery.

Vol. 1, though, is not worth the price (2 stars).I personally think they should have taken the best songs from both and crammed a full 70+ minutes onto one disc.

The games are very well edited and the crispness and clarity of the recordings is excellent. The only drawbacks are, as mentioned by other commenters, that there are no extras and they are broadcast with the TV commentators instead of the local guys. Personally, I would have preferred the local announcers since I am not a big fan of Madden or some of the comments he made in the Superbowl (like saying Harrison should have been ejected- and this coming from a guy who used to coach the dirtiest team in the league, whose players would do things like clothes-line Lynn Swann in between plays [I wonder how often he called for his own players to be \\"thrown out\\" back then?]- end of rant).All and all, I think the DVD sets are great and would recommend them to anyone who wants to be able to re-live these historic games again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu-ray may be only way to get wide screen version","review":"I just looked at the zoomed in back cover of the regular 4 disc standard dvd edition and it will be full screen versions of the four games just like the road to Super Bowl XL from a few years ago. They do not yet have the back cover of the blu-ray posted so hopefully this version will be the wide screen version for those like myself with wide screen TV's. Also the back cover for the regular standard dvd states that the total run time is 448 min and not 240 min. I am assuming that the Blu-ray will be closer to the 448 min mark than 240 min.Some other notes to consider. The newly posted front covers show that the Blu-ray will just be 2 discs with two games on each one since Blu-Rays can hold more information. The standard edition will be 4 discs with one game on each disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"a reallly good easy guide to follow.","review":"this guide might be one of the easy's to follow your steps.it also helped me out alot on the 108th stars of destiny you will know were to find them and how to get them.this guide is also one of the rares't guides you will find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive guide for a great game!","review":"This is a totally awesome guide book to one of my favorite games for the Playstation.

There were the annoying clicks and pain when I bended my finger and my palm was sore, too. I tried glucosamine because my doctor and other patients told me it helped them. It took about 6 years for my trigger finger to go away, but the wait was worth it. It also helps with other joint pain, along with Tylenol.

I debated returning it before I unwrapped it, but I'm a fan, so I figured, what the heck. How bad could a saber fighting game be? Well, after beating it in a couple hours, I have to sum it up like this... Episode III is a shameless self-promoter of the movie and little else. The game play is horribly linear (left to right) to be exact like an old NES game would have been. Definitely NOT a free-roaming environment like the Battlefront series. The graphics are OK, and the saber fighting is smooth and elegant at first, but is quickly loses it's interest after a few times playing it. The game is full of trailers for the movie which is a pain in the butt because you can't skip by them the first time through..I hate that. Anyway, long story short, it has no replayability. Once, you beat it, you pretty much have had enough. It sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointing Star Wars game","review":"Star Wars Battlefront now has a contender for mindless and boring Star Wars title.

There are lots of combos and moves that you probably won't memorize. When you get to fight as Anakin aka Lord/Darth Vader. Graphics are solid, framerate on par. Overall, this is a game you should buy first-off. I now know wht it's a \\"Greatest Hits\\" game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars is Great","review":"This game is great with only a few drawbacks. The professional reviews for the game were not great but I love this game. It makes you feel like you are really a Jedi and you can feel your power grow. The duels with characters like Count Duccu are the best as again it gets away from smashing up droids and you are in a rivetting battle. The variation of moves and powers, including using the force and throwing the light saber, add alot of diversity of combat and realism to the game. This is the game I have been waiting for, even though they could tweek it a little here and there, mostly by making it a little harder or longer as I completed it in 2 days and I am no hardcore gamer at all!!!!! But it felt great to finish the game but I just kept craving more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I don't particularly like the characters in the film but that is not the games fault!!!!!!!!!!

And, of course, this one is no exception.Lets begin with the fact that this game is HORRIBLE. Its a button mashers dream, so it does not take any skill to complete. Its repeditive triangle, square, R1, triangle, circle, and any other button that does anything. This is one of those games that the only way to do anything cool or entertaining is to memorize a long list of special moves.Fighting jedis in this game was a nightmare. It was simple and boring. To begin with, took about fifty hits to kill the other jedi. Hmmmm. And, on top of that, you could basically hold down the block button and not get hit, unless the other jedi did a SPECIAL move (oooooo) and knocked you down.Revenge of the Sith is a linear and one deminsional game. NOT FUN. STAY AWAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"My overall impression","review":"Before you look at my review and gasp. Read.I give the graphics 10/10I give the gameplay 10/10I give the moves 10/10Length 4/10 (this game only has 16 levels. I beat this game in one day)Overall, I give the game out of a 100 scale about 87/100.If you are an action/adventure fan and/or a star wars fan, then get this game. If you are just buying this game because it looks cool then I suggest you stay away. If only the game was longer. Other than that there is nothing you can really be mad at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revenge Of The Sith PS2 game","review":"I really think that Lucas Arts did a great job on this game. All the characters have different ability's. The extra things on this game are amazing like the duels you can play. For the duels you can choose different characters like Obi Wan, Anakin, Darth Vader, Mace Windu and Ben Kenobi, General Grievious and Count Dooku. This is a very good game! The only thing that disappointed me was that they didn't have the Yoda Vs Sidious fight. Plus you can't choose Yoda as a duelist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I love star wars and I played this game all the time! Learning all the combos was difficult, but after continual practice you will get the hang of it. Graphics are acceptable for a PlayStation 2 game and I was really satisfied with the story line. The only minus would be on certain levels you have to play as Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan with his sorsesu blade format is weak! I only enjoy playing with Anakin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"Bought it when it came out, played through it in about 6 hours, have never put it back in my machine. Translation: RENTAL. :)Even though it was near the end of the line for the PS2, its graphics fell waaaaayyyy short of other competition like God of War. They seemed to mostly phone this one in, like many movie tie-ins. I'd basically describe it as a less-fun Double Dragon with lightsabers and a broken \\"versus\\" mode.The greatest compliment I can honestly give it is that it was entertaining to watch non-gamers whack each other with lightsabers in the versus mode at a recent party. It's so badly done, the playing field is pretty even--your best gaming research and effort will still leave you dead-even with a zombie pressing buttons beside you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, rushed movie tie-in garbage!","review":"I am very sorry that I spent any money at all on this game.

One of the lamest games I have planned in years! Avoid at all cost!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Game!!","review":"this has some really great graphics and stuff. the sweet thing is that you have bonus levels so that u can be yoda,dark vader ect.

This game may be rated \\"T\\" but is has no blood, when you kill a droid it just falls apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun but short","review":"The game was lots of fun to play the first time through, but after you beat it theres not much to do. The multi-player mode is fun for a while but becomes boring when theres no one else to unlock. In story missions you can only be obi-wan or anakin thats one thing that stinks. Lots of fun the first time but after that your out of fun. Rent it not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars: A New Hype","review":"this game is basically all hype. everyone has been dying for a game with lightsaber action and we finally get one, the problem is that this game is mindless and short. my 10 year old brother beat it in 1 day. not to say it's a bad game, where it shines, it shines. the lightsaber play is awesome, the force abilities are awesome, but c'mon, the game is so short and is so simple. i guess that reenacts the movie well where you can rarely die. the problem there lies with not being enough of a challenge. i think lego star wars proved more difficult than this. it's a great game to rent, but it is not worth the 50-60 dollars that you would shell out for a purchase. i'd buy this game if it was a greatest hits, not right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"More missions","review":"Recently purchased this game, a lot of Jedi action in single player mode. Graphics are good, scenes from the movie are great. Learning curve is relatively easy,some bosses pose a challenge. Overall if you are a Star Wars fan, you should enjoy this game. It could have more missions though. I'm still having fun!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What I think about this game.","review":"This game is a pretty good one. You get to play levels not shown in the movie, like Anakin in the Jedi Temple, and levels completely made up, like Anakin vs Mace Windu. The game gets more worn out the more times you beat it. What my favorite purpose for this game is to duel my friends but I always win. Multiplayer duel mode is great but you can't be Yoda or the Emperor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Time","review":"Personally I don't like to say anything bad about anything, but this is an exception.In the year of 2005, I remember reading a magazine and saw the preview of this game and thought good graphics, copying Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King game, but thought worth getting.I got this game and I completed this game in two days and I was horribly disappointed. The single player mode was easy except for two levels and the multiplayer could have been good if they had made it like The Lord Of The Rings game for Co-Op mode and Vs mode was good, but you can get bored.So I recommend not getting this game.Jake Potts"},{"rating":"2","title":"a gamers addiction","review":"this is one of the best games i have ever played. the graphics are amazing and it is so cool being able to follow along in the footsteps of anakin as he changes to the dark side.

The film has a solid story, good actors (hey, there's Yul Brynner and Max Von Sydow working it as hard as they can). The director, Robert Clouse, creates an authentic nuclear winter look and employs his skills as an action / actor's director to give gravitas to a Twilight Zone type story. It needs to be out there and in widescreen because some of these \\"B movies\\" offer something new films don't - personality and originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post Apocalypse Worlds","review":"An interesting film from the 1970's, part of a string of movies -- such as SOYLENT GREEN, THE OMEGA MAN, DAMNATION ALLEY, A BOY AND HIS DOG,etc. --which deal with civilization after some violent cataclysm. Yul Brynner was no spring chicken when he did this role but performs well. Max Von Sydow as the Baron (originally it was to been called THE BARONEY) delivers as a man struggling to keep the people in his charge from being overcome by the violent forces outside his compound and from extinction. Then there is Big Bill Smith. Has anyone ever played better-- and more -- crazed over the edge psychos than this son of a gun? I think not. In an interview he said that in his death scene, while rats ran over him, one actually crapped in his mouth. Now that's taking one for the team!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Postmodernist deception","review":"Unbelievable. I am dismayed that this work is taken seriously. If you think that the idea of reason and rationality is constructed as a tool for political purposes you are frankly insane. Reason stands above any side's political purposes. This book itself is a failed attempt at reason. This book's value is as a humorous testament to what extreme lengths people can take fundamentally absurd ideas and how people can believe it is profound. This book sets out to argue against reason? Did the other reviewers miss this astounding contradiction?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read","review":"Yes, it was *that* bad. In a confusing, opinionated and poorly substantiated argument, Saul's comments/theories have holes so big you could drive a truck through them. Over hundreds of years of history he draws upon a very select group of examples to make his point. That point being something about rational thinking bringing modern society undone. I think Mr Saul should read a book called 'How We Know What Isn't So - the fallibility of human reason in everyday life'. Saul has obviously come up with an idea and then trauled through the history of man looking for examples to back up that idea. I'm sure that i could find examples of absolutely anything I wanted to given a big enough population and time scale to draw my data from. Saul's book is as erroneous as it is tedious to read. Definitely don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saul's grasping to understand and learning to write.","review":"Very interesting thoughts that he beats to death. I doubt Saul has any real experience in business or keeping talent in a business and the cost structure involved - though he claims to have \\"worked as a Canadian oil executive\\". Most of this is over simplified, one-sided, unsubstantiated, blue-sky thinking. What Saul said in 600 pages could be stated in 25 with a good editor. His writing is so poor it renders the book worthless. This guy needs a basic writing class."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very questionable book","review":"It is terrible. The writer goes on and on about how bad reason is in today's society. In an attempt to prove this he uses very questionable historical facts. While reading it I found myself many times thinking these arguements are not true at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad","review":"The first impression of the book was positive, but it started to become increasingly complex and confusing. I though about having misunderstood something, but many others share my opinion, this book is poorly written crap, and going through all 600 pages is waste of precious time. Authors ignorance is revealed when he speaks about any economics topic. For instance, mergers are presumably inflationary. Gee, you may believe it or not, but no wonder the author is EX-banker. Off the mainstream, front porch philosophy is clearly a stronger of his skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploding Millennium Myopia","review":"For the past four weeks John Ralston Saul's book \\"Voltaire's Bastards\\" has been my almost constant companion. When not actually reading, or re-reading, this brilliant dissection of the myths, cant and hypocrisy which underlie present Western society, the carefully presented and scrupulously researched exposes refuse to leave my mind. In the last paragraph of the penultimate Chapter, Saul calls on writers to concentrate on questioning and clarifying while avoiding the specialists' obsession with solutions; he continues... \\"he is true to himself and to the people when his clarity causes disquiet.\\" This seems this Author's intent and \\"he\\" has brilliantly succeeded. READ IT.......I DARE YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good critical ideas, but too long","review":"This is not the best book I ever read, but it is an intelligent one, with good ideas and excellent arguments against some naive optimistic positions about our modern world. Well-explained and clear, the book gives you a big deal of information. Unfortunately, sometimes you can get lost in the thousand of examples presented in the book. I would like a little more of organization. Moreover, I think it is too long (there are a lot of repetition of ideas and examples).Briefly, Saul's book gives you some powerful ideas that you can use in your reflections, but it is not a comprehensive explanation of the modern world, even if Saul looks for that.Because I believe in the diversity of the ideas, I am reading a Hayek's book now. Quite different, but both interesting authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of sheer genius.","review":"Afetr spending my graduate school years studying the power of Western bureaucratic powers I was delighted to discover this book. John Ralston Saul pulls at the very fabric of reason and stretches it in the light for us to plainly see. Sadly the inadequacies of this much appealed to ideology are exposed as sadly wanting.This book and the gigantic mind responsible for it leave indelible impressions on the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest, competent.","review":"This is without doubt one of the most important books of its type ever written. Saul is a writer of great ability. This book led me to read all of his other books that I could find. If you have not read this book, you have not yet arrived in the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy","review":"Naess knows what it takes to get on the radio, and these songs are just about as catchy as any in Pop. Hook after hook grabs you, especially in the first half of the album, and the hit title song is a genuine jewel. There is a strange combination of innocence and mature insouciance in her voice which propel the songs. After a while you may get fed up with the thin drum sounds and Naess's occasional problems with phrasing (fitting her syllables to the music), but I doubt you will find any catchier songs this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Even Better","review":"Leona's last album was a noteworthy debut, and this latest one takes it up a notch. Definitely much more complex and stronger songwriting than her last. If you're into college or indie rock mixed in with everything from Sheryl Crow to '80s punk, then this is the album for you. \\"Blue Eyed Baby\\" is just a fun, all-out rock song with a little punk edge. \\"Shining Star\\" almost pulls off sounding like a late '80s Depeche Mode song. If you want something different and adventurous, then try out this album. If you want the same old dopey Top 40 music, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pop Music","review":"At my old work I just happen to come across Leona Naess, and out of pure interest I just popped this CD in and I'm so glad I found her.

It makes great collection on MMA books.Why not all 5 stars: because I wanted to see more takedowns in it, specialy from Greco Roman side of wrestling.

He approaches the fighting science with good insight.However, Of all the books I have of he's this is the least useful to me. Mainly because most of the take downs are leg attacks;for which I am not a big fan of. Dont get me wrong I will go for the leg if it presents itself, but I like takedowns from the clinch. Mark does cover takedowns from the clinch just think he should have spent more time on it.In any case this has expanded my leg take down arsenal so I can't complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"British porn","review":"This is the typical newstand porn available in Great Britian.

Mr. Oakley covers the evolution of the reports conclusion calling for \\"appropriate remedial action\\" to todays fanatics that find tobacco causes every disease known to Mankind. This comprehensive tome is a must read for anyone with a desire to know how incremental propaganda can convince an entire society that 25% of the citizens are hopeless addicts. The optimistic conclusion of the Author is shared by me, there is no way this radical junkscience can sustain itself, because it is built on a pack of lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author proves that defending smoking is impossible","review":"Author may fool some gullible readers or those who desparately want to fool themselves. In the section that discusses smokers' deaths from lung cancer, Oakley says the risk isn't too bad because the death rate from lung cancer is only 0.16%. What he neglects to state is that this is the yearly death rate. The risk for a lifetime of smoking is much higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisted analyses by a non-scientist","review":"It is quite evident that the author apparently has no education or training in the medical sciences nor in epidemiology.

This book is pure rubbish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on fiction, short on facts","review":"I wouldn't be surprised if the tobacco industry commissioned this work. It wouldn't be the first time. In fact, some (most)of the reports cited that exonerate smoking, even the \\"scientific\\" ones, were produced with the generous funding and blessing of the industry. The public is unaware of these numerous unpublished reports, saying smoking is not harmful, simply because these claims will not hold water.Keeping the controversy alive is one of the industry's schemes to create and maintain doubt in people's minds regarding the obvious ill health effects of smoking.

This maybe a good intro book for the layman. It will be very entertaining for the non-scientists. But if you know something about chemistry, this book will disapoint you. There is incomplete or bad information. It seems the author doesnt know some chemistry basics. His explanation of what sulfuric acid is, is ridiculous, not to mention wrong. This just an example. I find this to be the most basic and i wouldnt trust the author with anything more serious that he mentions in his book. Im not a professional writer and i dont need to be to see all the spelling mistakes. This shows lack of professionalism. No one should follow any of these procedures.Summary: good entertainment for the layman.

This is powerful knoledge that can save your life (or get you killed)! Be sure to read all of it before begining any mixing of chemicals. He gives must know safety information with each chemical or project.Now the bad news: After reading this book, TV and movies will never be the same!

He was interested in improvised munitions for a game he was working on. After some research and reading the other reviews, I settled on this book.It's a good one. It gets really technical in spots, and the author really wants to share his political and social viewpoints which I'm not crazy about, but the information seems very solid for what we are doing with it.

Pat did not want that too so he goes over. The remix is damn good too, we need more of those song in clubs.Across the sky (original) is a delicate beauty.

If I were Yuki, I would have dumped his space ace butt a while before this film takes place. His mind doesn't seem to be in one place for any of it, which is good in a sense as it enables him to connect Teresa's message with the Comet Empire. He can command a cargo ship but forgets he's getting married in three days? He conveniently forgets that, uh, Yuki is a member of Yamato's crew as well? I won't spoil the ending, but I will say it's a little over the top as far as melodrama goes. Kodai aside, this film showcases how the characters have matured since the first film. Naturally, the animation is top notch, especially those launch sequences at which Matsumoto excelled.

Mostly constructed of plastic, which makes easily breakable and not something you can throw around in the shop. Same problems with the rubber strap and it's catch hook. The slots on the strap are 90 degrees off ( | vs. - ) so they do not line up with the catch hook. You have to stretch the rubber strap to force it on the catch hook. Which leads me to the next problem... the strap broke. Any amount of stretching and it will eventually crack and break. A little manufacturing Q.A. testing would have caught this. Another issue with the strap is it is too thick to go under the exposed brake cable under my bike's top tube. Therefore, you have to wrap them around your brake cable. So you're not able to replace, adjust, etc. my rear brake with it installed. If you have the Topeak Handlebar Stabilizer, try replacing the rubber strap with a Velcro strap.

I was not happy. I added a few of the copper tiles down the center seam to make the differences seem intentional but I wish that was not necessary. I think for small projects, if you get the right roll, all will be well. I added 2 rows of those copper tiles above the stove and sink and the overall look of the kitchen is much brighter with an art-deco feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"inexpensive fix for old canisters","review":"I purchased the brushed copper contact paper to cover some old Tupperware canisters so they'd go better with my new kitchen cabinets and drawer pulls.

Sure, any person with common sense understands that pedophilia is dead wrong, but it doesn't automatically follow that all of the assertions in her book are then true. She rails against Clinton's sexual indiscretion while extolling Bush's virtue, while he lied to us to get us into a war, has approved of torture, works steadily to dismantle all environmental protections and has been at the head of the most corrupt administration in our nation's history.Hypocricy is also a form of deviance if one believes the truth to be a norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personal prejudices dressed up as trendy boogey-men","review":"A collection of the author's personal prejudices dressed up as trendy boogey-men.

This product is bloated, takes a while to load even on a 32-bit system and crashes a lot (especially when you try to get to the calendar). It contains a messaging system -- a sort of message board that can be used adequately for an intranet, and of course, scheduler for appointments and meetings (which typically remind you of a meeting several days after it is over). As for as a regular mail client to use for Internet mail links and general use, it is just too big and too slow. The server is more powerful than that of other mail servers usually, but it seems a slick marketing tactic to require you to use a Novell server as well to take full advantages of its capabilities. Eudora, Outlook Express, Pine, Elm are all free and work just as well with any server. Pretty, but really a colossal waste of money.

It is sturdy & reliably fun every time. The kids collectively love this one! We highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful sprinkler","review":"After purchasing at a local store, my 2 year old son was so excited to try the sprinkler. He was so disappointed. The tubes did not wiggle. The spinning part in the middle does nothing like what is happening in the picture.The major problem is that it leaks a large amount of water from the area closer to the sprinkler from the connector. The gasket seals well and that is not the problem. It is the back of the connector."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"My husband I bought this sprinkler for our kids that range in age from 13 to 4. The picture on the box made it look super fun and after having bought a sprinkler that just didn't work right, we were on the hunt for a new one. What a disappointment. The tentacles just stay stationary and do not wave around no matter how high or low the water pressure. The only movement of water was from the center part spinning. Needless to say, I don't think we will be buying any more sprinklers. I'm tired of spending $15 only to get them home to find they don't work as promised. Boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This product is complete JUNK. The water does not squirt around as described. The hoses lay flat to the ground and the middle of the sprinkler squirts a tiny trickle of water about 2 feet in the air. So, if you're only looking to get your ankles wet this is the product for you. My kids were very excited when we got this, but that changed quickly once we tried to use it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"2012 Biggest Waste of Time and Money","review":"After fiddling around with this piece of plastic for over an hour I'm bringing it back. Various lengths of hoses, different hose attachments it doesn't matter. The cheap plastic hose connection doesn't fit tightly to your hose so it's impossible to keep the water from leaking and to build enough water pressure to make it work. The manufacturer should be ashamed of themselves for putting this product on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"My daughter and her cousins (ages 2-5) played with this at a family reunion. It was great at keeping them entertained on a hot day.You can adjust the craziness of the tubes spray water by adjusting the water pressure of the garden hose. When the younger ones were in it, or if they were shy and needed to get used to it, I just turned the water knob down a bit, and the sprinkler calmed down, too. I think the kids had just as much fun being able to control it as they did running through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely sprays water","review":"This barely sprays water, most of the side tubes point at the ground. Also, the spinning ball in the center sometimes doesn't spin, so the water just leaks out of the bottom. I'm really disappointed in this, wouldn't recommend it. Keep looking for another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 20 minutes of play","review":"Made in China like everything else these days :o( After only 20 minutes of use, the orange plastic piece that connects to the hose broke right off of the sprinkler when we attempted to move it.

Like many of the other disappointed parents here, this sprinkler far from delivers on its promise. Even with the pressure on full blast, the arms don't move and the overall water dispersal is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a dud","review":"Like other posters have already noted, this was good for about 10 seconds until the wiggling arms stopped wiggling. Additionally, water seemed to just gush out of the bottom of it. We tried varying the water pressure but to no avail. My son had more fun running through the hose as I stood and sprayed him. Waste of money...."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"Product is only $12.99 at Target. I bought this for my water obsessed dog.

The only problem is that one of the sguigly legs does not work and sprays straight up instead of spraying all over like the others. Not sure why this is. Still trying to figure it out. I am finding with all new toys, they are being made cheaper and cheaper, do not last, or not working as they should and who has time to ship things back? Bummer for the amount of money spent on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arms didn't work","review":"Arms didn't work, so it just sprayed water through the little tubes, making 6 little sprinkle arms that didn't move. Defective and cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I actually bought this at Shopko. The little tubes that are supposed to shoot water do not shoot water the way it's supposed to. It just shoots it straight out. There is no wiggling whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"If 1 foot of water is what you want, this \\"geyser\\" is for you!","review":"Just purchased this item and it was a total bust. The water didn't even get about 8-10 inches. We ended up turning on our yard sprinklers and letting the kids run through that. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I bought this for my kids for hot spring and fall days. The short of it is - it doesn't work at all. Our water pressure is excellent and our regular lawn sprinkler shoots water 12 feet in the air. This thing shot about 12 inches above the ground, and that is being generous. The tubes don't even spray. The water just pours out of the bottom of the unit, what a terrible design! Don't waste your money! I am going back to the good old lawn sprinkler, the kids get the same affect and at least the the whole yard is getting watered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the picture","review":"What a disappointment! The tubes got stuck in a rigid position and either shot in one direction or into the ground. The middle \\"geyser\\" barely went a foot off the ground. My 2 and 1 year olds were bored with it, except for all the water it poured out the bottom to make puddles to jump in. Sending this dud back."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"This toy is garbage...period!If you look at the image that is on the package you can easily see it was edited, the color of the grass along the house is a different color and it looks like the kids were added after because they do not look wet. Also...take a look at some of the little tubes that let the water out, there is one that looks like it has two heads.I wonder if they used a very long shutter speed on the camera to make it look like this toy is actually fun.Like the other person said...the only thing it is good for is to water the lawn.I contacted the company and they were no help...so I filed a complaint with the BBB.Avoid this toy and anything else this company makes."},{"rating":"1","title":"SW Express Geyser Blast Sprinkler","review":"This toy serves a better purpose as a sprinkler for watering the lawn. The recommended age group would be better at 3-5 yrs and even then that might be a little old. The picture for the toy does not do it justice. It makes it seem like the toy will be a lot of fun when in reality it is quite boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!","review":"Instead of wasting money on a well-known cartoon character sprinkler, I decided to purchase this sprinkler based on other cusotmers' reviews....and I'm glad I did! This sprinkler is awesome! It really does spray a lot of water in every direction. My 3 stepkids (ages 4, 5 and 8) hate going outside on hot days, but this kept them entertained outside for over an hour each day we used it (before purchasing this item, they didn't want to stay outside for more than 5 minutes)!(And it really does water the lawn well too...in fact I had to have the kids move it around because some areas were getting watered too well!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential, if it worked right","review":"This sprinkler had great potential and worked great right when the water first comes on (for 5 seconds) and then the arms get stiff and stop whirling about. The arms are what my kids were most excited about, so it was quite a disappointment. We moved the sprinkler to different areas, different hose hook-ups and do not believe it is a problem with too much or not enough water pressure. Because the arms are made of a very thin rubber/plastic, we suspect that the problem MAY be that our water is too cold and the tubes are becoming rigid from the very cold water. Nonetheless, this sprinkler was a disappointment as the water did not spray all that far and the tubes pointed straight out to the side or down towards the ground. A regular oscillating lawn sprinkler (from lawn and garden section) would be more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"The design alone is enough to almost guarantee the product won't do anything but spurt a little water from some of the tubes, with a LOT of water leaving through the openings on the bottom and the area where the ball at the top is SUPPOSED to form a seal when the water is on. I've returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty and disappointing","review":"From reading the previous reviews I am guessing there is a quality control issue here, it seems like the customers that have one that actually works love it. I was not expecting it to be as magnificent as the picture (they never are) but when we turned ours on it only sprayed about 6 inches high. We picked it up, and sure enough ALL of the water pours right out the bottom holes. There must be a seal on the inside that is missing. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful sprinkler, did not work at all.","review":"My boys thought it looked like so much fun. We pulled it out of the package, hooked it up to the hose and it worked correctly for about 10 seconds. The center stream that is supposed to spin around only spins if you hold the sprinkler on it's side. And the little arms that are supposed to wiggle around, the water just shoots strait up in the air and does not wiggle at all. We tried different water pressure settings, we tried every thing we could think off. We even took the back off to see if something was broken. But discovered that it only works properly if held up in the air on it's side, or for the first 10 seconds after you turn the hose on. Do not buy this sprinkler. I will be returning ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We had pretty much the same experience as the other 1 star reviewers. We do get a bit of a spiral out of the central ball, but the arms do not wiggle and we lose way more water out the bottom than what is sprayed by the arms. We'll keep it, and it will probably get some use this summer, but I would not recommend this toy to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy it.","review":"I should have read the negative reviews more carefully before buying this sprinkler. It simply does not work. Most of the water leaks from underneath the toy and the plastic tubes hardly move at all. It was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful sprinkler","review":"Hooked it up on fourth of july, what a disappointment! Water poured out of the bottom and very little water came out of the ball or tubes. My kids were so upset.

This toy vastly improved the play life of my young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geyser not such a blast sprinkler","review":"I bought this for my kids, ages 12 and 10.

This is more for younger kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"For the first two minutes the noodles wiggle then they just stand up straight and do nothing but waste water.

Scares those too young !","review":"Later on when my son is older, he will have a blast with this. But for now, it's sitting in a corner collecting dust. My son is almost 17 months old and this scares him too much. He stands a good 20 ft. away and just stares. Way too agressive. This coming from a boy that LOVES to play with water all the time. Just not this type of water delivery system.

There were at least 20 kids total ranging from 3 to 7 years. Not one of them was interested in playing around this.It does have an interesting pattern of sprinkling, but if the kid is standing in one spot the water only comes there may be 10% of the time (the exact number of course might be wrong, but you get the point).None of the kids (including my own) spent more than 30 seconds and they were done. Good thing I had a couple of inflatable pools and other things to entertain the kids.Someone else mentioned it's good for watering the lawn as well - no way Jose !Totally not worth the [...] I spent on it. Will not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Crap","review":"This thing hardly worked to begin with and then after three weeks of use, it just stopped working completely. Total piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK. Not worth the price.","review":"The advertisement picture for this product does not represent what it actually looks like when I turned it on. The spiral of water in the middle does not actually look like a spiral and it only shoots up about 3 feet at the most. Their are 7 tubes on the sides that are supposed to slash around while shooting water. They actually just sat on the ground and just made a big puddle around the sprinkler. I ended up plugging 4 out of the 7 tubes up, so that only 3 tubes can release water, hoping it would help make the water come out stronger. It only helped a little. It is nothing like the picture and it is NOT that I do not have good water pressure from my hose. I actually have fairly good water pressure. I wish I had not paid so much money for it. My next door neighbor told me the other day that she just ordered the same exact sprinkler and she got it for $10 cheaper!!!!! That made me even more disappointed in my purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, complete trash","review":"This sprinkler looks simple enough in principle but actual item is complete junk. After attaching the hose to the sprinkler and slowly turning on the water - the plastic sprinkler attachment broke off the sprinkler (still attached to the hose). After taping the attachment back into the sprinkler with gorilla tape, 4 of the little hoses sprayed water about 6 feet while staying motionless, 2 stayed at rest on the ground (also motionless) and the center ball rotated and water shot into the air exactly 6 inches. 6 inches. Not even close to the illustrations. Varying the water pressure just meant less came out, no squiggling or wiggling of the little hoses at all.

The process of the creation of this book from the conceptual stage to the final product is indicative of its value to the study of leadership. Drs. Scott and Shoop demonstrated collaboration and teamwork in order to create this book. The book puts forth excellent examples that aid in the understanding of current leadership philosophy. Besides the obvious educational benefit, any sports fan would appreciate the inside information from the man that has orchestrated the greatest turnaround in college football history. In today's society that is so sports-oriented, the result is a wonderful book on leadership that is interesting and will be enjoyed by many for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tool to be used by persons in any walk of life","review":"I would recommend Leadership Lessons from Bill Snyder to anyone interested in leadership and developing their own leadership skills. As a recent college graduate, I found Coach Snyder's leadership philosophies insightful and inspiring. Though the book documents the evolution and success of Kansas State University's football team, led by Coach Bill Snyder, it is much more than a biography or a history of KSU football. Leadership Lessons from Bill Snyder provides concrete examples of Snyder's leadership strategies in an easy-to-read, almost conversational format. A person in any walk of life could easily draw parallels between endeavors with their own organization and Bill Snyder's proven leadership as he turned a bankrupt organization into a top-ranked national powerhouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is over hyped","review":"This book was a lot more complicated than you would expect for a football book.

It uses the Aramaic roots of Jesus' sayings and in doing so leads to a spiritual depth of meaning that the Greek and English translations of his statements are not able to give.The translations from the Aramaic are then used to develop meditations that give the user an opportunity to explore the words and their depth in a mediated and gradual process.Douglas-Klotz has obviously developed a wealth of scholarship in this area and made it available in this small and accessible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concern with regard to translation","review":"The words are indeed deep and thought provoking. I am having a problem with the translation from Aramaic ultimately, to modern English.

His command of voice and atmosphere paints gothic pictures of Roderick Usher's doomed House or the living and dead occupants of Barwyke Hall (a little known work by J. Sheridan Le Fenu entitled \\"Dickon the Devil\\"). This audiobook must be listened to in the dark. It may be useful in literature or performance classes as well, for the authors of the literature (Ambrose Bierce, Robert Louis Stevenson, Washington Irving and others)are without doubt some of the best and never lose their seductive darkness; and Davies' rich, passioned vocal work serves as an excellent guide for students to study. For more \\"mundane\\" purposes, the stories are brisk, chilly, and altogether creepy. Those of you who already own audio copies of \\"Usher\\" and similar works ought to check this out just for comparisons' sake; Davies does an excellent job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"I probably liked this remix album more than the original it was made from. There are three tracks on it that I just adore and would reccomend it to any Ruby fan that mostly listens to music somewhat unlike the Salt Peter album.

If all you listen to is goth-industrial you might still like this, but probably not nearly as much as Salt Peter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different way to look at Charm City.","review":"If you want to scratch below the well presented surface of Baltimore (Harbor Place, Camden Yards, Ravens Stadium, and the gentrified Fells Point and Canton), take a look at this book. Some of the socially and historically more important neighborhoods of Baltimore are given themed walking tours. Accompanying each tour is a historical and social narrative explaining why this particular corner of Baltimore mattered so much in the history and society of the city. It's a great way to find out new things about neighborhoods that have seen their ethnic charm and style replaced by affluent banality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it from the library, but don't buy it","review":"The most useful part of this book is the author's anecdotes based on her experience an a medical sign language interpreter. She offers very valuable insights for medical professionals caring for deaf patients. However, the book also tries to be an introduction to signing for professionals wishing to carry on more basic exchanges in sign language. Here it fails, as the illustrations are not professionally done and are extremely hard to understand. There is no coherent educational theme, either -- it skips around from the most basic to the more advanced concepts without covering any thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frost avienta unas firmes rolas!","review":"These two albums are not Frost's most consistent--that was East Side Story, back in 1992. But they do have some of his strongest performances. Dope lyrics, chicano-style hip-hop production, and some songs in Spanish or partly in Spanish. KRS-ONE once said a great DJ can create a mood.

The internal housing is rather flimsy causing the lock/latch pin to pop out of place and the lock button's raised lettering isn't even painted white (as the picture would lead you to believe). 9 times out of 10 the clips that hold your original OEM lock and door latch rods in place have broken (as did mine), so if all else fails (on this cheap piece of Taiwanese junk) you can simply use the clips as a replacement in your original OEM door latch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be an \\"abridged\\" version","review":"This would have been a great biography except for one fatal flaw.

He is a horrible husband. He dies (Trustworthy's wife also dies). * Betsy and Trustworthy end up getting married (as they should have).

The sections which are age specific generally are of the form \\"If you were 20 you would train like this, since you are 50 you need to modify the training like this... (usually allow more recovery)\\". Thus the discussion becomes relevant for everyone.Some will probably find the specifics more detail than they are interested in.

He is happy enough with it the way it is, however defective and over-priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"Unfortunately I neglected to check the reviews of this Millenium Falcon before purchasing it for my son at Christmas. I judge this as one of the most poorly manufactured toys I've ever seen. The plastic is slightly thicker than a traditional model kit. The landing bay door has no hinge and pops off when it's touched as does the cockpit door. The gunnery chair is too small for any action figure and the landing legs give way with the slightess vibration. It looks and plays like a knock-off. I always instruct my son to take care of his toys but this Star Wars toy will not last the month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Piece of Junk","review":"This toy is cheaply made and was not well designed.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"This toy is not worth the money I payed.

I tried to contact Hasbro and complain about this toy but they were closed for Holiday break. I 'll call again after reading all of these reviews. I agree with everyone of them. I'm glad that I'm not the only one who feels this way. My son is so frustrated with this toy everytime he tries to play with it something falls off and I have to crazy glue it back on.(...). Hasbro should be ashamed of themselves for this poor quality and Lucas studios should remove them from being their toy manufacturer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the 1996 version","review":"I haven't had the Falcon in my collection since 2000 when I stop buying Star Wars. This year I have started to collect once again and the first vehicle I bought was the Falcon from Amazon, and I do have to say it is much better than the 1996 version especially the cockpit!! In the '96 version the cockpit was so bad that you really had to make an effort to fit a figure in it + you had to remove the whole cockpit to sit a figure inside. This version has all but done away with that and has made the cockpit more, \\"Kid Friendly\\". You don't really even need to bend the Figure all the way to fit in inside anymore.Apart from that this Falcon is pretty much the same as its 1996 predecessor. Although I do have to point that I'm an adult so I don't know how it fair up with kid consumers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this piece of junk!!!","review":"I sure wish I would've read the reviews before I bought this.

I think his ontology is rather silly, actually. But, we agree on other things. While I think Christian faith is more existential than what it is sometimes portrayed to be, I don't think that necessarily entails an existentialist ontology. Nevertheless, his treatment on anxiety and its relation to being & non-being are profound. Sometimes people that initially disagree on basic issues can end up agreeing about many other issues. Tillich is personally a case of that example. He had me going most of the way, in fact, right up until the end, about 15 pages out. Anyway, it's a theological classic.

When I called their customer support number (1-800-201-7575, which is hard to find on their website) for a second time to check up on the problem, they ran out of the item and couldn't sell me one for the $129.99 price they advertised. I have to \\"Check back once in a while to see if the product is back in stock\\". After arguing for a while on the phone, the only thing they could do for me was \\"lock the $129.99 price, IF the item comes back into stock\\". It's so sad that they can't even send me an email to buy a product from them IF it comes back into stock!!! As a business owner, I can't believe that a company like Amazon.com can't provide decent customer service or satisfaction!!! Awful, awful, awful!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a fabulous adaption!","review":"This is a wonderful presentation of the Chronicles of Narnia. The story held the attention of my entire family (small children, teens, and adults.) I especially liked the commentary by C.S. Lewis' step-son. It makes one feel that they are aquainted with the man as well as the work. I have shared my copy and everyone wants to get one of their own!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Version of The Chronicles EVER","review":"This series is by far the best adaptation of The Chronicles of Narnia, ever done. That includes the recent films. The actors that portray each character are spot-on in their interpretations - especially David Suchet, as Aslan. He has made his voice to sound like a LION, not a human, which is brilliant. He also nailed Aslan's character of being all-powerful, yet all-loving. My absolute favorite scene is in The Horse and His Boy, when Shasta is lost in the mountains, and Aslan comes to comfort him, revealing that He (Aslan) has been present in Shasta's life the whole time, without Shasta knowing it, and has orchestrated every event (even the painful ones!). The Christ-like message is so moving, I cannot hear it without weeping. I am confident you will enjoy every moment of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic audio rendition of the series","review":"My only complaint about the series is that it's abridged, which it clearly states. The characters were so well done that I just wanted more with them. Sometimes it was hard to keep the characters separate (without the usual, \\"peter said, etc\\" but it was still great."},{"rating":"1","title":"listen before you purchase","review":"I thought I was buying an unabrdged version which was the first disappointment. Also the sound is uneven so that I had to keep adjusting the volume. Sometimes the music nearly obscured the voices of the actors entirely. Most of the actors were excellent and pleasing to the ear. This was not the case with the voice of Aslan which I found to be ridiculous and at times downright creepy. Listen before u buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great production from Focus on the Family - Radio Theatre","review":"This is such a great series and to have it produced by Focus on the Family - Radio Theatre group, makes it even better. If you enjoy the Chronicles and have enjoyed any of the other Radio Theatre productions or Adventures in Odessey, you will love this set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son and I are enjoying the set","review":"So far my six year old son and I are enjoying the audio books very much. I will update my review at a later date if any problems arrives or if the quality of the acting and storying telling becomes less appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best!","review":"I bought this set for my five kids to listen to in the car while we are going places, I did not expect them to be so well done! We were all captivated, my husband and I included, we even stayed in the car after we were home just to keep listening to see what happened next. I would highly recommend this set, C.S. Lewis is an amazing writer he describes things in such a way that you really feel like you are there, and they stick very close to the original books in this radio drama. It is good for kids and adults alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"roooar","review":"Narnia - always a good read or listen in this case. I bought as a present and they loved it right away"},{"rating":"2","title":"Appropriate for ALL ages!","review":"Recently purchased this set on a whim, and so glad I did! I have laughed out loud, wept, and found spiritually deep concepts to mull over. Just like the books, fun and appropriate for ALL ages and makes and excellent conversation piece/teaching tool. Parents, spare yourself the Kidzbop, spend twenty bucks, and sigh in relief."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a fantastic experience","review":"The audio set is a great way for kids and the whole family to listen to the story of Narnia together. The full-cast drama features film quality sound and music. And it is true! It gave you an extraordinary listening experience that's not the same as either reading books or watching films, but equally exciting! And If you like the book series or one of the movies, I recommend this audio set to you and your family. And If you have kids don't like to read Narnia and spend all their time digging Harry Potter, It's not because Harry Potter is better written or anything, it's just better marketing. Try this audio-set to catch their attention and I promise your kids must fall in love with Narnia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"My grandchildren and I loved this wonderful dramatization. We were already big fans of the series and found these recordings added to our love of the tales.

We have six kids, and all ages were captivated by the stories. Excellent actors and dramatic effects (i.e., hearing a thundering herd of horses), and even more outstanding stories by CS Lewis. Literally, none of us wanted to make a pit stop, as we were all enthralled - \\"Keep driving, dad!

Each book is produced with great actors and sounds which bring you into the full Narnia experience. I was really proud of the work Focus on the Family put into these stories. Every dialog with Aslan is particularly expertly executed. They did a marvelous job at capturing and highlighting the themes C.S. Lewis wrote into each book. To make things more clear, this specific collection of the seven Narnia stories has a little less fancy packaging than the other collection offered by Amazon. I believe this is what makes the difference in pricing between the two, and even though it's not as nice, I still think this is the better deal because you get the same CD's for less of a hit on your wallet and still in a decent little box to keep your books in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Disappointed","review":"I loved this Jeep & my daughter did too when she opened it. But after a short time, everything starts coming apart. The windshield & roll bar foll off if you just tug on them. The glove compartment lid pops off all the time, and the seat belts are worthless! I know it's [cheap]...but it's a fairly useless toy. My daughter gets upset everytime the car falls apart--which is everytime she's playing with it! My daughter is gentle with her barbies & this car, so it's just not a durable toy. Spend the couple of extra bucks & get the VW Beetle car, mini-van, or Volvo Barbie Cars. They're much durable & won't frustrate your child!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick a Different Vehicle.","review":"This jeep isnt so hot! Cute at first glance, but the rollbar was the first to fall off....followed by just about everything else. Also want to mention it's hard to position the dolls in the car.

I'd save yourself the disappointment and choose another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful little spray","review":"I was very excited to get this for my 4-year-old son, and when it came he slept with it for 3 nights. When there was finally enough sun to go outside and get wet in the spray, we were very excited. I hooked it up to the hose and turned on the water. After we were sure that the water was going and all the kinks were out of the hose, we both just stood there and stared. It came out in drips and drabs only and the ears never made it up much less go around. The flowerpot did pop up enough to send out some spray, but it was only enough to go up to my son's ankles. Some may say that it could have been my water pressure, but I have my doubts since I have run lawn sprinklers just fine previously. Needless to say, this toy lost its appeal and is now sitting in the garage. I would not recommend this toy for any summer fun in the sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat frustrating","review":"I purchased this for my 3-year old daughter this past summer. Although she enjoyed running through the water, the main attraction for her was the spinning ears feature. Unfortunately, the ears seldom spin, and when they do, they usually will get stuck within a few minutes. I kept having to manually push them to get them started up again which was very frustrating for the both of us. Overall, I would not recommend this sprinkler unless your child does not mind the ears remaining stationary most of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the spin?","review":"Both of my kids received this as a birthday gift (different years)- took one back and sold the other in a garage sale.

They say he's got to go, go, go - Godzilla!","review":"This is one of the best Godzilla movies of all-time, in my opinion. It's got everything you could hope for in a Godzilla flick including a surprise visit from GINO (Godzilla In Name Only), which is the American version of Godzilla. It also has Kung-Fu Fighting aliens, Super-Powered Mutant Humans, Star Wars inspired space battles, Giant Monsters galore, and even a cute little baby Godzilla to tickle your funny bone and round things out. Any movie that packs all of that into one package is okay in my book. This movie is just one big zany, fun-filled, action-packed giant monster slug-fest that is perfect for a Saturday Night monster movie marathon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's No Fair, How Come I Don't Get To See It?","review":"I haven't seen this movie, but I really want to.

First off, Godzilla doesn't even show up until more than halfway through the movie. Not uncommon, but wait... The (ha, ha) plot is made up of would be X-Men fighting poorly done matrix-esque battles (including the motorcycle highway chase) and struggling against the aliens from the 80's TV series 'V'. The best thing about this movie is the dog. I felt a little of my soul had slipped away after I watched this heap. Spare yourself the hours of vomiting this disc will surely induce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen this Before","review":"1st im the biggest godzilla fan, ever since i was a kid. This movie was just bad. Horrible acting even for a godzilla movie. This movie is such a blatant rip off of the matrix and independence day. You actually feel like your flipping through the channels and watching a couple of different movies while your watching this one. Its such a shame that this is the last godzilla movie for the next 10 years they should have ended with giant monsters all out attack a way better movie. But of course being a godzilla fan you have to complete the set. But i have to admit this really tested my love for godzilla. i will admit it was good seeing all the monsters even though some you could tell they barely gave any thought about upgrading their look."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really bad.","review":"I love Godzilla. I've loved his movies for most of my life. I won't rehash what others have said. Just don't sit down to watch this movie with high expectations for the last ever Godzilla flick. You will be severely disappointed. Too much Matrix, not enough monster action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no!! This is Godzilla's 50th anniversary movie?","review":"What have they done??? I would of preferred Godzilla versing one ultimate monster or just by himself than watch this. I really wanted to like this movie but there is just so many things wrong with it I just couldn't. The battles are too short one minute if lucky some lasting only 15 seconds. The only battle worth watching is Godzilla vs. Monster X. I don't know why they put that Matrix crap in it that was just a complete waste it was soo boring and when could humans beat a giant monster (Ebriah) with a few guns? This is just a horrible movie to finish off Godzilla, if they concentrated more on the monsters than the already ridiculous plot it would of been much more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect...for a six year old","review":"I bought this as a birthday gift for my six year old son. He loves Godzilla so I thought I'd get this dvd for him as one of his gifts. I think the movie had a bit too much hand to hand Matrix-style crap which is OLD. Seeing all the different monsters got him excited while his mother was sound asleep from the lame script. LOL.This movie didn't feel like it had enough Godzilla and that Minilla monster was the silliest thing I ever seen. After THIS movie, please don't knock the American Godzilla as I think it was seriously underrated. All Monsters Attack Out was far better than this.My son normally says \\"Let's see it again!\\" after seeing something he likes but he didn't say anything about this movie except to copy the movie scenes with his toy monsters. I wonder if he'll write a better script too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad ending for the King of Monsters","review":"Purposively this is the last installment of the 50 year Godzilla series. Which is disappointing enough in itself, but this one fails to deliver a good ending. It seems as if the director thought it was more important to emulate Hong Kong action/fighting flicks than make a \\"Giant Monster\\" movie full of mass destruction and maybe even a have a point to it (as did the original '54 version, the Smog monster, and few others). Somebody should have taken a clue from the latest Gamera series: make a movie that works for both kids and adults that entertains, is exiting, and doesn't insult the audience. Some good scenes here and there, but over all it feels disjointed and uninspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic 50th Birthday Bash!!!","review":"I'm new to the Godzilla series, and I thought this was epicly awesome! There's aliens, action, fighting, shooting, martial arts, monsters and the King of Monsters himself; Godzilla! It's an absolute blast. An organization called the Earth Defense Force (EDF) is created to protect the planet. They freeze Godzilla, but must soon deal with an alien invasion. The aliens control Anguirus, Rodan, King Caesar, Kamacuras, Monster X and many more. Earth's final chance of survival is Godzilla. If you love monsters and mind-numbing action, you'll love GODZILLA: FINAL WARS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh How The Mighty Have Fallen","review":"What can I say About \\"Godzilla-Final Wars\\" except TOHO got royally screwed by the Director on this one.The final film in the series for awhile and they hire the Director of \\"Versus\\". The only good thing about the film is the Special Effects (as usual). The rest is ruined. TOHO wanted to make this their new \\"Destroy All Monsters\\" for the 50th Anniversary of \\"Godzilla\\" and instead got \\"Revenge of Godzilla\\" (Now the second worst film in the series). Save your money, skip on this one, unless you can get it for under $5.00 and you're a 'Godzilla' collector.

Then some evil aliens (are there any other kind?) unleash a horde of Toho monsters against the cities of the world. A grumpy but well thawed Godzilla proceeds to do battle against those funky names well known to all Godzilla fans: Ghidrah, Rodan, Gigan, Ebirah, Hedorah...For those who weren't fans of the American \\"Godzilla\\" movie a reasonable facsimile of that critter, dubbed \\"Zilla,\\" is thrown against our hero...with very pleasing results to say the least.As Godzilla movies go this is near the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you like goofy ,you'll like this.","review":"So this is how they're going out. A spacemen vs human movie with a little REDICULOUS Zilla tossed in. At least it was original..... originally barrowed from many other movies. Come on... this is not very good. And someone comparing Ryuhei Kitamura to Quentin Tarantino. Sounds good, but I want QT directing Kill Bill not King Kong. I've seen Ryuhei Kitamura's other flicks and they were pretty good, but he got way to goofy on this. I get what he was going for, but there's a reason the 70's Godzilla flicks are on MST 3000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla meets the Matrix meets the Power Rangers","review":"This is definitely the worst Godzilla movie in the last 25 years.

LAME... and if it was the final war was he not supposed to die ? I had to stop the movie a few times cause i was so bored.. and finally saw the rest of it in double time... needless to say it disapointed me.. i am a BIG fan of Godzilla i own all the DVDs out there .. and sadly even this one.. i recommend you rent it first before you pop out $20 bucks for it ... my final words are... there are nothing like the originals.. as goofy as they were,.. they were and are GREAT..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla- Final Matrix/Star Wars","review":"How could Ryuhei Kitamura make a Godzilla movie so completely uninspired? This film reeks of Hollywood plagerism, assuming entire Matrix/Neo characters and scenes, albeit laughingly so. Amazingly, even Star Wars fans will recognize their favorite scenes incorporated into this mish mash of previously done Sci Fi adventures.All of this could even have been overlooked, had only the monsters been inspired. Consider perhaps actual scenes of them more than just haphazardly spliced in, because, well, it was supposed to be a monster movie. I don't remember Godzilla even giving his signature roar until the movie's end. See G vs.Megaguirus for an example of an inspired monster movie. Less silly people and aliens, more of what fans want--monsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"STYLISH ACTION-PACKED ROLLER COASTER RIDE!

Anyway the plot is that aliens send a typhoon of giant monsters(all the above, except Godzilla, Mothra and Minya) to rampage Earth so the heroes awaken Godzilla who fights all the giant monsters(except Mothra and Minya) in several action packed battles. You should pre-order this movie now."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of worst Gozilla movies ever","review":"This has to be one of the worst Godzilla movies in the series. I am one of those old-school fans where the action was well paced. This movie is really an action movie and not a monster movie. They rip off the Matrix in several places with over-the-top stunts. The main villian is just goofy and cheesy with his fits when the monsters lose. The plot is horrible, the acting is the cheesiest I have ever seen, godzilla doesn't even really show up until the end. Then they just throw in every monster they could think of to finish off their stories. If you really like the power rangers then you will like this film.

After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant to buy this. We have a few other Godzilla's, and alot of them had way too much talking. This one was perfect. It had alot of monsters, the fights didn't last long with these, but it was wonderful to see them all.The alien subplot was a little annoying, but there was enough action to keep it interesting. There were a few scenes with a bit more human blood than I would have liked to have the little one see, but it is PG13. It may have been too intense for a kid under eight. Basically, they shoot an alien, and he vomits a little blood and a little more goriness happens.I think there was alot more monster action than some of the reviewers say. I would have to say three quarters of the movie had some sort of monster in it.It got a thumbs up from the neighborhood kids that range from 8-16."},{"rating":"2","title":"its stupid.","review":"but in a mindless fun way. the whole movie is pretty much pointless and pretty much goes no where. some of the scenes in this movie are so ridiculous that its hilarious, like when the leader of the army raises his sword like hes gonna fight godzilla. keep in mind that he is a normal human and isnt even as big as godzillas toe. the fight scenes are all very flashy and unrealistic and the plot is almost nonexistent. but there in lies the magic of this movie. its plot may be stupid. but i guarantee u this movie is never boring. i a must watch for fans of movies that are pure fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla Final wars","review":"My son love the movie and has been a fan of Godzilla movies for a long time.

It really has no direction and cannot figure out what type of movie it wants to be. The soundtrack is a mess and has none of the character and class of any of the older Godzilla movies. The battle scenes are at times pathetic and not well thought out. Maybe those in the 13-20 age group will find this movie entertaining. Real monster movie fans will find it a poor effort.The Japanese have said Godzilla will be back in 2013, lets hope they learn to do better than Godzilla Final Wars by then..

Watch a clasic Godzilla film instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martial Arts, not Godzilla","review":"I own all Godzilla movies and luv 'em for their simple plots, monsters, uncomplicated human relationships, etc. But this one does not follow that format. This is more of a martial arts movie complete with sneers, fighting poses, and impossible flying acrobatics. And the women, despite all the battles, running, fighting....they always have immaculate shiny lipstick and great hair (the TV lady has great legs!) Godzilla et al seem to be thrown in there as a subplot. I watch my Godzilla movies over and over but this is one of my least favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Godzilla Film Ever","review":"OK. Maybe Godzilla's Revenge is worse, and quite possibly \\"Godzilla vs. Megalon\\" is as well. But overall, this is a very bad, bad Godzilla movie. I'm not just talking about a bad movie, but a bad GODZILLA movie, even once you lower your expectations for these kinds of films. The plot is ridiculous and way too much time is spent with the humans vs. aliens story line. In fact, Godzilla and company is mostly a sub plot. For the most part the battle scenes are brief and unrewarding, and no more then three monsters make an appearence in any one scene. No great multi-monster shots like in \\"Destroy all Monsters\\". I barely made it through this film. I would rather watch the American version of Godzilla again than this movie. A pathetic end to the big G's legacy. Don't buy this movie, rent it if you must see it. Of course you must see it if your a fan, but this review is no exaggeration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Lets make this quick and simple.

Not really a kids movie though, 11+ years and up I suggest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Godzilla movie ever","review":"This hyper-active, pointless, shallow, contrived excuse for a Godzilla movie makes the American Godzilla look insightful and meaningful. I don't even know where to start describing what is wrong with Final Wars. The abysmal occidental actors? The total lack of originality in the plot? The ludicrous action-posing that dominates both the human \\"drama\\" and (even worse) the monster fights? The absence of any attempt to create an emotional connection between the audience and what's going on on-screen? The way that fight scenes just stop, without any kind of conclusion? The cheesy suit designs for most of the monsters (I mean, how do you make King Seesar look WORSE than he did in 1974???)?It would be much quicker to list what did work.Some of the special effects were kind of cool.End of list of what worked.Basically, almost anything that can be wrong with a movie, is wrong with Godzilla: Final Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the worst of the Godzilla 2000 series. I was extremely disappointed. I've tolerated bad Godzilla movies for years because I'm a Godzilla fan but this one pushes the limit.Let's admit it, there isn't one Godzilla movie that rises above the \\"B movie\\" status. Some are close, but there's always a crack somewhere that gives it away. Fans look past the bad costumes, poor translation, and ridiculous plots. If you ARE a Godzilla fan, you are obligated to see even this movie. I suggest renting it though.It suffers from loooooong people fights, short monster fights, and too much talking. The whole Matrix meets Godzilla combination bored me to tears. My son even got bored and stopped watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really want to give it one and a half stars","review":"I dont know what really to say except...if u like MIGHTY MORPHINE POWER RANGERS then this movie is for u...It truely was a bad movie...I feel sorry that Godzilla has to end like this...I was so excited when i first here about this movie. Boy was I sold a load of crap...If this is a fine example of Japanese movie making, I can see why they like American movies so much. If u r a godzilla fan, u know u are going to see...u will sit there an keep tellin yourself that it is good just to fight the bad reviews...But in the end u are going to be like the rest of us n say...I want my 2 hours of my life back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dreadful film to end the series","review":"This film contains all of the worst elements of the 1970's Godzilla films; which were generally the worst of the bunch. Silly aliens wearing absurd costumes speaking ludicrious dialogue. Granted, alot gets lost in the translation from Japanese to English, but the \\"people talking\\" scenes are truely painful to listen to. All of the sword fighting is ridiculous and unneccessary in a Godzilla film.Godzilla's fights with other monsters early in the film had too much \\"monster humor\\" for my taste. It was cartoonish, the way Godzilla would celebrate, and the defeated monsters would crumple on top of eachother. Rather than being battles between vicious monsters, they came off as pro wrestling matches.The only serious, and good, monster action was at the end when Godzilla faced Monster X, and Kaiser Ghidora; but by then the climactic battles seemed out of place, since the first hour and a half of the film was so silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exit with a whimper","review":"This remarkably lame entry into the Godzilla franchise apparently marks the end of the second run of movies, and it slams the door shut with a resounding thud. The last several movies were excellent, particularly Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, which marked the return of the evil, scary Godzilla. Final Wars is a lame pastiche of The Matix and X-Men, framed with relatively stingy Kaiju battle scenes. While the idea of the Kaiju Godzilla facing down his digital American alter ego is amusing, the actual execution was amateurish. All in all, too little of Tokyo being destroyed by giant monsters and too much moody expository dialog by sullen mutants.Let's hope they re-charge with some more fun movies next cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla Final Wars - DUD","review":"I thought this was the worst Godzilla movie of all time. Even with all the monsters, SPFX. First the monsters werent on screen long enough. 2nd the music was totally out of place. 3rd the characters are totally unlikeable. 4th Godzilla takes forever to show. 5th this movie just sucked. There were a lot of Hedorah fans who got to see their monster come back, looking different, and a screen time of 1 minute. Who was this Hedorah I would have liked to have known more. Ebirah gets a minute in the movie. King Caesar(sp) why ?? Minya Why ??? Gigan, Rodan and Mothra were cool. Monster X was neat, and became Kaiser Ghidorah at the end... Being a G fan to the fullest, I was thoroughly disappointed with this piece of junk. Nothing traditional about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool, sick, a great film","review":"This is a great film the actors are awesome the fights are cool and the special effects are the best yet. The main character is a mutant and plays his role amazingly. The story starts as aliens invade earth claiming they're peaceful. After earths protection force exposes their scheme to use humans as a food source, they must unleash godzilla (they froze him two years ago.) Then godzilla kicks all other monsters butts and fights the aliens unlimate weapon,Monster x. Later in that fight monster x evoles into monster x two. After a huge face off godzilla wins. During this the mutant fights a vey cool karte fight and just by a split second survive. This movie is great but has some flaws such as short fights (only beggining ones) to much humans not enough monsters and gigan has chain saw hands at a point. But overall this is a good movie and a very good choice for any godzilla fans if you don't mind waiting for monster action. I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Martial Arts","review":"I Liked This Movie. The Action and Special Effects were Awesome! The Upgrade of most of the older monsters were great. The only Ones That didn't make the Millenium upgraded cut Were Gabara, King Kong, Gorosaurus, Biollante, Battra, Space Godzilla, Destroyah, Titanasuarus, Megalon, Varan tell me if there's others. The Martial arts and people/alien Action could of done without. I would of liked a laser fight just fine. It was good movie cold of done without a few things. I didn't like the mutant, keizer crap. It said on the back that japan had a surprise for godzilla that they were going to finish him off. never had such thing. It also said happy birthday big g, but he had a crappy birthday present. In the first seen he got barried in ice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different Kind of Godzilla Movie","review":"First of all, apart from the first few mins, Godzilla only appears in the 2nd half of the movie. The movie itself aint bad, with some nice action. It almost feels like watching a Japanese version of the Matrix movie featuring Godzilla and some monsters, because the main plot of the movie doesnt revolve around Godzilla. If you're looking for some gd fun action, and not a typical Godzilla flick... this could be the movie for you...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple pictures, children love it!","review":"While it's not the likes of Baby Einstein and others, it holds it's own.

If I was gluten intolerant, I would probably get more, because they are tasty and have a texture found in similar gluten free cookies. My original purchase was based on the organic ingredients. The one I am not thrilled about is Calcium Carbonate. I consumed the 6 bags rather quickly and enjoyed them. I suppose the manufacturer puts them in a rather large bag to make it seem like you are getting a lot, but there is less than 5 ounces in a heavy foil bag; not exceptionally environmentally friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are great!","review":"I really enjoy these cookies.

I keep in a drawer just in case something happens to one of the other mice.Just some advice-- don't let it get too far from the mini-receiver and if it stops working check to see if the mini-receiver has been hit and lost contact with the computer-- the way it sticks out makes that easy to happen.

Kinda slow & dull story.One of the reasons I picked it up is that I had read somewhere that it was an anthropologically accurate portrayal of pre-historic people.Well. Probably not. The life portrayed is of hunter/gatherers in,perhaps the early 20th century. But, as archeology and anthropology indicates, early man did not live in the same way as hunter/gatherers did after the adoption of agriculture.This book is set in 20,000BCE. At that time, hunter/gatherers were not yet pushed into fringe areas where making a living was difficult. They had the ability to range over wide areas. There is no evidence that they starved in winter, and some evidence that they laid in winter stores.It's only a novel, of course. Still."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I gave this 2 stars based on the total book average. I thought the chapters written about Yanan while she was alive deserved 3 stars and the ones written about her in the spirit world were 1 star material. There were a lot of good reviews about this book so I had high expectations, but this book is not anywhere near the same class as the Earth's Children series. Clan of the Cave Bear has character development, action, history, and suspense. I actually cared for Ayla. I tried to care for Yanan, but couldn't do it. I wanted to get to the end of the book, if only to see how she died and would everything be wrapped up into some grand finale, but like the rest of the book the end was a big disappointment. I was glad when I got to the end of the book because that meant it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning - An anthropologically authentic novel","review":"This is a great novel that needs to come with a warning. It's has such an rich and authentic texture that those readers who like to submerge themselves in other cultures might get lost in this and never wholly emerge afterwards.Anthropologist Elizabeth Marshall Thomas brought her training and field experience to bear in this novel to paint a detailed portrait of the struggles of a Paleolithic nomadic people in what is now Siberia, all seen thru the eyes of a young woman. Thomas also did the unexpected. Starting from Chapter 2, and in alternate chapters, she presented the surrealistic vision of the afterlife that these primitives held. The aggregate is more of a mood piece than an action story. More insightful than heart-pounding.This is not a Jean Auel-type novel. It's more demanding. It's anthropologically sound. And very haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story, But Kind of Stressful","review":"This is not the kind of book I normally read, but I could stop myself from reading it once I began. Elizabeth Marshall Thomas truly knows how hook a reader. I felt pain and sadness, at the deaths of Yanan's lodge members, but also their joys. The other does a seamless job of moving the story back and forth from the really world [if you can call it that], to the sprit world, and somehow make me [a strong non-fiction reader] believe. I will worn the reader, that this book did not leave me feeling relaxed, I found that I was stressed and restless after reading it.

Easily the best invocation of what life may well have been like for our hunting and gathering ancestors, and a stupendous illustration of animistic modes of experience, and of the reciprocity between human beings and the living land. Brilliant insights into the sensorial worlds of other animals -- wolves, mammoths, and others -- as well as into mysteriously beautiful styles of thought and awareness still common among many indigenous, oral peoples. An anthropological and deeply ecological classic -- and yet its a novel!

However, I get the sense there never will be much of anybody \\"qualified\\" to speak in the presence of such greatness. So, here goes:Murray Perahia has turned in a singular reading of the Goldberg Variations. It is not to be missed.He somehow manages to express a vast array of emotion without losing the \\"through-line\\" of the work as a whole. While some (Tureck, Barenboim) seem to seek knowledge or mystery in their performances, and while others (Hewitt, Schiff) seek beauty, Perahia has found joy.This recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations gets my highest recommendation. It is my top choice for those looking for this work on one CD. That said, I still would not want to be without Maestro Barenboim's Bueonos Aires recording.Get this disc. Listen to this wonderful music. Drink in joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding performance","review":"Contrary to what Andrew G. Gindes said about this recording in his highly critical review that speaks more about his own very narrow musical tastes, Murray Perahia's performance of the Goldberg Variations in this recording is exquisite. I also much prefer it to Glenn Gould's Goldberg! Definitely a refreshing musical experience and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime - a worthy replacement for Gould","review":"Murray Perahia takes the Goldberg Variations to new heights here, to my mind/ear even more thoughtfully, sensitively and musically than Gould, Schiff & Hewitt (yes, pretty difficult, but that's what I think is achieved here).Here we have a supreme Goldberg interpretation, stunningly recorded. Perahia is simply so good, I can't imagine ever listening again to Gould's sing-a-along versions, exciting as they are. Perahia is more exciting still, where necessary.Don't hesitate to add this version to your collection - it surpasses expectations, even for magical Murray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't try to compare...","review":"From the perspective of a layman who has only listened to this recording, all I can say is that it's thoroughly enjoyable. Having listened to other Perahia recordings, his low key, non-egotistical playing is very appealing and it's no wonder that he has so many well regarded recordings on the market. Is this recording better than Gould's, Tureck's, etc.?

It does however go beyond such earlier standard texts, like Sakurai's \\"Advanced Quantum Mechanics\\", which was just an introductory treatment of relativistic quantum mechanics. Kaku takes you well into the depths of QCD and the [current] Standard Model.If you are a grad student wanting expertise in this field, an attraction of the book is its extensive problem sets for each chapter. Perhaps more so than the textual exposition! Another reviewer bemoaned the lack of worked out problems or answers. Well, that lack is the norm for many advanced texts. You just have to get used to it. But a more positive way to look at this is to recognise that sometimes knowing that an answer to a problem exists can be valuable in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sloppy job","review":"The only thing that could possibly justify the word \\"modern\\" in the title of this book is that, at the very end, it includes a discussion of supergravity and string theory. Apart from that, both the choice of topics and their treatment are fairly standard. The book is not an \\"introduction\\" either; it touches upon quite involved issues in a rather casual way. At the same time, it is sloppy both in its presentation and its notation, and some of the \\"proofs\\" leave much to be desired. It reads like something that was written in a hurry, at the expense of clarity and coherence. If one is looking for an introduction, there are far better books around. More advanced readers will be able to find books that cover the same material in a much better way, in the same number of pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a little Physics background","review":"Interesting book.

The filmmaker's access to Evo Morales and some of his supporters and allies provides a window into a political process that is both organic and extremely organized and hierchal. The power of community organization seems to outshine education, money, even ideology. The film also shows us the lives of women and men who live off of coca production, whose business has become more profitable as a result of the US crackdown on cocaine production. This relative profitability is also a powerful political tool to rally farmers behind this canditate.

Beautifully recorded, swinging very hard with the rhythm section lead by Gildo Mahones (p), Lambert Hendricks and Ross prove that they are one of the true treasures of the second half of 20th century music. The liner notes by Jon Hendricks and bonus tracks recorded the following year (without Harry Edison) help this CD become one of essential items in my jazz collection....\\"Everybody's Boppin\\" with some wild scatting is one of the highlights, but the wild delivery of (often zany lyrics)...

Alas, the Metro workers are on strike, so our little heroine goes off on her own in search of adventure, driving her poor uncle nuts in the process. This wonderful book manages to be funny and heartwarming while maintaining a raunchy, satirical edge. A perfect book for a rainy day!

The movie is terrific; the other \\"Lost\\" titles (with the exception of \\"Slaughter High\\") are full-framed but pristine prints. This transfer is as grainy as if I had taken the VHS and copied it myself to a DVD. It's an amazing rip-off, but I guess it doesn't matter to Lionsgate. I can't imagine what can be done, save sending back the discs. But since there's no other version (EXCEPT an old VHS copy--with the same quality) you're plum f***k out of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 STAR MOVIE, 1 STAR DVD!","review":"I always wondered why this beautifully written film was never released on DVD. It was initially released by warner bros and although it wasn't a huge hit it did well enough and received good reviews and golden globe nominations. When this film came out my parents were divorcing and I related to Drew's character. I also thought the parents were fully realized personalities. Of course none of this would work without the amazing work and chemistry of the 3 leads.Now 25 years later the DVD is released and it is CRAP! It appears that this is a video transfer (complete with the old vhs Vestron Video opening!). The image is full screen and is either extremly faded or so dark you can't see what's happening.

I'm hoping this isn't reflective of editing done in the rest of the book, but I wont know till I use the materials in a classroom setting.I've called Random House, who has notified Princeton Review but as of this writing they have not responded to my call for help in resolving this issue. At the moment, I'm scrambling around for an answer sheet.

Best is the music which is solid throughout. Yes, I still wish he'd rescue Steve Rothery from drudging on with that stuff they call Marillion these days, as though the keyboards do well here, the guitar could use some more muscle and flair. Even so, it's a good album, hopefully showing things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plague, and \\"the Rest\\"","review":"I'd divide this album into two sections, \\"Plague of Ghosts\\", which covers the whole second half of the album, and \\"The Rest\\". From the earlier comments, it's fairly obvious that the \\"Plague of Ghosts\\" suite is brilliant, so I won't dwell on that. I just wanted to make a couple of comments on \\"The Rest\\". It's mostly good, but I'd avoid \\"Rites of Passage,\\" and to a lesser extent, \\"Tilted Cross\\". In the former, Fish's vocals and lyrics, which are good, are overshadowed by a sop. sax. solo which sounds like something Kenny G. would do. Yuk. \\"Tilted Cross\\" is Ok, but kind of leaves me flat. It feels a little too thin. On the other hand, \\"Incomplete,\\" and \\"Faith Healer\\" are both excellent. \\"Incomplete\\" is a beutiful duet/ballad, and \\"Faith Healer\\" absolutely rocks. More than anything, I'd say these two tracks carry the whole first side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...Better...Much Better","review":"Fish's latest studio effort turns out to be his best solo to date.

Virgil and Exile were definitely the best, but I also liked Suits and Sunsets very much. But the Zippo thing is definitely his poorest work. The first 7 tracks are all too thin or simply just loud and they don't have the power to really move me inside. The second \\"concept\\" part is just a poor trial to warm up the genius Childhood times, but at last only a few nice keyboard pads and guitar riffs remain. Sorry, Uncle Fish, this is not the album I was expecting from you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I always look forward to new Fish recordings, but this one really let me down.

After wearing my old sifter out several months ago, I purchased one like this thinking it was time to upgrade to a newer style. After using it about 15 times, I am throwing in the towel and switching back to the old model with the crank handle on the outside. There's nothing wrong with the quality of this item, it just sifts much slower even when you operate it quickly.

I know others said not to wash the sifter--well, I did and I now have globs of coagulated flour entrapped between the mesh. (Why, oh why couldn't they invent a model that disassembles for easy cleaning? I use mine for powdered sugar as well as flour, so I think cleaning is not an unreasonable requirement.) I also agree with the reviewer who said that the handle mechanism wasn't very effective, and hitting the side of the sifter worked better.

It was like 100 degrees and every time I took a picture, the screen became hopelessly smudged and make-upy and covered in sunscreen. I would NEVER have been able to see the pictures I was taking without this cloth. It's a little small, but it does the job and stows neatly back in the little baggie. As another reviewer mentioned, I wish the end had some flap to protect the cloth from acquiring extra dust and dirt. It's also fun that it stays attached in the side the pouch and just folds right in and out. An upgraded carabiner style clip would also make this a little more user friendly and durable as the cheap plastic clip gave me some difficulty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient & Useful","review":"I purchased this cloth for my binoculars.

It's made of high quality brushed stainless steel, so no stain or grease will stay on it through a dishwasher cycle, and it looks great too!I have no problems with the design, finish, or size; it fits between the two burners in the rear of our electric stovetop, and is always ready to accept some grimy cooking utensils.

Well, the \\"Christmas caravan\\" turned out to be a real let-down. The album is not all bad, the Zippers are too good a band for that, but it isn't great either. It comes along as something that was slapped together too fast. With \\"Perennial Favorites\\" and especially with \\"Hot\\" they have gotten us used to outstanding quality, albums that have matured and where every single song is great. This one is just OK and doesn't stand out for anything. A very mediocre effort from an otherwise so talented and creative gang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Hate to say it, because their other cd's are among the most treasured that I own, but this was a major let-down.

Sadly, the only track that met my expectations was the New Orleans sounding instrumental of \\"Sleigh Ride\\". \\"Hot Christmas\\" had potential but just seems uninspired. In fact that's the one word I'd use to describe this CD - uninspired. It seems as if they weren't interested in making it in the first place.

When I woke up there was this woman singing. My first thought was, \\"Whoa! This lady can sing\\". I had no idea who she was and the station never announced her name. It was eleven PM and I wanted to go to bed but I had to find out who this singer was. So I went to the TV station's website and looked up the time slot. It said, Martina McBride in concert. Although I had never heard her before, I knew I wanted to hear her again. Begrudingly, I went to bed. The next day I order this CD from Amazon.Ms. McBride sings with a passion and energy often associated with early country music. Like the early artists, she counds as though she really feels the music she sings. There is a genuiness about her that is most refreshing. I'm totally impreseed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!","review":"This is the way all of todays country music should be done!!Martina took some of the very best country standards and made them, beautifully her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will love this CD","review":"I have this CD and bought this one for a friend for Christmas. Martina sings the oldies and it is awesome1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Country","review":"This is Martina's faithfull interpration of some classic county songs in her beautiful voice. If you prefer today's fashionable pop-country (Carrie Underwood etc.) this is not for you. These are classic country songs faithfully delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!","review":"This is one of my most favorite cd's EVER! Martina did an outstanding job and deserves a Grammy for this masterpiece. There is not one song on this 18 track CD that I don't love. That is very rare for me. I've played it at least 20 times so far. I can't get enough of it. Way to go Martina!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Enchanting","review":"Yet again, Martina McBride has released a CD she can be proud of. It is beautiful. Though I am sixteen, and was not alive when these songs were originally put out, I love them. The lyric is superb, and the music itself is not equalled by anything today. Her rendition of \\"Help Me Make it Through the Night\\" is rich, tender, and full of warmth. Paired with the lilting guitar, and the magical steel guitar, this is a lullaby unparalleled. She provides just the right amount of spunk in Loretta Lynn's \\"You Ain't Woman Enough\\" and delivers \\"Thanks a Lot\\" with the sarcasm simply dripping off of her tongue. As usual, Martina McBride masters every song she sings. This is a CD of 18 songs that she makes sparkle and come to life. Every one can be listened to over and over without a person getting tired of them (I should know, I've done it). I would recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martina McBride (Timeless)","review":"McBride does not do justice to the great old songs she is singing. She sings the words, but there is no emotion, no feeling. The music is sterile. It seems as though she just wants to get through the songs as quick as possible and be done with job. The instruments backing her up are similarly uninspired. Their music is bland at best and could have been mailed in. I regard the money I paid for this album as poorly spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy!","review":"I think it's very lazy to rush out an album of cover songs. Rod Stewart started this trend with his last 4 albums being all covers. His works better because he sings the songs in a new style or reworks them to sound different.This is just by-the-numbers remakes of the old songs with similar arrangements to the originals (which all are better than the new versions!)Don't get me wrong. I think Martina McBride is a great vocalist. She just doesn't put forth much effort on this release. It's time to work a little harder, Martina!"},{"rating":"1","title":"her worst album ever!!!","review":"this has to be her worst cd ever, Martina does not sound good on any of these songs, even the first single \\"rose garden\\" floped on the charts!! if you really want to hear a great remake album ,check out dolly partons new cd \\"those were the days\\" and leave \\"timeless\\" in the bin!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"martina shines,but not on \\"timeless\\"","review":"I have always been a huge fan of Martina,but her latest cd just does not do it for me, not sure why?

At first it was odd hearing and seeing these old songs sung by a different artist but it grew on me! Boy did it grow, I bought the cd and have played it at least 20 times since. I also marvel at how good it is sonically considering they used old recording technology, it makes me thing that a lot of things sounded better when they were made but the tapes and sources aged badly. On another note, as already stated here by many other good reviewers this CD is not for everyone, if you're of the new country camp and don't care for the old twangy stuff I doubt it'll be well received but for those that either grew up with these classics or as one 14 year old stated here found them later it's a fantastic CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!!!","review":"Maybe I'm showing my age or the era in which I grew up, but I rate this her Best. Not sure if I own everything Martina's recorded, if not I'm only missing one or two, but this is definitely my favorite. Nothing like that sound and style of playing and the steel guitar. Sure hope she'll do more albums of the Classics (I've got some suggestions...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"I Recently bought \\"Time Has Come\\" on an impulse out of a Walmart sale bin. LOVED IT!!! So then, picked up \\"Timeless\\". Yawn. I was bored stiff with most of the tracks. All done better by others. Admittedly, I am not a major country fan. I just know what I like. Then I received my first Carrie Underwood CD, \\"Carnival Ride\\" as a gift and was blown away. That girl can sing! I'm afraid Martina paled in comparison, at least for my taste. I think the \\"Timeless\\" songs, all famous standards do nothing for her, whereas the songs on \\"Time Has Come\\" all really worked with her voice. Just my opinion. If you are new to Martina, I'd start with \\"Time Has Come\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other People's Songs","review":"These songs are not associated with Martina McBride. They are all fairly well known country songs but they were all made famous by other people. That does not stop her from turning in a good performance. She does.Though these are not presented in the way we are used to hearing them, Martina is a good singer and conveys well the sound of country music of the 60s, 70s, and 80s. She also does a good job at portraying that staple of country (and most other) music: unrequited love. It is a worthwhile album and makes me want to hear some of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The songs themselves are \\"Timeless,\\" but not necessarily these versions","review":"Martina McBride doesn't embarrass herself on these covers of some of country's greatest hits, but she really doesn't add anything to the party either. With slavish devotion to the originals, she recreates, but does not embellish these songs. There really is no individuality here, which is a shame because McBride can sing, but these versions just make you think of how much more affecting the originals are. Perhaps the best thing this CD can do is make you search out other versions of these songs and see what can be done with some imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the younger genereation Martina fans!","review":"I am sure this is a great CD for people who remember these songs from back in the day. But as a young twenty-something Martina McBride fan, it's just not my cup of tea. I just can't relate to any of the songs on this CD! Sorry! If you love old songs, buy this CD. If you are young and don't recognize any of this music, leave it alone! I actually bought this thinking it was Martina's newest realease album of new songs, on the sole basis that it was Martina's work and a new album I didn't have yet. But I wish I had listened to samples first, because it's not my thing. I might try to like it by listening to it more, but until then..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the martina we all love!","review":"i love martina but this cd is weak, the sound is not good and her voice doesnt have the power like her past albums! plus i didnt like the covers she did!they have all been over done as far as remakes go! just all in all a very weak album from martina! better choices would be the new albums from sara evans \\"real fine place\\" or dolly partons \\"those were the days\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn","review":"Martina Mcbride has a lovely voice, and there are worse things than this cd. However this is my least favorite of her Cds and it's pretty boring to me. Lead Single \\"Rose Garden\\" is nice carpon copy of Lynn Anderson's 1970 hit, but not sure it needed a remake.

EXCELENT CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"They call such music timeless for a reason","review":"Timeless pairs one of the finest voices in country music with songs that are worth hearing. For some reason I can't understand, the bulk of country music being performed today is tainted with a \\"sameness\\" about it. That was the malady that ended the careers of noteworthy artists such as Ike Turner and Jimmy Reed in years past. The net result of such music is a reincarnation of disco with a country beat �C the heart of this kind of music is in the background, and it does not matter who is singing because the background is all that comes through. I don��t mean to paint the whole industry with a broad brush, but such junk permeates the country scene today, and this makes a recording such as Timeless stand out all the more �C a great voice matched with great compositions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly strong album!","review":"On the face of it, this is either an act of heroism or foolheartiness -- a tribute to a figure so iconic and universally lionized that following in her footsteps would seem to invite the sort derision that only the truest true believers can heap upon one another. But Vikki Clayton, who has filled in the \\"Sandy Denny role\\" at many a Fairport Convention concert, is entirely up to the task. She opens this album with Denny's signature tune, \\"Who Knows Where The Time Goes,\\" in sort of a throwdown to any potential detractors, and as on several other songs, her rich, confident vocals and understated arrangements carry the day. There are a few iffy touches, mainly in the electric filters and effects added to the bass and guitar, but overall this is a pretty strong record. Clayton herself is quite lovely to listen to. Devoted Fairport fans, doubtless primed to be weigh in against this album, should really try to approach it with an open mind... it's pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"these songs need to live on","review":"A nice set from the British singer. The songs of Sandy Denny are criminally unknown and unheard (especially in the USA), and any project that gets them back into circulation deserves attention (in the Fall of 2001, Clayton stated her intention to record a second volume in this series). Clayton's voice is well-suited to the material, though any female vocalist ever born suffers from comparison with Denny. Clayton often sings Denny's parts at the annual Fairport Convention Cropredy Festival in England (and does a good job, as evidenced by the live recordings; as opposed to some other unfortunate vocal performances over the years at the festival--eg. June Tabor, Linda Thompson.....it seems that the idea of singing the late Sandy's parts in front of a festival crowd has caused some good singers to choke)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic of the Phonograph(?)","review":"When Maureen McGovern recorded this live CD in the early '90s, she was at her peak as both a chanteuse and a jazz singer. Sadly, she has since torn her vocal cords to shreds, developing nodes, and is no longer able to sing. Yet this particular album, containing both great and little-known Gershwin tunes, explains what all the fuss was about--why the late Johnny Green, Buddy Rich and Gershwin's sister Frankie were stunned and charmed by her singing. Just as there was only one Ella, there was only one Maureen, and though her career was only one-fourth as long as Ella's this is the album I most remember her by."},{"rating":"2","title":"I beg to differ with the Dayton, Ohio Fan","review":"While I concur wholeheartedly with \\"Ohio Fan's\\" praise of this CD, he has erroneously lamented the \\"demise\\" of Ms. McGovern's career a bit prematurely. Maureen's voice is as astonishing as ever -- even more so with each passing year. Just as fine wine, she gets better with age. Ms. McGovern has recorded at least 5 CDs, each better than the last since the release of Naughty Baby. While it is true that she suffered a vocal cord injury in the early 80's, she has long since recovered. With each of her recordings, one marvels with more than a tinge of envy at her extraordinary vocal talent and yet, for me, Naughty Baby remains a sentimental favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime is the word for this one","review":"Maureen McGovern has NEVER been given the kudos she deserves for her voice, her instincts and her taste. For whatever reason, she never became a big star but buy this and go seek out all of her other CDs that she's recorded in the 90s and 2000s. She's got great style, impeccable timing and control over a voice that's powerful and well suited for the classic American Songbook. Her tribute albums to Harold Arlen, the Bergmans and others are all good. If you like Streisand or Linda Eder or Barbara Cook or Rosemary Clooney, give Maureen McGovern a try. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book and Series","review":"I purchased the Professional book one month ago.....I tested out after two weeks.

Instead I was told I had to PURCHASE tech support, and this would have cost me half as much again as I had paid for the program.MYOB should charge a higher price for the product, instead of deceiving people into buying something that definitely needs tech support--at least for the first couple of weeks--and then trying to force them to pay extra for support.I didn't pay for the support, and have made it thus far (about six months).

There is no call in number for initial free tech support. The email advice their tech support people sent me failed to solve the problem. I am sorely disappointed and ready to return the product to Amazon, which sold it to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh what a dissapointment!","review":"I purchased First edge last year right after I bought my new I Mac. Love my Mac hate this software program! I agree with the other reviewers, no tech support whatsoever! I had use Quickbboks on my old PC but never could figure this thing out so I returned it!

From soft and moody to powerful and strong, from breakbeats to guitars and pianos - its all in the game! You mabye know those records u would take with u on a lonesome isle where u have stranded?!

For me, the best was Bryan Burrough's \\"Storm Warning\\", a heart-pounding, from start to finish, account of the ill-fated Sydney to Hobart yacht race into not only the Bass Strait but the mouth of a hurricane. Insane competition and incompetence led men to their deaths.My next favorite was the excerpt from Thor Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki, a book I read years ago and now must read again. His writing is so wonderful. What an adventure.Then there is the hilarious and beautifully-written \\"A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again\\" by David Foster Wallace--his account of life aboard a cruise ship.The absolute abysmal worst was part of a novel, Caldo Largo. I do not care for fiction, anyway, and this was pretty bad. There also was a surfing episode that was boring.

It only covers LLC's for California, which according to the author is similar to other State laws. The book spends most of it's time explaining how to fill out forms for starting a LLC and how to fill out tax return forms. I had trouble staying awake long enough to turn the page. I had a basic idea of what a LLC is before I starting reading the book. When I finished, I hadn't learned anything new of value."},{"rating":"2","title":"The philosophy of LLC taxation","review":"I liked the approach. It's not a recipe for starting an LLC (there are plenty of those out there). It is more like background reading about the philosophy driving how LLCs are taxed, and what that means for how the LLC income is distributed and reported. Lots on maintaining capital accounts. There was a fair amount I ignored -- California and real estate specific information -- but the rest was very helpful.

But damn, I found it way too distracting. The introduction by Hofstadter was very interesting and conveyed his love and dedication to this novel; my hopes were high for an enjoyable ride. But I found the novel too dificult to follow, and the clever translation distracting. Hofstadter himself recommends a translation by Falen, and I concur, finding it much easier to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun for Hofstatder fans","review":"For anyone who has read Le Ton Beau de Marot, this book is a must buy, if only for the introduction which fills in the background of how this translation came to be written. For readers of Hofstadter, it will also be fun to read Pushkin with clear Hofstadter twists, as his style pokes through time and time again. For those interested in a good read of the original, however, the translation of James Falen is the way to go (as Hofstadter himself writes). This one is quirky and playful, which makes for an enjoyable read, but does not attempt to match Falen in terms of faithfully reproducing the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as described","review":"We enjoy the sign and have it placed at the entry door for tractors at our shop.

And all the characters are well drawn and very believable. But as did several other reviewers, I too found the ending to be disappointing, even jarring. It seems to me the author, near the end, lost sight of the Grace Shepherd she developed through the first 250 pages, a young girl and later a woman who was intelligent, reflective, and often independent in her thinking. She would not have returned to the church of her father and its dangerously ridiculous routines. More likely an ending would have been the angry, stalking return of her Southern-boy lover from whom she stole several thousand dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good southern read","review":"This was a good southern book, but I too was disappointed in the ending.

Interesting blend of polytheism, deism, Stoicism,atomism, and a bit of Cynicism. Eminently readable-Marcus assembles his thoughts into short paragraphs with no particular unifying theme that might determine the order, so you can start anywhere, and leave anywhere and get a compact bit o'wisdom from this troubled, dying Roman emperor.

It's hard to describe, but in essence this book should appeal to many readers.Meditations is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great read!","review":"Meditations (Penguin Classics)I absolutely loved this book! It was a great read, and felt very personal, as if I were listening to Marcus Aurelius's thoughts. I am using it as a part of my teenage son's home-schooling studies, and even he is getting into it. Great book! Highly recommend, whether for leisure reading, home-school studies, or for some brain exercise! This would be wonderful on a long flight, long train ride, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meditations of Marcus Aurelius","review":"It is an inspiration to read the private thoughts of Rome's Philosopher King.

I heartily recommend this book for men of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay, glad it's digital ... Boo editing","review":"This was one of my favorite novels from my teenage years. I always loved the combination of Science fiction with medieval fantasy. Stasheff's writing is wry and witty and fun to read. I have loved his character Rod Gallowglass all these years. Unfortunately, near the end, an editing hack job was perpetrated. I can understand the editor's desire to remove the controversial section where Rod brings about the joining of Tuan and Catherine by having Tuan spank and discipline her ... Yes, it's sexist ... But they could have edited it out better, because Tuan makes mention of it to Rod before the battle. It appears that 4 or 5 pages were just removed. Oh, well, a slight hiccough in an otherwise joyful romp down memory lane for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"The author writes a wonderful whimsical story. There is a lot of catholicism in this book, but I didn't take it as an attempt to convert people (as some readers apparently did). I believe the author was using his experiences and knowledge as a tool to weave a tapestry of fantasy for the reader (and no, I'm not Catholic). I loved reading this story. This entire series is a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A light, fun read!","review":"I definitely enjoyed reading this novel, it is a fun read and worthy of recommendation.

If not, read at your peril! What's more, if you enjoy books that follow a formula that is repeated over and over and over again throughout the series, then this book is for you. After book one in the series, the stories are situations rather than plots. In one book, the hero realizes that he is hallucinating and he can stop at any time he wants. What does he do? Does he return to reality and his family? Of course not! He rides around the countryside talking to heroes from books that he read as a child. There is no antagonist, nor a point in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"manufacturer defect","review":"Our air conditioner, when plugged in, makes a horrific racket.

Basically it describes how a group of misfit teenagers form a gang centered around their love affairs with firearms. I'm not using the word \\"love affair\\" here metaphorically either. Maybe it was intended as some sort of parable but its moral values are so confused and corrupted it is difficult to see any good coming of it. I couldn't watch the final predictable bloodbath, I just felt too nauseous. Do not watch this pretentious, awful film. Above all do not let any children see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best and most creative scripts.","review":"I'm in film school and after watching this movie I've decided not to become a screenwriter.The script is perfectly connected.

Here, he presents this style in both it varieties, sambuna and finason.His group includes the rare cimboa, a one-string fiddle, which very few knows how to play properly today. N'toni (77 years old) is the rock star of the batukaderas - I saw him on a concert in Cape Verde - impressing! The girls were shaking, drumming to his directions.The lyrics in batuku are about historical matters and more educational or moral advice. N'toni sticks to tradition. He prefers to stay away from politics. This is a very good introduction into batuku.

As one reviewer noted, \\"Images Of Umbria,\\" is not your average travelogue or narrative. In fact, it is a very personal project, its narrative realized almost entirely through images and music, addressing different themes and feelings.\\"Images Of Umbria\\" is also an attempt to show the region from both an historical and current-day perspective, to allow the viewer a certain latitude of imagination, and to inspire his or her own personal connection with the stories. It is a work that I am proud to have produced, and I sincerely hope that you will enjoy it.Danny DeLorenzoSecond Son Productions"},{"rating":"2","title":"The last of the real Tristania","review":"I've already written a review for Widow's Weeds (Tristania's first studio album); I echo the same feelings here.The album is amazing; get it. It's got a more operatic touch than Widow's Weeds, and I like 'em both. The album is worth purchasing to for the track \\"Angina\\" alone. People who dock off stars for the male growls, listen to this song; you may rethink your position. Growls are easy to do wrong, but when done right, it's like Yin and Yang -- unity of opposites.Apart from the occassional good track, I haven't heard solid offerings like Widow's Weeds or Beyond the Veil from Morten Veland's new band Sirenia, which is quite sad. Hope their new singer is someone like Tristania Vibeke Stene."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better","review":"I own this album since 2001. At the beggining i listen to it several times and love the whole thing. But, i rapidly lose my interest for it. Maybe, one or three times a year i give it another try, but... When, i see here that this album deserved more than four stars i was surprised. For me the drum is a weak point. I find it conventional and it don't fit well the music. The snare sound ridiculous and the playing got no feeling, a computer could have done better. Another point is the choir in latin. I heard the latin lyrics somewere else and it appears that the band copy paste already existing christian choirs themes (ex. Agnus Dei, Solima) Knowing that, the music become rediculous, and i'm sure that the meaning of the choirs lyrics have no link with the main lyrics. Bands that are similar to them and that in my sense are more better are Kovenant, Acturus and Evergrey. This, tree have never lose my attention. Look for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"music for the mindless","review":"I was thoroughly UNimpressed by this cd. I was expecting SOME kind of actual singing.

They use beautiful femal vocals and a harsh male voice (as long as a choir and a clean male voice). If fits SO WELL with the music. What I like best about it is how they dont need to over-do any of the insturments, they can keep it simple and the music is AMAZING. A few standouts are track #1, #2, #4, #5, #8, #9...and the rest are great as well, NO bad songs on this CD. I usually grade pretty harsh on music, but this band was amazing man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Goth Metal","review":"I was a little disappointed in this album. My first Tristania purchase was \\"Illumination\\" and I consider that a much better album. The female vocal is mostly buried on these songs and there are too many death grunts.I like female vocalists which you get a beautiful and strong dose of on \\"Illumination.\\" I still give this album 4 stars for being strong in its genre. The use of an orchestration sound and complex arrangements make it a good listen. It has a dark angry steel feel to it, so I would be wary if you're not a strong goth metal fan. If this is your genre, then I would say this is a smart choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received it","review":"I ordered this, but got something totally different in the mail.

The details are best described as cartoonish.The pendant comes attached to a cheap, black rope necklace band. It is probably best to replace with a chain or something that doesn't risk coming undone. Also included is a black drawstring bag to store the pendant in.This would make a perfect gift for a trumpet enthusiast without breaking the budget.

I might actually rather listen to one of those cd's than to this garbage. Theres a reason why this band never made it big or why they never were in magazines or there videos werent shown on mtv its because they suck. The lyrics arent catchy theres no memorable choruses to sing along with and the guitar solos are boring. I wont comment on the way they look seeings how looks dont have anything to do with how they sound but they didnt have many groupies thats for sure.

Song two, \\"Shake for Me\\" also is a great song and reminds me of Alice Cooper.Lead Singer, Richard Black, has an excellent technique and does a super job. Songs three through ten are good as well(at least four stars) and \\"Get Some Strange\\" is another fabulous song. This should have been a big hit but just as it was released Nirvana and Pearl Jam came on the scene with grunge.If I were to compare Shark Island with anybody the obvious comparison would be Guns and Roses or Great White and there ain't nut'n wrong with that!KILLER CUTS:Paris CallingShake Foe MeSomebody's FallingPassion to AgesGet Some StrangeWhy Should I BelieveThe Chain"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not just about painting!","review":"This book's vibrant pictures - paintings, really - will dazzle and enchant; the warm, touching story will remind that the greatest gift of all is the gift of knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely rare","review":"When I was lucky enough to get Right Quick, I was rightfully excited.

The Cisco test objectives are covered at the beginning of each chapter. It seems that the writers of this book wrote their own test objectives and then said it maps to the test -very weird. I highly recommend the Sybex book if studying for the Cisco CCNA test. The writing of the Osborne book is extrememly thin. It covers ATM, Vlans and AppleTalk which is not on the test.

All the reviewers are correct in their assessment. There are mistakes, no question about that. The CD that comes with the book is also full of errors - another sign of \\"rushing it out the door\\". Despite all that, I don't find it to be terribly bad. The certification summary, the two-minute drill, the number of questions at the end of the chapter etc. are helpful. However, there is one thing that really annoys me and I am not sure if you will agree. The network diagrams in the book looks really odd with those funny looking triangles. Just for that, I have to downgrade it from 3 stars to 2 stars. The publisher should seriously look for another artist who knows how to draw a network diagram in a clear and concise manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book, and other books too.","review":"Don't just pick up a 400 page book, understand the book and expect to pass the test! The book goes over each exam objective to VARYING levels of detail. If you see an exam objective, and the book did not provide you with what you considered to be adequate detail, then study those subjects with other materials. If you have questions on a subject or did not thoroughly understand it, do yourself a favor, and study. Study the IOS manuals, dig into the Cisco web site, understand their case studies. Understand the workings of the various WAN technologies, and heck, even go read an RFC or 2. This book is the exam objectives PDF file on steroids, not a 2 week read-and-certify. I would suggest going over the book, then finding supplimental materials going over LAN/WAN technologies and IOS configuration. The book does not give you all of the information you will need.

If it were possible to assign a negative star rating, this collection of dis-information would get five of those. Any material in these pages that isn't completely erroneous or irrelevant to the subject matter covered by the test is available absolutely free on the Cisco website or other similar sites. I'm currently pursuing the CCNP & CCDP certifications. My experience with the above title has put me off this publisher completely.

It turns out that I was right, but due to my previous experience with Cisco, I still passed. If someone read this book cold, they would probably get a 30% on the exam. This book contains many errors in the questions and some contradictions in the text. SAVE YOUR MONEY or try the other CCNA book. This is one of the worst technical books that I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"I read this book 5 times before taking the CCNA test.

If I had not been using the CBTs and reading extra info on the Cisco web page, I would not have passed. This book is serverely lacking in areas such as ISDN, encapsulation and switching.

This is the strangest book I have ever read. It does not map to the test objectives, it has the oddest figures, and the CD included is junk.

The information does not exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't prepare you for anything, especially the test!","review":"This book was so rushed into production, that is doesn't even help you with anything.

While reading the book I noticed dozens of mistakes, not to mention old syntax for alot of the commands being explained. The book covers all the topics on the CCNA exam so if nothing else it provides a general concept for which direction you need to study..In short, if you're reading this book to get your CCNA plan on spending hours on a network playing with the routers and the various routing protocols.Steve Smith CCIE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book!","review":"After finding many errors in this book, I spent the remainder of my study time worrying that what they had taught me was in error.

You know what it didn't, it doesn't cover any thing about ISDN Protocols E,I,Q or give you the rest of the information you need to pass the ISDN part of the Test. It doesn't cover the 5 step of Data Encapsulation very well. It also made no comment about steps of VIP port asignment in a Cisco 7500. I found this book very lacking in knowledge in general, But the One Good part was the Sections Tilted From the Class Room which where Extremely Well written.

Es una critica a la situacion de la isla y de como tambien tratan a los inmigrantes ilegales en la madre patria.Un tema fuerte, pero que se trata adecuadamente a nivel de comedia.Alexis es increible cuando asume la doble personalidad del rico espanol que muere cuando tiene un encuentro sexual con una mujer cubana...la recomiendo para un buen rato!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book promotes tooth decay","review":"I was given the unfortunate assignment to read this book for work. It has virtually no plot, and when something finally does happen, its over in about two sentences. For the most part, the characters (who it is virtually impossible to keep track of unless you've read the preceeding 20 stories) spend their time being impossibly nice to each other and quoting scripture passages. There is also a weird father/daughter dynamic in this story with an elder daughter disdaining any thought of marriage so that she might always remain with her father, and said father thinks this is simply wonderful. There are pages and pages devoted to the daughter telling her father how she never hopes to leave him. I know its not meant to be, but it strikes me as a little creepy.Read something else and be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn(ZZZZZZZZZZ)","review":"Penned in the mid-nineteenth century, the original Elise books were written by Martha Finley as a means to supprot herself after she suffered a serious injury.

It also cleaned easily in the dishwasher without being stained by the tomato in the soup. I also have patterned china and this plain white serve-ware coordinated well with it.One warning, since the serving spoon is also porcelain I had to wrap the spoon separately from the rest of the platter when transporting it in the car to keep the spoon from clinking against the dish and risking chipping.

I flipped through the first few pages and decided to buy the book based on how good they were. Unfortunately, nothing else in the book matches its level of writing. The other stories are skillful but safe, repetitive, always told from the point of view of a privileged young woman, and bourgeois in a way that doesn't question its bourgeois status. I can't finish the book. And \\"Notes to Sixth Grade Self\\" is [bad]. ... But despite all this, she has talent and hopefully her next book will be as good as that first story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positive reviews here are a sad commentary on our world.","review":"Like one of the reveiwers here....I read the first story, and was so disturbed by the, cruelty that I almost put the book down. But I didn't...yet I wish I had. I give this author an A for style and prose, but a big F for heart and soul. It is horrifying to me that so many of you think that this book is so earthshatteringly good. It's a sad reflection on the lack of humanity today, in ourselves as a people. The author's cruel writing makes me feel that she could actually be capable of such cruelty. And most of you are eating it up.....shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"An edgy debut that bristles with reality","review":"I read a couple advance reviews that suggested this book was going to be a thoughtful and tender examination of relationships in the aftermath of loss. That description turned out to be beautifully true, but incomplete. A current of dark struggle muscles its way through these stories as well, setting the reader uncomfortably on edge. Orringer shows the reader that loss has a dark side that's often sexual and angry. In stories like \\"Care,\\" \\"Stars of Motown Shining Bright\\" and \\"The Smoothest Way is Full of Stones,\\" you'll see that the language of emotional dislocation is articulated with guns, drugs and sex. Even when a character's pain is kept inside, longing and loneliness seep out in sharp-tongued dialog and clear-eyed self-examination. Prepare yourself for a dark and beautiful ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginably Horrible","review":"This was honestly the most negative book I have read in my life. I have a clinically depressed uncle, and if he had read this book, I think he would have killed himself. I might as well have read the mind of someone about to be incarcerated in a mental hospital. The level of genius the author used to compose truly repulsive perspectives and sordid plots is commendable, but I would rather watch psycho killer movies if I wanted a dose of lunacy. I feel sorry for anyone about to read this book. Get ready for a day or two of an oppressed immune system from the mental trauma about to be inflicted from the author's nightmare depictions of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Astonishing Debut!","review":"Last summer I attended a bluegrass festival in Lincoln, NE to hear the headliner, the Del McCoury Band. While they were terrific, I was completely blown away by the Grasshoppers! This is an amazingly talented group of musicians with solid chops and tight vocal harmonies. Working with a single vocal mic, the band traded licks and vocals like a finely tuned engine. Also, like the Del McCoury Band, the Grasshoppers are a family unit: there's dad (Glen Garret) on guitar, his son (Jeremy Garret) on fiddle, the son's wife (Honi Glenn) on upright bass, and his longtime friend (Randy Glenn) on banjo. The twelve originals on their debut were produced by labelmate Dan Tyminski (of Union Station and \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" fame) and are every bit as good on record as their live shows. This is a bluegrass band to keep an eye on. I can't wait until their next album! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiophonic Addiction!","review":"This is an incredible Disc.

This is an original album so if you don't like to listen to new music and experience new styles, don't go here. Most of the tracks here are slammin'. Might find a couple on here that just don't keep with the flava.

Almost nothing came out that was remotely interesting. Enter Finch: They are above it all. With this 4-track debut, the band just hints at what they are capable of. Finch have a sound that fans of everyone from Jimmy Eat World to the Deftones can appreciate. They have a great sense of melody, but yet, the music is aggressive at it's core (not Slayer-type aggressive, you know what I mean). These four excellent songs breeze by in just under 20 minutes and it is a great trip. My favorite song on the CD is also the only slowed-down one, \\"New Kid.\\" It has sort an ambient/techno feel (reminds me a lot of the Deftones' \\"Teenager\\").

Finch's 'Falling into Place', while only 4 songs long, is an album more than worthy of any listener's ears. The lyrics are meaningful and heartfelt, and the music just has this ability to draw you in. Every song is equally excellent, but my personal favorites are 'Letters to You' and 'Waiting'. Just try and listen to those songs without singing along. So, if you want to hear a band that is not quite like anything else out there and you're willing to give something new a try, then I highly recommend giving a Finch a listen. I doubt that you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"These ladies got game (talent), originality, and creativity!","review":"If you enjoy jazz, new & old school R&B, with original [funky] tunes without all the remixing then you're in for a special treat when you get this CD.

With the new CD release of \\"Dream Beat Dream\\", it's great to see RK back in his element he's most familiar with. There are some great moments in \\"Dream Beat Dream\\". The first track, \\"She Rides\\" is a hip and smooth throwback to his previous releases, \\"Her Joyride\\" and \\"NYC Tripin\\". Other great tracks were \\"South Beach\\", \\"Cream\\" and \\"Her Dream\\". Though not as outstanding as his debut CD, the recording is much better than his last two CD releases.

I COULD NOT HAVE ASKED FOR BETTER SERVICE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read despite quirks","review":"As much as I love Nora Roberts, I can't give this re-release of PLAYING THE ODDS and TEMPTING FATE five stars. Why? For starters, as much as I wanted to I just couldn't get past the \\"time warp\\" problem. There is no way that couples who met, fell in love, and married during the 80s can have adult children in the 90s. I haven't read Daniel's story yet, but I'm sure I'll find it even weirder that by the time of THE MACGREGOR BRIDES, he's 91! Secondly, Caine's constant lighting up of cigarettes drove me crazy. I'm sorry, but I wouldn't French kiss anyone who smokes as much as he did in his story. Yuck! And lastly, if an author is going to write a family saga, she should remember what she's written in previous books. In Laura's story in BRIDES, Roberts alludes to Caine finally convincing Diana to take that walk down the aisle. Wrong! In Caine's story, Diana proposes marriage to Caine. Despite all that, the romances are wonderful.

I enjoyed Serena story Playing The Odds, that's why I gave it 4 stars.I love the way Serena is such a strong women and she goes after what she wants. She falls for Justin and want she wants she gets and she wants Justin, I loved this story between them reading along you can feel how much Justin does love Serena, he makes you fall in love with him and you see why Serena loves him too.

While reading it, I confess I couldn't wait for it to end. It has no semblance of a plot. First a bunch of animals see a ball. Then there's a kids football game. Then it's back to the animals, and we never see what happened with the game. The story meanders from one pointless development to the other until blissfully, thankfully the story ends -- at least that was my opinion. When I finished reading it my six-year old turned to me and said it was the worst story he'd ever heard. What could I do? I told him he was right, and apologized for picking it as his bedtime book. My advice is kick this book away, pass on buying it and run as fast as you can to a more interesting read, like maybe a life insurance brochure, a microwave instruction manual or a piece of tree bark with interesting patterns on it -- anything really, but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scuttle this Trike","review":"Anything coming out of a box at Christmastime is exciting to our toddler.

I am waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great trike if you get a good price","review":"I saw this 6 mos ago and read the reviews and decided not to buy it, since my son is taller than average. I just found it at Walmart on clearance (about 66% off the amazon price) and decided to buy it. He loves playing on it. The advantage of the short height is that the center of gravity is lower and it doesn't tip so easily. It's light and he picks it up to move it around if he wants. Though I wouldn't recommend this product at full price, it is worthwhile if you can find a deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it were adjustable","review":"I just saw this toy in Parents Magazine Sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at Target this week. I ran to get it since my [...] son is too short to use his hand-me-down red tricycle. It looked like lots of fun in the picture, however, my son is too big for it! I don't know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old- no way! If it were adjustable, I'm sure he would have loved it, but just like another reviewer stated- it's just like the other ride-on toys we already own.

I hope I am allowed to say that. The math section was especially helpful because it helped me review math concepts that I have not covered in several years. I haven't taken a basic math class since middle school and all of the concepts in the practice test were in the actual test. (I hope I am allowed to say that too). The strategies given for the reading portion were also very helpful during the test. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the other practice test is for Elementary education and I am going into Secondary ed. so it won't be of use to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good beginner's guide","review":"It's a good \\"first pilates disk\\" while you're trying to figure out if Pilates is the thing for you.

His Theology is more than suspect however. Thus a history of the successors of St. Peter ends up becoming a college course on why the Catholic Church only began with Vatican 2. This book was therefore disappointing and worse promotes contempt on Great Popes such as the Saintly Pius X. Catholics and others searching for a history of Popes would be better served elswhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected History and Got A Movie Review","review":"I would give this book no stars if possible. It was utter crap. It was essentially a who's-who among the Popes of liberal Catholicism. From calling Pius X an intemperate, mean-spirited tyrant that set the Church back \\"for half a century\\" to calling John XXIII the most beloved Pope in history, and his pontificate of the greatest importance since that of St. Peter himself. I have to question the scholarship of any \\"Catholic\\" author impugning the only canonized Holy Father of the last century while glorifying the one that called the only unnecessary Council in history and almost single-handedly tried to tear the Latin Church down brick by brick, but I suppose I should expect nothing less from the Theology Department of Notre Dame.St. Pius X, ora pro nobis"},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"When there is such a dearth of materials for the learning of Twi, I am reluctant to criticise. However, a dictionary is a critical resource for a learner and should be reliable and educative. This dictionary is inaccurate and incomplete. I am working with two of the most widely used series of Twi learner's books available in Ghana, and a significant proportion of their vocabulary is missing from this dictionary, spelt differently from accepted usage, or given inaccurate meanings. Unfortunately, we still await a good modern Twi dictionary by a native speaker of the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Americani married to a Ghanani","review":"I read the reviews and found a used copy at a good price and thought I would try it since there aren't many options for Twi dictionaries. I sat down with my wife who speaks fluent Twi and started reading words to her just for fun. We both became frustrated in that she only understood a handful of the words. I do understand that there are many dialects of Twi but I would ask her how to pronounce certain words and they weren't even close to the spellings in the book. In his acknowledgement, Mr. Kotey States that the dictionary is a by product of a research grant to create instructional materials for three Akan languages. He goes on to list many prominant Ghanaian collaborators but at the bottom of this extensive list he states that, \\"None of them however, participated in this dictionary project.\\" If Mr. Kotey decides to re-write this in a more concise version, there is definately a need and a market for it.

If you're a light traveler, it may work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Few good forms in otherwise poorly organized book","review":"The most important note to make about this book is that it is only a book of forms. There are no essays or articles in it that will help you learn about coaching.Some of the forms might be useful to someone who is starting up a new coaching practice. The main thing I noticed about the forms is that they are repetitive. There are multiple intake forms, multiple coaching FAQ forms, multiple \\"First Coaching Session\\" forms, etc... Each with basically the same information. The worst thing about the book is that the forms are not well organized.There are definitely better books out there to introduce you to coaching.One Better Recommendation:There is one book in my current library that came with a CD-ROM filled with forms you can edit and then print or send in email to your clients. The book itself was also a great intro to coaching: Fabjob guide to Becoming a Life Coach."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of lists","review":"I was not impressed with this book. It's a book of lists, and checklists, not a narrative, descriptive guide to how to coach. It has a bunch of forms, which are great if you're just launching your practice, but to really learn the craft, this is not the book to teach that. It's \\"oversell\\" to say that it's \\"everything you need to launch\\" or even expand your practice. This book disappointed me greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book; more than I expected!","review":"This book is pretty good. to me, it is a bypass for Coachville's coaching program though.

Written by a Flavr Savr researcher, the book highlights the internal clash between business executives seeking immediate financial returns and scientists charged with coming up with a high-tech tomato that genetic science had not yet produced for general salad consumption. The book's middle-third is a little too technical if you never managed better than a C+ in chemisty or biology, but the insider's view of the struggle to get the new tomato to market and her responsible conclusions make this book a must read for anyone interested in the emerging global role of biotechnology."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.2 Classic","review":"Great Metal/Rock CD.

A must have for all Rock/Metal fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a nice album","review":"With their self-titled debut album, Dangerous Toys found themselves in regular rotation on MTV. At the time their southern rock influenced metal was noticeably different from the hair metal dominating MTV's Headbangers Ball. The album contains such memorable, and somewhat laughable tracks as \\"Take Me Drunk,\\" \\"Feels Like a Hammer,\\" \\"Sportin' a Woody,\\" plus their breakthrough hit \\"Teas'n, Pleas'n.\\" Despite the bands enduring reputation as a cult favorite, the album has a very corporate rock feel. The fact that Jason McMaster's sounds like Axl Rose's only furthers this idea. Still, this CD fairs better than most from the genre at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danger is their first name","review":"High-o-silver, their ten boots are going to step all over you, Dangerous Toys are actually still together last time I read a Metal Edge. I think these guys need a standing ovation, and how's about a new record eh? Let's get dangerous again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Eyeliner Needed","review":"This CD came out at a time when heavy metal was suffering a woeful testosterone deficiency. Rooster-haired poseurs like Poison, Warrant, and Firehouse were getting all the attention, and bands who were true to blues and rock were being largely ignored.Enter a handful of bands who nixed the image gimmickery and just offered in-your-face rock/blues/metal. One of those outfits, Dangerous Toys, brought to the table a nice mix of punk, blues, Southern rock, and straight-forward metal. Ferocious vocals from Jason McMaster punctuated the no-nonsense attack, and the end result was a fine first effort from the Texas group.This is one of the handful of albums from the late 80s that I still listen to today. If you like your music BS-free, I highly recommend Dangerous Toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make my waistband go snappy","review":"This is awful, even by hair-metal standards. The singer sounds like every other gd singer from that time and has written lyrics only a 13-year-old boy would like. Just look at the song titles.

Hunting a wild goat with an ancient gun and incredible skill. A \\"camel-stop\\" not unlike a truck stop.Then you meet the tribe, a mobile city of people and their animals, which they seem to live entirely off of. Cross raging rivers, take off your shoes when you get to the ice fields so as not to tear them, carry sick livestock on your shoulders.

Anyway, maybe they can make up for it but putting all of the \\" Are you Afraid of the Dark?\\" on dvd format. We all who are snick fanatics would be sooooooo greatful. So please think about it. Trust me on this if you put 'em out they would buy. I Would give this series 25 stars & two thumbs way way up. Thanks!!!!!!!!!

I mean please put this on dvd. Nickelodeon would get a lot of money, because any hard core Snick fan including me would buy this Box set. So i'm asking you guys to seriously concider putting this out on dvd for our Snick friends. Trust me when i say you won't be dissapointed with the sales if you put this out. I will run out and buy it the exact day when this comes out. This is refering to \\"Are you Afraid of the Dark ?\\" Show on Nickelodeon. I would give this 50 stars if cd now had that many. Thanks.

The RX he RX'd was going to cost $70 per month. I thought this wasn't much considering my husband and I could easily blow that in a month and decided to go ahead. Afterall, she is our baby. After looking online at the suggestion of a friend, we found this website and that with this product and Azodyl together, even with shipping, the costs was just about $46 per month and it came right to our door, cold storage and still cold. You just can't beat that! It allows us to afford to prolong the life of an animal who has been with us all of hers.Thank you for a wonderful product at a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 1.8 oz.","review":"I received this product today, however the container says 1.8 oz, not 2.5 oz. Either I received the wrong product or the seller needs to change the product title/description (I sent an email to the seller about the error).Otherwise, regarding the product itself, I believe this is helping to improve my cat's kidney function.

Wrong item was received, regardless of who's error it was- they should take the book back since I paid for shipping both ways. They were IMPOSSIBLE and rude to deal with and would only give me 80% of my money back. There was no photo for this book listing and they sent me a 18 year old version. I contacted them immediately upon receiving the book and still only an 80% refund after some very rude comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, half-baked tripe","review":"My friend says \\"God I love this band\\".

Werner, see my review of the 185.00 encyclopedia which I inadvertantly ordered only to return it the next day. These authors overcharge for the simple fact that uneducated readers are willing to pay these exorbitant prices; the books are usually disguised as \\"specialty\\" subjects that require alot of research. I say B.S.--most such work is either copied or rehashed from the same few sources.

This is a gorgeous pop album that sounds only better with each play. The Rolling Stone record guide described Anne Richmond Boston as a cross between Sandy Denny and Grace Slick. That's not too far off the mark although I think she leans a little closer to Sandy Denny than Grace Slick. She actually reminds me somewhat of Deborah Holland, another hard-to-find singer/songwriter.Also worth searching for are two albums by the Swimming Pool Q's for which Anne shared lead vocals back in the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"schizophrenic","review":"This is like two distinct half albums. The great songs are worth the price and time, but the run of the mill, American Idol style pop stuff is totally dull. The lead-off song, Dreaming has magnificent guitar riffs and is full of driving energy. Darling Be Home Soon is a great cover of the Lovin Spoonful's hit, complete with 60's style guitars, but it doesn't sound dated. When You Dance gets the mood of late night AOR radio from the 70's with the cover of the Neil Young song.The Soul Side Of Your Mind & Lately make me appreciate the skip button on my remote. 7 of the 11 songs are excellent. If you know the music of Christy McWilson, add her style to the mix of artists listed in the previous review. Grab this thing if it's still bargain priced. You'll play most of it over & over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeper, must-have album","review":"One of the most beautiful Rock & Roll voices in the music world.

As an American who speaks fluent spanish, I know that kids learn best with songs and animals. These DVD's have none of those features. The sisters spend an inordinate amount of time singing a spanish song that was absolutely not necessary for the video. Words are spoken one at a time over and over by many people in the most redundant of ways and never grouped into phrases-ever. My daycare kids eventually tuned out after about 10 minutes. This was in contrast to the Spanish dvd I purchased that featured a parott puppet that mixed songs and stories.When I tried to return the product, I was unable to do so as one of the sisters said they can't re-sell them.

The members of our group really enjoy the author's thought provoking ideas. Kalas makes it very easy to relate the scriptures used in his books to our every day lives.We have found that there are some books that may be particularly helpful to read during certain religious seasons. New Testament Stories might work best if started just after Christmas since it begins with the birth of Jesus. Chapters 9 - 12 discuss the Easter story.In addition, Kalas' Old Testament Stories would fit perfectly if started in the fall and scheduled to end with the final chapters discussing the Christmas story.We started our study group with the Ten Commandments From the Back Side, another Kalas book I would recommend. All of these books have easy to follow study guides."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are real chalkboard papers out there - this is not one of it","review":"Very slick, doesn't take chalk at all. I sanded it, cured it twice (rubbing chalk on it), still doesn't write as well as a normal chalkboard would. I did paste it on a flat, quite smooth surface. I've bought chalkboard paper that wasn't too much more expensive than this on Etsy, and that paper has a rough surface that you can write VERY easily on. People who said they could write on this chalkboard paper obviously never used a good chalkboard before...Skip this and go elsewhere.

Seemed like a great idea, but wouldn't rec. if needed for repeated or frequent use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbery, hard to stick and smooth out","review":"It took me more than 45 minutes to get this contact paper to properly stick onto a wall surface. I was constantly having to re-position it to smooth out air bubbles and wrinkles. The awkward dimensions (18\\"x6') may have added to the difficulty, but I suspect that the poor quality of the material was more to blame. I also don't like the semi-glossy appearance and prefer a matted look that is more similar to traditional chalkboards. I'll stick to Wallie brand chalkboard paper from now on, which has never given me trouble, and won't purchase this Contact Brand again. (In fact, I'll probably eventually replace this paper with Wallie -- much happier with that brand.) Very annoying product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine with chalk pen","review":"I applied this to the glass of a picture frame to make a cute little chalkboard.

You better really like the pattern and color cause you were for the most part \\"stuck\\" with it. I was thrilled to see that they had a chalkboard version of contact paper and was expected to have a similar experience with a good quality product; but definitely time have changed.The paper barely stuck to the surface so much that I was able to peel it off after the complete installation. Secondly, the chalkboard feature was bogus at best. Honestly it wasn't any different if I just bought black colored shelf paper. The finish was too glossy to mimic an actual chalkboard and the writing left permanent indentations in the paper after I erased my work.The only decent part about the product was the price because I truly didn't have any remorse throwing the entire purchase in the trash.I'll try the chalkboard paint and stay away from the easy alternative; too good to be true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stick to wall","review":"I wanted something cheap and I found this.

I do not recommend this if you are seeking chalkboard style paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertisement","review":"I bought this to cover up worn chalk boards and it does not work as advertise.

It in no way has the texture of \\"chalkboard\\" paint. To me, it feels like regular black contact paper. Chalk does not erase and normal chalk scratches the surface. It is also a pain to work with and anywhere it creases - even in the package - leave a huge blemish on your \\"chalkboard\\". This might be ok to use dry erase on but definitely not chalk.

So far I have used only regular white chalkboard chalk on them, but that chalk writes cleanly, clearly, and erases perfectly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chalkboard Contact Paper","review":"Although I love Amazon and thoroughly happy with the service, I was disappointed in the Chalkboard contact paper. I thought it would be more like a chalkboard finish where you could write on it with chalk.

Once I got past the fact that there were going to be some air bubbles (that maybe would not be seen once there was writing on them and in photographs) I tried to write on this contact paper and it would not hold the chalk. I was very disappointed! I had to go to the Home Depot and buy Rustoleum Chalkboard spray. That worked MUCH better!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"Great quality.

I primed it with chalk like other people suggested, but the chalk didn't go on that well. It isn't like a real chalkboard - not as good as chalkboard paint either. The chalk also leaves scratch marks on the vinyl that you can see after it is erased. Underwhelming product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Great!","review":"I have had this for just over a month and a half, it's still sticking great! I cut it in half and made it into a very cool headboard for a black platform twin size bed. My son thinks its awesome. It's useful as a friendly reminder to make the bed in the morning and put toys away at night, and gives my son a creative outlet without damaging the paint. I highly recomend this to any parent that needs to put up some reminders or a quick I love you. And college students, Great way to make a neon colored study calendar.

The contact paper works very well for writing chalk on. I actually didn't need to prime it first but still went ahead anyways like other reviewers suggested. The only difficulty I had was trying to get the contact paper to lie flat with out bubbling when being applied to such a large space (24\\" wide). If your projects in mind for this contact paper are small then this will fit your needs. If you are looking to apply this to a larger surface then you will need some help and some patience. My husband and I gave up on trying to smooth the bubbles out but since we were creating a grid on the chalkboard it was not too noticable once our project was finished and hung. Overall, I'm still happy I went with the contact paper instead of chalkboard paint (which I have not worked with).

It was a good addition on some glass jars I purchased to hold the candy. The contact paper was easy to cut, put on the jars, and write on. Even easy to peel off after I was done using them.

I thought a traditional chalkboard might be too dusty and fall off the wall, plus it was boring. This contact paper was such a great alternative. I cut it into a house shape. I definitely will be buying more and have plans for a neighborhood in his playroom. My husband was also on board since he thought this was more temporary than chalkboard paint. I think when needed this will remove easily. Others mention that chalk doesn't take to it well but I've had no issues really. Certainly it isn't as dark and bold as a regular chalkboard but I like that it isn't as dusty and with a wet towel wipes completely black like new again.

When I went to paint it, the odor was too strong to tolerate and the cabinet was too large to drag outside. Then I found this chalkboard contact paper and decided to give it a try. It was easy to cut although I probably should have used a utility knife instead of scissors so it would have been a bit straighter. I pealed the backing off and was able to mount it with no bubbles. I still smoothed it out, as directed. I love that it was so easy to install and start using. I actually bought another roll for my daughter who has 2 pre-schoolers who like to write on things. Hopefully this will give them a few appropriate surfaces to practice their creativity.

I wanted to cover a panel on my pantry door to do meal planning for the week and it works out great! I also decided to use the scraps inside my fridge to label the produce drawers with the contents so I don't forget what I have in there (there's almost always something I forget about that goes bad in the bottom of the drawer).This is just black contact paper, so it comes off easily with no residue and can be re-positioned if you make a mistake when you're installing it.I use a chalk \\"ink\\" marker on it and it works perfectly! Wipes off cleanly with a damp towel or paper towel and leaves no chalky residue. I think this is likely a plus for a kitchen area.

My only complaint is the paper is hard to pull off and if you're not careful it will leave grooves in the paper that are permanently there and you can't do anything about it.

While, I hold the opinion that Orenda's album is not quite as good as her work with Azure Ray, nor is it as good as her fellow Azure Ray Bandmate, Maria Taylor's debut solo album, it still holds enough merit on it's own. Personally, I'd say it's a good album best to be listened to from beginning to end, but If I were to name my personal favorite of the album, it would have to be \\"Blind Asylum\\". Whenever I see four stars on Amazon.com I tend to think that it's probably a really bad album because seeing anything less than four stars is a rare thing for me. So if you're reading this, just know my intention is to give it four and a half stars, because while it's not quite deserving of five stars, it's an attempt I recognizing as almost there."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Maria Taylor's solo debut...but darker","review":"Being a massive fan of Azure Ray's work, I was initially disappointed that Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor decided to \\"go it alone.\\" In fact, Maria Taylor's first album 11:11 is spectacular (and while similar to Azure Ray's work, it has more vibrancy and originality). With Orenda's album, I have to disagree with most reviewers who say that Maria's is a better album. I found that most often, my favorite Azure Ray songs were those written by Orenda and with her on lead. Invisible Ones is a really exceptional album full of intense mood and music. The track \\"Invisible Ones Guard the Gate\\" is southern folk/spookiness to the max--excellent stuff. And songs like \\"Blind Asylum\\" are lush and poignant. For sure, Orenda is grittier (check out her side project, Art in Manila...another great album), but grittier doesn't mean less prettier (haha)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly the same as the cheaper domestic version","review":"This \\"import\\" version of the cd is EXACTLY the same as the domestic version.

The Dragon Lady has none of the original mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Poor Example of the Classic Cliffhanger","review":"This certainly has to be one of the worst examples of the classic cliffhanger I have ever seen. The poor quality of the picture and sound track are enough to spoil any redeeming qualities the picture may have had --- if it had any. Very weak plot development combined with non-existant character development (many key character barely speak) and so cheaply done that it looks like they picked a wooded area in southern california and dressed it up with a few potted tropical plants to give it that \\"jungle look\\".

However despite its boldness I cannot recommend High Tension.This movie definitely pushes the envelope when it comes to gore and violence but the plot is predictable and the writing sloppy. The ending just doesn't make any sense and borrows heavily from other horror classics. I had the whole thing figured out half way through the movie.The theatrical release was plagued with partial (not to mention poorly executed) dubbing. One scene would be dubbed and the next would be subtitled. Hopefully the DVD fixes this and lets you enjoy the original soundtrack.

Either Alexa is Schizophrenic or the director is. Other than the \\"twist in the end\\" confusion, it was a very good movie that could be very scarey and gorey as well.

Unfortunately, High Tension pretentioulsy tries to add intelligence and surprises were clearly any genre fan can not be surprised as the plot twists just seem all too familiar. My guess is that the film will gain popularity with younger generations (just as all the Rob Zombie flics do) that may or may not be familiar with all the horror goodies previous decades have given us. I also object to the gratutious use of lyrical rock music in moments when an ambient soundtrack would be more appropriate and powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Doesn't make the Grade","review":"I bought this movie after reading some of the reviews. It seemed to me that this would be a good movie with a twist. The movie is not what you think and that can be a good thing but, in this case this is not a good thing.This movie had to be written by at least two people, one started it and the other person finished it with out reading what the 1st writter wrote.If you watch this movie or have seen it I ask you one question, Where does the truck come from?"},{"rating":"1","title":"By the numbers slasher film with a nonsensical twist","review":"College girls Alex and Maria travel to a country cottage only to be stalked by a killer.Most of this film is a predictable horror flick with false alarms, bloody killings and narrow escapes. The usual cliches are in full force, phone lines are cut, the killer is everywhere, the pretty girls are screaming...In the final minutes a twist is added when we learn the killer's true identity. The only problem is twist makes no sense. It contradicts scenes we'd already seen and feels forced and just added in to make a cliched film seem more shocking.The photography is excellent, the directing fine, and while the girls don't have much to do other than look pretty and scream they do it well. But there's really nothing to recommend this disappointing film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate the French even more now","review":"Why did this film get sent over here? Is it to show how crappy French films are? Thats what it seems. Now don't get me wrong it was pretty decent, probably 3 stars through the first 3/4 of the movie. Everyone is talking about the ridiculous ending. It makes the movie make absolutley no sense, like all the stuff we saw didn't happen. It's just stupid and incomprehensible. That was probably the last French movie I will ever watch. Why did Lions Gate release it here? Did they not watch it first? Simply put give it a watch if you like a lot of blood and guts cause it does have that. If you are a fan of movies that make sense, then don't watch or buy or even rent it. It's sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"intense?","review":"Wow someone spent way too much time on that review.You do need to get out more.The movie was a piece of eurotrash with nothing new to offer the viewer. Plain and simple. No need to read into it any further.I agree with the reviewer below. Don't waste your money unless you have no life or anything else to watch.Amanda"},{"rating":"1","title":"Twists and Turns","review":"This movie started off with drama at the beginning and never stopped. The plot twist pretty much made the movie, without it, this was a remake of a Stephen King book I read once called \\"Intensity\\". It had the same plt, minus the twist. I'd buy this movie for my collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Film I've Ever Seen","review":"Officially the worst movie I've ever seen, and I regret that I can't give a negative review here. The better part of the movie is trite splatter-flick fodder, which drags on and on without any real evocativeness or point. The ending is the worst part though; a twist that, though unpredictable, makes absolutely no logical sense based on the events that occurred leading up to this \\"revelation\\". It also has an extremely tasteless homophobic bent that leaves you with the taste of bad propaganda. I'm also sort of a connoisseur of foreign film, and this movie has the absolute worst English dubbing that I've ever had to suffer through. It's hard to even watch, and makes anything that might have at one point been suspenseful into something nearly comedic. Don't waste your time or money with this excuse of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"INTENSE???","review":"This coming from a guy who reviewed THE WEDDING DATE!This movie blows I'm sure so does that reviewer.KAtie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad....","review":"Couldn't even watch it....mouth movements do not even match the timing of what is being said.

The entire movie is Intensity by Dean Koontz until the ending which is total crap by the way. How can you just rip someone's book and not give them credit? I hope Mr. Koontz sues these people. If you want a real thrill read Mr. Koontz's book, and if you are not much of a reader, if you can find it, Fox made a tv movie on the book ,and gave Mr. Koontz credit, the tv movie was actually pretty good. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"French Horror","review":"Wow, creepy intense, lots of gore, mystery, and great scare factor. What more can you want in a horror film. Tension says it all.

The \\"twist\\" ending that people talk about seems like it wasn't planned until the last week of shooting, as none of the movie makes sense in any other context.Question: If you imagine stealing a yellow sports car and crashing it while actually driving a truck and chasing yourself at the same time, will your imagined crash wounds become real?Answer: Only in subpar horror films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever, bar none.","review":"What a bullcrap ending to a semi-decent movie. Started out good, decent story, and then came the \\"twist\\". I like to refer to as a completely unbelievable lie rather than a twist. This was like watching Halloween only to see Michaels mask get taken off and it is Jamie Lee Curtis. What a freaking joke, this director must be one clueless donkey. Note to self, never ever rent or buy anything from this director ever again. I was even warned by the cashier at Blockbuster about it, still I rented it to see for myself. Wow, nothing like setting up the entire movie only to pull a fast one on the viewer. Don't get me wrong I love a good, well thought out twist like \\"The Usual Suspects\\" and \\"the Sixth Sense\\". But this pile of garbage tries to pull a twist without any kind of factual support what so ever. After watching this movie painfully end, I thought to myself, I can be a hollywood director if this moron can."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie almost sucked","review":"I saw this movie and thought it was boring. It just barely rates above sucking due to the fact that I have seen movies that were worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense gore, high action sequences","review":"High Tension is a highly disturbing visual masterpiece. One of the better made horror movies of recent date. The kill scenes in the first 30 minutes are as realistic as they are intense and brutal. And then the real terror begins as a cat-and-mouse chase between the killer and the victim ensues, leaving a bloody trail behind. Other reviewers have been disappointed with the ending but, without spoiling the ending, I will leave you with this thought- I found many subtle hints throughout the movie to lead up to the \\"twist\\" ending. The killer's mind is a highly disturbing and visual place.Side notes- kudos to LionsGate for releasing the unrated version. The English dubbed over for the first part of the movie is done well and the transition to subtitles in the second half is smooth. The dvd has the usual standard features and interesting commentary by Cecile de France and the director."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT HORROR FILM !","review":"This is truly one of the best horror films ever made! It's a bloody french kiss to the backwoods genre with an excellent twist to give it some originality. This is a very scary,gory & vicious film,filled with some very High Tension not for weak stomachs & as a huge horror fan i couldn't ask for anything more. Alexandre Aja's \\"HIGH TENSION\\" is most certainly distine for horror classic status!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WICKED, SICK, AWESOME MOVIE!!!","review":"I picked up the unrated version of this movie the day it came out. I never seen it before, but heard it was well worth checking out. Let me tell you, if you love lot's of blood and gore in your horror films, then this is well worth checking out. I thought the movie was put together beautifuly. It is unlike anything I haver ever seen before. I don't mean just the blood and gore either, I mean the twist at the end of the movie. I will admit, I didn't get it at first, but I got it now. I won't say what it is because I don't want to give anything away. You will know what Im talking about if you view this film. I recommend checking it out at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chyna Sheperd untouched and alive?","review":"I thought the first hour or so was great, a great remakeof Intensity by Dean Koontz. Sort of like the way they updated The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Except the film makers decided by writing their own end to the story they could steal the rest from Koontz and try to pass theirs off as original. The whole story, up until after the gas station. was lifted. And my god the ending, their ending, sucks.The special features on the disc have both of the writers claiming that their story was original, that they came up with the idea while they were in high school. Makes sense because I believe Intensity hit the shelves at the same exact time these two thieves had their artistic premonition. I agree with the other review and the writers should be sued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"The movie was going really good. It was tense, exciting, nerve wracking....then the ending just ruined it all.Most of what you see in this film is just what the killer is imagining. I'd say only 15% of the movie actually happened. Everything else is just a dream. We don't figure this out until they reveal the ending.While this could work for most people, many of us have seen this same plot device used many times before in other movies or TV shows, so the idea is old and basically just ruins the film for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wanted to like it...but i couldn't","review":"The movie was going ok...then WHAM! the twist...I was shocked. then after about 5 seconds I realized half of the stuff the killer did were either unnecessary or impossible. It was a lazy film that really let me down. I love horror movies, I love sci-fi movies where you need to suspend disbelief. But I don't think I've ever been ask for such suspension of disbelief as much as this piece of crap.For all those who disagree...Explain the scene where the killer gets head for the head.P.S. Amazon really needs to let people rate things with zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't the hacked off leg that made this lame","review":"I amplify the many reviewers who complain about the plot twist at the end. Until this cheap, audience-cheating cop out, this was an effectively gory psycho-meets-his-match-in-cute-girl horror flick. The twist, which reveals who the killer \\"really\\" is leaves gaping plot holes bigger than the holes left in the victims. Why, why, why do some film makers feel the need to go for those \\"trick\\" endings which seldom, if ever, excite the audience? The twist has become such a hackneyed cliche in these horror movies and this is such a poor use of it that I can't recommend this film. It's the feeling of being cheated that you walk away with and not the sense of thrill from the tightly directed and very bloody first 70 mins. I hope if/when a Hollywood remake happens that they leave the killer's identity intact, but based on movies like Secret Window and Identity, they probably wont."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The movie was great until the last 15-20. I was feeling the high tension with every twist and turn the main character made, but the last 10 minutes which showed the other part of the movie being a hallucination was lame for lack of a better word. OK rental do not waste your money buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't even bother, seriously","review":"this is a really weird, not terribly scary waste of time. I didn't know it was foreign until afterward, but that helped it make some sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Horror Well-Executed, ***BUT***","review":"This movie, at least the first half or so is very tense and fulfilling if you're a fan of the genre. Scary, disturbing, dark and dank--but with one huge problem--the script simply isn't original.If you've read Dean Koontz's \\"Intensity\\" you know exactly what I'm talking about. This film is basically Koontz's book with a different ending, which probabably explains WHY the directors threw us that curveball of an ending...they needed just enough to be a little different from somebody else's great story. I myself have a major problem with this issue. Even the title is too close to that of Koontz's book.Despite all of this, I did enjoy the movie, very much. I appreciated the fact that the film was dubbed in english. It allowed me to take in all of the intensity of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will freak you out","review":"High Tension carried me on a suspenseful, frightening trip that never had a boring lull. If you want to be scared and constantly wonder what's around the bend, watch this film. The French cornered the market on fright and horror with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gore & More Makes for a Satisfied Viewer!","review":"I've been wanting to see High Tension ever since I heard of it. I finally picked up a copy on VHS for $3.00 at a used Video Store. I must say I'm extremely glad I did.This movie had an interesting plot,about 2 girls who are terrorized by a maniac in the middle of the night. There is a twist to the movie, if you pay attention you may actually figure it out. It definately keeps you alert the whole way through. Plus there's a good amount of blood and gore in it. There's not a dull moment in the movie!Overall, its a great original horror movie, lots of blood, lots of action, and ,well, \\"High Tension\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not totally original","review":"I was very excited to watch this movie and granted, its been probably at least four to five years since I watched it. I was let down totally because it looked like a very similar book I read. My favorite book of all time is Intensity by Dean Koontz. You can tell that the idea and story was all from the same but then certain things went in an opposite direction. I maybe be a little hard on it because of the fact it didn't do the actual novel justice what so ever, but if you want a better version of this movie, read the book Intensity because it is ten times better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decidedly average","review":"The best thing that happened in the movie was the unconventional ending. The gore - and I saw the uncut gore - wasn't all that gruesome, in my opinion. There were long stretches of time where nothing much happens - especially since the \\"unconventional ending\\" was explained in the very beginning of the film.Given the interesting ending, some explanation would have been nice other than another entry for The Celluloid Closet Part 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid, Bloody, Stupid","review":"This movie can't be as bad as I think it is. Or is it? Avoid the misery of finding out for yourself. High Tension is a one-gadget movie with plot holes large enough to drive a Home Depot truck loaded with chain saws through. The war in Vietnam did not have this much senseless violence. De France is quite attractive in her blood-spattered T-shirt but she'd be a lot more attractive if she spent a little less time sawing people's heads off, nailing their feet to the floor, and torturing them in various other ways. Not seeing this movie isn't good enough. You will never again be a whole person until you've forgotten that it exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"What complete garbage","review":"ATTENTION!!!!! SPOILER IS LISTED IN THE NEXT LINE!!!!! STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM!!What garbage. DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS PIECE OF DRECK!! What a complete rip off of Secret Window. These guys should be sued for plagarism. I wonder if they called Stephen King before they did this film?I first got an linkling what was to come when the 2 girls were in the truck and Alex was crying staring at Marie with this \\"I can't believe you are doig this!\\" stare.I can't put into words what a COMPETE RIP OFF AND LET DOWN THIS MOVIE WAS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't want to make it more complicated than it is.","review":"This movie sucks, I only saw like half of it. First off it's really foreign and it's just about some dumbass who drives up to a house and starts killing everyone for no reason. The main character, some ugly bald women sees the killer in advance and is just hiding all while trying to rescue her friend, another really ugly women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone looking for a cheesy horror film","review":"I can understand people making the dumbest possible decisions in horror films, and I understand all the bloody gore. That is the whole point. Don't ruin the movie with a plot twist that makes no sense. There are too many problems with the twist that completely ruined the movie. Also, I don't know about the audio soundtrack. Half the movie was in French and half was in English for absolutely no logical reason. After the plot twist the movie takes a turn for hilarity. Hold on to your horses folks!Overall I much prefer \\"Club Dread\\". At least in that movie the killer that won't die continues chasing people even with is lower torso missing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IF I COULD GIVE IT 0 STARS I WOULD!","review":"What a horrible waste of a DVD Disc...And I made the mistake of buying this peice of dung.

Dont waste your time.Oh one star for nudity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing is original","review":"DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! This is a total waste of time. Not only is the movie vile and unentertaining but it also lacks a story and is a rip in the side of many moviegoers.

You need to get out more hoss.The movie was \\"ok\\" but not great.The ending was something so unoriginal it made me feel stupid for sitting through the whole flick.But I did dig the gore. If you want to watch a brainless gore flick with a cute chick that fingers when alone in bed...WATCH THIS FLICK. If not...go watch something you havent seen before.luv moms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tres stupid","review":"A predictable fright-fest with acting far better than the all too typical script. You've seen all these tropes worked and reworked many times before. The only thing new is the twist ending, which doesn't work at all. The difference between subjective and objective points of view are totally disregarded to supply the ending, and it's a colossal failure of narrative logic. I only give it two stars because it has a few visceral moments among the recycled set pieces, and the acting of the two leading women is quite powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haute (High) Tesnion....","review":"I have previously bout the french ver. of the movie through eBay with the subtitle and i believe this movie is a very well pu together movie.

Which i was only going to see b/c i wanted to see what they cut out. There is no \\"S-E-X\\" scene you LOSER!@!!! go see the movie b4 you critisize it. if its one thing i cant stand its critisizing from someone who didnt even se the movie at its best. Any way dontlisten to the loser who said all that. It is a very good horror film. Much better than the PG-13 \\"horror\\" crap that is out now. Have fun spending your money wisely. If you dont agree with me then well you suck and have no appreciation for movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatent (and poor) rip-off of Dean Koontz's Intensity","review":"I don't know where to start with this over-hyped horror film. I think it is the first French horror film I have seen, and while I don't mind subtitles, I found the switching from subtitles to dubbing distracting. Then of course there is the first 3/4 of the film which is a complete rip-off of the book Intensity by Dean Koontz (which was also an excellent, far superior made-for-tv movie). There are also poor special effects in the kill scenes. The acting is excellent, but the surprise! twist ending is ludacris. At the end I was just sorry I had wasted my time watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been good","review":"The first three-quarters of this movie? Pretty good. Grim, claustrophobic, brutal, and gory: all the markings of a nasty horror picture, the sory we just don't get enough of these days. And while the dialogue wasn't Shakespeare, it was serviceable.Then we hit the last quarter, and everything falls apart. I haven't seen an ending this frustrating in a long time, and it ruins all the good stuff the preceeds it. This movie has been accused as \\"homophobic\\" by some, and that may be true; but far worse is that it's just plain stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the plot twists","review":"I wanted to like this movie, but it failed me. First off the dvd has three versions: US, French and dubbed. The US is a mix of dubbing and subtitles. The French is subtitle (and the best) and the dubbed is horrendous.Now to the film itself. It's gritty and well done. The gore will keep you on the edge of your seat. All is well until the plot twist. This is where the film disappoints. Such a potential of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY LAME!","review":"Not a good movie by any means. Strange soundtrack, non-sensical plot, and bizarre dubbing/subtitling (never seen it done worse). I cant seem to make sense of the \\"twist\\" in the third act. On the plus side the gore is solid and the cinematography is occasionally quite good as is the pacing/editing. Overall, a silly, mindless, DIRTY little film for people who were lost by the intellectual density of \\"House of a Thousand Corpses\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite poor","review":"Perhaps because it's French I expected this film to be more stylish than the average horror film... not a chance. The whole thing looks like it was shot by a couple of junior college film students and the musical score was more humorous than forboding.After the big \\"twist\\" (which again seemed cooked up by some rather dim bulbs), you're left wondering what the first hour was all about. Usually twists make at least some sense in the context of the film, but in this one the \\"twist\\" just juxtaposes two different scripts. This might be the first film ever to attempt combining the lack of a plot and plot holes all into one reel.If it weren't for the leading actress (who just happens to be amazingly attractive), I would've walked out after the first killing sequence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch with caution","review":"I dont know if any of you have seen my reviews for other horror movies. But to give you my background... Suspiria, The Beyond, Zombie, Funny Games, The Hilla have eyes, The last house on the left... all of these movies were dupposed to be disturbing and gory... but to me they were fun to watch... High Tension was not fun to watch for me. High Tension was so hard to watch I could not take my eyes off it. Finally a real movie that can stick with me. Now alot of people dont like the ending.. But please guys if you are all die hard horror fans like myself.. love to see blood... love to see things like this.... you will love this movie. I love the fact that i couldnt really watch it.

TRUE horror.. not the watered down stuff"},{"rating":"1","title":"I seen worse","review":"I just watched this movie last night. I really had high expectations, even though it was a foreign film. It started out well, not the typical slasher movie. There was a lot of blood and guts as the movie progressed. I have to admit the ending was not at all what I expected. The movie leaves a lot to piece together in the end and It sort of leaves you scratching your head, and wondering how it all went together."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's been a while since I had to avert my eyes!","review":"This really is a nasty, bloody French movie! I watched the film with English dubbing and the overdubbed dialogue did not detract from the film at all! The DVD includes two different cuts of the film both in dubbed English or original French audio. The gore effects are great and very realistic. The acting, directing, and sound design were notable, as well. This was fun to watch. It really kept my brain thinking and my stomach churning! I recommend this film especially for fans of \\"Saw\\" or \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"good movie until the twist","review":"I totally agree with the last review. The plot of this movie is definitely taken from Dean Koontz's Intensity with the exception of the unbelievably stupid twist ending.If they would have stuck with the original ending then this movie would have been decent but the ending just makes no sense at all and just kills the whole movie.They made a movie from Koontz's original story that stars John C.

It is so bad it litterally negates the entire movie. I was left flat and some-what angry.

Sure, there was some moments that raised the suspense somewhat, but it feels like the script writers and director were trying to deflect your attention from what is otherwise a weak story. I think most will probably figure out what's really going on within the first half hour of the film. I will say during the end of the movie, Cecile De France does put in a haunting performance. A missed opportunity overall in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOOOOOOOOO AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I held off watching this movie for a couple of years. All the while, so many people told me how awesome it was. Constantly ranked on people's top horror movies of all time, and top foreign horror movies. I'm a big fan of horror movies and foreign adds to it (they are more original than we are).

Within the first 10-15 mins, it is painfully obvious that this is a total remake of Intensity from the college friend visiting the friend's family to the guy showing up at night and killing them one by one to the friend hiding under the bed and making the room look like no one was using it to her sneaking into the truck, the daughter being the only one to live by capture, and on and on and on....for all but the last 15 mins of this movie it WAS Intensity.

The PC app is difficult to use, does not employ a standard UI, and makes bulk loading of map data to the PDA normal memory, much less extended memory, as tedious as you can get. I would throw the app out, and start from scratch. On the PDA side, there is no overview map that i could find. You could only access maps by name which is not WYSIWYG at all. It does scroll fast and the maps look great, however. I'm suprised at the total lack of basic necessary features. Delorme could learn a great deal just by looking at Garmin's Mapsource applications and their very well designed cartographic GPS units. Until they address the ability to quilt together map sections, provide bulk downloading, and many other features, i'd wait on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not User Friendly","review":"I have used the regular PC Versions of Street Atlas for years and love it. This software for a PDA need to be pulled from the market by Delorm before it gives all their software a bad name. They are trying to load too much secondary travel info into the PDA and not what is really needed. Which is easy to use maps or areas that can be easly loaded and navigated. Something like their Street Atlas for PC's Ver. 01. Who needs the names of hotels, places of interest, and eating establishments on a PDA. All you want to do is find out where you are and where you are going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I liked the PC version, but the handheld version is expensive, hard to use and not that much value. When compared to MS Streets and Maps it is not even in the same league. The Bluetooth feature is problematic and the tech support is poor. In both versions there seems to be a bug that introduces a position error of about 200 feet. This seems to be problem for both the hand held and PC editions. If this keeps up I expect DeLorme to be out of business within 2 years. Too bad---It has the potential to be world class."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money!","review":"This is the worst mapping software I have ever used (and I have used most of those available). There is a position error of 200-500 feet everywhere but on major thoroughfares and DeLorme Tech support (???) can only say it's a problem with the map translations (???). I notice there is no 2007 version! I have found the same position errors in their laptop version. Microsoft Streets & Trips is dead-on in position everywhere... DeLorme should be totally embarassed since their only products are in this field!

Edith Warthon -- the stunning creator of amazing novels like The Age of Innocence and The House of Mirth -- had outdone herself with Old New York. The four novellas in Old New York have similar themes: infidelity, jealousy and the always intriguing class system. I love all the stories, but I particularly like \\"New Year's Day,\\" which focuses on an adulterous woman. I marvel at the fact that this story had probably caused some controversy in those times. I also enjoyed \\"False Down\\" and \\"The Old Maid.\\" I know that this particular book is not as popular as -- oh, I don't know -- The Age of Innocence, but the timeless quality in the stories is definitely memorable.

It was great.

There were no tables (like Boosalis book) or outlines (Cliffs) to give a good overview of main concepts. The sample tests in this book were pretty stupid.

It's Not one of the greatest but a good solid B western (based on budget not quality). I gave it 4 stars because I like both Lee Marvin and Randolf Scott, the interaction between them is great. I think Scott is an underrated actor who never got the credit he deserves. He is somewhat of the same stoic cowboy style as Clint Eastwood. Scott has some great one liners through out the movie, like when the young cavalry comander recomends Scott move on as the indians are on the warpath, Scott says, \\"Its worse than that-they are hungry.\\" One different effect among many is that you see Scott go for his gun but you never see him shoot someone. In this movie Scott plays a X-lawman who hunts down bandits who killed his wife. This movie is one of seven westerns(with Scott)produced by Budd Boetticher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"This is a western I saw in the early 60s, the first of its kind, in which villains could be sympathetic - or even humane - and good guys didn't go without their own faults and ambiguities. Lee Marvin cuts the unforgettable figure of a killer with a sense of honour. And Randolph Scott is a study in stubborn dignity.

The plot jumped around a bit and there were many parts that didn't fit or just were not needed and ran on too long, not to mention there were parts where the sound was missing, yes I am sure it was for artistic reasons but when a man gets hit by a semi believe me it is not quiet, to me it just made the film seem amatuer and unfinished. Long sequences of nothing and too much focus on mundane subplots just made that film a waste of 2.25 hours of my life, I actually caught myself nodding off here and there, not to mention for cops trying to put a drug cartel behind bars they killed anyone who could have testified against the kingpins so THAT made it very unrealistic, there was no attempt to arrest anyone, just kill em all... pitiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This was not Miami Vice. It was a cop movie with the same characters as the tv show. I realize they were trying to make an updated version of the show, but they updated it so much that it wasn't the show at all.

I will, tend to agree with the bad reviews overall. It is an adaptation of the seies but which completely changes the style of its concept. While that is OK and probably more adapted to the times, the movie is still unfocused. The storyline is not that great and it combines a slow-moving pace with periods where nothing happens with moments of hard violence. It is also very very darkly shot and while I am sure this was intentional, it was not a good idea. And the acting is not that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"This version was pretty bad. It had no cool feeling to it, no glam no nothing. Glad I didn't buy it. Watch the original TV series instead, that one rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I have to laugh at these 4 and 5 star reviews that look like they were written to promote the film, instead of an honest opinion. First, this movie should have never been called Miami Vice. It is an insult to a great 80's TV series, that rivited people to there TV sets on Friday nights. What we have here is a 175 million dollar movie that looks like it was shot using cheap video cameras by amatures, and a story that was thrown together.Mann should have taken Jamie Fox advice when he presented the idea to him to make a \\"remake\\" of Miami Vice. Not a film that just uses the name. I cannot begin to explane my disapointment in this film, and how bad it looks. I only gave the film two stars because of the action shoot out scenes which Mann is able to do very well. If there is a Miami Vice II movie, which I dought there will be, lets hope it's done right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Mann lover left disappointed","review":"I am not afraid of movie violence, drugs, or anything like that. I am a huge fan of Michael Mann's work. I thought Collateral was fantastic and Heat is easily in my top 5 of all time.I was excited to see Miami Vice, but after viewing I was left feeling overall disappointment. It lacked the development and human element that made his previous efforts great--I just didn't care what happened to anyone in the whole movie.Michael Mann is known for creating stark backdrops, but his vision of Miami is just plain cold, without feeling \\"gritty\\" as it was no doubt intended to.Overall the whole effort felt detatched and sterile, even the performance of the normally vibrant Jamie Foxx. Here's hoping Mann's next effort has a little more life in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don,t waste your money(wait for the re-edited DVD)","review":"I am a huge fan of Mann,s work but in my opinion this one is his worst.Great locations,stylishly photographed,fine music but there is no story to follow here.It is overlong by the way.Watch the series instead.There is no way to care about the characters.OK performances(I mean just suitable).There is a rumor that the director will re edit this mega disapponting experience so I think we shall wait for the reduxed movie maybe it will be better SOMEDAY SOMEHOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Heat Instead","review":"There were a couple of good action scenes, but that's about all that I enjoyed. I am a fan of Mann's films, but Miami Vice just didn't do anything for me. I actually dozed off a couple of times, which I have never done before in a movie theater. That should tell you something."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"B\\" Grade Movie","review":"We expected better than this! The color was dull. At times we couldn't understand what was being said. The plot was choppy and hard to follow. Not an \\"A\\" movie, more like a \\"B\\" grade movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled Garbage","review":"This movie is not worth ant spit. Does a huge budget and big name actors equal a worthwhile movie? NO! A good story stands on its own while actors, cinematography, set, and soundtrack are just icing on the cake. This movie has the actors and a partial soundtrack but everything else is vile enough to have the director executed in medieval fashion! I wouldn't recommend this film to my dog Spot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably terrible","review":"This is one of the worst movies ever -- period. The positive reviewers here must be using what everybody's selling on screen.

It didn't matter whether I was on the stereo channel or 5.1, it just had no audio track. Also the HD had issues in places and the screen glitched a lot. I love the movie, but I'm a bit upset that there is no way to contact Amazon customer service regarding issues with the streaming video. The support portal is still geared for physical products. For 3.99 I'd expect a better streaming experience and or a way to contact Amazon for support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Will Prevail","review":"This movie has everything for those of us who want action, adventure, great plots, good overcoming evil, and LOVE. I really enjoyed the thrills in speeding to Cuba in a boat, outwitting the bad guys, and forgiving a girl who went astray. Colin and Jamie were a great pair as Crockett and Tubbs, and good looking also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better the Second Time Around","review":"I saw this film in the theater b/c I was intrigued, and I found it dense, immersive and compelling.The second time, aspects of directorial and acting genius emerged.Great, great film. Most don't get it? Fine; most think that PEter Jackson's bastardization of Tolkien was a representation of the Lord fo the Rings because there were cool special effects.What makes a film is not effects, as Miami Vice demonstrates; what makes a film is characterization, and well-drawn plot.This film is dense with all of that. You'd have to wake up out of your consumerist coma to know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this one","review":"Miami Vice features endless shots of speedboats going to and fro, lots of unintelligible mumbled dialogue, and a lame drug-kingpin plot we've all seen a million times.It also features 2 partners, Crockett and Tubbs, who have absolutely zero chemistry with each other. If you hadn't seen the tv show you'd assume this was their first day on the job together.I am a fan of Michael Mann and I also loved the original TV series, but this film is a snoozefest."},{"rating":"1","title":"On and on and on...","review":"Boring film.What's cool about it? Some boats and planes and cars a fancy condo. A couple decent gory \\"deals gone wrong\\" shots.What not cool about it? Everything else! This film (at two hours and twenty minutes) just spends too much time trying too hard to be \\"cool\\". Gratuitous sex scenes...club scenes...back and forth with the \\"I don't trust them\\" dialog. So much boring dialog. So much of nothing. They may as well have put their bathroom breaks in there too. It's just too much.The HD DVD presentation isn't too impressive either. I don't know if it was how it looks on film too or just on this transfer, but the picture is very unexciting. I've only read about the bonus features, which sound cool from what I've read, but I never count those myself.I just can't recommend this film. If it were an hour and a half maybe. It just doesn't move fast enough. Total snooze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes down hill and than picks up at the end","review":"This movie was ok at the beginning but than it just got boring and the story became confusing and hard to follow. There was also very little action in it and it was just boring. The ending was good but that still doesn't make it worth it. I recommend buying the Miami Vice seasons on DVD or the PSP game. If your a die hard fan, well than go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the original series","review":"Having just come from a screening, I must say, that was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The attempt at gritty cinematography looked like it was filmed using a cell phone camera. The dialog was stunted and cliche to the point where people in the audience were laughing at how bad it was. The pacing made it feel much longer than it actually was and all the characters in the movie had an overly serious look about them the entire time. Judging by the audience's reaction, I'm not the only one who thought it was horrible. I had higher expectations given the cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, incomprehensible vice film from the Mann","review":"To say \\"Miami Vice\\" is a disappointment would be an understatement. A blonde Colin Farrell is hopelessly miscast - not to mention unlikeable - in Don Johnson's old role. He spends most of the film trying to be \\"cool\\" but his performance descends into parody. Jamie Foxx is OK but has little to do. Combined with an incomprehensible plot the fun drains away pretty quickly in this film.The man (Michael Mann) who brought us good films like \\"Heat\\" and \\"The Insider\\" has laid an egg here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Waste of Time!","review":"Why was this movie called Miami Vice and \\"loosely\\" based on the tv series? Other than the names of the characters and the fact that they're cops, there was no resemblance at all to the beloved show. The plot was slow and hard to follow, the scenes were mainly dark and it was hard to tell who was where and doing what. I finally had to adjust the contrast on the tv so that everything was a weird color but I could finally tell what was going on. There were a few action scenes but they came so late in the movie that I didn't really care at that point if the main characters lived or died.I guess I'll have to get out my copy of Bad Boys if I want to see an action movie that has great chemistry between the actors. Colin Farell and Jamie Foxx's characters fell well short of the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could get those two hours of my life back","review":"The movie Miami Vice may be great for fans of the series, but I wasn't one when I went into it. I like action films. I like Colin Farrell. I thought, why not? The answer: many many reasons. #1) Colin Farrell has a mullet and a Burt Reynold's style moustache that is so distracting I spent so much time lamenting its presence, I had a hard time grounding myself in the movie. #2) There is no way of grounding yourself in a movie that's about nothing. And it is. About nothing. No point. No plot. Just guns, nonexistent drug shipments, and bad accents. Lovely. #3) The movie didn't so much end as just cut off without any resolution.Can I please just have those two hours of my life back? Please, save yourself the time and money of renting this lackluster film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero","review":"This movie is the worst movie I've ever seen. Reasons why: It just starts. No title. No actor names on the bottom. The lighting is too dark in the film. You can never see anyone in any scene. Colin's gritty voice is horrible. Colin and Gong Li have no chemistry and I do not understand why they had so many scenes together. Gong's accent is horrible. I can never understand what she's saying. The dialouge is horrible. There is a part in the movie where I am sure Jamie was supposed to say FEDS but he says FEEDS. I could go on and on but I don't want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just boring...","review":"Ok, so I've seen a bunch of folks talking about how there was no chemistry between the main characters - yeah that was a problem, but my biggest problem was there was no tension *anywhere*!After being undercover a grueling two days, Tubbs turns to Crockett and says something to the effect of \\"Can you handle it, or have you been in too long?\\" OH COME ON!!!If Isabella and Jesus have a poly or open relationship - which they certainly seem too, then why would Jesus be so upset to see her dancing with Crockett. You can't have that both ways.I honestly think they bought the MV title so they didn't have to spend anytime giving us background on the main characters - but they didn't use that extra time to give us any depth.I don't follow directors, I have no idea if this is a typical Mann movie or not - but it's a bad movie, and boring, and I want my $8 back! Sigh"},{"rating":"1","title":"It should have been left alone...","review":"I believe my husband said it best after we watched the movie a few hours ago. On it's own, it would have been a decent movie... but slapping the Miami Vice title on it, as well as the familiar character names is it's downfall. Part of what made the show so great was the 80s cheese, and there's none of that in this movie. Too many times 'classics' are modernized and ruined in the process, look at Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Depp did a good job in it but otherwise it sucked and I'll take the the Wilder version any day.In my opinion, this movie came too late. By doing it now, they were left with basically two choices, make a lame spoof of it like Starsky & Hutch or change it like they did. It really was a lose/lose situation and really it should have just been left alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"michael mann's best work ever","review":"omg, i love miami vice & i watched it so many times that i had to purchase it three times so far, beautiful action movie with romance, the romance between colin and gong li is so intese and so real,it's awesome with a sad ending, i enjoyed it soooooooooo much, i hope michael mann would make the sequel and i can't wait for it, god willing.it's a beautiful movie which i enjoy watching over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not play.","review":"Region 2 encoding: Will not play on most of the devices sold in the US or Canada [Region 1].

Unfortunately, the video quality of the Blu-Ray leaves much to be desired. Reviews on DVD Talk and other forums mention the presence of film \\"grain\\" during the darker scenes (night scenes etc.). Unfortunately, large portions of the film are \\"dark scenes\\". At it's worst, the video is simply unwatchable. I also own the DVD, and I find the DVD to be a more satisfying home movie experience. That aside, there are segments of the film which are free from the grainy background noise. These scenes offer a sharp picture with vivid color rendering. Too bad this doesn't hold true for the whole feature. The audio quality is about what you would expect from a Blu-Ray. Miami Vice is a great movie, but you should buy the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miami Vice","review":"Miami Vice was one of my favorite tv shows growing up. I remember watching my first episode of the show while on a family vacation in Florida--past midnight, everyone else asleep, room lit only by the tv set. The show was extremely dramatic and the scenery so amazing. And being in Florida myself for the first time made the show resonate that much more. Well last night I finally watched Miami Vice the movie. I was surprised to feel the same emotions that accompanied my first glimpse of the tv show more than 25 years ago. Everything about this movie is pitch perfect to me--the casting, the locations, the story, the camera's movements, the music, the cars, the boats, the planes, the guns, the clothes, everything. In fact, I keep replaying the final standoff with Yero. I love it when Tubbs starts that 645i and the engine rumble comes through my subwoofer accompanied by Nonpoint's remake of In the Air Tonight."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is better","review":"Yes, I know there wasn't a book, and that's my point. Even worse, this movie was based on a TV show and the TV show is much better! The TV series had a sexy style, color, music, and a pulsating rhythm under the surface holding it all together. This movie, even with all its sexy actors and big screen, couldn't hold a candle to it. The script and the plot, even the scene changes, were disjointed. The dialogue was juvenile, the characters predictable and stereotypical. I couldn't even enjoy this as an action film. And don't get me started on the lame romance which took up a major portion of the story. Come to think of it, maybe the romance was the best part of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film review by a Miami Vice TV fan","review":"Very dark print, hard to understand, poor acting, not believable story line"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"With a good cast and a big budget with a great locale, this one should have been a lot better.The music is good and the action scenes are well done but that's about it. The plot is okay but the dialogue is just horrible. Most of the characters seem content in just looking good and style is definitely emphasized over any substance. How does a vice cop afford a designer wardrobe anyway? And why do they cast a Chinese woman as a Cuban? Yes she is atractive but she also looks Chinese.Other than water, the Miami locale is mostly wasted. They do have land there also but they seem to miss that. Too much of this movie looks like they are posing for still shots. I'd only give it 1.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miami Vice","review":"First of all, please don't waste your money buying it. I'd wait till it hits cable. The movie was very dark, and nothing like the television show(that it was inspired from?).

Its hard to believe how bad this movie actually is. I cant honestly think of anything good to say about it - the movie itself was lacking on all counts and seemed like it would never end, the picture quality varied between poor and average (for a HD DVD) and the sound was no better than an average DVD.

There are no exciting (or even non-exciting) action sequences. The acting is terrible and the story is way overdrawn.In conclusion, if you want to see Michael Mann at his best, watch Heat.

Colin Farrell looked like a greasy bum and Jamie Foxx had no part at all. No action until the very end of the movie - I almost fell asleep half way through.

I honestly is worse than a bad crime B movie. First of all, it starts off with no explanation of what is happening, there is no character development, nor any legible plotline. The dialog is congested and uncomprehendable. You will feel as if someone threw you into the middle of a movie and left you with nothing but two actors that have no chemistry or longing to engage you.

Although, my beta machine no long works, thanks to DVD, I can watch the first two seasons over and over again until season three comes out.When I first heard of Miami Vice the movie, I was hoping that it would turn out to be another one of Michael Mann's classic stylish movie like the Thief, Heat and Collateral. But I walked out of the movie theater totally disappointed.While the TV series were built on Crockett and Tubb's partnership - season one's pilot episode, and their friendship - season one's \\"Evan\\" episode, the movie has none of that. There were absolutely no chemistry between the two stars. Instead of building on the two's relationship, Mann wasted half of the movie on Crockett's romantisizing Isabella.As for the gun battles, there was no comparisn to Heat's bank heist's sequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"I honestly don't know what to say...","review":"This was just awful. I'll give it two stars for Tubbs and Trudy. That's about it. Farrell, who is very much overrated in my opinion, needed a shower and some motivation to do a decent job acting, while Gong Li, who is normally intense and stunning, just looked bored. Problem is, I don't think it was their fault. This was a horrid script. It made no sense, there was no real chemistry between Farrell and Foxx or Farrell and Li (gee, is he the common denominator of badness for this film?).

The only innovative part of the whole movie was when Jamie Foxx flew in an Adam Air (is that correct?) very light airplane only feet behind another small airplane while working undercover to create the 'cloaking' effect and fool the radar screens in South Florida. Much of the rest of the movie wasn't innovative at all-like when Tubbs and this underworld criminal sneak into Cuba by boat (uh huh yeah right) and then hang out in a bar and order drinks with funny slang Spanish-language names. It doesn't even look like Cuba it looks like a cardboard prop! They spent $125 million making this? This movie lacks the thumping music from the TV show as well. When I say 'innovative' this movie was nowhere near as innovative as Michael Mann's 10 years earlier 'Heat'HeatHeat was truly a landmark movie the music and all.

Movies like miami vice are supposed to have a good plot, good acting, a decent amount of action and maybe a love scene hear and there. Miami vice failed in all categories. The movie is slow. It takes a really long time for any action to even occur. By time some action happened I was on my way to sleep. If you want to see a movie with great scene shots but is boring as hell this is the movie for you. Thank god for blockbuster on line because if I had paid for this movie I would be very upset.

Probably best described as a crime drama - BEAUTIFULLY shot. In my opinion, not liking this film means you probably don't get it or were expecting something else. Michael Manns' signiture is all over this, and his use of the new Viper HD camera is stunning. When i saw this in the theater, it was evident there were M.M. fans there - at the end of the film half the theater stood up and clapped! Check this out in HD if possible! Merry Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A must miss","review":"The theatrical version of \\"Miami Vice\\" was a huge disappointment. It lacks a coherent plot, and like its TV counterpart, it's all style (or wants to be) and very little substance. About the only thing going for it is the atmospheric cinematography. But with little to no plot, it's a hard one to sit through.The always stellar Jamie Foxx is completely wasted - he has little to do but act as back up for his hot headed partner (not a bad way to collect a multi-million dollar payout); the other detectives on the team have literally no screen time at all.I was expecting a lot more considering it was directed by Michael Mann. It wasn't even on par with a cheesy Jerry Bruckheimer film. I was shocked that two relatively good actors were reduced to this tripe - the acting was so stiff that Colin Farrell (who needed a shower desperately) makes Don Johnson look like a thespian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casting disappointment","review":"This movie contained alot of nice visual effects and the sound effects were pretty impressive. However, for some reason Gong Li who is Chinese played the role a Cuban woman who was the lead actress in the movie. It says alot about the Hollywood studios that they can't cast qualified Hispanics for leading roles even in movies that take place in or are about Latin America. This was a major setback to the film, it lacked believability, it was not genuine to me at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"To be honest, I was never much of a \\"Miami Vice\\" fan when it was on TV. Even as a teenager, it was apparent to me that it was trying way too hard and that, frankly, it was all pretty silly.Well, Michael Mann grew up and his characters put on socks. And in probably an inevitable move, he came back to \\"Miami Vice.\\" The film incarnation does not have much of a connection to the television series, for good or for ill, but more of a successor to \\"Heat,\\" \\"Ronin\\" and \\"Collateral,\\" with insanely gorgeous (digital video) cinematography is its biggest asset.Worth a watch for Michael Mann's modern film work. It'll probably just be frustrating for hardcore fans of the television show, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"rent from the library","review":"I have left very few reviews, despite purchasing many items through amazon, but I just had to put my two cents worth in regarding this dvd.

I tan and teach home tanning for a living, and I regularly meet folks who have used this book as their reference and failed to produce anything remotely like leather. There is nothing inaccurate about the information but their just isn't enough detail. Tanning is a fairly simple craft, but it is very tactile and precise. You need to know the details, the ins and outs.

After thoroughly cleaning the lenses, I used one of the wipes (a paper product, not cloth) on each of the lenses. The result was a white film left on the lenses that obscured visibility nearly as bad as the fogging problem. I cleaned the lenses with a microfiber cloth so that I could see reasonably well, but still had some visible streaks from the anti-fog application. When I went out and played tennis, the glasses fogged up just as bad as they ever had - so apparently removing the material so as to see clearly negated the fog prevention. I would rate this product as completely useless.

The result is louder almost heavier version. The album version is also on this single.The live tracks apart from the small amount of feedback and Todd Whitener trying to sing over the top of travis on many occassions, are very good.

Plus the band does not come apart without me having to take a pair of scissors and cut the band. There is no clip-type fastener.

About a decade later, the novelty started wearing off; and I ended up selling it. Today, I only downloaded two songs on my iTunes player--\\"Losing My Mind\\" and \\"If There Was Love\\". The rest of the album is now completely forgettable, including the ear-achingly remake of \\"Love Pains\\", which should have included a fade-out at the end of the track; \\"Don't Drop Bombs\\", one of the stupidest titles for a song; and the closer, \\"I Just Can't Say Goodnight\\", which sounds like a reject from the \\"Three's Company\\" soundtrack. This is positive proof that Liza Minnelli's experiment with pop music went haywire--and no amount of help from the Pet Shop Boys could avert this catastrophe. \\"Results\\" is even more dated than when Epic first issued this disc--in 1989!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SHOWGIRLS OF MUSIC!","review":"The ultimate camp CD!

We also suggest buying the 'sister' album , Cher's 'Believe' and hitting the random button on your CD player.One cannot help but envisioning Neil and Chris (PSB) in the control room rolling with laughter as she did her vocals to some of their best 'A' and 'B-sides'.Even the picture on the back of the cd (her walking across a rainy street, wearing only a coat with an expression that clearly indicates she's under the influence) makes this experience worth the $10.

It was in the fall of 1989, at Badlands bar in DuPont Circle in Washington, D.C. Hard to believe it has now been 15 years since then, but even now, this album sounds as fresh as it did when I first picked up a copy. The vocals and production of this CD are excellent. The lyrics and emotion that Liza issues forth on these songs are moving.I have often been saddened by the fact that Liza never followed up this CD with another Pet Shop Boys project. She certainly has the following to justify the effort--and I know her vocals are still very strong. In any case, at least we do have this timeless jewel."},{"rating":"2","title":"euro-pop outing","review":"This is a great euro-pop record produced by pop-masters the Pet Shop Boys.

That's what makes his songs so awesome. If you're expecting a standard rock group, Dave isn't for you, but if you're at all open to listening to music other than metal or classic rock, this song will turn you into an instant convert.If you're a skeptic who doesn't understand exactly why Dave is so popular, just listen to this song and you'll understand. This is pop rock at its BEST.If you're one of those people who've heard alot of Dave and don't think it can get much better, listen to this song. In my opinion it is the best upbeat song he's ever written. After the first half, it gets repetitive, but the first half is AMAZING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller is Better","review":"Thomas Toch has proven that precious things come in small packages. I agree with the author that big high schools have lost the personal touch that is needed to build relationships with students.

I recommend this book to any educator looking for a simple and concise answer to the complicated and vastly over sized American public high school systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent description of the small schools movement","review":"This book is an excellent read for those who desire to learn of 'case studies' of secondary schools that are changing in a positive way the school systems of our country.

Also discussed is the mindset change that must take place to make them successful. An excellent resource for those desiring to learn more about the 'small schools' movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes the case for small schools!","review":"Thomas Toch provides several examples of successful small schools in this book. In each chapter, he provides the details about a relatively new small school. Each school has a different and interesting approach. It was amazing to read about the positive effects that the small school environment has on students. The book demonstrates that it is possible to create small schools without major restructuring and a great deal of additional funding.The book is an easy and enjoyable read. With each school's story, Toch makes a very compelling case for small schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light Reading on a Very Heavy Subject","review":"I started out with high hopes for Toch's tale of five \\"small school\\" high schools attempting to break out of the mold of the traditional, comprehensive factory model high school. Toch's goal is to show how these schools have been organized, the challenges they faced, and still face, and the issue of whether the small schools are working for students, supposedly all students. Toch's accounts, however,are filled with unnecessary comments regarding the dress of students in the schools, and judgements on Urban students that make the reader wonder what his actual goal for the book was. More importantly, Toch's studies are seriously lacking in an analysis of the academic impact the schools are having on student achievement.This book is an easy read, with short choppy sentences, but if you are looking for a book that will help you better understand what small schools have to offer, this is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia!","review":"I had this album when I was in college...it was misplaced over the years.

Even if you aren't into military or techno thrillers, you may be surprised how enjoyable a read this is. You come away giving a big salute to the pure cojones of the Israeli air force.Technical glitches and a few misc. gaffes cost it a star, but if you aren't a fussbudget, you may not even notice or care."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised","review":"On a recommendation I purchased \\"Raid on the Sun\\". I like politics but am not inclined toward military histories.I could not put the book down. The author handles all the political and diplomatic issues and contexts with ease and authority. His handling of the personalities of the pilots involved made them each interesting, not the least the \\"nicest guy\\", Ilan Ramon, who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster years later.I was surprised how much I enjoyed the recounting of the air raid itself. The author made this this military affair an exciting and suspenseful story, and all the technological issues were easy to understand while being comprehensive at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good nonfiction historical work","review":"Claire tells this story with a minimum of techno-jargon even though there is page after page of information on airplanes and nuclear reactors. Actually the book seems to be written on newspaper reading level (8th grade-ish) so it's an easy, (although VERY gripping) read. Once you get started its difficult to put the book down because you get involved with the personalities (just like you would with a good work of fiction), and you are eager to know what's going to happen to them. It's a story of fighter pilots, politicians, anxious wives, nuclear scientists, spies, saboteurs and one ruthless dictator eager to get his hands on weapons-grade plutonium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Military Tale","review":"Raid On The Sun is an amazing account on a successful military mission to destroy a nuclear reactor in Iraq.

The author does a most incredible job of relating this tale to the reader, it really touches you. You can feel for the people. I recomend this book to literally everyone. No matter who you are you will find something enjoyable in this novel.

The writing is inelegant and marred by cliches and grammatical and factual errors, and the much-touted access the author had to previosuly classified records and personnel appears to have been wasted, since Claire doesn't tell us anything (except the real names of the pilots) that McKinnon didn't tell us 15 years ago. Indeed, in many stretches the writing is suspiciously close to a verbatim copy of McKinnon's text, notwithstanding Claire's supposed access to sources McKinnon didn't have. Lucky for Claire, the underlying true story is so riveting that the flaws of the book can to some extent be overlooked, but it's a shame the author didn't make more of a truly incredible tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not mention G-d ?","review":"This book deserves 5 HUGE STARS but why isn't there a mention of G-d ?

I am not a real fast reader, but I went through this book in three nights. I thought the author told a good story, but he lacked some of the technical knowledge some of the aviator types like myself notice. There were also quite a few errors about the IAF and some of the players. One example is that Iftach Spector is the top IAF ace with 15 kills and all of his kills were during the Yom Kippur War. No question that Iftach Spector is one of the great IAF pilots, but the top IAF ace and world record hold is Giora Even with 17 kills.\\"Raid On The Sun\\" is a very good read although Dan McKinnon's earlier book \\"Bullseye One Reactor\\" was much better on the technical issues based on his experience as a former Naval Aviatior...not USAF pilot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of technical \\"howlers\\"","review":"I am giving this book two stars because it is an interesting and compelling story. But the technical errors are far too many and too serious to allow me to recommend it to anyone with a technical background. Some examples: (1) neutrons emitted from a fissioning nucleus at the speed of light (only massless particles can go the speed of light) and (2) US F-16's carrying Stinger missiles (they carry air-to-air Sidewinders not shoulder-fired Stingers). The author does not understand the simplest physics of nuclear reactors or weapons even though he could have gotten the information easily from Richard Rhodes \\"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\\". Since the author got so many things wrong that would have been easy to find out, I have to wonder how many other kinds of errors were made that I didn't catch."},{"rating":"2","title":"An very interesting account of the bomibing","review":"The book is obviously not written to being a detailed study of the raid but more in the type of one of those many instant histories that comes out. So it's very similar to a novel. Some of the facts are wrong as several reviewers have pointed out and some of the sources used e.g. Victor Ostrovsky are very dubious indeed.However it's the best study that I have seen on the actual bombing. From it you can get some of the feel what its must have been like to those that participated too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Freshman Release","review":"Holland Nix, a Nashville artist, does not fit into any cookie-cutter musician stereotype. Earthy voice, earthy look, pure style... This CD is a stripped-down production in the sense that it's not over-produced as so many rock/pop projects are today. Holland's vocal delivery is honest - you will find yourself listening to the lyrics, as you should, instead of having them get lost in the over-use of a lead guitar. My favorite cut is the Airplane Song. I travel a lot and it's hilarious how she expresses every traveler's lament. Don't buy this record if you're looking for a shiny record label symbol of \\"music\\".

First of all, the story was completely predictable without a single surprise, not one. But there is a deeper problem, and that derives from some of Friedman's writing mannerisms. He uses adjectives and pronouns in a cloying, irritating way, to wit: The upperclassman (meaning Kirk) and his companion (meaning Gary Mitchell) did this or that, and Kirk's friend (meaning Mitchell) alerted his comrade (meaning Kirk) etc. etc. I did not know quite how to characterize this writing style, except to say that I found it to be annoying and distracting from the story. And candidly, there is not much of a story here, or in Friedman's other books about Kirk and Mitchell.I know that Friedman has a following, and that's fine.

Logan and Rachel were like that. After so many years of harboring feelings for someone it's rare that second chances are given. These two were thrust into each other and they really didn't wish to be but some things are simply undeniable. The secrets of the past will bind their future and connect them with a passion that was hot. It's easy to fall back in love when you never fell out. Again, I say that parents should take a more hands off approach to their children's love lives. It would make things so much simpler and less pain would be spread.Francis Ray did it again with this book.

There is no denying the MUSIC is fantastic as usual- what you'd expect from Night Ranger. It's also true that Gary Moon has a good voice if you're into the whole Axel Rose/Stephen Percy/Mark Slaughter sound. But the two together- not so good. The way the recording was mixed was odd too. A couple of the songs have the music overpowering the singer, which doesn't help. Best songs? \\"Feeding of the Mojo\\" and \\"Do You Feel Like I Do / Tomorrow Never Knows\\".

No","review":"I am afraid I must be the lone dissenter in the review of this particular adventure. First, on the good side. The traps and challenges presented in this module are very creative. They would challenge even some of the most experienced and paranoid players out there. As with the classic Tomb of Horrors, there are a myriad number of ways to die if the party is not constantly on its toes.The problem comes when the adventure is over. IN MY OPINION, the characters do not have much to show for things when all is said and done. On a risk-reward type of basis, the risks for outstrip the rewards the characters receive, especially when dealing with the lowest level of the dungeon.With some retooling, the adventure could work, but as it stands, it was a bit disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahhhh....

Understand that this book is nearly 10 years old and focuses on a business model that is near extinct.When this book was first printed in 1996 it would have been considered a basic \\"seminar in a book\\" about selling and establishing income from nature photography. While the book does have some timeless information on common sense, it for the most part is archaic in content.There are many fans of John Shaw out there but when it comes to buying a book and expecting content that I can use, my own expectations are to get the product as advertised.If you want a John Shaw book on nature photography, stick to his other publications.

I was reluctant to even look at this book, since the word \\"beginner\\" was in the title, but given that there are few BizTalk books out there, I gave it a shot. I was very impressed by the depth of content, going much deeper and with much more explanation than the MS docs. If you're a newbie (or even intermediate) to BizTalk, definitely consider this book. It will help you not only to get started up and running, but it will give you a solid foundation as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to BizTalk","review":"This book provides a great introduction to BizTalk.

He attributes a unity and aggressive purpose to a haphazard series of Germanic migrations, that is simply not borne out by the evidence presented. Indeed, his accusations against the English people border on racism. He misses the point that the British imperial drive has its roots in Norman, not Saxon history; the record of the Normans in the Mediterranean and the Holy Land are evidence enough of this. It is a shame that such a potentially important book should be ruined by predjudice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I'm not a metalhead","review":"My friend recorded this onto a cassette when I was 17 and I thought it was ok. I used to love the vocalist's singing style. I found it in a record shop on vinyl and bought it just to see if my memory of the album (as really good) was correct. I must say that the vocals are quite laughable - lots of vibrato and falsetto. The guy can sing in parts, I guess. The guitar is technically proficient but strangely lacking. I can take it or leave it (in fact I have left it in my mother in law's attic) - along with much of the rest of the 'true metal' of the 80s. Anyway, being a metalhead is myopic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanctuary : \\"Into The Mirror Black\\"","review":"I can't understand why this release is so overlooked. \\"Into The Mirror Black\\" has to be one of the best Heavy Metal releases of 1990....This is much more mature than \\"Refuge Denied\\". It's also much easier to listen to. The guitar soloing here is incredible, and the songs are pure Metal at it's best. It's better organized than RD, and the sound is more on the lines of \\"Nevermore\\"....This release must not be overlooked. If your interested in something new, or something that you may have missed out on in the 90's, Sanctuary's \\"Into The Mirror Black\\" is certainly a release you should check out....It's without question Sanctuary's finest hour...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Attractive","review":"This hoodie is missing a zipper cover so it looks wierd as the zipper is clearly visible on the front of the hoddie, making it look cheap.

I ended up not keeping the camera and bought a Sony CyberShot DSC-W290. I was worried that it wouldn't fit, but it fits perfectly. The inside of the case is a suede-like material in pink. The bottom and sides are a nylon material and the top is black leather. It also comes with a black leather wrist strap. It has a magnetic closure which is very easy to use. There are three little pockets inside for storing a memory card. A great little case for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a good case.","review":"I liked this case since I ordered it. I was actually a little scared that it may not fit my Nikon Coolpix s630. It fit perfectly! The only thing that I didn't like is that it fits so perfect that there is no way to use the inside pockets that it has for a memory card or battery.

Since then, its been tough to keep the earbud in my ear without the foam piece.I decided to buy the EarBoom as a replacement. Bad mistake. In addition to not staying in my ear, the intonation is tinny at best. The only reason I gave this product even 2 stars was that it had a foam piece on the microphone portion of the EarBoom which I have placed on my Nokia earbud. Small retribution but worth a couple of stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clickity Clack don't buy that","review":"I have tried 2 different Jabra Earbooms.

Her credentials as a Woolfian scholar are further strengthened by the high quality of this work which offers much more than a conventional commentary on Woolf's major fiction. By juxtaposing texts against each other and exploring the psychology of Woolf's characters with fresh and uncustomary insight, she offers the reader a stimulating work which is full of arresting and thought-provoking ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy pop from an underrated band.","review":"A part of the reason I followed my love of music to the southeast.

Skip part 4","review":"I agree with the prior reviewers regarding the unfortunate track 4, the Sermon. It is unacceptably pretentious. It reminds me of Leonard Bernstein, with all his great compositions, laying a real egg with his Kaddish Symphony. Hubris. Those of us who love music -- and I love all kinds, from Bach to George Thorogood -- expect music, not preaching to. Stick to what you do that you do well.

The first three songs (particularly the title track) are well-executed and almost burning with intensity. However, the CD is plagued by a long, drawn-out, totally unnecessary sermon on the fourth track that completely destroys the mood you built up to that point. The final song is also not crisply executed and is not really an appropriate closer for the album.As much as I like Wynton Marsalis, I cannot recommend this album. If you do buy it, then buy it for the title track alone. Otherwise, \\"Black Codes\\" or \\"Levee Low Moan\\" would be a much better buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read these other reviews...","review":"...before I bought this disc. Tracks 1, 2, 3, and 5 are all prime Wynton, but that sermon absolutely wrecks this album for me. Even the value of the other pieces can't overcome the puerile delivery of that campy melodrama. There are a lot of great Marsalis discs out there...start with BIG TRAIN, for instance. Leave this one alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The SERMON is alchemy","review":"The sermon is amazing and inspirational. It speaks eloquently of what any musician or artist know to be true. Either you get it or you don't..it's just that simple.The sermon should be played in every music class in every school in this country. REPEATEDLY- until the message begins to get through that music- and the creation of it- IS and always will be a gift.

I was extremely disappointed by the content of this book.Not only is the book very short on information in several key areas, it also lacks any significant coverage of exam essentials like clients. The small overview given of clients is not enough to prepare someone for the exam.As if the lack of essentials wasn't enough, the book is incorrect in at least one exam question! In a question regarding trust levels, this book is in direct conflict with Microsoft's own Exchange Server 5.5 book. That was in the Chapter 2 exam.

One would expect an instrumental cd from Neal, and that is what I was hoping for with this cd, but it's not what I got. I was very pleased. Neal plays the guitar with a firery passion, that would take a great vocalist to match him, and not to be overshadowed by him. Neal for the most part Neal's vocals are overshadowed, but not consumed by his playing. And for some reason this only adds to the music.Late Nite and Softly are the outstanding tracks on this cd, and the rest are not far behind.

Neal's blues roots REALLY come out in \\"Rain's Coming Down\\" and \\"Late Nite\\". \\"Inner Circles\\" and \\"I'll Cover You\\" are excellent songs that just make you want to dance.

Many of the patterns, with a little adjustment, can be made into a plush doll. The book did have a very nice weaving technique, though.Also, the 'spiritual excersizes' leave a lot to be desired.

Even Though no songs are written by the band they are all great songs.Beki Bondage puts a good twist on all the songs. I enjoyed their version of Cold Turkey and Hell Raiser. Beki Bondage is a good band they are very skillful in how they play. I like the way the collection of songs gel togeather.

After getting disappointed by Alien Ant Farm's new realease ANThology, I decided to go out an get Pressure 4-5's CD. I usually dont get CDs that I have only heard one song from but this was an exception and I am so glad that I got it. The CD has everything from fast-paced rock with heavy guitar riffs to slow, melodic beats. Overall this is a great CD and I am looking forward to listening to them in the future. So get this CD as soon as possible, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"IRONIC?","review":"Sounds like every other cd that a teenager would have: you can tell these guys don't really care about their music by seeing that they all have pretty boy pics.

They're better but I still don't care for either of this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic Garbage!","review":"DONT BUY IT. Some of the songs are not that bad, but trust me...you will not be glad you bought this album. The songs are all boring and depressing and really...pointless. This is just the same boring, depressing, nu metal garbage [I.E. Drowning Pool] and you will be sick of it before you finish listening to the cd.This cd would be much better if it was a little heaver, more music, and less singing. The thing that mostly gets me down about this band is the lead singer, he goes a overboard with his type of singing. His low, depressed, MONOTONE DRONING ruines the music and makes you want to kill yourself on some of the tracks. I think if he screamed a little more and changed his voice more often instead of having the same level voice all the time, the album would be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars for 2 Good songs....","review":"Pressure 4-5 is just another Nu-Metal band trying to get popular with the kiddies. At least they don't rap like most nu-metal which I Completely dispise. I heard \\"Beat the world\\" On the radio, of course, and also saw it on MTV2 a few times. Well, I thought it would be great, Beat the World is a good song, but the rest of the CD is just terrible, Its only like 35 minutes long, all the songs sound the same, they are boring, uninteresting, redundant, and badly written. Sometimes the lyrics don't make any sense whatsoever. \\"Into Yesterday\\" Is the other song i liked. Just download those 2 songs off Morpheus or winMX and you have the cd, because the rest is filler. If you are looking for some good music that is similar to this, check out Cold - 13 Ways to bleed on stage, Staind - Dysfunction, and Taproot - Gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"They have a long way to come","review":"I was excited about the release of Pressure 4-5's debut album. Everyone was comparing them to the likes of Incubus and I thought \\"Great, a new band that isn't horrible,\\" and believe me, P4-5 is FAR from horrible, but they just aren't much to write home about. The vocals are probably the thing that killed it for me. The guy's voice is so dry and monotone and he sounds the same in every song. It gets very tiresome after 4 or 5 songs... The music on here is pretty good sounding, the band has talent, and you can tell, but that vocalist, I swear... Overall, this is the better side of all the nu-metal debuts this year, but they have a long way to come and a lot of practicing in their future."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Perspective","review":"After reading several books of this genre, this was the first one that I actually felt had any direct relevance to my life. For me, the words themselves do not do the healing, but rather provide a focal point for reflection which has given me a fantastic new perspective on the events in my life so far. The book does not preach, but still shows the reader how they can open themselves up to the world around them. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A source of healing for anyone","review":"This book is a godsend for anyone dealing with life's tougher issues (or knows someone who is).

The good thing is she pulls it off...and well. The only reason im not giving this 5 stars is that i know some people do not like rap and this single features Krayzie Bone....i like it but if u hate rap you probably wont like the song as much. All in all this single seems to be a good preview to what Tiffanys doing now in the 21st century....on her new CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real treat by Tiffany","review":"What I loved most about Tiffany was not her bubblegum pop, her cheesy hand motions, or her denim jacket.... it was her voice. It has this cool raw quality to it that gives me goosebumps. I can listen to her for hours. She can relay emotion without the vocal gymnastics of some other singers (Christina, Mariah - are you listening?) The whole CD, \\"The Color of Silence\\" is excellent. It's one of those CD's that you can listen to from beginning to end without skipping any tracks. The style of her music has definitely changed but I don't think a 14 year old really has their own style. I think at that time she sang what was given to her. This seems like it's coming from the heart. There is some really good stuff here, and it would be a shame if it doesn't get the credit it deserves. But I guess if it can affect even one person then it's a job well done. I can't wait to see what's next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful WW I novel fought in the minds of the combattants","review":"This first novel of a trilogy of World War I is the most powerful although it was the last one, Ghost Road, which won the prestigious Booker Prize.The setting is a hospital in England for those recovering from shell shock. The protagonists are a psychiatrist and his patient who is opposed to the endless slaughter of the war. Clearly to \\"cure\\" the patient, to find him sane, is to send him to his probable death.The entire novel takes place within the hospital yet the horror of this war is omnipresent, the images sharp and overwhelmingly strong and sad. It is an amazing book because of the author's ability to portray the horror of war without being in the battlefield and the permanent scars left on the psyche.Interestingly this novel has been built on the foundation of meetings between real people. I found this book irresitible and memorable, and immediately read the rest of the trilogy, but it is this one that is haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A UNIQUE INSIGHT TO WAR!","review":"What a unique look at the lives of the first world war soldier. I found myself totally engrossed in the rehabilitation of the men in this book. It questions the whole idea of what it was to be a man in this period. With shocking flashbacks to the reality of the trenches we are made aware of how horrific the conditions of the war were. Barker intertwines facts with fiction in a way I have never seen before. We find ourselves questioning whether Pat Barker was even there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book came highly recommended by a source I respect, so I was surprised to find it boring. I would have been better off reading a biography of Siegfried Sassoon, and something on treatment for shell shock in WWI. The most interesting character for me was Rivers, but by the end of the book I still knew little about him. Most unsatisfactory, I had little interest in finishing this book and certainly won't be bothering with the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it","review":"I really expected to enjoy this but I found it heavy going. Of course the subject is tough but I usually enjoy historical novels, particularly when you discover more about the consequences of major events on people. I found the book difficult to keep up with and I didn't gain any attachment to the characters. Whilst I did gain some knowledge on psychology, I was disappointed by the apparent conclusion of the book, but maybe I missed something. This, of course may say more about me than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"I did not think anything could match Birdsong but this did. So much so that I went on immediately to complete the trilogy. Some parts were not easy reading but throughout it was authentic and utterly compelling. These are books that will remain in the memory for ever while many others fade."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book of the trilogy","review":"Readers who want a fictionalization of Paul Fussell's \\"The Great War and Modern Memory\\" should look no further. This slender novel captures the essential cultural impact of World War I--the destruction of sincere discourse. Barker's economical style is ideally suited to the material, although at times I wished she would probe her characters a bit further. While her reticence is fatal to the other two books in the trilogy, it works here, perhaps because Rivers is such a wonderful, complex personality. A haunting experience, and worth every bit of the discomfort it causes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poets, Patients and Psycological illness.","review":"Pat Barker's booker prize winning book made for excellent reading with an in depth but readable story of mental health. With some intriguing looks into the decisions the army made, during the first world war, regarding mental health and it's treatment. This book provides a gripping look at a place where the real world meets the imagained and the people on the borderline of both. All in all, a great read, one which will make you want to read the sequels and learn what happens to all the carachters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regeration touches on interesting issues but has many faults","review":"Regeneration on the whole is not what I would call a great book. It touches quickly on some interesting issues but only deals and looks at them fleetingly. As well, it keeps on trying to drive home cliched and over done points such as \\"war has a great cost to society\\". It is confusing to read as it switches constantly between characters without giving you any idea that it has switched. Much of the book leaves you wondering what the point of any of it is. There is no real plot, no real thrust to any of it. You don't really care too much for any of the characters. The whole thing left me rather cold. If it was more coherent I would be much more pleased with it. As well, the book annoyingly blurs the line between fact and fiction, so you are left with the belief you have read something based on fact, but it is hard to discern what is factual and what is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdly Overrated Fluff","review":"Absurdly overrated, and I am wondering what kind of bigwig muckety-muck connections Ms. Barker has in the publishing industry which allows for such mediocre material to receive such propagandistic hooplah.It is written adequately enough for a psychological novel, sure; however, as a chronicle of WAR it fails miserably: there is precious little of the dirt and grit of war, just a lot of fluff from someone who has obviously never experienced it first hand. Barker should stick to something she knows, something she's actually experienced. She gives the reader so little concrete detail here: One or two pages of \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" by Orwell, or \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" by Hemingway, are worth far more than this entire light-weight book in providing the reader with a real glimpse into war and a soldier's thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality was better","review":"Sorry, but I can't see what this superficial fictional treatment added to the already rich mix of Sassoon's own (internally inconsistent, or just honestly perspectivist?) memoirs and Max Egremont's probing, nuanced telling in his biography of Sassoon. The sharpness and humanity of Egremont's insights make this novel seem banal by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely overrated","review":"I was so looking forward to this read, and equally disappointed. The male characters (with one notable exception) don't seem to live and breathe, and are a sketchy set of characteristics and tics. The one exception (and not a surprise, considering the author's former work) is a working class Northern woman involved with one of the main characters. Since the characters are not particularly involving and the milieu and era is not brought vividly to life, the book reads as a schematic, rather than a flesh-and-blood, fully realized work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Well, looks as if I'm a lone wolf concerning these books, and now I know why I had never heard of Pat Barker. I read about a book a week and I am so upset that I wasted my time on these. If you're looking for literature that gives you some insight about World War I, you shouldn't waste your time and money either. There is so much worthwhile literature out there. I must say that a lot of times I am quite disappointed in Booker Prize winners. ((What were they thinking?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"Despite being a long-time reader of several WWI poets (Owen, Brooke, Sassoon, etc.), I only got around to reading this book last summer (2004). I found it an excellent interpretation of the times and people. I think that the issues raised in the work are timeless, as apt today as yesterday. Moreover, (risking some sense of gender neutrality) the book is hauntingly in tune with \\"maleness,\\" coming, as it were, from a female author. In other words, this is a perceptive work, underrated despite any of the stars I might give it. This is a book of interest to the casual reader and the scholar alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"A monstrous journey through the insanity of War.","review":"As a combat veteran, it is rare that a written page will haunt me so. Pat Barker's \\"Regeneration\\"(the entire trilogy for that matter)does just that. Not since reading \\"Johnny Got His Gun\\" had I been thrust once again so vividly--into the horrors of war. As in war, the only redemptive aspects of Barker's book, lie in the complex and profound interaction of it's characters. As bravery and insanity abound; horror and tenderness will confront you all at once. A must read for those who wish to be sickened and inspired simultaneously. A truly extraordinary and insightful work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regeneration","review":"By MollieI thought this book was really good. I got attached to the characters and I wanted to read more about them and what happened to them!I thought that Dr. Rivers was an especially interesting character, and it was my favorite part of the book, reading about all of his changes. As we discussed in class today, the book is about Seigfried Sassoon but you can observe monumental changes in Rivers. As he tries to rehabilitate his patients, he learns things from them and through them, changes himself.I also liked that pat barker brought up the subject of bonds between men during the war, and all the men that realized that war wasn't really a manly experience, they actually ended up gaining more feminine qualities, nurturing and taking care of each other, and the other psychological effects of the war that you wouldn't normally think about.I definitely recommend this book and I want to read the rest of the trilogy.By Mollie Little"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This was one of the best I've read. Its light, easy reading and impossible to put down. Yet raises many questions. well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of appreciation","review":"I read Birdsong and was stunned. WW1 came alive for me and the sheer scope of the tragedy. I couldn't wait for Pat Barker's book - WHAT A LET DOWN! I have given 2 stars because it is reasonably written, but she brings none of Faulks intrinsic understanding of the male condition under such circumstances. All in all she lacks an appreciation of what was happening at a human level. Good try, but not well done; and the trilogy won a booker?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I really disliked this book. It made some interesting points about therapy and war, but in general I did not love reading it. It was however, an easy read and i needed it for a class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding.","review":"This is a terrific book. One of the best novels I have read in years, it contains wonderful writing, superb character studies, and addresses moral questions of great importance. While this book will be read and enjoyed by everyone, it has some special interest for physicians (like me). This book contains the best deciption of the complexities of the doctor-patient relationship I have ever encountered and uses the special nature of this relationship to highlight the moral dilemma inherent in balancing the claims of the state with that of individuals. Readers should be aware that the central metaphor of the book, regeneration, is drawn from a famous experiment in clinical neuroscience, performed by one of the protagonists of this novel.I also recommend very strongly the other books in Pat Barker's WWI trilogy, especially the concluding book, The Ghost Road. The concluding section of The Ghost Road is a tour de force of remarkable power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regeneration gives new life to WWI era strorys","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by regeneration. What I thought would be another \\"war book\\" turned out to have heart, as well as an interesting story line. Tired of the romanticizing of war that often goes along with these depictions of World War I, I loved the way the different patients' gruesome stories of war weaved together. I was most intrigued by Dr. Rivers and his fear that the emotionally painful work he is doing with his patients will not pay off in the end but will have caused more damage to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"by Jessica Chang","review":"I found Regeneration to be an extremely enjoyable book and i highly recommend it. Pat Barker does a wonderful job tying together bits of history with fictional characters to form a piece of historical fiction surrounding Dr. River's experiences at Craiglockhart. It was particularly interesting to see what was considered to be mentally unstable in the early 1900s - such as homosexuality or opposing war. Barker's use of Yaelland's treatment for Callan served as a great contrast to River's treatment for Prior, letting the reader know that not all doctors were as considerate or personal as Rivers. In the end River's interestingly finds that not only has he influenced his patients but the patients have changed his ways of thinking as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is about the remaster, not the songs","review":"i always want Dan's records in the best sound possible & this is an excellent album so i bought this, but unfortunately i was blown away in a negative way by the loudness of the remastering. this is a case of where the remastering is too loud.what's special about Dan's music is it's melodious & soulfulness, but on this remaster, it becomes Metallica in a bad way.i played the original cd to compare & the music there is natural, clear, warm & pleasant. i also compared the remastering from the Portrait box set & there the remastering was done well, an improvement, but not hammering loud.

It's not as hard and as pure punk as their previous CDs, it has a poppier sound to it.

The main upset was that I couldn't just bring them on the desktop and surf the internet or do work in the word prcessor with the dog(s). Plus, there were numerous bugs such as missing costumes and the fact that my dog refused to drink out of the water bowl. All he would do is carry it in his mouth and bark. Another thing, they say that when your female gets pregnant, which did happen, she would get fat and less hungry and lazy. Although my Bulldog napped and didn't eat as much she stayed as thin as ever. I also had problems with the puppy ageing.

Maybe I feel this way because I have a really puppy that I love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"It's pretty exciting the first few MINUTES you get it, but after a quick few minutes it gets very boring. One major problem with video games it that they get boring. Be sure to get one that actaully has you wanting you to get back on and continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disappointing.","review":"dogz 4 is an overpriced, useless product, which should be taken off the store shelves. myself, i love the other programs (petz 3 in particular), so when the new ones came out i was expecting more. much more. the graphics are messy, the voice recognition works like jack, you end up being stuck with all these things you don't need, and they OBVIOUSLY did not spend enough time in it's building. if there was such as thing as 1/2 a star, that would be my rating. if you really want a virtual petz program, wait for the rumored \\"petz 2000\\" or just buy petz 3. don't waste your money on this crap. it's not worth it AT ALL."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Cool is Dogz","review":"I love the game Dogz! I bought it with my own money that I got for my birthday. I can't have a real dog, so this is cool! I love the Mutts and the Great Danes. It is also cool cuz you can dress your pets up and take them to exotic places. ....I am a 4th grader, so maybe that is why I think it is fun. If you are older, it might be boring. But I love it, and so do 30 yr old. people. I reccomend that you buy Dogz 4, and try it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good game.","review":"Dogz4 is a good game even though Dogz3 is just as good. Each of the puppies has its own personality, and even if you do get bored with it you can always just adopt new puppies. I think the Arabian scenes and stuff were kind of dumb but I liked how you could put whatever you wanted in your rooms. P.S. The voice thing doesn't work unless you try for a loooooong time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Policy Roadmap - timely, succinct, on point.","review":"In this comprehensive, yet succinct book, Tom White, former Secretary of the Army and a retired General lays out a clear roadmap for rebuilding Iraq. It is timely, and there is no doubt that it's release has sent waves throughout the Department of Defense, and inner circles of Bush's policy makers.While most people will be aware that White clashed with Defense Secretary Rumsfeld on several policy matters, there is no doubt he has an elightening perspective into the strengths and weaknesses of the DOD Iraq policy to date. Furthermore, his expertise in the field of energy and infrastructure only bolster the validity of his claims, that the Pentagon underestimated the investment and resources required to rebuild a post-war Iraq.Hopefully, folks inside the beltway will invest a little time to read this quick study on what it will take to bring this state back to economic self-sufficency in a post Hussein world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for getting started","review":"Let me start by saying that before I got this book I already knew a bit about drifting and how it works but this book is a great help with terminology and visualization of maneuvers. Don't expect that you will read this book and just be able to go drift right away but the book does give you some ideas on how to get started. Great place to start if you are looking to learn a bit about what drifting, the culture, or what car to buy to get started."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"Not worth buying if you are trying to drift. Does give some information but no unique advice that can't easily be found elsewhere. It also says that the ae86 corolla has independent rear suspension, which is wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very different Rankin","review":"Very enthralling and captivating story by a great author. This reading was many years after pubication but it hasn't lost its appeal with the passage of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witch","review":"I read all the reviews before buying the book so am somewhat taken aback by my reaction during my reading. I'm an avid reader and enjoy Ian rankin but frankly this is a flat, boring read for me. I'll finish it but it's hard going. All the characters bar none are totally uninteresting and the word and action play between Doyle and Greenleaf just plan silly and irritating. It's hard to believe this book and the Rebus and Malcolm Fox books were written by the same person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Fun","review":"Hilarious! This is one of the best books for Children and Adults alike as it manages to entertain on many levels.There is a great mixture of new and more traditional stories which I never got bored of reading.Favourites include \\"The Stowaways\\" and \\"Handsel and Gristel\\" as well as \\"The Guest who ran away\\".It doesn't matter where you open the book, you can always find something to amuse you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrrrrinnnnnnngggg!!!!!","review":"Hi well to start this book stinks!! I thought I was gong to like it but I really didn't. This book is boring, dull, And all the other words that mean the same thing. I didn't finish it cause it was so boring. But I did like the stowaways. Overall this book is boring I really didn't like it if you want a real laugh read more funny stories well gotta go hope this was helpful Brooke."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"On 3 different Macs initial backups failed with 10s of thousands of errors. Tried different drives. Networked or not networked. Returned 2 firewire drives thinking they were the problem. Not.If you buy this make sure you test it out thoroughly before your 30 days are up. After wasting days of my time trying to work these problems I called tech support, on the 41st day. For $70 they would have helped me. I declined.I used this software 10 or 12 years ago and loved it. Times have changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Semi happy","review":"Product arrived in good condition, within a week the legs all broke off of the spider. So not very good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Editorial/Book Info correction","review":"Comprehensive, detailed monograph for the student, professional, etc.Note: Book Info above states \\"CD-ROM included\\" but mine did not come with one, there is no referral within the book to a CD, and standard bibliographic descriptions (WorldCat, Lib. of Congress) do not include any reference to a CD. I think the Book Info statement is incorrect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinpocetine can cause depression by depleting dopamine and other neurotransmitters","review":"Vinpocetine inhibits IKK preventing I'B degradation and the following translocation of NF-'B to the cell nucleus. Increases in neuronal levels of DOPAC, a metabolic breakdown product of dopamine, have been shown to occur in striatal isolated nerve endings as a result of exposure to vinpocetine.Such an effect is consistent with the biogenic pharmacology of reserpine, a structural relative of vinpocetine, which depletes catecholamine levels and causes depression as a side effect of the cardiovascular and anti-psychotic effects.[15] However, this effect tends to be reversible upon cessation of Vinpocetine administration, with full remission typically occurring within 3-4 weeks.Anecdotal evidence confirms this dopmaine depletion leading to low energy, difficulty focusing, loss of drive, ambition, etc.I would try gingko or rhodiola for memory or brain enhancement.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical musical documents!","review":"The legendary and authoritative baton of Fritz Reiner and the superb musicality and twinkling pianism of Rudolf Serkin joined the best of themselves to produce one of the most striking and incandescent versions ever made in the story of the disc.This Brahms reading is simply epic loaded with virility and dramatism.The Hungarian Rhapsodies don't find a close contender in the market. Precision. histamine, accuracy without a simple drop of nostalgy, loaded of paganism and exultant mood.I recommend it without any restrictions. A true musical treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best House Music Album Ever!!","review":"In my opinion Pacha is the best Disco-Club in the world and this album contains all the spirit of Pacha. Soft and slow kickbass, percussion,... The cd is mixed by Farley and Heller and they really did a very nice job!! I enjoy a lot listening to it. If you do like real House Music, you should get first this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative, But Too Technical","review":"This book is a long-overdue tribute to a much and unfairly maligned operatic genius of classical Italian music, who was one of Beethoven's teachers. The book contains not only a Salieri biography, but a detailed history of the opera in to Salieri's day and rightly regards him as the successor of Gluck's reform operas. The major fault of the book is that it will appeal mainly to musicians and musical historians rather than the general reader due to its over-technical nature with regard to some areas. Still, the best book about Salieri's life and art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not reach the correct temp in a 8200","review":"Despite being listed as a replacement part for the Weller 8200 these tips will not allow the correct temperature to be reached even on the 140w setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally... something new and exciting","review":"The video for \\"Shh... (Hope Diggy)\\" sparked my interest enough in this band to go see what they had released and pick up a copy. Unfortunately, their full length won't be released until next month, but I did get to pick up this 5-song EP. I was definitely impressed. The middle eastern vibe is here, along with great meaty guitars, weird time signatures, and impressive vocals. My top picks on this album are \\"Bullshed\\" and \\"4RA's\\". The only reason this cd didn't get 5 stars is because the last song, \\"Trust Ease\\" didn't really grab me lyrically or musically. (\\"...ignorant easter suit\\" just doesn't seem to make any sense to me) All in all though, The Apex Theory is an amazing new band and I am very excited about the release of their full length album, \\"Topsy-Turvy\\". Buy this EP and support this band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Rock...New Music","review":"If you don't already have this album...get it now. This EP can be considered just a taste of what is to come...great sounds, great change ups, interesting melodies. This EP obviously has eastern influences, which in Rock is a great thing nowadays. I'm beginning to see a lot of this with lots of different artists, mixing up American texures with foriegn cultural sounds. This has begun to make rock, all the more, the focal point of music today. Bands like The Apex Theory are not afraid to explore with different sounds, Now that's the quality of a great Artist."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],N={key:0},B={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(x,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-98c0924e"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/61.md","filePath":"guide/61.md"}'),j={name:"guide/61.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
