And once you start making the recipes, you'll be even more pleased with it. Okay, maybe some take a little more than 10 minutes, especially the first time around. But once they become favorites (like Chicken Marengo is for me), 10 minutes is really an accurate estimate!

Tina Arena lacks all of the voal emotions of Helene, even though her vocal power is strong. Natasha St-Pierre's voice, in my opinion, is too raspy, deep, and dark for the innocent and light Fleur-de-Lys. My thumbs down, however, have to go to Steve Balsamo.

Some of the good ones are \\"God You Made The World All Wrong\\" and \\"Live\\" They are great but the cd as a whole is very boring.I forced myself to listen to it many times- hoping for it to click and it didn't.Don't waste your money- wait for a complete CAST recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily Pretentious","review":"Well, with musicals and operas I am prepared to brave any amount of darkness and unhummability. I love Sweeney Todd, Les Miserables, and Assassins. However, this struck me as just bad. The songs are unnecesarrily dark (at a party they all sound like they've bathed in the blood of children), the storyline hardly exists (the show looked like a stage version of the selections). The lyrics are just the same line or verse over and over, and the music is always the same melody, yet rising in pitch perpetually. The only character that is even close to well-developed is the priest. The only song that isn't completely inhuman sounding is \\"Live For The One I Love\\", but it doesn't match the rest of the score and seems as if they just had Jim Steinman graph a song of his on at the last minute. I loved the singing and acting and set, but the play itself is horrible. I would rather be strangled by my own intestines than watch this or listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I thought that it was very good but theItalian version was superb.I still give this a 4 star"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Great CD.

The lyrical beauty found in one language (french here) doesn't mean it will be retained when translated to another language. i love the music and the singers are all wonderful. ( for me i especially like Bruno Pelletier, Daniel Lavoie and Natasha St Pierre) all in all, i will certainly like it if the entire album were sold, like in the french version. some songs like Florence and Court of Miracles and the duet between Esmeralda and Fleur are sorely missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsung Diva","review":"When talking of new broadway divas, enough is not spoken of Alison Fraser and the great body of work she has done.

Unfortunately, their quality has deteriorated over the years to the point where I would never recommend them.First, they are not true to size. I had read about this on many reviews, so when I ordered the slippers, I chose one width wider, and a half size longer. That worked.They are very shoddily made. I bought the slippers in gold. In just a few weeks the color seemed to be coming off in spots.After about a month, the material at the toe part of the slipper started to bunch up.Stay away from this slipper. They are definitely not only not worth the money, but are not worth any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"These run very small, not true to size, too short, narrow.","review":"I have purchased Daniel Green slippers for years, and am usually very happy with them. The problem with this style is that I had to return them (thankfully, Amazon has very easy, fast returns) due to the slipper being too short, tight, narrow. I am disappointed in how short, narrow they are and even though I ordered a size up, still too small. I would not recommend them for elderly, or frail family members as the wedge heel is relatively high and they could cause a fall.

The fans dont like it because it tackles the hard questions. A literary masterpiece this isn't. Arraras is no 'E.A.Poe' but then it is her first attempt at writing. Some of the dates are inconsistent with court transcriptions but on the whole it is quite accurate. The interview with Yolanda was very revealing. Arraras' line of questioning was clever and it was this chapter that changed my mind about the level of Yolanda's innocence. She made too many mistakes. A must for the person who is not too emotionally attached."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shameless attempt to cash in","review":"Arraras swears she knows \\"Selena's secret\\" and teases readers throughout but the truth is that she is just as big a liar as Yolanda Saldivar, convicted murderer.

Dont' waste your time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money, What the heck is the secret?","review":"I bought this book--along with Joe Nick Patoski's biography of Selena and Remembering Selena--in 1997 (along with every Selena recording I could get my hands on, that was the year I fell in love with her, but I digress...). It's the least informative of the three, and by book's end, I was still wondering just what the book's title was referring to, because Ms. Arraras didn't spell it out! Given that the author--then host of Univision's Primer Impacto--constantly refers to herself, I can't help but feel that the book is less Selena's story than a self-promotional piece. The only useful part of the book is a translated text of Arraras' interview (or at least a portion of it) with Selena's murderer Yolanda Salvidar, originally broadcast in Spanish on Univision.Patoski's \\"Selena\\" is far more comprehensive its depiction of the strange goings-on of the entertainer's final months.

Now, I felt prepared to handle that and what I read was a \\"look at how great my show and I are!\\" book. She's apparently more able to be manipulated than she'd like to admit, because for some reason she believes an awful lot of what Saldivar told her; things that common sense don't dictate to be true. She states in her book that her show \\"Primer Impacto\\" has been criticized for \\"smacking of sensationalism\\" and now I know why - and I've never seen the show! \\"Between the lines\\" she insinuates that Selena was having an affair with her plastic surgeon and was about to move to Mexico and that that's why Yolanda shot her - to prevent her from causing harm to herself. PUHLEEZ!!!! I couldn't rate this book with negative stars, but if I could've that's what this book would've gotten from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS!!!","review":"This woman is full of crap.

Yolanda is full of crap as well and would say anything to convince others that her killing selena was justified by the \\"SECRET.\\" Arraras is full of BULL and should be ashamed of herself for blastfeming selena and her marriage and her family.

This is a WAIST OF TIME AND STUPIDITY. Mrs. Ararras needed money at that time (I believe) and she used murder Yolanda Saldivar just to sell.(well, I really do not think she sold many copies though). I do not understand how the media keeps giving credit to this crazy Yolanda Saldivar who is desperately looking for attention in any way! there is no secret mentioned in this book, because there is no secret at all. period.

Since the entire Quintanilla family denies that this books facts are true, I would not recomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is for Yolanda Saldivar fans","review":"I felt from the introduction that in some way this author was trying to make excuses for Yolanda Saldivar. (If you read the book you'll know what I am talking about.) I found the book to be a little too much about the author and her career rather than about Selena. You get the impression that she is trying to accuse the late Selena of hiding some horrible secret,of Selena's father being a rapist,& all the while Yolanda was just a victim in a complicated triangle. Yet,you never find out what that secret was supposed to be. The book is a long drawn out tale about Yolanda Saldivar and somehow only confirms just how crazy the woman really must have been. Unless you are just curious how stupid this book really is,I would not recommend purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but really no secrets","review":"I liked the book to a point. It did explain some things that I didn't know about Selena. But secrets, really there isn't any that you will find in this book.

If you are a true Selena fan, don't even dare read this book, you already know about her life. I was reading it to find out more about her, was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensational without substance","review":"I quickly got tired of the author congratulating herself on her coverage of the Selena story. She states that Saldivar told her \\"the secret\\" but she is bound to silence. So why write the book on nothing but innuendo? It is a common cry of the acused to say that they are guarding some secret that will set them free. I just don't buy it.

On page 250 Ms. Arraras writes: \\"If you have read this far--and if you've read between the lines--you know that I have revealed much in an indirect manner.\\" I read that far and the only secret I can ascertain is that you can get published simply because you interviewed the murderer on television, rather than because you have something new to say.

It promised to reveal a \\"secret\\" of Selena's, but did nothing of the sort. Instead, the author continually promoted herself, as well as her television show. When I first glanced at this book, I thought that I might be reading an in-depth report on the death of Selena. Instead, rumors and half-truths were the basis of the so-called \\"secret.\\" The author does hint at certain things, but doesn't have the integrity to come right out and state them. Never before have I seen such a fine example of the way that media personalities view themselves: as indispensable to the \\"ignorant public.\\" Arraras seems to consider herself a very professional and dignified reporter,yet is not above having an astrologer on her show to sensationalize the death of Selena."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!","review":"Arraras is such an arrogant woman that she took up a lot of space saying how she wasn't taking sides, when that is clearly not the case. She puts Saldivar on a pedistal and makes her out to be the victim. What is this \\"secret\\" she talks about? Apparently she knows, but because of a vow to not tell, she wastes the reader's time with a bunch of crap. If this secret is supposedly going to clear Saldivar, then just say it.

I found the title to be extremely misleading... Selena's secret? Well what ever the alleged secret was it remains still just that. Furthermore, the author couldn't seem to get enough of making reference to herself in some way or another. I thought this book would shed light on an unclear subject, but only left more questions with its insinuations. For those of you interested in reading about \\"the secret\\", don't bother as you probably know as much about the secret as anyone who's already read it.

It turns out that Nathan, the boy is the lawyer's wife's pupil. Nathan wants to buy his dying mother shoes so she will look nice when she goes to see Jesus. If that ain't sad enough, the part where Nathan listens to her heart to see if she is still alive was just too hard for me. I had to leave the room on that part.

When I started to watch the movie I was really disapointed to see that the DVD would just stop and the people would still be talking and the picture would freeze, it was like the DVD was stuck. I still kept it because I just love the movie and was afraid that if I sent it back an other one would not be available. I have ordered from amazon before and have been very satisfied with my purchases. However this one was a dissapointment.Thank youCarla Bertovich"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Shoes Review","review":"The DVD came very quickly.

They never repeated it, or sold it to another station. Last year I looked everywhere for the DVD and found a notice on Amazon that it would be released for DEC 2006. I pre-ordered it and anxiously awaited it's arrival. It was as good as I remembered it to be. It is a movie with HEART and true family interaction.

I don't know anyone that wants to watch a depressing movie about a young mother dying and leaving her child. Yes the actors were really good, but I've always been under the assumption that a christmas movie should make you feel good, not MISERABLE. If you have ever lost a person you love at the holidays or if someone you've lost loved Christmas this is definitely NOT the movie for you. Better take stock in Kleenex before you watch this depressing tear jerker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profanity in a Christian movie?","review":"I bought this movie on sale at the local Christian bookstore (Lifeway), thinking it would be a good Christmas movie for my family. I was shocked to hear two uses of the word \\"D---it\\"! Why did the movie creators feel the need to throw in words like this, into a Christian movie of all places!

Proceeded to say they were probably out of stock but they should have told me that up front before putting me through the hassle of having to make two returns. Then it took forever to get my money back. It was a nightmare of a transaction.

He wants to buy his mom new shoes for Christmas. A guy name Robert Layton, (Rob Lowe) who is a lawyer who does not spend to much time with his family. Robert meets Nathan at the store that bought the shoes for his mother. Roberts gives Nathan some extra money for the shoes. This movie is really sad. I would not recommend watching this movie.

This was the best.The selected material is representive,the research well done.the filming and background music pleasing. I have seen many of the included works in museums and look forward to seeing them with my newly acquired acumen.The modern art section is a little pc and the woman who intimates that western art is built on the exploitation of the female nude is off-the-wall. The section on Florence was my favorite because of its beauty and importance as the epicenter of western culture. No, this is not a boring series except for those who favor Michelob over Michelangelo."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good series.","review":"We watched this video series during the last two terms in my Art History class. Yes, alot of people appeared to be asleep, but if they are anything like the students at my school, that wasn't the fault of the video. I thought they were very interesting and filled in alot of the gaps in my art history knowledge. I liked how they had mini-slide shows of works with some music playing in the background. It was especially nice in our lecture hall with the surround sound system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotically Boring","review":"We watched this video for my Humanities class.

I am a sucker who will buy almost anything Stooges. This dosen't really offer anything new in the way of Stooges collections of \\"lost material.\\" The same songs are here and they are about the same quality as any other collection you will find out there. A bonus, it's on vinyl and listening to a record is always a great treat. I don't really see any reason for anyone to track this down or buy it unless they want a collection of this material on vinyl. If this is your introduction to this material buy Original Punks or Penetration on CD first. They both offer the same tracks but with a cleaner sound. If you need more, than look for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stand Up!","review":"Paul Robeson was a proud man. A man of bravery, intelligence and integrity. He was a man who had to walk alone, as men must do sometimes. He formed his own opinions, defined his own ideology, and stood up for that ideology when confronted. Faced with hatred the way he was, many men would give in and surrender, Mr. Robeson refused to do this. He walked the road that Malcolm X, Nelson Mandela, and Michael Jordan walked and he lived to tell it like he saw it. All the kids who live in poverty should know that education is the key to being your own person, if you need a guide, read Here I Stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness","review":"Every Community has its mythological heroes. Paul Robeson not only projected a positive image for millions of African Americans during his era, but had an undeniable genuis. In this case, the reality lived up to the myth of the man. In this book, we have an opportunity to hear his own side of the story, in his own words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing insights ...","review":"Paul Robeson is one of the most amazing singers, in so many genres. And not only in singing, but his Othello must be listened to -- a sonorous delivery. He has always been a person I have looked out for, both listening to recordings and because he was the first person to sing at the Sydney Opera House in Australia. He sang on the steps when it was only part built and gave a concert to the construction workers. This book allows you to meet the man behind the public persona -- athlete, scholar and civil rights activist. If you like his music, take the next step and meet the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul Robeson - a Deceived American!","review":"Paul Robeson was a collosal dupe of the Soviet Union, who used him very effectively, and treated him royally when he lived in the Soviet Union, much of his life, while the average Soviet citizen barely got enough to eat. Towards the end of his life, Paul Robeson preferred to come home to die in America. The book is an interesting read about a misguided and manipulated African-American."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real support toward successful learning","review":"After many years of working with children of all ages in school settings, I commend the author on making the \\"secrets\\" of school success so doable. This easily readable book should be a must for parents at the beginning of the school year. It holds many practical applications to help a child be a successful student. If parents were to follow only a portion of the suggested \\"tips\\", their children's 180 days in school each year would go much smoother."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is rubbish","review":"I bought this and it didn't improve anything.

Alexandra Kennedy's gentle style of writing along with several guided meditations allowed me to move at my own pace and within my own framework. As a result, I was able to deal with the grief I wasexperiencing and answer many of the painful questions that arose. When my mother finally died several years later, I picked up the book again and was able to explore my own transformations that were a result of her death. This book was an invaluable tool for one of life's most difficult transitions."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trojan Horse for New Age Ideas","review":"Grieving from the recent loss of my mother, I picked up this book after reading the jacket and flipping through some of the pages. It seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. Imagine my surprise when part way into the book, the author began devoting half of the remaining pages to discussion of shamanistic rituals and her own cosmic field trips.This would be fine if the book was packaged as a New Age book about grieving. It was not, and this reader feels taken advantage of. The 2 stars are for the half of the book that gave what it promised: good practical advice about dealing with loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so practical guide to greif","review":"After the sudden lost of my mother, I felt strangely empty and confused. I had lost my father 2 years prior, and felt I dealt with his death in a very strong and mature way. After my mothers death I was feeling what I thought was an exaggrated sense of loss and bewilderment. I looked for books on the subject and found this book highly reccomended. I did not find what I was looking for.The author recounts her own experience with loss and encourages the reader to take their own \\"out of body\\" sharmanisit experiences to deal with grief. I found this not helpful and almost annoying. I did however stumble upon a different book with a simular title: Losing a Parent by Fiona Marshall. This book was excellent and helped so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal help","review":"This book was a phenomenal help to me as I went through my grief process.

She encourages us to open our hearts to the tremendous resources within: our imagination, creativity, dreams and spirit. Alexandra provides practical tools that help us access our inner resources.Her strong access to her own inner resources enabled her to take good care of herself during the intense time of grieving in her life. It helped her be present with her father in the transition from life to death and after death. Reading about her transformational experience is encouraging and refreshing. It helps us see death as an opportunity rather than a threat. Losing a Parent helps us appreciate and celebrate life and death in all their dimensions.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to befriend death embrace transformation.Julia James, life coach & author of the award-winning bookThe Mini-Retreat Solution"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the premise","review":"I was expecting some advice on how to deal with the emotional and psychological issues of losing a parent.Instead, this book was more about shamanism and spirit guides.

Alexandra's wonderful book has been a beacon of a light, a lifeline and an anchor in the stormy sea of grief. Ms. Kennedy's touching account of her own journey and transformation at her father's death provides a map of possibility. Not only did she give countless practical suggestions on how to grieve, but also opens the doorway to our inner world of spirit. Through her own vivid examples, using visualization and shamanic journeys,Alexandra demonstrates how we can find internal sources of strength.Thank you, Alexandra, for being willing to share your story, wisdom and heart with us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the recycling bin","review":"What a waste of money this book was. I suppose if you choose to deal with death by looking to spirit guides and other new age rituals, it would be helpful. The author is certainly impressed with herself; I found much of this book to be pretentious and self-serving. For an enormously comforting view of dealing with death, I would recommend \\"When Bad Things Happen to Good People\\" by Rabbi Harold Kushner. Too bad people who \\"borrow\\" my copy never give it back (I've lost at least 10 that way), and now it is out of print. Re-reading that book would have been helpful to me at this stage in my life.

She varied between sitting and watching, to crouching to attack and climbing all over the TV to get the birdies. I gave it four stars for 2 reasons. First, I don't recommend it for kittens. My four month old kitten, Boon, just was not that interested. I don't think his short attention span allowed him to sit and watch. So, I don't recommend it for kittens. Second, the quality was not that good. Some of it has that \\"Blair Witch\\" feel of a camera bouncing around a bit. However, Cleo did not mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic Cologne","review":"This is a good basic cologne. It is not that expensive, which is appreciated, and it lasts for a fairly long time, usually about 8 hours for me. It is somewhat minty, and if you are not used to that it can seem a bit unusual for a cologne. I use it after the gym to give me a clean fresh feeling. For most colognes, you slowly stop recognizing the cologne you are wearing due to your sense of smell getting accustomed to the scent, but I can still smell this after several hours and my wife has told me she smells it later in the day. Overall...very good general cologne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belle of the ball","review":"There weren't sizes listed on this, but One Cute Pooch emailed me with an approximate and it fit just fine.

This movie fits somewhere between the 3rd and 4th years of the series and revives the marriage of Ricky and Lucy. If you like the series you'll pick up the movie's theme immediately and you'll know the background. If this is your first introduction to TPB then you might have to endure the first 10 to 15 minutes while you get a sense of place and plot. No matter, Clattenburg does this well, his keen sense for comedy overcomes the hopeless trailerpark life, the screwy thinking so brilliantly portrayed by Trembly, Wells, Dunsworth and pals and highlights the background of the simple set. If you're looking for a different comedy, something you'll think about after the movie is over, and maybe just a little social statement along with your laughter, this is the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted it to be better.","review":"This wasn't done in true TPB fashion.

I will typically get 6-7 hrs. of listening time with my Lyra, and I've experience no skips or anything else.For the people experiencing file corruption problems with their Lyras, you need to keep in mind that you should not store more than 100 entries to a playlist folder.

I have friends who have Creative brand mp3 players and they seem to have everything going for them: better sound quality (the eq on this this pretty much sucks), better design, and better prices.

However even before that, the thing I really noticed was that the controls were clumsy and often took several attempts at making them work right before they actually did.I ended up returning it to the store from which I bought it.

It plays music well and I keep using it because of that.

I found that Windows Media Player is much simplier for downloading music to it than the Musicmatch software they want you to use.However, it does work and 4 gigs is nice. It has a nice size to it but the case that came with it is useless if you don't wear a belt and you can't find cases for it. I also wish it had features like picking up in a song where you left off like other MP3 out there.It won't be my next MP3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I have had the Lyra Jukebox for only one year and it just blew up on me - literally. I noticed that the battery life recently took a turn for the worse, lasting maybe 45 minutes to an hour. Then the other day I went to use it and noticed that the battery pack expanded and split the case open - now it is worthless. It worked somewhat decently prior to this. I experienced the \\"Corrupt File System\\" errors it appears most others have, but a simple reset fixed it. As far as mp3 players go - it works, but it is very basic. The interface is limited and the scroll wheel is inaccurate. The shuffle feature is also weak. It shuffles the songs, but the order in which they are shuffled is the same each time it is used.For the $180 I paid for this at Wal-Mart a year ago, I would expect it to last more than a year. Don't waste your money on this, there are much better players out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"File System Corrupted","review":"We bought the RD2762 Lyra in mid 2005 to listen to audiobooks from Audible.com. The placard at the store indicated that this model would support Audible's .aa format, but once we got it home we discovered that it did not. I found an online press release from RCA that indicated the RD2762 would have a software upgrade later in 2005 and would support Audible at that time. It is now mid 2006 and their software still does not support the Audible format... To top it all off, I am experiencing the \\"File System Corrupted\\" on the Lyra. I have yet to research any solutions or contact RCA about the problem, but I am disappointed in this product.As for the goober that says consumers who experience problems must not know how to use pc's or mp3 players, ID10T."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Customer Service, will not buy RCA ever again!","review":"Recently we have tried 3 different RCA products and had problems with all 3. When you call RCA Customer service, you will end up talking to someone in India or the Philippines who barely speaks English and doesn't really care about your problems.We bought one of these RCA MP3 players and contrary to what it says, they will not reliably play WMA and MP3 songs mixed together. We had been unable to get an answer from RCA as to why and whether there is a fix. We were lucky enough to be able to return the unit for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still...a must read.","review":"I am one of those Murakami fans who has all his works, some in English and some in Chinese. If you are a first time reader of Haruki Murakami, I would not recommend this book right away. But if you've read him before, I'm sure I don't need to tell you that this IS a must read. As always, our main character is still that reluctant outsider who dances to his own pace, having almost no contact with his outside surroundings. He lives in his own philosophy and his own special way of observing the world around him. Bizarre as it may seem, the characters in this book are so deadpan, they seem alive. Murakami mixes fantasy and reality into a totally different genre giving readers a whole new perspective on their own lives. But then again, this is only my personal point of view. I'm one of those guys who would stop at an empty red light, 3 in the morning so... take my word for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wind-up Bird Chronicle","review":"I am a stranger to Haruki Marukami. His titles intrigued me and I wanted to try something different. I am afraid that this particular novel completely baffled me and I wondered why I bothered. I know that many people are addicted to his writing but this just wasn't for me. I found it rambling and pointless. Maybe I'll try another one of his to see if it hits the spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliance!","review":"This is the first book i've read by Murakami. I was in the bookshop when its strange cover beckoned me. i didn't feel like reading anything too heavy and the thickness of the book made me a little reluctant. but i bought it anyway and i don't regret it. On the surface, everything seems simple. the plot seems simple, the lives of the characters seem simple. but as you read further into the book, you can't help but get totally absorbed. this book really made me think about things...life, its meanings, japan.... such bizarre, surreal concepts arise from such a simple plot. even though the book is fairly thick, i wished it was thicker. i didn't want to put the book down, and when i finished, i wish i still had a chapter more to go. brilliant brilliant brilliant! go buy this book now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, disappointing read","review":"I had heard great things about this book. However, it was pure drudgery to read it. I only kept reading it because I expected it to get better as I read further, and I needed to finish it for my book club. After 600 pages I was disappointed and confused. I probably won't be reading another Murakami book, based on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Mr. Windup Bird","review":"Three quarters throught this book I started to feel jealous that anyone else in the world besides the author and myself had read this book. That is how much it meant to me. I knew this was silly, Haruki Marukami is a very popular author! I have never felt like this before, but oddly I felt hurt that other people could conjure up names and images of these very same characters. On another note, this author amazed me in his ability to write with simplicity without being boring or mundane. This is my first book by this author. Luckily there is a fount of other H.M. titles for me to continue reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sitting in my chair","review":"Sitting in my chair, I saw a sunny spot on the carpet. I resisted moving for several minutes, and the spot shifted its position slightly.That's when the slender woman entered my line of vision. She was wearing a yellow plastic raincoat and pink Chuck Taylor high-top sneakers that sounded like Philly Joe Jones doing some inspired brushwork during \\"Night in Tunisia\\" (the Verve version, not the Bluenote).She asked me if I liked her with our without breasts, and I said simply \\"Yes\\", remembering that I needed to sautee the chicken breasts for dinner, add a little soy sauce, and vaccuum the carpet.When I looked up again the woman was gone. I looked back at the sunny spot, but it had started raining outside, and sounded like the rain drumming on the pith helmets of the Manchurian expedition stranded in Hangchow in the bleak autumn of 1939, when many of the soldiers were forced to unwrap their leggings and wring them out for drinking water and nourishment.(Continue for 600 pages.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"bizarre and wonderful","review":"Bizarre, wonderful, completely engaging. Murakami writes with an original, delicate precision and the reader is left with a sense of having witnessed something singularly surreal and yet completely believable. The author manages to guide his reader coolly through a labyrinth of seeming randomness that blossoms into an epic flower of a novel. This novel will have you pondering long after the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book is a complex and multi-dimensional masterpiece. It is what best-selling fiction should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved first third but then unsatisfying","review":"I just loved everything about the first third of this hefty novel. It became disappointing when it dawned on me, that the author wouldn't be able to resolve all the clues and mysteries he'd laid out. The main protagonist started acting increasingly irrational too. I am also didn't particularly like the exceedingly graphic descriptions of war atrocities. It went on for too long too. I love serious fiction and I realize my opinion runs counter to the main stream, but that's the way I feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murakami standard","review":"I was apprehensive about plummeting into this lengthy novel, especially because the back cover's description read pretty uninteresting. But don't be fooled by descriptions of the content--With Murakami, its never about 'plot', its about the language with which he utilizes that content that sends readers into the experience of a murakami novel. The master of describing \\"the ordinary\\" transcends and explores a whole other area of existence in this book. Emotive, thoughtful, and exciting; a solid investment of time and money for any Murakami fan. Also check out his novel \\"Norweigan Wood\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic, harmonious mystery that leaves you wanting more","review":"This was my first introduction to the author and it seemed suiting, once I got into the novel, that I read it while alone, away from my partner over the span of a brief vacation alone. For the right person in the right context, this could be a very life changing novel to which you could relate.I enjoyed the level of mystery or puzzle included in the book, and the nicely balanced bits of history, and the author's voice-- my only beef is that I truly wanted to know more in the end, however, it seems like such a reality simply wouldn't exist and its ending is in balance with the kind of mystery and similarities to real human life this novel conveys.Sometimes in life, you simply won't have all the information, and you'll never really know. Our minds do the best with what we have. If there were one message from the book overall, I believe that would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully read","review":"A piece of advice to everyone. When reviewing an audiobook, review the AUDIOBOOK, not the actual book. Or do both. People who listen to audiobooks are interested in the performance as much as the text being read. Saying that, this is read wonderfully, and I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - more of the same - but good","review":"If you are new to Murakami, this novel might not be the first one you should read by this author. I would recommend starting with \\"A Wild Sheep Chase\\" which, in my opinion, is by far his best. In the Wind up Brid Chronicle you will recognize many of the same types of characters and intriguing plotlines that are laid out in A Wild Sheep Chase. However, in the Wind up Brid Chronicle the plot is not quite as nicely laid out and the book does not flow as well. That being said, Murakami is one of my favorite authors and the Wind up Brid Chronicle is a fine example of his craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello? Hello?","review":"I also loved this book. But why did I keep reading when it was so painful? Also confusing. The plot line(s) are certainly gripping enough to keep you coming back, but it seems that some basic explanations are never divulged. At the end, I wanted to go into a tantrum, like Alice, and pick up all the pieces and throw them around until I had an order I liked. Maybe it was too much like life, for all the transrational bits. Do we read to escape? To return? As Okudzhava sings: Fate, fate, fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting though not easily understandable read","review":"This book will keep you interested and entertained from start to finish. It is a sort of fantasy, mystery, love story. The plot is actually three plots. The protaganist is searching for his missing wife, is developing a friendship with a teenage girl all the while Murakami is retelling a veteran's horrific war story.The book is hard to interpret, my belief is that it has many meanings but the main point I took away from it is the power of imagination and meditation in acheiving our goals and desires. It is beautiflly written and I would give it a higher rating were it not a little slow in spots. Still, an excellent, mesmerizing read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eastern Twin-Peaks","review":"If you enjoyed \\"Twin-Peaks\\" you will love this book. It takes you off on directions never thought of. It starts in normality - a guy making spagetti and starts to twist and turn into alternative realities. Its themes are present, past and the supernatural world that lies just beneath the surface. It shows how all these worlds are linked. If you are into sincrinicity then you will understand this book entirely. I really enjoyed this book and will definately buy other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, that's a trip!","review":"What an eerily strange tale! It starts off simple enough, but before you know it, you are completely absorbed into a surreal situation where you don't know what is going on around you. But, to give credit to this talented writer, you simply don't care! You accept the absurdity, the trippy-ness, the lack of reason with complete abandon. This is not easy to do. The writing style is absolutely beautiful... the descriptions, at times lush, at others, creepy as hell!!! There is one scene that actually made me want to cover my eyes it was so gruesome -- and I'm not easily shocked! I would definitely recommend this, but only to those who are ready to surrender themselves to an alternate universe. Not for the skittish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex, Disturbing and Little too Long","review":"I read Wind-up bird Chronicle while unemployed which made the book more compelling. While my period of self-discovery wasn't as eventful as Toru's, I felt a certain kinship with the character. There is such a sharp combination of the magical and realist in this book that it seeped into my subconscious and I felt changed in the reading of it. I think the second half is weaker than the first but that first half is so good that it compelled me to keep reading and made the whole experience unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impeccable as always","review":"He has fast become one of my favorite authors and this may be my favorite yet. It is right up there with Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World. I enjoy the melancholy and the plainness, wrapped up with the weird and awkward. I truly enjoy the quietness of this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still think about this book - months later","review":"Several months after having read this book I still think about it. Some of the characters are among the most memorable I've encountered in literature. I just wish I was reading it for the first time again."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"I wanted to continue, but the narrative voice is so damn irritating that I can't. The main character is so passive and pliable. Moping around his house? Check. Seemingly giving up on life? Check. Accepting demands from others because who really cares? Check.By the time the plot picks up, it's too late. I don't care what he does, mainly because I'm not sure he'll do anything. At least not until it's too weird or too many pages have passed by.I don't need every page action-packed, but at least give the characters some momentum. That'd be nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"bounces between the hopelessly mundane and the searlingly violent","review":"It's not hard to find novels these days that deal with personal ennui, national guilt, dreams, the supernatural etc. What struck me about this is the awesomely bizarre way in which all of these forces reinforce and interact with each other here. On the one hand you get moments of an almost suffocatingly sensible domestic life, and on the other hand, bits of hallucinatory violence and surreal-ish occurrences, though the juxtaposition between them kind of breaks down by the end (which might or might not be the point). I'm a bit embarrassed to admit it, but I've never read any Japanese fiction before, and while that did not prevent me from immensely enjoying it, I can't help but think that I really don't have the proper background to fully appreciate it. The end of the first section though, damn, has to be one of the most harrowing, emotionally draining things I've ever come across in fiction"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four and three quarters stars!","review":"WOW. The author guides you through a complex plot with great literary skill. Many of the characters are fascinating and the plot is interwoven with their individual stories. If you simply read the account of Lieutenant Mamiya and the chucked the rest of the book, it would be worth it. But read the whole thing, for Mr. Murakami is a master storyteller. I know this is one book I'll read again and gain completely new insights as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it.","review":"I actually gave up on this book after about 300 or so pages of going no where. Eventually, I returned to it, but the ending didn't do much for me. After I finished it, I unloaded it to a thrift store, but the thing never sold.Murakami is a good author, but this is not a good work. Try something else. I suggest \\"Wild Sheep Chase.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid cartoon world","review":"I think Murakami is a frustrated filmmaker. An earlier reviewer's comparison with David Lynch is apt (both are empty) but another (English) reviewer compares it with Point Blank (which he and I love) for its atmosphere; not enough to sustain this leviathan, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"the journey and not the destination","review":"I found this book to be wholly and completely engaging. While it's true that Murakami does leave many, in fact, dozens of questions unanswered, I believe the beauty of his book is in the journey and not the destination of the story. Toru is clearly overwhelmed by the ambiguity of both his situation and the people he meets. He searches for something \\"concrete\\" that he can wrap his head around. But he learns, as do we, that one can't always understand what's happening, or why it is. Sometimes you just have to go along, and hope for the best. It becomes a matter of faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"I'll be brief. I read this book about 5 years ago, and have owned 3 copies since. Everyone I've lent it to has loved it (and in some cases has lent it on.. hence the 3 copies).In this novel as in Life, stuff happens which we want to fit into a grand pattern , but which ultimately proves to have no resolution.I LOVE this book, and re-read it about once a year. The writing style is transparent, allowing the narrative to be absorbed subconsciously. Within his sparse use of language (and what a wonderful translation, I guess!) is much beauty, moments where I stop and savour a sentence, letting the imagery dissolve like snowflakes on the tongue.I think this a wonderfully decadent book. You should indulge yourself and read it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you want leave it even if you hate it","review":"Over 600 pages on emotional constipation beautifully written on any subject you could ever think of: sexual relationship between man and wife, man and fantasy, man and mental prostitute, man skin peeling a life, deep well,water, hunted houses,nasty V.I.P intellectual,empty boxes and so on.I definitely HATED THIS BOOK but never the less coudnt let it go.The vivid wild deranged imagination of Murakami hypnotised me totaly.He is one wacko writer...What a genius!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps his most \\"mainstream\\" work after South of the Border","review":"I've read most of Murakami's books and I can't escape the feeling he's some sort of reincarnated Zen master standing behind me with a stick and head full of koans. Murakami plays; he recycles characters, has kinky relationships and likes the just-a-bit-lost-ordinary-guy type of male leads. I'm not sure how many times he'll keep trying to enlighten his readers (I hope for a few more novels at least) before he gets bored and probably just lives out in the country listening to jazz and cooking (oh, did I mention he has a theme of jazz and fine cooking in the books?).Like Calvino, what you take away from the novel is what you have inside. Some literature is more like a mirror than a force-feeding of ideas. Let your patterns go and enjoy the pleasure of turning the pages over for the first time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrific translation","review":"I read the review stating that this English translation was far from ideal, and I can confirm that something is awry after struggling through a choppily arranged novel chock full of errors (grammatical, punctuation, arrangement, simple spacing). I have no idea how these novels get digitized, and certainly haven't read the book in any other format, but I'm very disappointed to finish a critically acclaimed novel (by one of my favorite authors) and wonder what was 'lost in translation'.I would in no way recommend this download for English readers; find a different translation. I hate to give Murakami any kind of poor review, but take this as a reflection of the product as a whole. I've never had troubles with his other novels in 'physical print' before, maybe Kindle is still working out some kinks. I, for one, would appreciate a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS","review":"This book is Murakami's masterpiece, and is both captivating and imaginative. Murakami is a master of suspense and I literally could not put the book down, yet it lacked the trashy quality that many equally gripping novels have, which was a pleasant surprise. Moreover, this is the type of book that takes you somewhere worth going, so that after 600-700 pages, you actually feel like you have gone on the same journey Mr. Wind-Up Bird did. Murakami has ingeniously mastered the art of creating a book that is unpredictable - the twists and turns the plot makes will consistently surprise you and keep you interested, yet at the same time they seem inevitable, which is the mark of a true author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative and Strange","review":"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is one of the most imaginative and strange books I've ever read. The story is set in modern-day Tokyo, and it contains historical references to the Japanese-Russian conflict in outer Mongolia during WWII, but there all connection with reality ends. The book's characters are unusual people to say the least. Almost all of them seem to be blessed with various other-worldly powers. Viewed in one way, the book is a 600+ page collection of their histories, and it is as a storyteller that Murakami excels --- his descriptions are vivid, imaginative, and quite captivating.But what is the book about? I'm not really sure. Perhaps it is about self-reliance and responsibility. The moral is not as important to Murakami as the stories themselves, and the images and people of this book will probably stay with me for some time. Give this one a try if you're in the mood for a mind-bending read."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-","review":"Interminably long, bloated, and meandering, but there are moments of beautiful writing and some worthy chapters that can stand alone (e.g., Lt. Mamiya's stories). Overall, however, the characters, themes, plot just don't come together for me; none of these feel fully realized, urgent, or deserving of the demands it makes on the reader. I feel that the book could have been improved by some judicious editing.His writing style IS \\"hypnotic\\", as they say. Toru's voice really took me to that grey zone between reality and the otherworld that he experiences. Sometimes when I put the book down, I felt like I had just emerged from the dark, mysterious world of \\"Room 208\\", and I needed to take a moment to remind myself that I was in the real world.Murakami is clearly a talented writer, but ultimately his ambitions got the best of him with this one and he doesn't deliver a \\"masterpiece\\"; he delivers a promising but flawed book."},{"rating":"2","title":"spaghetti and water flow?","review":"from a short story, this novel started out with the same character making spaghetti as the phone rang - which lead him into a search for a cat and ultimately, a resolution of the world's symbolic water flow. murakami attempts to resolve many issues in this novel - including life in a well, solving the symbolic waterflow problem, ridding of his brother-in-law - which bears the same name as his cat . . . i am re-reading it the third time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for Murakami","review":"Murakami writes well and I finished the tale. As I closed it, I wondered why I had persisted, spending precious time on nothing of substance. I hope that at some point he touches at least one foot on earth and writes about something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of sound of fury, signifying nothing","review":"The only thing that kept me going past the halfway point of this 600+ page book was the hope that, by the end, the author would somehow tie together the long and eclectic list of characters and story lines. Alas, there was no attempt at all to do so, the result being a collection of seemingly random people, places, and events that bear little if any relation to one another and serve no purpose in the overall story. I was really looking forward to reading this book after reading the good reviews, but after finally finishing it I wish I had pulled a different book off my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read anything else...","review":"Wow, what a disappointment. I bought this book because EW put it high on the list of their best contemporary classic novels.It started out interestingly enough and I like the characters but I realized about halfway through the book that the story was going nowhere! Having a bunch of odd occurrences and characters does not a good story make. I'm trying hard to speak in generalities here so I don't ruin the story for anyone but I shouldn't because there is not much of a story. The ending was the most terrible part of all. You would think all this abstractness would tie in in a satisfying way at the end but not even close. I was actually angry; waste of my time.If you want to read a book that is a little out there but tells a beautiful and haunting story read the Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell instead of this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but unsatisfying","review":"The book wasn't hard to get through at all despite it's length, which was nice, but it was seriously flawed. I felt like, to keep things interesting, the author felt the need to cram each chapter with strange phenomena, complex backstories, and fascinating details, which seemed cool at the time, but were ultimately disappointing. Because along with these wonderful tidbits came an unspoken promise, or feeling, that they would all somehow have some significance, that everything would tie together in the end. That wasn't the case. The book just ended, with a startling jolt, and no curiosity was satisfied. It's a book that was seemingly written chapter by chapter, while all along the author had no idea where he was going. None the less, fairly entertaining, so hey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering mess","review":"This book was recommended to me after I had made a recommendation for another Japanese author, Natsuo Kirino. Windup Bird begins with promise but after 400 or so pages you are still trying to figure out what the blazes is going on. After 500 pages, I'm too stubborn to stop; but, the last ten pages were absolute torture. There are many components and characters in the book, while I'm sure the author thought would be interesting, were plain silly making little sense. Natsuo Kirino's \\"Out\\" would be time better spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is an amazing book. It is incredibly diverse, spanning many years, two countries, and several specific settings, all while weaving in and out of a central plot. Toru Okada is an intriguing protagonist, a complex charachter who's personality is both easily detectable and endearing. He is an ordinary man under extraordinary circumstances. And the ending was quite fulfilling. I'm usually not satisfied with book's endings, but this one didn't dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the Japanese equivalent of Gravity's Rainbow","review":"Or possibly not. But a damn good read anyway.It starts with a spaghetti snack and a missing cat. Somehow it moves through World War II Manchuria under Japanese occupation (Manchukuo) and later to a forced labor camp in Siberia. Meanwhile, a wife vanishes, a woman analyzes water, her sister becomes a prostitute of the mind, several people spend time at the bottom of dry wells, there are several wet dreams, and there's a wig factory, Dunkin' Donuts in Tokyo, and hotel room 208.About as diverse as you can get. Mystery, fantasy, war, coffee. Engaging, and almost unputdownable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wind-up Bird Chronicle","review":"I've read a dozen or so of Murakami's books, and love his understated style.Plot elements gradually come together, so the reader is left trying to figure out what is going on / meaning to be conveyed, until near the end. Sometimes, you are left wondering, with questions unanswered, even when you've reached the end, which is an interesting concept in itself. His books always give you food for thought, and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, is one of those leaving you a little bemused, but highly entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"TV on Paper","review":"Reading this book is like watching television. Not necessarily bad television but still television. I don't understand why Murakami doesn't just team up with David Lynch and make a bunch of movies...his talents are not as a writer. That said, this is probably good beach reading. It's not best-seller bad but it's not exactly literature either."},{"rating":"1","title":"nope","review":"i guess one has to be very intellectual to understand this. i only know that there are many things left without explanation and characters comes and goes without resolution.the main story is interesting but since there are too many things happening in this book at the end i didnt care for it.not recommended.adiós."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I can't figure out why this book is so popular.It was a major disappointment to me. It's not that I don't like weird stuff. Or maybe I'm just too conservative: I loved Tanizaki& Abe Kobo, especially his Woman in the Dunes & his Box Man. But this is just a confused mishmash where nothing really ever seemed to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a thoughtful look at the interaction of people with one another, history, tradition, and family ties. It shares characteristics with magical realism, raising interesting questions about what is \\"real\\" and whether or not \\"real\\" varies from culture to culture or generation to generation. For me, the book is also a relevant depiction of how people in normal lives handle existing day-to-day as ordinary people, how \\"ordinary\\" can change to extraordinary in the course of a very short time, and how sometimes personal enlightenment/discovery is driven by horrific events."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the heck was that about?","review":"bizarre yet captivating at the same time. little long winded as well.hmmm i lost my cat. some strange person with a funny hat says there is something wrong with my water.let me dwell on that by going down into a dark dry well so i can meditate...wait.. what..?interesting read nonetheless but was a little bit exhausting in the end to finish.I have to warn you, once you pick it up you have to finish it- the strangeness just made me so curious i kept wondering how it would end. Not that the end gives you any respite from the weirdness nor any satisfaction in the story..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Murakami has got to be one of my fave authors, but this book was a great disappointment for me. There were some interesting stories included in the work, but put together they lacked cohesion.

I suggest you skip this one and go for another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After reading \\"Noreign Wood,\\" \\"South of the Border, West of the Sun,\\"and a couple of others, I bought this book.

Everyone seems to love it except for myself. I had the book sitting on my shelf for a couple of years, wondering why I bought it.

Please, someone tell me what I am missing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"*sound of wind rushing*","review":"Florid waste of time!!Murakami shouldn't be allowed to write about women. He casts them all as victim-y sex objects. What a neat guy.Lots of details, no depth to any character, no plot, no more Murakami."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel I've been manipulated.","review":"Every writer tries to manipulate his readers: he programs a response in them with the words he writes. Murakami in this book simply toyed with the readers, playing one trick on them after another. He wrote, four no maybe, five different books and cut them apart and patched different pieces of them together in a rather random order. They were all pointless, especially the main Toru Okada thread, and they generally were not pleasant reading. Maybe I feel like the first patron to buy Picasso's first abstract painting, and Picasso went on to become a recognized artist. But this first patron may have never changed his mind that what Picasso sold him was a piece of junk, and the rest of the world is a bit crazy not to have noticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haunted houses, pre-teen prophets and psychic prostitutes..","review":"Let's try real hard to be weird and mysterious as possible. Apparently Mr. Murakami didn't try hard enough. An abandoned house(possibly haunted), a wise-old teenager, a malevolent brother in-law, dreams crossing into reality, things disappearing into thin air? it's all been used, re-used, recycled and borrowed. No wonder the book is so long. Mr. Murakami attempted to string together every para-normal theme and ended up with more of a scary campfire story than a chronicle. I was unable to finish this book. The pain Creta Kano whined about to Toru Okada for what felt like three days was similar to the pain I felt reading 75% of this book. Did the Boogeyman appear in the ensuing chapters? The story sure felt like was heading in that direction. If you're looking for \\"flakes\\" try the psychic hotline instead. It's less time consuming and more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ordeal to Finish","review":"I am a diehard Murakami fan. I have read a good chunk of his novels and have gotten accustomed to his distinct style. I could deal with Kafka on the Shore's quirkiness, so I tried The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle.One of Murakami's gifts is to explore the mind of a character and analyze their personalities and relationships with others. The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle only offers an unlikeable main character and a whirlwind of characters and places that drift in and out of the narrative. It has the usual cats, psychic phenomena, and mysterious women, typical of Murakami. I felt reading this novel as an ordeal and I admit to skimming over the historical chapters dealing with Manchuria. Murakami should stick to a relatively straight-through plots and skip dream sequences. I want to like this book but I can't. Don't use this book as an introduction to Haruki Murakami, try Norwegian Wood instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A real trick of a book this one. A story stranger than Hell and storytelling that is plainspoken and warm. When I expected snarling dogs, I got steaming tea. When I felt calm, calamity came.This book is an adventurous and mind-bending metaphysical take on the twin mysteries of being and believing."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Murakami, very good.","review":"Really enjoyed it, reminded me of PKDick. Will read more, probably Kafka and NWood next. Great eye on Japan and surprised by the sex, which was done well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who are you?","review":"This book is what I am starting to believe is typical murakami. It's about figuring out who you are and that, it seems to me, is what just about everyone in the book is doing in one way or another. It's about being lost and finding your way home. And yes, the characters are weird, talk funny and have strange things happen to them, but these are reasons that I like this guy, not strikes against him. The whole point is to look at the world in an off kilter way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific read","review":"There are few books that make me as happy to think about as the Wind up Bird Chronicle, its been 7 years since I read it and have since given 4-5 copies and recommended to several other people. I think what it has in common w/ other books I've enjoyed is that it has a compelling storyline that pulls you through the book quickly but if you're open for further interpretation the book is ripe w/ original metaphor."},{"rating":"1","title":"felt tricked","review":"I feel somewhat tricked by this book. The first half of the book was interesting, and the writing is certainly good. But, I really hated the second half with pointless substory after substory. And the main story itself didn't go anywhere. At the end, it felt like a big waste of time. I was very dissappointed. If there is no ending, no goal to your story, it is fairly easy to make up interesting stuff (which might have been better off as short stories) and keep going on and on, and then just drop the ball. I don't see much value in that."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was a great book?","review":"I bought this based on all the reviews here and was sorely disappointed. My assessment of the book is this: when the author didn't know what to do next, he introduced some character out of nowhere, no connection, no realistic explanation, no reason at all other than to un-stall the storyline. When he needed something else to happen, he made some other character mysteriously disappear under seemingly nonsensical circumstances.....rinse, repeat, ad nauseam.I don't know...I love to read, but I didn't like the storyline, the characters, or the way the author wrote. Great books I'd recommend are Blindness by Jose Saramago, Bel Canto by Ann Patchett and Life of Pi by Yann Martel."},{"rating":"1","title":"More questions than answers!","review":"Reading this story causes you to admire the discriptive ability of Murakami but leaves you with more questions and lack of understanding than any book that I've read! The explaination that I read that best explains this was the reader that said 3 chapters were not included by the publisher! I will read more Murakami but with a suspicious \\"eye\\"! one more!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah, blah, blah...","review":"I made a mistake while reading this books and that's the reason I am rating it with two stars instead of one or none. My mistake was that I was reading Faulkner's \\"Light in August\\" at the same time. Every possible comparison is possibly unfair an out of turn but I couldn't avoid doing it anyhow.Murakami has some good ideas and bring it all together in an attempt to convince us about his hie sociological and metaphysical concerns. I don't deny them but he gives the impression that he is trying too much. Why? Does he try to sell something ? (actually he does, doesn't he?)His prose is silly and boring, possibly good for teenagers though.In my opinion, this book has nothing to offer unless you have plenty of time to kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wild Tale","review":"I've been really looking forward to reading one of Haruki Murakami's books, and this is the one that particularly caught my eye. Murakami's stories and writing are a bizarre mix of realism and a fantasy world. In this book a young man named Toru Okada looks for his wife's missing cat. Eventually, he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a strange \\"netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo.\\" He meets a whole group of strange characters, allies and antagonists. As the book progresses, it becomes harder and harder to tell what is real and what is not. This book had a great plot, and I really liked the narration of the book. Toru Okada tells the story, and he is matter-of-fact and observant. I look forward to reading more of Haruki Murakami's books in the future.*You can read all of my reviews at my book blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*"},{"rating":"1","title":"With so many good books out there, don't waste your time with this one","review":"This is the most random and boring novel I have attempted to read since Bleak House. Ironically, on page 380, the author writes, \\"This reminded me of several so-called art films I had seen in college. Movies like that never explained what was going on. Explanations were rejected as some kind of evil that could only destroy the films' 'reality.'\\" Haruki, I think you just described your book perfectly. If you like reading page after page of what a jobless, friendless guy with absolutely nothing going on his life does to try and occupy his time (insert detailed descriptions of meals prepared, chores accomplished, and random train rides to a train station to stare at peoples' faces all day), this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as dirt","review":"I recently read the same author's 1Q84 and thoroughly enjoyed that strange land. But this one, I just couldn't get into at all. It started off dull...and stayed that way. I also noticed certain themes recurring that, frankly, I didn't care much about. Bored househusband getting ominous sexy calls from strange women, then hanging out with teenage girls, and endless descriptions of him making his lunch, picking up drycleaning and looking for a cat. Yes, there was a sense of foreboding gathering over the proceedings, but I just didn't have the patience to see what it turned into. I dropped out of this book about 40 percent through. If it suddenly gets awesome halfway in, I hope someone will tell me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and violent","review":"In this book, the author must have been filling time and overcoming writer's block by describing in intricate detail boring things like making lunch and losing ties. I struggled to remain interested only to find myself horrified by an extended rape scene that just went on and on. People natter on about the dream-like quality of the writing. I would describe it more as a dull and monotonous snooze-fest, interspersed by nightmares."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Went Wrong?","review":"I've been a fan of Melting Euphoria since their first album, and waited with great anticipation for the release of this, their fourth. Sadly, I was more than disappointed. The beautiful female vocalizations present on their first two albums have still not returned, and gone also is a lot of the electronic bubbles and synth washes that gave ME such a wonderfully spacy sound. What we are left with is a lacklustre collection of aimless jams, with lots of guitar, but devoid of any really interesting guitar hooks. On \\"Field of Reeds\\", ME heads out for the first time on ablum, on an extended (12+ minutes) piece, which unfortunately showcases the weaknesses, rather than the strengths of the band. It sounds as if they are running out of musical ideas on this one. Still, I give it a couple of stars because it makes pleasant enough background noise, just fails to grab and hold on like their previous efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took me Over!","review":"Some people have been somewhat unfair towards this album. Screw 'em! This is GREAT, a wonderful sonic assault on the consciousness. There is some tendancy towards repetitiveness, but there are true gems like \\"Night on the Rappahannock:, an accoustical departure from the undulating psychsufr that pervades the rest of the album. \\"Tabs of Blue and Silver Sunshine\\" is unbelievably dynamic and driving. In a kinder world, this very talented band would receive more attention from the mainstream(although it would probably end up being used to sell cars, a la Moby). Simply put, some of the best music out there.P.S. I'm a little older than 12. DUHHH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Soul","review":"Many great R&B performers have come and gone. Barbara Aclin is one of them. She had a soulful way of delivering a song. She also composed many of the songs she sang. This record gives a listener a good chunk of her work. The remastering is excellent. If You are into diva's, Barbara Aclin was a queen, and a queen beats a diva any day. You will not be sorry you bought this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Book!","review":"This book is great! It divides up the vegetables by season, and the recipes are so simple! Most of the vegetables really are ones you would grow in a home garden, and the seasonings and other ingredients are ones you probably have on hand anyway, so you don't have to spend hours shopping for specialty items. The recipes are easy and generally quick to prepare, as well as being healthy, with several making use of the grill.I've tried lots of recipes from this book and so far all have come out well except the lamb-stuffed eggplant, which was too dry. The leek and potato gratin, however, more than made up for it.

He really did. And for 20 years, the Christian community bought it. Kudos to the researchers for Cornerstone who had the guts to research -- and publish -- the actual facts of the matter.Yes, there is a place in Christianity for forgiveness -- a very important place. But forgiveness does not mean pretending an offense, especially a serious offense which affected tens of millions of people, never occurred.Sadly, 2000 years of church history has demonstrated that there will always be \\"wolves in sheep's clothing\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right On!!!","review":"This book should have been published in the eighties during the big satanic panic hoop-la when the Christian church was pointing fingers at every single Pagan group out there for alledgedly committing acts of violent ritualistic abuse.Warnke was one of the frontline witchunters whose allegations against the pagan community roused countless court battles with Pagan families with small children, alledging that ritual abuse was being performed against them (to no scientific or historical proof). we know the truth now several years too late after familes have been destroyed by his lies and accusations.This book takes a look inside the lies he told, the acts he committed, the lives that were destroyed by his lies; and the Christian celebrities who kept his secret hypocratic lifestyle hidden for many years until now!Very very juicy bit of gossip but every bit backed up with endless documentation! (Which makes it even jucier to read!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the truth?","review":"What is the truth? I do know one thing that is truth! We have a forgiving GOD who puts us back together and shows us how to move on from our ways of that past that have caused us hurt,pain and grief. The only thing that this book maybe useful for is how to judge another man in front of the public. Mike is just another man who has had faults like you or I,and nobody to my knowledge has put my dirty laundry out for the public to see. Let GOD handle that,let us pray for the wounded not condemn them. I don't have that much time on my hands. If we want to go that route then lets start bringing up all the lies that have been fed to us by other so called prominent individuals. It's Mikes responsibility to tell the truth about himself. He's helped many in the their time of need,as have many other individuals who have had a battered past. I have read both sides to this story and well it can raise a few questions for sure. From BOTH sides!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book Of Lies","review":"Warnke had been debunked by Cornerstone Magazine and shown to be a liar. He had never been a Satanic High Priest nor had he attended a Satanic Ritual with Charles Manson (who was in jail on the date Warnke alleged. In the Church of Satan, drug use is not condoned and addicts are looked upon with scorn. A lot of the so-called accounts of Satanic Rituals have been shown to be lies and the fabrication of people with mental illness or people with something to sell.Yet Christians like using Satan to sell their products of fear and stupidity. Satan has been the best friend of the churches and has kept them in business for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christians Hate One-Another","review":"As is so typically \\"Christian\\", we are an army that kills it's own wounded rather than raising them up and restoring them to health. This book is another perfect example of just such hypocrisy. No wonder the world finds all who claim a faith in Jesus Christ to be fools. How can we ever give Jesus to the lonely and dying world while we're destroying our own, mercilessly? Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, Jimmy Swaggart, Oral Roberts, and, with this hate-filled book, Mike Warnke, have all become victims of Evangelical Christendom in the United States. May our precious Lord have mercy upon His so-called servants for their hatred of one another. \\"Christians\\" around the world carry out this kind of hatred everyday.

That's the first thing I said while listening to Pennybridge Pioneers. This cd is great and although it isn't the Millencolin sound of old, it is definetely a good sound. There is a mixture of fast and slowish songs, but the beat is hard and catchy as always. My favorites are No Cigar, Material Boy, Penguins & Polarbears, Hellman, Stop to Think, and Highway Donkey. The other songs are great as well. This is the best cd that I have heard this year and is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd!","review":"I got this cd like 20 min. after it came out in mp3 version - so i've had the chance to listen to it for a while. It is definitely the best cd Millencolin has come out with. Even though it doesn't have the ska that i previously loved about them (well, maybe - fox) this cd is awesome! - i love every single song on it and definitely buy it if you like alternative, rock, punk rock, ska...etc - they have mature incredibly from their previous albums and this cd just amazed me to no end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Millencolin CD Yet!","review":"This Millencolin CD is the best one yet, I've had it for about 4-5 days now and have only stopped listening to it to eat sleep and go to school.

And even softer songs like \\"The Ballad\\" sends such a powerful message that anyone can relate with. This, by far, is my favorite millencolin CD out to date, and I own them all. any softcore pop-punk rock fan would love, and quite possibly relate to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swedish punk is good? I never knew that!","review":"Overall, just a great, simple punk CD.

I loved their ska stuff off of Same Old Tunes(definitely buy that one).After hearing the crap off of For Monkeys, I wanted to give Millencolin another shot, but they dissappoint again with more crap. On this CD, they sound like they're trying to become more rock with a hint of punk. Get it if you're into that I guess. \\"No Cigar\\" is so-so, but the rest is just awful,with the singer's voice going really high and sounds like crap once again.Definitely the worst CD by Millencolin."},{"rating":"1","title":"They have done way better","review":"It's very....blinkish. It's just not that good of a CD. There's no intensity at all, and that's a key element of punk music. I love Millencolin, don't get me wrong. But, it's what is in there other CDs that I love. I just hope this was an experimental CD and they aren't following the path of the Vandals who are going down hill. The Vandals last two CDs were so slow and not anything like \\"Live Fast Diarrhea\\" or \\"the quickening\\".

Four out of Five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD, despite not being hardcore punk or ska","review":"All of the previous reviews that accuse Millencolin of being no longer hardcore are totally unfair. Yes, there is sort of an alternative twist to some of the songs now, but the bad reviews are only because these people are mad at the band. This is one of the most surprising purchases I've made in a long time. The songs are good and catchy...and are BY FAR more punkish than alternative, with the exception of \\"The Ballad\\", which is an excellent song in its own right. Don't listen to the people who want to hear hardcore after hardcore album with no change.

As a matter of fact I'm listening to them now. They are a clean group and they dont cuz at all i think. That makes it so that your parents will enjoy it if they dislike explicit lyrics. The only downside to the CD is that the songs are too short. Most off them are about 2:30 long. It is still great. This is one of the groups that you probably have never heard of but they are real good. If you played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 then you could get a taste of their music in the song No Cigar.

Maybe its the new record company but they sold out to punk."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one horrible CD!","review":"After buying this CD i was a little disapointed in how slow the music was, it sounds like alternative rock. This is the worst Millencolin album by far! after listening to it a couple of times I forced myself to like it but got sick of it in a couple of weeks. Then after hearing them in concert on the Punk O Rama tour (it was the best!) I hoped i would like the cd again but it only made me like the previos CDs even more. Millencolin only thinks that they sound better with their new, no ska sound.and I particularly dont like ska. but if your gonna get a Millencolin CD i would definetly recomend Life On A Plate. its their best album yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Saw, Could Use More Features","review":"This is my first miter saw and I have to say that it was surpisingly easy to use.

One of the few other redeeming features is that it teaches one to read Hebrew without the use of vowels underneath the words. My advice: If you go to Israel buy Prolog's \\"Hebrew So Simple\\", or \\"Hebrew at Your Ease\\" by Eliezer Tirkel and Maskilon I & II (both for English speakers), BEFORE you try to use the Berlitz Self-Teacher (Hebrew)."},{"rating":"2","title":"sa1","review":"this amplifier is very good.have it hooked up to two boston prisub 85 in-ceiling subwoofers and hits way harder than my single 10\\" floor sub ever could.this amplifier has two seperate amp channels.at 230watts rms each channel for 460 total watts of rms power.each channel is 4 ohm capable.very flexible wiring capability.Even with the high power ratings it hits so hard and clean i am just amazed with this unit.I have mine mounted in the wall so it is a flush mount;for very clean installation.You can buy this amp for 159.00 refurbished here on amazon.DO IT;IF YOU NEED AN EXTERNAL HOME THEATER SUB AMP THIS IS THE ONE TO GET.my home theater set up is all boston and i have to say it is the best sounding system i have had to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Description","review":"The ABC's Hands-On Learning Touch and Feel Cards were listed as used and in good condition which they were.

This means that it has a stnkin' lot of sweet fatty elements that most books limit. It has tons of gushy romantic fluff. It's very lusty for a Christian fiction but by no means inappropriate.The writing was definitely weak and the dialogue was very contrived.

I read it twice to try and find some redeeming quality to it, but it fell short. Why did the female lead character change her personality from fiesty and able to take on challenges, to doormat once she admitted attraction/love for the male lead? Has this writer ever even been to Georgia? Descriptions were flat and inserted as if they were taken from an encyclopedia. Dialogue was decent until the character shift, but then became inane and frustrating. Lacked reality for my taste and felt like an author's first attempt at writing (i.e., lacking in evocative description and logical character progression). I was sorry to have spent the money on it and agree with previous reviewer who said it didn't earn the right to be in the inspirational category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grief","review":"...It was so one-dimensional and so populated with cardboard characters that it bored me silly by page 10.

If it is supposed to be about people of faith, it gave us a man who handled his lady roughly, raged at her and never seemed to me, at any rate, to grow up, find any spiritual dimension or develop any real feeling towards those around him. The inference made to the heroine's mother being better off dead, bearing in mind she had been an unhappy alcoholic, was incredible to say the least and was really quite offensive. The dialogue was strictly B movie and stilted and strained. Also, the book was clearly given a bit of a re-write to bring it up to date (eg the use of computer technology circa 2003 and not the early 1980s when it originally appeared) but it didn't work..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD !","review":"I loved this CD , especially the Lori Yates vocals.

It's not an easy defence to master however. Invariably, the Knight on f6 is forced to several different squares by pawn thrusts on White's part on many occasions. This is a double edged sword. White either ends up getting his advanced pawns picked off or develops a strong enough initiative that suffocates Black. I've had varied success with it, but seem to do better in Blitz games where my opponent has less time to come up with more solid moves. I can definately see the potential though and i recommend this book to anyone looking to avoid the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano, King's Gambit or if you're tired of using or unfamiliar with the French, Caro-Kann, Sicilian, Pirc or the Modern defences.

There are momentary bright spots and little tidbits of trivia that may bring a smile. Unfortunately, the majority of the book is taken up with a spectator's view of Lance Armstrong. Mr. Barry drags us through the 2004 Tour de France from the comfort of his television set; he wasn't on the team that competed that year. And this is the core of the book.Overall, the book has SO much potential, but Mr. Barry cannot bring it to fruition. Bike racing is fun and funny, and full of wonderful stories. This book is not.

If I remember well they had a little more subtlety in their songs, musically seen. The songs of Patricia Barber are sometimes a bit too easy, too many repeats of the same tune, the hauling guitar, the pounding drums, the doodling bass. One of the best numbers is \\"Light My Fire\\" (appropriate title) originally written by The Doors, following \\"Constantinople\\", an oriental based song with a beautiful trumpet solo, but if you listen to \\"Light My Fire\\" you can understand my criticism. But then, beginning with \\"Silent Prayer\\" the wonder begins. Patricia's own songs, with the exception of Paul Anka's \\"She's A Lady\\", reveal a hidden passion that breaks through gloriously.Sonically, this CD sounds even better than \\"Café Blue\\" does."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my cup of tea","review":"Patricia Barber is an artist I only know from CD recordings so I can only judge her latest CD on the basis of my listening and my own prejudices. I have not seen her perform live, so the review is based only on listening to Modern Cool.Eight out of twelve songs are Paticia Barber's own compositions, so we get a real flavor of her music. The other four are familier songs that Peggy Lee and others popularized a number of years ago.The CD has a dark feeling, for me, and does not make me push the repeat button. After a couple of listenings I removed the CD and set it aside and will try it again later, but I doubt that it will become one of my jazz standards. I think Patricia Barber does a nice job on the standards but her own compositions are too quirky for my tastes, and leave me an uncomfortable listener. However, I am the first to admit, when I heard Miles Davis play years ago, I did not like what I heard, and it took multiple listenings for me to really enjoy his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and boring","review":"This rates as one of the worst CDs I've ever purchased.

This is modern jazz for the female vocalist. The guitar licks often feel John Scofield influenced, and it has a very free jazz spirit. A 2am venture into a New York jazz club, \\"I'll have a Manhattan\\", may very well be where this album is coming from. It should be noted it is mellow, and is not simply \\"another female jazz CD\\", it is truly inovative. If you are looking for Modern Jazz, and Modern cool, this is the CD to pick up.

I ain't tryin ta hate on em', but they need ta stop hating. otherwise I like dis c.d., The best song on this is \\"Hip-Hop\\", I think.

But, being proud of who you are don't mean you gotta go blaming everyone else, especially white people, for your troubles. If Dead Prez fell this way, why are they signed to Loud, a label run by Steve Rifkind, a white guy. How come when a white guy says bad stuff about blacks he is considered racist, yet when black people say bad stuff about white people, it is considered good, healthy pride? It's complete garbage. If there ever were black skin heads, dead prez would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great hip hop album","review":"At first, I thought maybe I shouldn't be listening to this album. Being white, I didn't much care for the intro track \\"Wolves\\", where a strongly anti-white speech is given - blaming whites for every problem that African Americans face today. However, I kept listening due to the reviews I have read and heard from others. The album faces strong political views for all races, though mainly focused for African Americans. Definately a wake up call for all people.The album would have received five stars from me, but the strong racist additude towards whites just brought it down a level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypocrisy prevents a Classic","review":"Finally a hip-hop album about neither being a thug nor being jiggy. Not since the Public Enemey day's has the rap would been blessed with a released as politcally charged as Dead Prez's \\"Let's Get Free\\". It is these political messages, however, stop this from being a classic album. The album is definetly pro-black, and could be recieved as anti-white, due partly to it's frequent use of the word \\"cracker\\" to describe those of the caucasion persuasion. This presents one problem, Dead Prez are signed to Loud Records, which is white owned. They also speak down upon hip-hop's major labels. In the wide world of rap music, labels don't get much more major than Loud. If you can allow yourself not to be distracted by these rather major hypocrisy's, in Let's Get Free you will have a hip-hop classic. If you can't, in Let's Get Free you will still have a refreshing, political, controversial and thought provoking album that still has the \\"bumpable\\" quality so revered in hip-hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music For The Revolution","review":"The album cover is censored in stores.You have to ask yourself why?

They're not trying to be rap stars with all the bling, bling lifestyle. They're trying to speak to a young generation seeking some meaning in life. While as a African high school teacher, I don't totally agree with the song \\"They Schools,\\" I can understand why they wrote it. School for far too many of my young brothas and sistas has little or nothing to do with them, so why take it serious. On the other hand, I would have liked to hear a song about how we can make education our own, for our own purpose.... Nevertheless, all the other cuts ring powerful and true."},{"rating":"2","title":"real","review":"I just read a review that a guy named Nick gave to the album, and I understand his views as far as feeling racism from the album. But I believe that maybe it is better to step back and really look again. What I hear is not directed to ALL whites. Maybe that is not what I want to hear, DP is directing their feelings towards the whites that have held people down. We all know that all white people, just as blacks and other races, cannot be characterized into one. And I also know that DP is smart enough to know the difference between the different types of whites. Me being white, I know people like the ones they speak of, in all races. I feel what they are saying all the way and also can relate to much of it, believe it or not. And some black folk may not be able to relate, so really I feel that as an individual, you take it as you choose.

Sending a message to the people and to those opressing the people, Dead Prez holds no bars to get the message across.

Told it was political, a la Public Enemy (to site a trite exemplar of poli-rap), & organic, a la Roots (another trite exemplar of a particular rap sect). So, liking much of the output of each subgenre to which I heard DP compared, I expected good things. I put it on the ol' laptop Cd player, though, & got nothing from it. The instrumental backing was deadening, the flow uneven, the politics not-thought-thru... If there is one thing --- in fact, it's the only thing --- I don't need in my record collection, it's bad music that the artists are obviously trying to hard on whild having too little ability to actualize what they are trying hard on... & the Dead Prez disc Let's Get Free, same as the entire Reggie & the Full Effect catalogue, Tool's Lateralus, & Dylan after '75, is bad. Plain & simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Political and racial messages aside, this album is very bad. The monotonous lyrics and insipid beats make my ears want to escape from the wackness that is Let's Get Free. Now, there is one exceptional song on this album. Track #15, You'll Find a Way is very good. An instrumental song seems extremely out of place on this horror of an album, but at least it's well done. With the muted cornet, drum beat, and piano this track makes one wonder as to what was going on during the rest of the album. I recommend not getting this album because it is very poor. If I want to listen to a speech about equality I will do so. I do not need noise from Dead Prez. I urge people not to buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"dopest thing after immortal technique","review":"its too raw dawg real talk all songs empowering and amaizings yo buy this son rawest rap group out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Hip Hop","review":"Just as Rage against the machine did in the rock world, dead prez has succesfully used hip hop as a form of spreading awareness about racism and the injustice that occurs to people of color. It is nice to hear hip hop that can teach you something if you listen. As opposed to complete BS we hear on radio and mtv. Hip Hop has grown into a type of music with no meaning lately. The songs are constantly about drinking, women and drugs. The lyrics have gone from Tupacs genius to p diddy, nelly, and ludicris' stupidity. Listen to any of those artists' albums and you will here the same thing over and over. But with dead prez, they have a message that you dont get with very many hip hop acts. They are different, and what they rap about is meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated!","review":"I read Three Faces years ago and found it fascinating, but have since read I'M EVE by Chris Costner Sizemore and Elen Sain Pitillo and agree with the reader who says that the false information published in the original Three Faces books was no longer relevant.

On these two counts I am delighted with the 8260.What has been disappointing is the inability of the 8260 to track through even slight fingermarks or surface problems on CDs, especially CD-Rs. The thing is built like a tank, so it's hard to understand how the pickup could be that sensitive.

With Rose Madder, King seems to want to grow up and tackle a serious subject-that of spousal abuse. However, he fails miserably for the simple reason that the book is damn boring. Moreover, King's patented stupidity creeps in here and there, mixing fantasy and other boring silliness, when the subject of spousal abuse itself would have been enough to provide serious horror and drama. Also, the villain (norman something) is too one-sided and cartoon-like to be ever taken seriously. In short, the book is a phony mixture of melodrama and silliness. that'll put most readers to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books Ever","review":"I am writing this review to try and save others from wasting any time on this book. I really should have put Rose Madder away after the first couple hundred pages (which were passable), but I just kept hoping that things would improve. They don't.Rose's forays into the alternate dimension that exists behind the picture that she picks up in a pawn shop (where she finds new love) are ridiculous and boring. I've read a lot of Stephen King, and appreciate the supernatural elements that are always injected into his writing, but I can't help but think that this concept was dreamed up under extreme deadline pressure.Don't waste one cent buying a used copy of this book, or a minute of your time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as he can get","review":"I generally do not do reviews.

The painting evokes so much emotion from Rosie...and the mythological symbolism of the minotaur, the labyrinth, the river of forgetfulness, the Demeter/Persephone pomegranate allusion...brings so much clarity to the levels on which the story can be read. I am sure I will reread it - if nothing else to be able to put Norman to rest again, as that felt really good (but I have to admit I wished he was caught by the police and suffered in the real world - but the punishment in that wouldn't be as capital as the painting's).

I was thrilled by the beginning, irritated by the end. Nevertheless, it was a creative attempt, and I always admire that in any artist. I just wish King had stayed with reality instead of suddenly jumping into fantasy. Nothing wrong with fantasy, but it just didn't \\"go\\" here, at least for me. I finished it, but it was a grueling experience. I kept hoping it would get good again. Also - the ending was a feminist tract. And I am a dyed-in-the-wool feminist. I just don't love blatant politics with my fiction. Now, for a subtle feminist novel, one that really packs a punch in that area, read Deloris Claiborne - it's a masterpiece of courageous womanhood against the odds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rose Madder","review":"This book is excellent. I can really relate with the life of the main character. The book starts out with a wife Rose Daniels of an abusive husband. She can't get the courage to leave him and she has been taking these beatings for around fourteen years. Finally one day she gets the courage to leave him and she moves away. It seems that everything will be all right from here on out but what she doesn't know is that her husband can't live with out her and is looking for her. This book is written from what seems like a person who has been in an abusive relationship there self. Stephen King puts you in this book he makes you feel like you are the one doing all the actions through out the book. I would definitely recommend this book but I would have to say it should be read by a more mature reader. There are a few dry parts in the book but over all it is great and you wont be able to put it down from the time you pick it up or at least I had a hard time putting it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Good for Writers looking to Discern technique","review":"As a fellow writer I admire Stephen King's novels filled with creativity. Yes, this book drags on too long, yes it's repetitive (I wanna talk to you, up close), yes the characters are characatures, and yes the painting concept is ill-conceived.That said, it was worth reading for me as a writer because it gave me some good ideas to use for my own writing. I'd say the weakest part of King's book is the dialogue, but you have to know how difficult it can be to invent dialogue for fictional characters. The strongest aspect of his writing is descibing what goes on in his character's minds. This he's masterful at. But I'd say the more realistic the characters and story, the better the fiction. The characters in this novel are not well developed. Speaking as a regular reader, the book draws you in with an interesting scenario and just keeps you interested enough to keep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"TYPICAL of KING","review":"He never fails to dissapoint me. (with the exception of Delores Claiborne)As usual, he reels you in with an intense, easy to read storyline and then lets you die a slow, agonizing death through the last 1/3 of the book. Too sci-fi with the painting. The most horrifying aspects of any of King's novels have been characters/events that can actually exist - THAT is horror. Not some boogeyman/bull in an animated oil painting. He should learn to leave well enough alone instead of going off on a (bizarre) tangent every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bombed half-way through!","review":"Why incorporate supernatural events into a book without explaining them adequately? Rose Madder has a supernatural sequence weaved into the plot which leaves the reader astounded.

I recommend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea ruined by Stephen King-stupidness.","review":"In my opinion, the last good novel this guy wrote was Misery. Since trying to stay awake through Insomnia and loathing Regulators, I've decided to give the rest of his novels 100 pages before I decide to trash it or stay with it. Live is just too short to waste time when there are so many far superior authors out there. If I didn't keep getting these Stephen Kings as gifts I probably wouldn't bother at all. On to Rose Madder. I have to admit, by page 80 I was very hooked. Everything went along quite nicely until around page 300, when the patented Stephen King-stupidness kicked in. You know what I mean: the villian starts spewing that gawd-awful baby-talk....\\"Anna-Anna-bo-Banna, banna-fanna-fo-Fanna\\". Give me a break. When is King going to grow up with his readers?

For a span of several years, it appeared that Mr. King was content only to shovel out the same stories only substituting different names for the characters and a different monster for the antagonist. Not anymore. King has come back with a vengeance and given us the scariest \\"monster\\" to date in the form of psychotic police detective Norman Daniels who relentlessly stalks his runaway wife. Norman Daniels makes Hannibal Lecter look like a boy scout. The book's characters are very well-rounded and the situations are quite believable.

Stephen king does it (again) with his book Rose Madder. It is an insightful look into the strange twisted world of domestic violence and is perhaps one the best reads I've had in a long time. The pace of the story is what drives the plot so well. It is similar to being trapped in a room with a wild animal: no rest until release comes in the closing of the tale. A very well thought out and well researched book. I'm afraid that Stephen King still has even more sides to his personality that we have yet to witness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ze Bool","review":"I regard this work by Stephen King as one of the weirdest.

I think it detracted from the story because it seemed like it came from The Dark Tower novels (don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of the Dark Tower, just not in the middle of an otherwise somewhat reality-based novel).Mr. King's portrayal of the abusive husband who's also a serial killer on the side is chilling.

I had a hard time believing the story line.But, all that aside, whoever converted this book from its paper version to the e-book version did a terrible job. Most times when the letters 'r' and 'n' are found together, such as in the word \\"corner\\", they are replaced with the letter 'm', making the word \\"comer\\". At first I thought it was just the font being used that made me see it that way, but then I found an instance where they got it right and used the 'r' and the 'n' as they should.A lot of this book is intended to be in italics to identify whose perspective we're reading. There are many places where the italics are not consistent. Lots of other cases of poor spacing and poor editing of the e-book version, which detract from the natural flow of the book, and distracts the reader. I'm really very surprised to see that they're asking $8.99 for something that is so poorly done. It should be free."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my least favorite King stories...","review":"As an avid King reader, I read them ALL, the reviews be damned!

All in all this is a good book, although the thing with Norman's rubber bull's mask was a little stupid, appeared to be to me at least, but the story about Rose, who her character unfolds during the development of the novel, who she enters the mystical world of Rose Madder - that's great, really great. In my eyes this is a very classic Stephen King, very classic writing, very classic elements of story, but on the other hand it is not. It is a wonderful story of love, lost, and pain, a story that has its own mythology, its own pace and most of all a character made out of flesh and blood, not of ink and paper. Rose is a woman you can see, hear, feel, touch ... she is as true, as this story is - because it is true to the most important thing about a book: the story itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by a horrible ending!","review":"I was really enjoying this book and was looking forward to the denouement, when King drops this absolute schlock on my head.

I wasn't used to reading books over 400 pgs. long, but once I started reading I couldn't put it down. What I loved about this book was the characters and the way he described them. Very detailed. The most favorite part of my reading was from one of the main characters, Norman. Stephen King not only gave a description of Norman, but described the roots of his thoughts as well, which led me to know more about this character than any other character in the book. As I read this book I found myself laughing at some parts and sad at other parts of the book. To me this book was like an all in one. Suspense, drama, comedy, and horror. Truly this book was a great enjoyment to me. This was the first Stephen King book I have ever read and I have to admit it has been one of the best books I've read so far.

And, despite it's 595 pages (books of this length usually loose my interest), finish it is what I did, in 4 short days. I could literally not put this book down, and when I eventually had to, I could not wait until I could pick it up again. I was almost saddened by the fact that I had finished it.

Like others who've reviewed the book here, I found myself reduced to skimming these sections.My other problem with the book is the excessive and equally numbing vileness of the wife-abuser Norman. King seems to relish, in some weird self-indulgent way, his chance to embody this repellant character. It's all overwritten. When one vile, mysognist fantasy would do, we're treated to fifteen.

Of course it does say on the box in rather small print (although I could not find this mentioned anywhere in the description of the product) that it doesn't work on fabric. This is correct. It doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong velcro and strong adhesive","review":"I bought this after trying a piece that a friend gave me. Velcro sticks great. Adhesive sticks well to a clean, relatively smooth surface. Has survived outdoors for one Las Vegas summer (so far). This velcro is made in white and in black. Won't adhere well to cloth and sewing is not possible (gums up the needle). Expensive, but well worth it. I'll buy it again in a few years when I've used up my first box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely sticky adhesive and realize the color is WHITE","review":"This product is very useful if you need have Velcro tape as the adhesive is extremely strong.

Having said that, the CD is fantastic, I really am pleased overall with what I heard, so much so, that I ordered Hypnotic the same day.

Great job Paul."},{"rating":"1","title":"The CD wrapping was tighter than this CD","review":"Obviously Paul Taylor didn't show Jeff Kaz his walking papers from the Rippingtons because he was the better player.

I love trance, and the combo of opera and trance is enchanting. I heard many familiar opera songs on this CD, such as Haberana and Pomp & Circumstance Opus 39, No.1-D-Major (which is the song they play at graduations). My favorite song on the disk, however, is Chariot of the Sun. It's enchanting, and one of those tracks you can put on repeat and listen to over and over.I find that this CD is a love or hate, and there's rarely and in-between.

I was on a personal protest. So? I wish I could have been enjoying his latest ever since it came out. From the opening scorching track and then beyond, Chris takes the true listener to musical realms that few can achieve. Every song rocks, rolls and grinds with authentic roadhouse sweat.

Great selections here tell you how to be a general mediaeval magician about town, and the book has value in its display of rituals made from bad Hebrew, bastardized Latin and garbled Greek--with a bunch of pater nosters added for flavor. Waite was a closet Xtian dressed up in magic robes, and helped dilute the nonsense of the Golden Dawn, into even more nonsense. A pretender to scholarship, a collector of old recipes that only a magical moron would use in today's sorceries. Yes by all means get the book, read it, and have a good chuckle.

Awesome.","review":"One of the things in this installment I like most is the way the plot is drawn out for us. 9/10 of the X-men blame a steel-skinned mutant Collossus for the destruction of the X-mansion. The X-men battle Collossus while Wolverine, one of the first X-men, battles the guilty one: Juggernaut. The plot is more detailed and complex than this but I won't elaborate further. You'll have to see it yourself. But the thing I don't like about it was the way they described the Juggernaut. I think he needs more detail on the whereabouts of him and should've described more about his half-brother relationship with...

I was crazy about him. First three albums that is. Ever since then he has not had the original magic and if he thinks he is brand new I have awful bad news for him. He needs to get a brand new life besides music. There is nothing new here and very boring indeed. Even the so called smash hit \\"Little Girl\\" Sure I cried the first time I heard it. It has a good message that needs to be heard. But I could listen to this song 10 times max. As far as a hit with staying power give me a break. It is a very depressing song. Sure it has truths to it that society should address. But not on my stereo. Like I said 10 times maybe. Then hang it up.

I have yet to listen to anything else than THE LITTLE GIRL track. The rest of the CD had no impact on me.

I wish artists would consider what they are putting out to the public, even if they know that one song can carry the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Michael Montgomery's Brand New Me","review":"This album is worth it just for The Little Girl. Although the music of The Little Girl is not outstanding, and the lyrics might offend people of some religions because of the specific reference to Christianity, the spirit of the song is unsurpassed. It is a spirit for all times and all seasons, and it teaches human courage and religious values and the horrors of child and spouse abuse. It teaches us that from the ashes and from death and from horror arise life and love and understanding and faith. I can think of no greater message, and I hope that other religions and other ethical people will contribute analogous songs according to their own beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"even then is a great song","review":"the album overall isnt the greatest but it is good the song even then is just about the best song i ever heard so id recommend this album to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Little Girl Brings This Girl To Tears","review":"John Michael Montgomery's \\"Brand New Me\\" puts together all the necessary elements to present a profoundly moving country album. The highlight of this cd is the heart-wrenching \\"The Little Girl,\\" which brought tears to my eyes and warmth in my heart that only John Michael could produce. I can honestly say that no song has ever made as much of an impact on me. Other songs that stood out include the opening song, \\"Brand New Me,\\" which is an up-beat and light-hearted take on dealing with heartache. \\"Bus to Birmingham,\\" expresses the pain of letting go for the sake of love. \\"Weekend Superstar\\" describes what it's like to be a blue-collar worker with an undeniable desire to perform music. Finally, the ballad \\"Even Then,\\" bleeds a deep and honest love story told through a rolling melody. The bottom line is that John Michael Montgomery puts heart and soul into every note he sings. This album is an explicit display of all that makes country music so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance","review":"I prepare a raw diet for our dogs and needed new poultry shears to cut through chicken backs before putting them in my electric grinder.

This filter developed cracks in the metal fabric within a few months and it became almost unusable after about 5 months. Also found that the plastic extender ring did not fit snugly and often fell off. The distributor says that the filter is very sensitive, and the cracks are from tapping the filter against the lid of the garbage can to get the grounds out. Since that's the only way to remove wet grounds without washing them all down the drain, this filter is clearly too sensitive for me. Anyone who uses the tap technique should not purchase this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swiss Gold - The best coffee filter","review":"We had an old Swiss Gold filter that was labelled \\"Braun by Swiss Gold\\" for Braun coffee filters and after 2 decades of use, it developed cracks in the mesh - possibly from careless washing or banging it to get the grounds out. I was frustrated by the new Braun filters available - they are gold colored metal mesh but don't last and rust quickly. After a little research, I discovered that Swiss Gold filters still fit. The Swiss Gold filters are not cheap like the Braun filters at Walmart, but worth the money. It should last a long time with gentle cleaning - no banging on the edge of a trash can or compost container to dump the old grounds. Clive Coffee had the best price on the internet thru Amazon and shipped very quickly. The filter is great and I will be looking at other products sold by Clive Coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better tasting coffee, but use it with a burr grinder!","review":"I love the taste of coffee much better using the gold filter than with paper filters (I make drip coffee in a Technivorm Moccamaster CD).The only \\"catch\\" is that with more of the oils and flavor from the coffee coming through this filter, some very fine coffee dust comes with it. The result is some \\"sludge\\" in the bottom of the cup.I am using a cheaper blade grinder (Cuisinart DCG-12BC Grind Central Coffee Grinder) to grind my beans, which leads to grounds of varied sized (from \\"dust\\" to \\"boulders\\"). A burr grinder (such as Baratza Maestro PLUS Conical Burr Coffee Grinder) In Black - G385) would make much more even sized grounds, and once I start using one, the sludge should go away.Alas, I am one step closer to home coffee nirvana!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slow to no drip!!!","review":"This filter is too slow, and I found in order for the water to go through, I must stir the grounds constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I thought I would spend the money and get the best but it turned out to be just talk. I was using the melita 12 cup drip method grinding with a blade grinder - melita paper filters. Taste was supurb but the filters were expensive in long run. Well, the swissgold, using the same grinding method, made fine coffee except for thesludge at the bottom of the pot.The only way I could deal with the problem was to hand make a muslim liner that I place between the melita cone and the swissgold. So really, my expensive gold filter is just used to hold my handmade liner in place.To be fair, I bought an new Bodum burr grinder (thinking my blade grinder was grinding too fine), using the recomended setting for drip pots. The result... still the sludge, but not as much.The only good thing about this swissgold is the extender that comes with it, which makes it into a 12 cup filter and the gold looks good on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"Looking at all the other filters, you notice that they are not really gold - they are paint (how else can they get gold colored - magic?).

Really the only problem I have with it is the meathod of clipping it to the gamboy is a little cheap. It's kinda hard to put it in words, but you can bump the little thing and accidently unclip the battery, but thats only happened once for me. That is really the only reason I don't give it 5 stars.

The writing is superb (unlike in, oh 99% of bridge books). The hands are well chosen, a few oddities are thrown in, but most seem realistic, and the analysis manages to bring out the beautiful depths hidden in them without the endless double-dummy over-analysis so common in bridge literature.

Aside from the obvious technical mastery and consummate professionalism that both Ray Brown and the late Jimmy Rowles brought to the procedings, what made these sessions unique was the telepathic interplay between two very distinctive musical personalities.To put it bluntly, neither of these storied artists ever released finer recordings than these. The performances are spontaneous, quirky, and yet never mannered, and virtually every tune receives close to a definitive performance - even the hackneyed Bert Kaempfert \\"L-O-V-E\\" comes off as a masterpiece. The recorded sound on the original records was demonstration quality, and of course on CD you're tempted to offer the performers a drink.

Each of the foam rockets lasts for ages. Only gripe was the 3 base pieces disassemble quite easily but a little tape fixes this permanently. A bit of tape on the pipe also helps keep it pointed up. Overall an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Toy","review":"I mistakenly printed this review for the Ultra Stomp Rocket. It was the Stomp Rocket Jr. that I purchased for my 2 1/2 yr. old grandson. As I mentioned in the other review he absolutely loves it - and so do his cousins! And it is so easy and very safe for him to use (under adult supervision, of course). But I have to agree that the fins come off after only one day of (much!) use. And I'm somewhat concerned that the pad may not last too long - the plastic doesn't seem durable enough for all that \\"stomping\\" on. I'm afraid it will crack in due time. Other than that I am very satisfied with this product. I would definitely purchase another one if I have to (as long as the price remains reasonable)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun fun fun","review":"My 3 year-old and 6 year-old love this toy. The rockets are soft and light enough so as not to harm to anyone who is accidentally or intentionally hit with one (as long as you don't get it in the eye)... just like getting hit with a Nerf dart. Good for indoor and outdoor play.The launch base is fairly well made and easy to put together. Just push the pieces together and attach the hose with the carrage bolt and wingnut and you're ready to go. The bolt does not fall out of the tube which is nice. It would be nice if the base were a bit heavier. We use bean bags to stabilize it, but it is not necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hit gift this Christmas","review":"Got these for my 5 and 6 year old nephews this Christmas and they loved it.

My son and I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for sensory seekers","review":"My autistic son LOVES his stomp rocket. It is safe for inside too which is great for a rainy day. For those who are needing sensory input through their feet, this is great for that too. Take it outside and let the grown ups make the rockets go as high as they can. I recommend getting some extra rockets just in case they break or go into your neighbors yard since the price is so reasonable. Great toy for young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"best toy ever","review":"I have a 3-yr old and a 2-yr old boy and this, by leaps and bounds, is the best Christmas present ever. We have only used it inside so far, due to the weather (cold and wind) but we shoot the rockets from our basement up to the main floor (in a split level) and they both can shoot the rockets (when I aim them good) all the way to high up on the far upstairs wall. My 2-yr old LOVES retrieving them and both boys giggle uncontrollably while playing with this. It's a great winter time indoor toy because it wears them out (not only climbing the stairs to retrieve the rockets, but also trying to jump and stomp as hard as they possibly can) and we can't wait to use it in the summer when we can shoot them straight up in the air. This is much better than many other more expensive toys they've received because it's active fun and they can take turns easily plus it's for indoor or outdoor. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!","review":"I bought this for my 3yr old niece and she launches it, goes and gets it, and launches it again over and over again. It is very durable for its use and enjoyed by her and my 30yr old brother, who is just a big kid anyways. Great Job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable - love it & highly recommend","review":"I purchased this for a 3 year old boy, and he absolutely LOVED it! It kept him entertained for hours, and he was quickly able to figure out how to aim it and how to make it go farther. He was easily able to make it soar 40-50 feet in the air. We ultimately had trouble convincing him to come inside for dinner.Parents/adults beware though -- the rockets were landing in neighbor's yards and on the roof. Kept us busy, but I still think it was completely worth it, as watching the launches and seeing how much the kid enjoyed his new toy made the evening very entertaining. The family dog also got a few hits, but he didn't mind either.The little fins on the sides of the rockets are just glued on, and have a tendency to fall off. It doesn't affect the rocket launch though, so no big deal.The launch pad is made of pretty sturdy plastic. It seemed fine even after many launches off concrete.This toy is simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun for $10!","review":"I got this Stomp Rocket for my twin 3-1/2 year old boys. I wanted an \\"active\\" toy that wouldn't break right away and this definitely is everything I had hoped for! Between all the \\"stomping\\" and retrieving the rockets before the dog gets them, the boys are getting TONS of exercise! The rockets are fairly soft and we've even used it inside when the weather was crummy (and if one lands on the roof, we just wait for a gust of wind and it comes right down). They constantly want to play with it and I will probably get one more just so they don't fight over it all the time. The only complaint I have is that the plastic base (made up of three pieces that sort of slide together) keep coming apart (but the boys haul it around everywhere and are pretty rough with it, so that's probably a user problem). One cool feature is that the launcher can be \\"aimed\\" at things, instead of just shooting the rockets straight into the air. I would definitely recommend this toy....I liked the price also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!","review":"I bought this as a gift for my 4-year-old nephew. He loves it! The rockets really fly far. He loves running out to pick them up as much as he does stomping to make them go. He's had hours of fun playing with the Stomp Rocket. The stand is adjustable so he can make the rocket shoot way out into the yard, or straight up into the air. The rockets are soft foam, so there is no risk of injury for anyone who gets in the line of fire. It came with four darts which are large enough to not get lost easily, and they glow in the dark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but what a piece of cr*p!","review":"It's a basic idea and good for little kids (boys especially): jump on the pad and the rocket flies high. My son loves playing with it. Unfortunately it's the cheapest toy I've ever purchased, the quality is horrible.

They came off too quickly for our toddler even to see what had happened, which was also frustrating...very disappointing.

Our toddler constantly ate the tube and jumped on the device, which probably isn't a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Broken, in Pieces","review":"Ordered this toy to give to my toddler nephews on Christmas morning. Appallingly, the packaging and the overall quality were such that the pieces in the box were broken on arrival (little broken yellow pieces of the \\"launchpad\\").

We live on a cul-de-sac and he can go to the middle and shoot rockets for hours. He easily has the strength to shoot them very high and it took all of about 30 seconds to teach him to use the toy. The reason I rated the item four stars instead of five was due to durability. Within days, the wings on every single rocket had broken off and were lost. So, now I'm out another $6 buying more rockets and, until they arrive, we have a completely useless toy sitting in the garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Toy. Ever. (for the price)","review":"This toy combines two of my 3-year old son's favorite things: stomping and rockets. It takes seconds to put together and is ready to go. And it works.

So, it might be worth buying two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big hit!","review":"Purchased for a 5-year old, but the 2-year old loved it, too. Simple & easy toy; Few parts to break; Works as described.

Most contain the traditional elements found in still life such as flowers and fruit or portraiture and landscape painting, however with a twist. Whilst the vase may be filled with flowers as you would expect, it may sit in a slightly altered almost sci-fi world.Meyer has some fantastic creatures, my favourite being the Llamiger (cross between a Llama and a Tiger) ad the Zebrocerous (yes, Rhino and Zebra together).I also love the medusa paintings for her coloured hair, almost ribbon like but with little creatures hidden within.This book is neary all pictures with a brief introduction and preface, so if you are expecting commentary then you would be disappointed.As the \\"search inside this book\\" function was unavailable, I found pictures of Meyer's work on the internet using an image search prior to purchase.If you like her artwork, this a fine collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Disability Sport and Recreation to Recreation for All","review":"The 1989 book remains as an excellent book on a diversity of sports from scuba diving to martial arts, canoeing, ice skating and boccia with an introduction to dance, recreational games (small selection) and fitness which are internationally competitive. The major drawback is the context of disability versus a framework of recreation and sports for all, in an inclusion or integration context. The book remains a standard reference in sports, recreation and the arts, including in my forthcoming research studies, including a new motorsports research series (e.g., Car shows, car cruise-ins and bike nights in Central and northern New York; Peterpaul Recreation Park), and city level arts and culture i.e., Utica Monday Nite).

It does seem a bit stiff at first, but it softens slightly with use and you quickly get used to it. I love it just the way it is and I don't think it would be effective if it was too mushy. The only downfall I see is that it doesn't have a hand strap on the brush head and that's a big inconvenience. I made one from a wide piece of elastic and attached it to the sides of the brush with small nails. That works great and I'm very happy with my brush!

I am pleased with this brush, but it might be a bit harsh (the Tampico type) for someone who has NEVER skin brushed before. I have been happy with brushes bought at the local drug store with the softer brushes and I feel recieved the same benefit. I will continue to use this brush, but buyers if you have never used a skin brush, use this one a little lighter to the touch on your skin when you use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst brush ever!","review":"This is absolutely the worst brush ever. I purchased this brush based on the fact it is one solid piece of wood so no worrying over the brush breaking off as other brushes I have owned have done. Abd that the bristles are natural. This felt like I was cutting my own skin. I have to be extremely light in touch with this brush to avoid hurting my skin. I have continued to use every other day in hopes that the bristles will soften up but no hope there. Will need to order another brush. Do not buy this brush!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly stiffer than I might like","review":"I think this is a good dry skin brush, but I can barely use it on some parts of my body because it is too coarse. However, it is so good for the feet, knees, and elbows. Currently I use this lightly and mainly use a horsehair brush that is actually intended for polishing shoes. I like the horsehair one better because I can also use it on my face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be great, but wooden brush base split after 1 week","review":"When this item arrived, it far surpassed my expectation. The brush base was made of thick wood. There's also a plastic base between the wood and the bristles and that also appeared to be well made and substantial. And as far as the brush, it is thick and full of what appears to be well distributed, healthy, firm bristles. As far as function, the item was exactly as described; it resulted in a great massage and exfoliation of the skin (a bit tough the first use, but by the third time, my skin felt less sensitive and more stimulated). Unfortunately, after the third use, I noticed cracks in both ends of the wooden base. It was obvious that it wouldn't be long before the cracks would expand and meet in the middle. This would render the brush unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"gets the job done","review":"I like it. Its sturdy. the bristles don't come out all over the place like some cheap brushes I've found. Its ROUGH but its the perfect amount of rough. I have sensitive skin too and my skin loves this brush. It'll make you're skin soft as butter. I don't use it everyday though, just every now and then. Maybe three or so times a week. (Not that I COULDNT use it everyday...I just forget) I had no issues with the top popping off or anything. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome brush","review":"This is an awesome brush. Stiff bristles that don't fall out. Perfect! I Would recommend to anyone.

It doesn't bother me that it is so rough. My skin is so soft just \\"gently\\" brushing it. I bought this because the long handle can be removed so one can use it as a hand brush without having the handle in the way. The handle can be easily put back to get the hard to reach places on one's back. I have Keratosis Pilaris on my arms and my arms have never felt smoother. My husband loves it too. He likes to scrub his skin until its raw when he showers. After I get out of the shower I like to put onNeutrogena Body Oil, Light Sesame Formula, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2). I feel like I have baby skin! The brush is rough. I've only used it a couple of times. It's not a brush to use like you would a toothbrush or a hairbrush (intensely). Use it softly as if you had a mild sunburn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a shower brush? I beg to differ","review":"A lot of the reviewers say this is a dry brush. I find that is not very good advice for a first time user...as the bristles are extremely sharp when dry. I have not tried using oil as one reviewer has recommended, but soap and warm water are just as effective in getting the bristles the right hardness. You don't want them mushy because you are trying to exfoliate and this requires a bit of roughness (think of derm-abrasion).After softening the bristles and wetting the wood (I find the handle will never fall off if the wood is wet), I can use this nightly after a long hard day at work. It just feels really nice especially on callus/dry prone areas like my elbows, feet and knees. My only concern is how to sterilize the brush after usage and prevent the wood from rotting or getting mucky. I have considered using bleach but I have yet to try it. Will post results of that if I ever try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous brush. I needed a vegetable fiber brush for body brushing, and this is perfect.","review":"Fabulous brush.

It's not worth complaining about though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent shower brush","review":"Perfect firmness -- not to soft, not too firm. I feel like I'm really able to scrub off the dirt and dead skin from all parts of my back. It did come off the handle once, so my only little gripe is that I really don't need a handheld brush, but that would be easily fixable with a little glue, if you want it to stay on the long handle permanently. As for those who say it is too firm, well they must have thin skin. You can't please everyone.

The Howard Hughes character appears for five minutes at the beginning, then has nothing to do with anything that happens in the movie until the end. In the mean time, we get to see this looser Melvin and his slutty wife mess up their lives doing one stupid thing after another, together, then apart, then together again, then apart again. At one point they win some money on a lame TV game show, then squander the money. I never really cared about either one of them even though I'm usually a Mary Steenburgen fan. At the end Hughes dies and this will turns up (which Melvin planted) and he defends it in court. Then there's a sequence where he remembers back to his encounter with Hughes... I have to admit I was hitting the scan forward button toward the end so it's a bit of a blur. It's amazing this script ever got funding, much less some of the big name actors who have bit parts in it.Oblio"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat as a Tire That Ran Over a Cactus","review":"This movie is not at all about how Melvin's life is \\"transformed\\" by his encounter with Hughes. It is about Melvin's life as a loser, and a rather unpleasant one at that. After rescuing Hughes after a motorcycle crash in the desert, Melvin pretty much forgets about the incident; there are no further references to it until nearly the end of the film, when he learns Hughes has named him as a beneficiary in his will. Those intervening years are the subject of this movie. They aren't very interesting years. Melvin flits in an out of marriage, in and out of low-grade jobs. He is an irritating, rather dopey character, as is his wife (played by Mary Steenburgen). The acting and cinematography are pretty good, but what is the point of this movie? The will is not proven to be valid; Melvin doesn't even get the dough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Souped up santa sley","review":"I agree with the previous reviewers that this movie is quality.

It has worked well and has saved me alot of time and effort. I'm no expert on sprayers, but it seems well built and I'm impressed with its 4 filter points to prevent clogging of the spray nozzle. You may find the shoulder, chest and waist straps a little awkward, but they make the sprayer secure and comfortable to wear, even with a full tank. The pump handle is ambidextrous which is convenient for lefties. My only con is that there is alot of lost motion between the pump handle and its mounting point on the sprayer. This creates too much lost motion in the handle, and makes pumping less efficient than it should be. Otherwise, I rate the Chapin 62000 a solid 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the first use","review":"This had the best review on Amazon when I purchased however I was very disappointed when the pump cylinder at the base of the tank cracked.

The back padding is a nice touch, but somebody was not thinking, as the fill markings are UNDER the back pad. Why not on the sides?Follow-up review.

I haven't gone camping with this yet, but its a nice little tent that's simple to put up. The guy strings that come with this are cheap so I recommend on replacing them with 550 cord. I wish the front two flaps had zippers but instead it has tie strings to close them, I may sew some zippers on it. The netting does have zippers so that's good. It has a small window in the back it has a flap with zippers on the outside. The tub is nice heavy duty tarp material. Don't forget to apply seam sealer to the stitching to avoid rain leaking in. There is a video of this tent on youtube [...]This is a great little tent, great price. This would be great for someones but out bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pie Town, Photos, and the use of Propaganda.","review":"This is a fascinating account of a vanished place and attitudes that explores the use of photography to tell a story and create a point of view.

In fact, I barely got him out of the box before he began obsessively organizing my record collection by genre, subgenre, year of issue, and suitability for mix-tape inclusion.However, hindsight being 20/20, I wish I'd spent the few extra bucks to get him the optional headphones. This little guy has an unaccountable taste for Joy Division, C & C Music Factory, and the Smiths. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but frankly I'm wishing he'd mix it up a little.Also, housebreaking is a real chore.

It is easy to read, easy to follow: it presents the discrete-time and the continuous-to-discrete KFs in a clear and logical manner. The MATLAB exercises didn't seem to be integrated with the text too well, and they were written in MATALB v 4., so there are a few \\"corrections\\" that must be made (\\"randn\\" in v. 5, so all the references to \\"rand\\" in the MATLAB code must be fixed). The extended KF and some implementation issues (UDU filter, sequential estimation) are not covered as well as other topics. If you are new to the topic and are looking for a good introduction this is the book. If you already know the topic, I'd pass on the text. What I'd like to see is a new edition of Gelb, replete with MATLAB implementations.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking explanations as a textbook","review":"I am trying to learn the subject by reading this and Gelb.

I find there is too much emphasis on elementary, preliminary material, and not enough on application.I teach the subject out of my own notes (draft book) where the development follows that of Gelb, Applied Optimal Estimation, and all of the computations are done in Matlab. I first read Kalman's original papers in great detail, and rederived his work before the Gelb book (MIT Press, 1974) was published. Since the advdent of Matlab (1984) I have continued to used Gelb's derivations, and augmented that work with extensive Matlab examples.I still find Gelb more usable as a text than other, newer books, and will continue to use it along with my Matlab supplements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Holiday Movie","review":"I always enjoy this movie around Christmas.

Though I thought Mara Wilson did a good job I just didn't like the remake she was in as much as this original classic starring Natalie Wood. There is another remake, it was made before the Mara Wilson version, I never saw that version but I know that it starred Sebastian Cabot who played Mr. French in the classic TV show Family Affair, I'm sure it isn't as good as the original black and white version but I think it would be interesting to see how Sebastian Cabot did as Santa Claus. There is one thing that I really dislike though and that's the computer colorised version of the black and white original, it just doesn't look right, Looks like a little kid took a magic marker or crayon and colored over the film, and I very highly recommend the original in black and white on either DVD or video tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Miracle","review":"Naturally, Amazon has asked for a review of this purchase before I have even received it.

There is nothing about this picture that is a negative. There have been imitations, but none have come close to this production.

The very premise -- standing up to common sense at a time of the year when we want so much to believe in the inherent goodness of people -- can get you right where you live if you're willing to give yourself over to it. Edmund Gwenn and (a very young) Natalie Wood help us to do just that.The rest of the cast is a bit stilted, but it just doesn't matter. Besides, the 90-second screen debut of Thelma Ritter would make any movie a gem. (Naturally, she manages to do in those 90 seconds what most of the cast struggles to do in 90 minutes: make us believe that what we're watching could be real.)

Don't care for seeing it colorized..but someone mentioned it was also in black & white. I'm not planning to buy the blu ray because I don't see how they could improve on the original. Haven't seen anything in blu-ray that warrants buying it, but my husband seems to.As far as the movie is concerned, this is a very endearing film. How can you not love the diminutive Edmund Gwenn as Santa Claus? Natalie Wood does a wonderful job and is very believable when \\"Chris\\" blows the bubblegum bubble that snaps.

Cynically, I didn't expect to enjoy it much. So much for cynicism - the magic of the film and its message got to me. And it still does every time I watch it. Edmund Gwenn is excellent as Kris Kringle, the man who is a dead ringer for Santa Claus because he IS Santa Claus. Natalie Wood is the young girl (a cynic herself) who doesn't believe in him, having been taught by her mother, Maureen O'Hara, to be very realistic and practical. Not only was Wood a great adult actress, but she was also a gifted child star, delivering lines and emotions like a pro. Thelma Ritter has a small bit as a frustrated shopper, but she's a standout, as is the rest of the supporting cast.

It is also possible that the original film was shot with soft focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, but cover misleading","review":"The story is a classic and this original is one of the best. However, as a Blu-ray we expected a bit more. First, the cover shows the colorized version of the movie. We expected to get both, you only get the black and white version. In fact, that is all you get. Hardly worth the blu-ray disk storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie.","review":"This is a perfect Christmas movie to watch with the family.

I didn't. I got the version I see on TNT every Thanksgiving. The version that is cut up from years past. People always write that the part they love is when Maureen O'Hara and John Payne find Kris's cane by the fire place in the house for sale. For me the part that makes the movie is always cut. Tommy Mera is just done with his testimony in court and asks Kris on his way out of court for an offical football helmut and Kris says OK. After the happy resolution of the trail Maureen O'Hara ask Kris to dinner party, but Kris says it is Christmas Eve. The next scene should be the Mera house Christmas morning and Tommy getting his football helmut and mom and dad saying I didn't get it while Tommy is wearing this over sized football helmut. Until I see a completely restored version I will not buy the dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A holiday standard","review":"I never saw this one as a child but every time I have seen this one over the years it brings out the child in me.

Their sound and instrumentation is Irish but with African percussion joining the bodhran and references to eastern European folk music and Andean flute music kind of popping up everywhere. The lead singer's vocals are stunning and distinctive with a definite nod towards Bob Marley. Kila's instrumentals are a little more \\"spacious\\" than other Irish folk bands, sometimes straying into New Age territory, but this is exciting, acoustic music that had me dancing in my living room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and different!","review":"This is one of the most innovative things to hit Celtic music since Mike Oldfield. The label says \\"Acid Céili [celtic?] Tribal Groove,\\" and that's exactly what you get.

Check out Rusty Nails and the title track."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINELY BEATEN HIPPY TRAD","review":"Great addition to a Irish Trad collection but the best Kíla experience is the LIVE experience.

How wrong they were and how happy I was when I stumbled across this gem...The first De Paris album (the brothers are joined by Omer Simeon on clarinet) is actually a Jimmy Witherspoon vehicle, from the period the great singer was - for some reason - under the radar of most jazz fans... And he was at the peak of his powers as shown here by his work with the bend lead by Wilbur De Paris...However, in spite of the excellent Witherspoon album, the real reason to buy this great CD is the album \\"Wilbur De Paris Plays Cole Porter\\", in which De Paris' band, augmented by Doc Cheatham, gives remarkable, mostly new-orleansish readings of Cole Porter's classical songs.

The book is unofficially broken up into two parts: a detail description of facial, hand, and body gestures which can be used as templates for communicating and the author's advice on how to approach the creation of new Pantomimes. The book is a good study in Pantomime, a particular type of wordless narrative derived from commedia dell'arte, but not about wordless / silent theater in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unbiased Review","review":"John Antonelli's five star review praises this book for saying \\"things about Arlington County that everybody knows and no one wants to say,\\" adding that \\"Pastorelli is my favorite character.\\" What Mr. Antonelli fails to disclose here --- but readily admits elsewhere --- is that he was the model for the Pastorelli character. Not quite an unbiased reviewer, in my humble opinion. Moreover, as the book's author readily concedes, this work of fiction bears little resemblance to the real world of Arlington politics. Anyone trying to understand Arlington County by reading this book would be better off trying to drive around Atlanta using a London roadmap.

You can store a can which isn't empty attached to the gun for 30 days.You need to buy a can of great foam cleaner to clean off the gun nozzle between uses or to clean out the gun for storage. It's kind of a pain to clean hardened foam from the nozzle after using the gun.

This album is about 25 minutes worth of good beats pretty upbeat melodies and at times an occasional swing sound. It is difficult to tell whether or not the guitar is electric or acoustic at some points. Also the spotlight seems to be just as much on the sinatra-like deep voiced singing of Jim Atkins.

But the essays are written from the perspective of a psycotherapist and it presents itself that way. He is a leatherman, no question.

Would the account be a true picture of you as a person? Such is the case with this book. Clearly, because it was an unauthorized bio, the only people who would talk to the author were the people who were either jealous of, or had an ax to grind with Martha Stewart. The result is a one sided unflattering account of one of the greatest self made persons of our time. Why, I was expecting the author to try and trace Martha's ancestors back to Satan! I would not, therefore, recommend this book; unless you enjoy unwarranted hateful attacks on an american icon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A successful woman always be treated unfairly","review":"Successful women are deemed to be monsters all the time and in everywhere, from ancient to modern day and from east to west. Because Martha Stewart couldn't be that perfect and elegant, her other disgraceful side is uncovered by people who want to entertain public. That's main idea of this book, rather than to persent an insightful and true story.In the content of this book, when Martha Stewart delivered her ideas of living to male executives, those men didn't understand how she can make money and lure audience by triming roses..... I don't need to mention the result that how successful she becomes. However, the above does reveal something, that man doesn't know what woman thinks and likes. He can't analyze or criticize a woman who he understands nothing.In my country, it is like a curse that a woman succeeds in her career then her husband would become a loser.I really hope people to be nice to these exhausted women."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all Martha fans","review":"This is a fascinating and well researched book about Martha's amazing business acumen, and how she has packaged herself as a unique American icon."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It's a Good Thing\\"","review":"Having read \\"Just Desserts\\" a couple of years ago, this new volume dove-tails that to fill in the spaces of Martha's business world.

But this book does much more: not only does it paint what I feel must be a balanaced portrait of the person, it sheds light on her motivations and the type of person she inherently is (whether you like it or not). Byron's goal is honesty here, and it's needed and important to seeing past the Martha Stewart caricature we normally view. Before I started Martha Inc., I couldn't care less about the woman, but when I was finished reading the book, I had a deeper understanding of her, a better appreciation for her many accomplishments, and I even felt a bit sorry for her. I was expecting trash - but what I got was a profound surprise, and I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Scuttlebut","review":"Byron may be \\"fair\\" minded in his presentation of Martha but he would be better off as a Hollywood journalist.

I really thought it would focus on the business aspect of MSO, but instead it's just another \\"When she was good, she was very good...but when she was bad, she was rotten\\" tale that lacks any real substance. There seems to be only a few people that would give him any first-hand accounts of their experience with this overwhelmingly successful entreprenuer. This book was a total waste of money for anyone who has read Oppenheimer's Just Desserts. And does the world need a rehashing of that? With Byron's credentials and having actually met Stewart, I expect more. This is the first time I am returning a book after reading it, but that is my vote against bashing people just to make a buck!

I can't stand the phony creature myself, and she has embarrassed women everywhere with her antics, but this book is so poorly written that I cringed through at least half of it.

According to Christopher Byron, (whom by the way was turned down by Martha to write this book) Martha Stewart has not done anything good her entire life...He goes more into the detail of what her martha-wannabe ex-friends think after she dumps them...This is very poorly written book, don't waste your money if you are a fan of hers and want to know more about the company she established."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Martha's Autobiography","review":"I agree, like the \\"biography\\" Just Desserts this has more of the same tired stories of Martha's temper in full gear. By the way, though there is no excuse for bad behavior-she's human. So what. She is one of the great business women of our time. I'm looking forward to reading Martha's upcomming book to hear it straight from her. All these books with gossip and sour grapes of people who didn't climb to the top with her are getting to be a bore. It will sure be refreshing and a lot more interesting to hear the story from Martha herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is she NOW?","review":"Lacks the recent happenings of Martha and her empire.

Is it true that Byron was turned down by Martha to write this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"vampire Christopher","review":"Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture. Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha. Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploiting a topic","review":"Putting aside the fact that I'm not a Martha fan, this book is truly disappointing. It has no idea or style; it only has a topic. The book is badly researched (based on a handful of Martha's former friends and neighbors turned foes). In an attempt to \\"explain\\" pure luck and dogged will, the book dwells excessively on (nonessential for the book) issues and events such as demographic trends and world events. Two or three ideas are repeatedly recycled to fill in about a dozen chapters. The author persistently tries to relate to Martha throughout the book and with the very publishing of the book, but fails. The amount of Westport gossip is incredibly overdosed, even accounting for the tastes of readers that had bought a Martha book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about Omnimedia, mostly MS gossip","review":"I ordered this book expecting to read the history of Martha Stewart Omnimedia and how Martha Stewart acheived such phenominal success. Instead, the book focuses on Martha's personal life to an embarrassing degree, making the book almost unreadable. I don't really care if a jealous friend thought that Martha treated her husband badly; I want to hear more about how she built a hugely successful business from the ground up. This is one of the least substantive business books that I have ever read, which is surprising given the author's strong business writing background."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARTHA STEWART IS A GENIUS","review":"I'm not a fan of Martha Stewart's books, show, magazine, etc, but I think that Martha Stewart is a genius. This book does not treat Martha very nicely, but it shows you why she is successful and how she did it. Her audaciousness, as mentioned in the book, had me roaring with laughter at some points and in awe at others (why didn't I think of that???) Let's face it, if she were a man and her name were Lee Iacocca or Donald Trump her critics would have been singing her praises, and pronouncing her a visionary. If you have a business or plan to start a business you will benefit from reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martha Envy","review":"Ms. Stewart is a smart cookie and not just the baker of the \\"Cookie of the Month,\\" as many somehow believe. Were her name Mark Stewart instead of Martha Stewart, her extraordinary success would be trumpeted as a model for American perserverance and accomplishment. Instead, her life is gossiped and conjectured about mostly by men and a few women. What isn't mentioned in any discussion I've read about her success is the fact her TV program and magazine is about empowering ordinary people by deconstructing apparently complicated and intimidating tasks. If Martha can do it, then so can we. Props to you Martha, you're the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Do Martha!","review":"Gheez! Did this book ever change things for me! Having been a Martha fan for two decades, I was shocked at what I didn't know about her ascent to Omni-hood. And Byron's bibliography was the nail in the coffin. Without having verified all of Byron's sources myself, I have to say this book provides a convincing depiction of someone who will do anything for personal gain. Nothing or no one is sacred. Very sad and very disrespectful. (Only criticism: Byron belabored the similarities of Stewart and her father. Those were the only instances when I felt sorry for Stewart.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This book claims to be a biography but fails miserably to offer what a good biography does: a balanced portrait of a person's life. Instead, it reads like a story in a tabloid newspaper, which is no surprise given the fact that the author is a writer for the New York Post. There's lots of supposition and inference, some of which is almost laughable. For example, the author relates the story of the taping of Martha's first television show, a Thanksgiving special, which was supposed to be a dinner at her own home. His scoop on this? The whole thing was staged. The meal was not something that Martha whipped up in a day, but took ten people over four days to cook. Hello!!! Obviously this guy never watches the Food Channel. The list could go on, but suffice it to say that a good biography on Martha Stewart, one which actually quotes friends and family, has yet to be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secret Religious Sects?!!","review":"Where is the data about secret masonic affiliations?Where is the connection between rock and roll and Bono?Where is the biblical eschatology?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is missed up","review":"I order this part online after looking at it and checking to see what auto it fits.

Pereze-Reverte once again takes the reader to 17th century Spain and the rule of Philip IV and the Spanish Inquisition. Monty Python may not have expected it, but the Spanish Inquisition is at the heart of this tale.The story is fairly straightforward. Alatriste's poet friend the don Francisco Quevedo (an historical figure) seeks the swordfighter's help in freeing a family friend from an \\"unpleasant\\" life in a convent. Mayhem ensues and our narrator young Inigo Balboa finds himself in the tender clutches of the Inquisition.A good story, but Perez-Rverte's real strength is putting the reader inside the skin of a 17th century hidalgo as well as the fears of living in a society where the Inquisition holds sway. The presentation of an auto de fe through the eyes of one its, umm, participants is fascinating. I highly recommend readingCaptain Alatristefirst. You will understand and enjoy the book much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so; so what.","review":"Nothing special and the point of the book is never clear. There's a mission, but then we get a primer on the Spanish Inquisition [which I didn't expect ;-)], courtly behavior in Spain, and a prim look at sexual relations.

At the heart of her trial is the issue of her heritage; she is of Hebrew descent. In the course of his struggle with the prejuidices holding not only an innocent girl captive, but a nation, the captain relives his own memories of the time he was a subject of the horrors and how afraid he was.** Though historically illuminating and shocking, the seesawing back and forth between memory and present narrative hampers the flow of the novel.

But because of that they are not light. I am just using my bike to commute to work, and I'm not worried about speed, so the weight isn't a big deal to me, but you definitely can feel it. It just makes your legs stronger! I read that it is a good idea to get a tube that is a size bigger (longer) than your usual, and it's true.

At this point many, many people have already done that. I found this book to be very well written. I didn't really enjoy reading some of the subplots but appreciated their presence to further flesh out the main characters.

It appears that members of the group are also being targeted by this psychotic killer.The reader gets several hints about the identity of the killer, but Gerritsen is wise in throwing in some unexpected twists on this devilish journey.Gerriten writes muscular and unobtrusive narrative and she throws in lots of background both medical and mythological in this tense, tidy thriller that you will have a hard time putting down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The two main characters are incredibly insensitive and stupid.

Detective Jane Rizzoli and Doctor Maura Isles determine they are all connected. A group of people who are knowledgeable in evil and it's history (the Mephisto club) become involved and help to interpret some signs found at the murder scenes. I'm with Rizzoli...I like cold hard facts. These stories about evil demons and fallen angels are just not my cup of tea. Usually when I'm reading a book, it is very hard to pry me loose from it. While reading this book, I was easily distracted by anything and everything going on around me. The ending of this story was the only part I found interesting. This one was a struggle to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly.......bad","review":"What a great plot idea. Too bad it was so poorly executed.Haphazard secondary plot lines that go nowhere. A \\"mysterious\\" foundation head, who you keep expecting to do something remarkable...and yet never does. And a denouncement that's unbelievably brief after such a prolonged buildup of tension...what a let down.This book could have used a few more rewrites, or at least a better editing job."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOOOOOOPs, I forgot to write an ending","review":"My my my, another gore novel minus an ending. You better have read the prequels to this to understand the characters: you know, the stay at home Dad who is married to the overzealous detective; the mother of the Pathologist who seems to have been evil but you are given no clue why; the sex starved stalking priest who you think is the killer until he disappears from view around page 200. I could go on and on, what a disappointment. Enough gore Ms. Gerritsen, write an ending and develop your characters. A waste of money, should have waited for the paperback, would have burned better in the fireplace. You want to read a thriller? Pick up \\"What matters Blood\\". That is a fun read. I put Mephisto Club in the category of a Patricia Cornwall novel, it's like kissing your sister. Ain't nothin to it! OOOOOPs, I ain't got a sister and this book ain't got an ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"I have really enjoyed the earlier Rizzoli books. This one was very disappointing. I found my self not caring how it ended. Maura seems to have retired from her ME job. She is too busy with her personal life to be productive to the story line. I enjoy mysteries but I am not sure I will finish this book. I will be careful and read the reviews of Garrison's books before buying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts Strong But Goes Rapidly Downhill!","review":"Let me start off by saying that if you haven't read any of Gerritsen's books featuring her two main characters, don't even consider reading this book. So much about the characters deeply depends on your being familiar with their history. Even if you have read other books with these characters, The Mephisto Club, while starting off with a lot of suspense, is a disappointment. The plot drags and requires you to suspend belief way too much, there are too many subplots that are left dangling, and the ending -- what there is of one -- is weak and unsatisfying. All in all, I'd advise you to skip The Mephisto Club. Your time and money are too valuable to spend on a book that, at best, is mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read !","review":"Just finished this book. Hard to put down.

This is my first experience with Tess Gerritsen and will most likely read more from this author.

An entertaining read nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This was the first book by this author that I have read and it will be my last. I thought the two main characters were uninteresting and were one-dimensional. The story started off okay, but by the time I had finished half the book I was rapidly losing interest in the story. If I had liked or felt drawn to the main characters in any way, I might have finished the book despite a mediocre story. But, once the story, went off track, I just couldn't get myself to finish the last 1/4 of the book. And it is very very rare that I don't finish a book that I start. I just couldn't waste any more of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harlequin Romance !","review":"If Tess is going to continue to write books like this, she should switch her publisher to Harlequin Romance, it will give the unsuspecting buyer a \\"heads up.\\"It is not possible to describe the many short falls of this rather long boring novel without giving the romantic subplots away, let just say that the ME does no pathology as she is way too busy whining about an unatainable romance and the detective does no detecting as she is totally wrapped up in her parent's pathetic lives.There is a bit of a mystery bouncing around in the book, but it is hardly worth wading through all those pages.Come on Tess, you can do better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please.","review":"This book with such a fascinating premise never really got started.

I think the director did a fair job at recreating the book, though probabaly gave into the feeling that he had to please the audience more than stick to what the film really should have been. The psychedelic montage of Charly on the motorcycle probably pleased audiences and helped to even draw a few people in tht normally wouldnt have watched a movie like this. However, I think he did, at times, hit the nail on the head by showing how people treat someone that is mentally retarded, the sort of coming of age, and how a mentally retarded person acts differently than a more intelligent person. It is a comparison movie that strayed some from the book, but was still a very good movie. I highly recommend it to everyone.

The use of \\"psychedelic\\" split-screen was at once annoying and laughable. Claire Bloom fared best as Charly's sympathetic teacher but less so as his sexy lover. Consider this a movie with noble but failed intentions. Either that or time has not been kind to this sixties relic.

Well, I was very excited to be able to see this book put into life on the screeen, only to be terribly dissapointed. I'm rating this movie by the book it was compared to, and in relation to \\"Flower's for Algeernon\\" this movie was terrible. The movie totally left out half of the book, and made a disgrace of what they put into it. I also felt Cliff Roberstson portrayed Charly poorly.

Wynton Kelly on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, Jimmy Cobb on drums, with Sam Jones switching with Chambers on bass. The music featured here is a showcase for Kelly's lyrical piano, and Wynton is locked in tight with his sidemen throughout all eight selections. \\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\", \\"Sassy\\", and Kelly's take on \\"Autumn Leaves are all highlights.

Weinberg's book describes several key aspects of consulting,which a consultant needs to know for success. Trust of the client, pricing the consultant can live with, pitfalls to avoid are some topics. Though Weinberg describes general management consulting, his principles extend to other consulting fields. Best of all, I know when to say $100 an hour, and when to say $50, and to be happy with the result.Yet the reading is light and enjoyable.

Seems like you are working with a floppy.Fourth, its Mojo software hangs all the time.Fifth, it sucks battery life.Sixth, if your MP3 is not in a directory, i.e. if copied directly, it wont show.

I have often been disappointed by the depth of knowledge that some 'trainers' actually have, but this package is supported by vast in-depth knowledge of the product. My only gripe is that I had to solve a major no-show problem with the Virtual PC image (provided with the training DVD) without support. Pilothouse Consulting recommend 512MB of RAM minimum and were surprised to hear that I was running Virtual PC on a standalone (??).

Some of the yields are so poor that I maintain commercial samples of the products so that students will have something to characterize. I have even written the authors with questions about improving yields in some of the experiments, but received few suggestions for improvements. Also, very few of the experiments take the students through reasonable purification steps for the products (I suppose because the yields are so low).

He is a jazz fan, but didn't realise this recording existed."},{"rating":"2","title":"History in the making","review":"This recording is an essential addition to any serious Jazz collection, capturing as it does five Jazz giants recorded together for the one and only time.Charlie Parker is on Alto Sax, Dizzy Gillespie Trumpet, Bud Powell Piano, Charles Mingus bass and Max Roach on drums. From the first number \\"Perdido\\" you know this something special. A medium tempo version which never stops swinging. Gillespie in particular is in fiery form on this number. On \\"Salt Peanuts\\" Bud Powell plays a memorable solo, which precedes a thunderous drum solo from Max Roach.The atmosphere is fantastic with the crowd applauding the musicians solos, and sometimes you can hear the musicians cajoaling each other to better performances. Considering the recordings are over fifty years old the sound is pretty good. The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because there is a newer 'complete' version of this recording.Sadly Max Roach the last surviving member of the this quintet has just died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with my order experience for this product. The unit quantity was listed as a case of 12 1.5 pound packages. I received a shipment that only included one 1.5 pound box of lentils. After calling the help line to get the problem corrected, I was assurred the problem would be corrected. When my second shipment arrived, it contained only another 1.5 pound box of lentils. I called again, and was refunded the difference. All I wanted was what I ordered, which I never got. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun, and so moving","review":"How could you go wrong with 3 Tony Award Nominees????? Mary Testa, Chip Zien, and Alison Fraser! It's amazing! Plus the one cast member I was not familiar with, Joanna Green, is also superb. Just so you know.. the songs on the cd are not in the same order they are in my script. The closing number on the cd (not counting the bonus track) is actually the opening number. \\"Marvin's Giddy Little Siezures\\" which opens the cd is in the middle of the show. This is why it seems so helter-skelter. I don't why it was done like this... but it was. The show's performances sell it though. The performances are enfused with pathos, but they all have great comedic timing as well. William Finn's music is incredibly catchy, but also complex. Although poorly recorded, it's wonderfully performed, and a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book...and a shocking secret","review":"This was a really good book. I read it in one day. The only thing is Elizabeth was really acting like...well...a sl#t. I mean,really...she is supposed to be the good twin. It was kind of upsetting though because she is my favorite twin. Anyway,it really was great. A real page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great tracks, but they are all in mono on this CD!","review":"This CD is a digital edit (a DJ mix assembled on a computer rather than a live mix set) of classic Todd Terry tracks from 1988, plus 3 tracks from 1994. The music is great, but there's just one major, major problem with this disc. The intro and segues are in stereo, but the tracks are all in mono! This is fine if you are blasting it at a party or on a crummy car audio system, but for any other kind of listening, it is terribly annoying.Since I have the original 12\\"s of a number of these tracks, I know that Todd Terry's music was in fact recorded in stereo. It is a crying shame that the dj who mixed the disc, Anthony Acid (an artist who released some mediocre dance tracks of his own back in the day), mastered all the tracks mono and left his segues in stereo. Was it intentional? I wonder..."},{"rating":"1","title":"why bother?","review":"i cannot recommend this book at all, except as an example of what the genre has sunk to. the characters are trite, the story is absolutely uninteresting. jones basically decided he needed to make a quick buck and decided to exploit the heroic fantasy genre. there's no dramatic or narrative tension driving this story forward at all. you can all but see the numbers in the template (and it wasn't a good one) he followed to write this book. i'm dismayed (but not surprised) that eos has the audacity to publish a second book in the series. no wonder heroic fantasy continues to have a bad name. (i gave this book one star because the format wouldn't allow me to give it none.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice start ,but dies by mid book","review":"The start of the story was very good, but by the middle of the book it just limps along. The main characters kept second guessing what they had done. This gets old fast. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great escape reading!","review":"Just as the Blues in music has a formula, so does epic fantasy. The Stone and the Maiden follow this formula faithfully with real bad guys versus real good guys, magic, wizards etc. Nothing new here for sure but what do you want? Tolstoy? Don't expect too much from this genre, because you'll be disappointed. This book certainly delivers what a good fantasy should and that is escape reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saints by whose criteria?","review":"Having glanced through the book I became unsure of of the credentials of the persona within. Seeing descriptions like \\"the first feminist\\" and references to alchemy made me feel uneasy. The Czar Nickolas listed as a saint also caught me as slightly odd. Looking at the back cover I see that the author has also written book(s) on witches and witchcraft. I personally don't think one can be true to both genres. Look elsewhere for a book of saints."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mouse for a Superman","review":"The mouse works well. A mere click turns it on, without a complex and confusing setup process. In that respect I cannot complain. You start working with it and get excited that it works so well, without any problems, that you cannot believe. But you quickly notice that it is heavy, and in less than five minutes your hand drops dead. Oh boy! It feels like you are moving a ton of bricks. I went back to my corded mouse, a cheap Ativa, which, even if it is not as good, I can move with ease. I gave the Philips mouse two stars because it works very well, but you need superpowers to move it after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"cowboy boot charm","review":"The charm did not arrive in a timely manner after purchase and the charm was flat on one side with the design on the other side only. The description given could have been better explaining the design of the charm.

Because it consists of reprints of a series in a regional magazine it doesn't have the development one would expect in a book. Finding specific information is largely a hunting process- better indexing would help. There is, however, a great deal of information to be found and I'd say the book is indispensable for anyone researching 20th century Judaism in the southern US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not orginal hits","review":"How is it possible that Mr. Jones' major attribute -- his big brassy voice -- can sound so sad and weak?

The amazing remix 'Rockit (Megamix)' is alsoquite stunning with some very creative use of samples(ahead of its time).The problem is that whoever remastered the music followsthe modern trend of overcompressing the music, drainingall dynamic range out of it to increase the apparent loudness.This makes the music jump out at you, but it's verytiresome on the ears and drains the life out of it.Personally, I can't even listen to the CD anymore.I would recommend prospective buyers pick up one of the oldschool hip hop compilations with Rockit on it instead(the other tracks on the LP/CD haven't aged as well)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Laswell And Hancock Funkit!!!!","review":"THIS IS FUNKY STUFF!!A little Material,a little Kraftwerkand ALOT of Grandmixer DST's scraching up against Herbie'ssynthesizers and catchy tunes.\\"Rockit\\",of course,is \\"Rockit\\"but the pulsing electro-funk of \\"TFS\\" and the more traditionalfunk grooves of \\"Autodrive\\" and the groovalastic Curtis Mayfield cover tital track,beautifully sung by Dwight Jackson Jr. and the more exotic world-fusion influenced \\"Earthbeat\\".No dullmoments or downtempo songs on \\"Future Shock\\".Herbie's best inthe 1980's-BAR NONE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK","review":"I did not enjoy reading this book at all. I felt it was very poorly written, and unprofessionally put together. The plot at times was at times ruff edged, and the authors ideas did not have a flow to them. Along with the poor plot, the homosexual references throughout the novel were ill called for and, at times, unfound. The sheer length of the book was totally unnecessary, for a boring story like this could be told over a fire in less than 10 minutes. This is a story that belongs around the camp fire, instead of selling (or not selling rather) for $25, paperback at that. I do not recommend this book, no doubt written will running from boarder patrol, to any innocent fantasy story seeker, or educated novel reader.4 shizzel"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Betsy-Tacy Series","review":"The Betsy-Tacy book series is fantasic, to say the least. When I was little, my mother read them aloud to my brothers and I. That's not to say they're only for children. Anyone will love these timeless classics. They feature Betsy Warrington Ray, a young aspiring writer, who's character is actually based closely upon author Maud Hart Lovelace's Life. In the first book, 'Betsy-Tacy', Betsy has her 5th birthday party and invites her new neighbor, 5-year-old Tacy Kelly. Soon to make their twosome a threesome, Tib Muller moves to the neighborhood from Milwaukee. They become great friends and the books take the girls through high school and beyond. The books in the Betsy-Tacy series are:Betsy-Tacy, Betsy, Tacy and Tib, Betsy and Tacy Go Over the Big Hill, Betsy and Tacy Go Downtown, Heaven to Betsy, Betsy in Spite of Herself, Betsy was a Junior, Betsy and Joe, Betsy and the Great World, and Betsy's Wedding.I recommend these books highly; everybody should read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A million Betsy fans can't be wrong.","review":"This review could be written for any of the Betsy books, but this one is my fave. Like all of the books in the series this book is about the life of a young girl in Minnesota. Not only is it interesting from a historical perspective--what they wore, what they did--it is also just a great story about a family that never gets sentimental or preachy. The characters are also well developed, including the minor characters that reappear in the series. It is interesting to note that althought these books take place in the early 1900's and were written in the 40's (I think) Betsy and her sister Julia both plan on going to college and having careers. My mother read these books and passed them along to me and even though I am in my 30's I still reread them every few years. I have also introduced them to young readers with great success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classics still for kids","review":"We were just thrilled to have someone tip us off to the Betsy Tacy series. I read them to my 7 and 5 year old girls and they love them. The 40's live on and teach us that little girls will forever be fun and imaginative when given the chance to play and be together. Turn off the TV and games and get into this series and this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mighty Mighty Dells","review":"I love this CD.

Luckly I purchased the gloves via Amazon and will send them back and let Amazon fight it out with the seller. Why can't we buy clothing that is made with quality and pride?

But, it does make a good decoration!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than commented on","review":"Having seen her perform in Pal Joey in London and again in My Old Lady in Hollywood, I was quite interested to read her story. I was not disappointed. The book tells HER story, not the story of O'Toole and others. For the lady who wanted gossip, I suggest getting the scandal sheets at your local super market when you check out.The book covers not only her stage career and O'Toole relationship, but her thoughts and feelings about both and many other aspects over about a 40 year period.It is an intimate commentary on what she was going through from day, week, month and year onward.For the comment that O'Toole wrote a good book... that is rubbish. He can't hold a candle to her as a writer. His \\"style\\" is awful. A poor man's James Joyce! And Joyce was bad enough himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted more dirt","review":"If you want to hear droning stories about British theatre life, then this is your baby. However, if you're hoping for some juicy revelations about Peter O'Toole, look someplace else. What a crushing disappointment this is. Sian was married to O'Toole for 20 years and during the height of his world-wide fame. She was with him during his breakthrough role as Lawrence of Arabia, in Becket, Goodbye Mr. Chips, and all his other stellar 60's roles. I expected gobs of gossip on Taylor and Burton, but Sian merely relates Peter's drinking binges with Burton and the fact Kate Hepburn referred to Liz and Richard as \\"fat pigs.\\"And what about O'Toole's drinking? As one of the most famous drunk actors of all time, in the league of Lee Marvin, Burton, Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, I expected some fireworks in this area. Forget it. Sian clinically describes Peter's addictions, his out of control lifestyle and racing cars, but it's all told in a desperately dry manner. All very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is there more?","review":"As a self taught sewer, I always enjoy learning a new skill and finding out new things that didn't take at first exposure. He starts from step one and proceeds to sewing a useful project. This is definitely a new sewer DVD but he is very patient and demonstrates things very clearly.

The heroine is manipulative and thoroughly confused...Alpin would definitely be branded as a flake in today's society. As for Alpin's leading man-Malcolm-He had a knack of changing his personality constantly, and I felt only pity for this character. I also found the lack of respect for the religious content aggravating and offensive. I felt I couldn't grasp any sort of interest with the book... I truly prefer the novels by the following authors: Elizabeth Lowell, Julie Garwood, and Iris Johansen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beginning, horrible ending","review":"***SPOILER WARNING***In the beginning, each of the heroes wanted to deceive the other. Malcom, however, outgrew his need for revenge, managed to forgive Alpin and tried to make a happy future for both of them. The heroine was horrible. She behaved childishly, never told Malcom what she wanted and what was wrong, didn't believe him when he told her that he loved her and jumped to stupid conclusions. She tried to run away from him - not once, but five or six times. It was horrible. And then Malcom behaved as if he had no back bone at all - he always brought her back, didn't even give her a proper tongue-lashing, but just put up with her behavior. I wished he would just let her go and find another woman. I don't know how he could love such a selfish, childish creature. In the end, I lost all respect for him. I had to force myself to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alpin's Goodness not Believable","review":"Malcolm was a fine character, even if he was a bit dull, but Alpin was awful. I just didn't buy her altruistic ways. She'd been so devious in the past, I found it hard to like her. She was quite a hateful child to Malcolm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars ... In Deference to this Great Author","review":"I do love A.L. and most of her books, but this was not one of them. I couldn't wait to read it after reading the wonderful book BORDER LORD, about Malcolm's father, Duncan Kerr. THAT book was great, THIS book was awful. So boring, the plot was not interesting, and the characters were hard to get to know. I was SO disappointed, as I'd waited a while to get this one, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Too Boring...","review":"Compared to Border Lord, this book was a drag. Very boring. The characters were flat, and just not interesting in any way. I hate to say that because I love Arnette Lamb's books, and this annoyed me no end to read such a bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Best Sunscreen","review":"This is seriously the best baby sunscreen out there. My son is blonde/blue eyes and we've been using this on him since he was 6 months old and he's never had so much as a light tan - it stays on and requires very little re-application (maybe only once or twice in an entire day). It also goes on white so you know if you've missed a spot (but absorbs quickly). I am very paranoid about sunburn in children and wouldn't trust any other brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so mild.","review":"My daughter has a mild eczema on her elbows and knees.It gets worse if I use any soaps/cleasers other than Cetaphil.I bought this sunscreen because I heard that it was very mild.Wrong, at least for my daughter.

I am going back to Aveeno."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old product","review":"I am very disappointed that Amazon sent me a suncream which is almost expired. You can notice that this suncream was made a long time ago just looking at the case.I received it yesterday, and the expiration date is Aug 2008.

While my kids seem to respond to it fine, both of my brothers, my wife and I all had pretty strong reactions to it after a few days - our skin dried and flaked. If so many of us hadn't been using it we probably wouldn't have recognized the problem.I'm not sure of the reason, though I am at least a little concerned that micronized zinc oxide is used. The micronization makes it disappear into the skin, but I know it also changes the chemical properties of metals. Could be totally unrelated, but no matter, I now have a gallon of sunscreen I won't be using."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sunscreen Expert","review":"All I have to add to early comments are a few words on water resistance. The standard Blue Lizard formula advertises it is water resistant for 240 minutes. This stuff is not, even though I see the same claim made for it on some web sites. Chemical sunscreens, which are in the standard Blue Lizard, are absorbed into the skin, which makes them more water resistant. The ingredients in Baby, zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, sit on top of the skin and are more easily washed off. I sent a note to the Blue Lizard people who confirmed this. So be careful about reapplying this more frequently if you or your kids get wet. Unfortunately, we learned the hard way with our 8-year-old."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great!","review":"Even though normally I'd hate paying this much for a bottle of sunscreen, with this product it's worth it. My daughter has a terribly sensitive skin; she can't go without sunscreen, but she also has a bad reaction to most types I've tried this summer - except for this one. I've tried it on our pediatrician's recommendation, and so far, it works just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dermatologist Recommended","review":"I bought this product because it was recommended to my by my dermatologist. She actually recommended the Blue Lizard Baby for me, an adult. The baby lotion is strong enough for adults, but sensitive for babies so that it makes a GREAT sunblock for EVERYONE. Since the baby formula is for sensitive skin it is even safe enough to wear on the face without having to buy additonal 'face' sunscreens. No problems with leaking bottles nor with it being too thick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parabens","review":"Reading a review from the smaller bottle it mentioned that there are parabens listed in the ingredients event though the product is listed as chemical free.

Now, at 22 months, he uses 4 word sentences,is potty training himself, and counts to 10 and back (and I only knew about Vol.2! ) This does not create \\"superkids\\", it merely teaches the parent how the baby's brain is developing and how to involve themselves with exercises to maximize growth. Every area of brain development has corresponding basic exercises which are explained in detail. The baby sets the pace so there is no stress involved. More user friendly than \\"What to expect\\" and equally, if not more important. Crucial for stay at home parents, daycares, and shower gifts!

It was so bad that I had to go online to check out other reviews and see if it was just me or if the book was this pathetic. I'm an avid reader and read everything from biographies, to suspense/adventure/horror/sci-fi novels. I'm also a musician and did the band thing at the same time as the story setting. I was hoping to find a nice novel to reminisce too.Was I ever wrong. The whole novel has a horrible literary style...constantly name/product dropping, as if the author would identify an object in the book (i.e. atari 2600) and then go into excruciating detail to describe the object. The book went nowhere, and worse yet, it took forever to get there. I highly recommend avoiding this garbage- it was sad that trees had to be killed to produce this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful \\"writing\\"","review":"The \\"typist\\" of this book should go back to his day-job. Great idea, wrong \\"author.\\" Un-forgivably bad writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY, a GOOD book about our Generation","review":"This is Gomez's second novel, a sort of sequel to his first, Our Noise, which had the same concerns as his current book: The cataloging and critique of the current generation of twentysomethings. Geniuses has to do with a band, Bottlecap, from his first novel, and tells the story of their disasterous foray into a recording contract with a major label and the recording of their debut record.Gomez has all the details right about what it's like to be young and live in the Los Angeles, as well as puncturing the pretensions of the indie versus major label arguement. This was a totally fun book and great read that anyone in their twenties (or beyond) would enjoy.He's the only writer under thirty who matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Redux: Gomez Pens Another","review":"\\"\`Chapter One,' he found himself saying, walking around the apartment, repeating, \`chapter one. . . [sic]' When it came time to follow these words with a story, characters, and dialog, he was stumped. That was why he did not take up writing\\" (p. 218). This seems as apt a description of Jeff Gomez as any, and, penned as it is by Gomez himself, one wonders why he did, of all things, \\"take up writing,\\" and then, to compound that initial mistake, choose to follow-up his ludicrously unaccomplished first novel, Our Noise (1995) with this equally dull, inept, and useless second novel, Geniuses of Crack."},{"rating":"1","title":"chickens","review":"Geniuses of Crack is a good idea, hijacked by a terrible writer. This word comes to mind: verbose. Gomez is one writer who should not quit his day job. Reading this book, I was reminded of chickens; small brains, lots of noise. Not to say Gomez has a small brain; in fact he's obviously an intelligent man; the problem is with his fingers: they don't belong anywhere near a keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make them all go away","review":"When you read a novel, it's helpful to find at least one character that is sympathetic with qualities that make the reader care about them. Don't look for such a character here. The characters are (a) shallow as a wading pool, (b) snakes in the grass, (c) complete jerks and/or (d) borderline retarded. Toss in plenty of stilted, unbelievable dialouge and mundane paragraphs setting or developing scenes and finishing this novel becomes a test of reading endurance. By the end -- if you make it -- you don't care what happens to anybody. How this set of characters ever warranted one book, much less two, is very difficult to believe or understand. Measures should be taken now to ensure these characters never surface again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gomez must be on crack","review":"This book is an absolute affront to everything. Gomez seemingly doesn't even have enough talent to rise to the level of sensationalism. Indeed, the only redeeming quality of this book is that it may give a number of fourth graders around the country hope that they too can get published. Do yourself a favor, if you want a mindless read, pick up the TV guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful look at a great plane","review":"There are a lot of words between these two covers, but I was especially taken by the photos --- especially those which show the special area at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, where AIR FORCE ONE, the president's plane, lives.This is really two books in one. It's partly what's going on today, including some inner secrets. It's also partly a history of presidential air travel. The author tells what happened to AIR FORCE ONE on September 11, 2001, and he also recounts the past experiences of presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was the first to fly while in office."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Zeke album.

The biggest difference from the previous three (four if you count the new singles comp, \\"Pinstriping The Dutchman's Coffin\\") is that Blind Marky has totally renovated his vocal style, going from the fast-paced barks of old into all out screaming pulled straight from the grooves of a Slap-A-Ham \\"Bleeeaaauurrgh!\\" compilation.Other than that, it's the same ol' Zeke. The songs are getting a bit longer, with only four or five missing the one minute mark, but the thrash songs still shred and the slow songs still swing. A hilarious cover of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rhiannon\\" is included, complete with Marky transforming the chorus into \\"Rhiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh!\\"A good Zeke albums, but this one is most likely only for the fans. \\"Flat Tracker\\" is a much better place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A short review","review":"In honor of the brevity of most of the songs on \\"Dirty Sanchez,\\" I've decided to keep my review brief.

If not, then ignore what I say because it's to be expected.What I see are false teachers, that have dredged up, and are spewing 2000 year old garbage in an attempt to turn people away from true gospel of Jesus Christ. But, that's what false teachers do... falsify information, distort truth, destroy faith, lie, and cause confusion.Judas had full access to Jesus, night and day, for 3.5 years... then he betrayed the Son of God with a kiss, for 30 pieces of silver. He was a traitor! Nothing more, nothing less.\\"The Gospel of Judas\\" was not written by Judas Iscariot... it was written abt 120 years after his death by another of the many false teachers trying to destroy Christianity at the time.

The characters in the movie actually used my old driveway as their own. Living in New Bedford a good part of my life, I found the opening scene of New Bedford Harbor breathtaking and it really touch my heart. The movie is very romantic. If you love romance movies or novels, I'm sure that you will not be disappointed. My favorite scene, next to the opening one of New Bedford Harbor, is when all the characters are at the Portuguese Feast. Having gone to the Portuguese Feast in New Bedford year after year, it was interesting to watch. This is a very different, refreshing, romantic movie that I really enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, romantic valentine of a movie","review":"I found \\"Passionada\\" to be utterly charming--a movie about second chances and taking a chance on love when it comes your way. The movie is very well cast and the cinematography is breath-taking. You can tell the director really fell for New Bedford and did his best to re-create the Portugese-American fishing community there. Jason Isaacs did a splendid job playing the vulnerable, low-roller con man Charlie Beck and Carla Milos (who is actually Greek/Italian) did a credible job as Sofia (a widow but \\"the most married woman you're likely to meet\\" as the bartender puts it. Emily Rossum, in a pre-Phantom role, shines as Sofia's daughter, the budding gambler. This is an old-fashioned romance movie where the emphasis is on the romance rather than the sex. The DVD offers the discarded original ending (too melodramatic) and commentary by the director and the cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, Poor male actor performance (Jason Isaacs)","review":"This is a nice story, very romantic set in a beautiful scenery. I enjoyed the beginning of the movie, but as the story unfolds the male character becomes more and more pathetic. The actress Sofia Milos is fantastic and Jason Isaacs is just not a match for her in this movie. The director should have chosen an actor with temperament. In certain scenes he is overacting a lot and in the love scene he is almost \\"slimey\\".For the story and female actor it\`s worth watching, but do not expect much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, and works as expected","review":"This cable did the job splendidly.

Ex: He states that the monsoon starts in November. Wrong! He got his personal equipment briefing just befoe he left on his first combat mission. It didn't work that way. He says the PDJ was named after a Frenchman named Jarres. Wrong. He was sent on his first mission totally unprepared? Not likely.

Even former military types, although most were not pilots, have praised this work of fiction. There is not a page in this abomination that remotely resembles any factual missions flown from NKP. The inaccurracies are so overwhelming I doubt that if Halliday was in fact a pilot or has ever been to NKP. It would take a book to list all of the implausable, impossible, and inaccurate stories in this book. While Halliday was supposedly swanning around at 12,000 feet my squadron mates and I were down at 3,000 feet over the Trail.We know what happened out there and what didn't.

Its written from an interesting point of view. The pilot is reminiscing over his tour of duty while taking a break from flying on a mission. All the different memories he recalls are rocks in a stream which he picks up and examines. But don't let that unusual aspect scare you off. It works well with the story. In the essence of \\"Chickenhawk\\" (the best helicopter book to be written about the Vietnam War), \\"Flying through Midnight\\" captures the spirit of flying an ancient World War II designed cargo plane with a top speed of only 200 knots through anti-aircraft fire and enemy territory at night.

It reads with the drama of a novel but provides a combat memoir following the author's Vietnam tour of duty, where he's stationed in a no-man's land area and flues without ID or rank.

Yet, when he comes face-to-face with a clever enemy that is attempting to eradicate the scientific braintrust of Great Britain through mind-altering deprivation techniques, Palmer is in his element. With class character-actors like Nigel Green and Guy Doleman as competing superiors, and with Sue Lloyd as the beautiful love interest, Palmer scours wonderful London locations to the exciting beat of John Barry's magnificent score.I can't possibly throw enough superlatives at what I believe is the best spy movie ever made. The tedious surveillance scenes ring true with me and the classic organizational in-fighting (that's generally overlooked in similar films) brings a realism that is enhanced by Michael Caine's terrific portrayal. This is worth every moment of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ipcress FIle","review":"Finally after years of trying to find this film, Michael Caine at his best! The Cold War Spy film has it all and acutally beats the early James Bond movies.

The digital sound transfer is less than perfect (I believe it is mono - it certaily sounded mono) and while the lines are crisp and clear they are not always acoustically accurate. Further, the score is not well transfered either. Yet, the quality of the camera work (often under-exposed) is very effective. The cast of characters all appear like old hands at the spying business and without the benefit of any special effects or expensive sets, London is turned into a creepy backdrop of espionage and double agents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bible for building ships in bottles","review":"This was my second book of many books I own on building ships in bottles. I built my second ship in a bottle from this book (a clipper ship). This book and Don Hubbards book (my first book and first ship) are best for those starting out. What makes this book the best is that he also includes putting other things in bottles like a one legged pirate which I also built. This makes it a step above the rest. Once you learn from these two you can get others for more ideas and ship model plans. Even if your starting by building from a kit you need this book to learn the fundamentals."},{"rating":"2","title":"It must be good...","review":"Let's face it, any book of poetry is better if your poem is included, and two of mine were included from the notorious 2004 St. Louis Nationals, a bittersweet experience. From Rose Smith and Eliot Harmon there's some great work that I'm glad my writing is nestled with. For the poet who thinks that slam is about performance this book shows that slam is good for writers too. For the teacher, there's some work that challenges and pushes the boundaries of the performance poem in new and fascinating directions. Having been to a couple of Nationals before, what really stood out about St. Louis was the quality of the poetry. I felt blessed by words, sometimes delivered in small crowded hotel rooms, on street corners and in alleys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick it up","review":"This makes for a good read, the kind of book you can pick up, open to any page, and find something worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"works fine","review":"I've just used it a few times but the cable arrived in a timely fashion and has worked fine thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coloring is not just for kids!","review":"If you think that coloring is just for kids think again!!

Unfortunately too much of the book is a collage of Bible stories mixed with anecdotes of modern people and events.For example, Marcus offers a paragraph of some 180words describing the office of Zahi Hawass. (BTW, his name is mispelled in the index.) In another instance, Marcus tells how Kent Weeks is changing the image of Ramses II. This story is included because if the Exodus is historical, Ramses II is probably (?) Pharaoh.Marcus also includes stories to show how archaeology is changing the Middle East. On page 90, she tells the story of Palestinians who recreate the story of Baal dying and rising back to life. Although this story is interesting in its own right, it comes across as Marcus' mind wandering again.In her view from Mount Nebo, Marcus would have done better to keep archaeology in focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Objectivity","review":"If you REALLY want a more objective perspective about how archeology is truly re-writing the Biblical tradition, then read The Bible Unearthed, and forget this book.

It made me look at the Bible in a new way, and at the Middle East. What I found most interesting were the connections made thoughout the book between the past and the present, and the way the Bible has stayed relevant throughout the ages even as scholars, historians, and now archaeologists change the way that we view the text. This isn't a dry or academic study -- it is filled with fascinating details about the people and the digs as well as the biblical history -- and the mixture of Bible stories, archaeology, and the modern debates made the book rich and accessible, particularly to someone like me who loves the Bible and history but is not in the professional field. I am going to recommend it to our book group."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I purchased this book on the advice of a good friend, whose opinions I greatly respect. I have read this book and am disappointed. The author has taken a vast subject and attempted to condense it into a few pages, which does a disservice to the subject. I found the book confusing, rambling at times, and raising more questions than answers or providing me with the direction to find answers. I also laughed when she took the trouble to describe the appearance of experts or their physical appearance, at the expense of more substance. I have come away from my reading with a little more information, but desperately in need of another book or books with significantly more, on point, substance. Perhaps more information on Palestinian archaeological history together with Israeli history would have been a better, albeit longer, read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"Under the stress of trying to quickly prepare for the NAB, I ordered this book directly from McGraw-Hill. I did not realize that the NAB has its own preparation materials that you can order. The problem with the book is that it does not give you the specific regulations that you need to know to take the NAB. The book gives an overview of what Administrators need to know, but does not supply specifics. The sample exam questions are good, but there aren't enough. I also do not think the book is easy to follow.

I bought law school legends evidence and later decide to buy Sum and Substance since I wasn't getting as much out of law school legends as I would have liked. I much preferred the sum and substance one as it was better organized and easier to follow. Also, Sum and Substance has more tracks, so you can find and listen to the explanation of specific concepts again without having to search for a concept within the 1 hour tracks you'll find on the law school legends evidence series. Also, the outline that comes with law school legends evidence is too superficial to be of any help.

At the end of the book I find I still don't understand. Why does a foot tap to a piper or fiddler? There is no drummer, rhythm instrument, etc. Why does a minor chord make us feel wistful?

It helped me better understand both music and neuroscience. Music's influence on us is a fascinating and powerful subject.That having been said, however, I do need to make at least one criticism. Levitin's evolutionary explanation for the development of music is egregiously one-sided. He suggests, with others, that music may be an outward demonstration of intelligence and physical prowess - look at me, I can afford to waste all this time and energy - akin to the male peacock's tail. THIS IS ALL WELL AND GOOD FOR MALES, BUT WHAT ABOUT FEMALES!? I read not one sentence in Levitin's book explaining what evolutionary theory would have to say about female singing. I'm willing to accept adaptive explanations for many things.. but in this case Levitin does little to ward off the inevitable criticism that his book features a number of very half-based \\"just so\\" stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is a must","review":"This book is exciting, enlightening and awakening. I took piano lessons forever, am learning to play the flute, loved to sing in a group and just enjoy listening to music- most of it anyway--this wonderful treatise helps me learn why this practice is so wonderful.

Also, a very uninteresting writing style.If you must, buy it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent informative read!","review":"I really loved this book because unlike many books related to this subject it has not been too watered down. It is accessible but still contains loads of information. Somehow Levitin has managed to fit an 800 hundred page draft into a 200 page book! I will continue to refer to this book for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of detail","review":"The most striking feature of this book for me is that it blurs the line between music as an aesthetic experience & the study of the brain as a scientific exercise.So while it does a great job of defining the various parameters we appreciate music by ( notes, pitch, timbre, meter etc), it also delves into the way memory is organized in the brain, how musical appreciation is connected to our emotions, what makes a great anything (10, 000 hours of practice, apparently) etc.The chapter on memory is tiresome & is far too academic for general readership. The initial chapters on musical parameters is very helpful to somebody with no training on music. The connections to emotions, & the music we like are very interesting reads.Overall, a more than moderately good book without being exceptional because of the insufficient sieving out of unnecessary detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Boring Book","review":"I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately I only enjoyed maybe 2 of all the chapters in the book. Most of it is just too \\"brainy\\" in terms of the vocabulary that is used and the topics discussed. The chapter on expertise in music is interesting but not really back by much science. The last chapter is an interesting approach to the evolution of music and the chapter I enjoyed the most. Everything else I found very boring and hard to read. If you know a lot about the brain then you might enjoy this more."},{"rating":"1","title":"please don't read this book","review":"As previous reviewers have stated, this book is full of inaccuracies and misinformation (for specific examples, read the other reviews). It is by no means a scientific book, but rather the half-baked musings of a pseudo-scientist and non-musician with an axe to grind. For example, Levitin writes in the final chapter: \\"Contemporary 'classical' music is practiced mostly in universities; it is listened to by almost no one; it deconstructs harmony, melody, and rhythm, rendering them all but unrecognizable; it is a purely intellectual exercise, and save for the rare avant-garde ballet company, no one dances to it either\\" - a sentiment that reveals not only the author's bias but his ignorance of the very field about which he is theorizing. The fact that so many people with a genuine interest in music and neuroscience have read this book and seemingly found it useful is genuinely troubling to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"any impressario, non-performer, non-musician, lacks credibility","review":"For a musicican, for one trained as a musician, this is a heady intellectual book. However, it often misses the point - entirely, aesthetically, and in practical terms. For instance, a piece practiced a 1000 times, according to the author, should be peerless. Obviously, this is not true. The native talent of the performer is paramount, and, most of all, the piece may be practiced WRONGLY 1000 times, of which, as a non-performer, the author is clearly unaware. The author also almost completely ignores the influence and insight of professional classical performers. The author is an administrator and impressario of rock and probably rap bands. The author has no training in musicology, and probably never talked to a musicologist. I admire the intent, but there are no breakthroughs here in understanding, or enjoying music, and no great insights into music's magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a music therapist, and feel let down.","review":"To be brief, this book was based on an individual's point of view yet he attempts to portray it as fact.

It discusses all the parts of music that I have ever wondered about (being a musician myself.) I enjoyed this book so much because it's easy to read but also extremely engaging.

For me, however, the best this writer did was to induce a quick and fairly deep slumber. Was it the over-long dissection of the definitions of tone and timber? The re-hashed discussion of optical illusions? The lack of any real human stories of interest? I'm not at all certain. I just couldn't stay awake long enough to form a decent opinion of it. So this book is going on the \\"get rid of it\\" pile and I hope the next owner finds something to appreciate in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More research needed","review":"As a musician I find this topic fascinating. The book does cover many interesting points and brings up ideas about how and why we react to music in the ways that we do. However, the authors errors in analyzing some of the music examples and forms throughout the book are flawed and drive someone like me nuts. If the author isn't an educated musician he should have spent more time with musicians researching some of the technical details of the music he examined. The book might try too hard to be all things to all people, and satisfies none. Too technical for the non-scientist, not technical enough for scientists, to musical for non-musicians, not deep enough for musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention music lovers","review":"The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it might only appeal to readers who are curious about actual brain functions while listening to music as well as the simpler pure enjoyment of notes strung together in a pleasing way.

Don't waste your time with this book. It lacks any form of continuity, and the writer rambles about various topics, dragging his points all over the place. I wish I could have gotten a condensed version of the better parts and key points of the book since most of it is a mess. I picked it up after reading two magazine articles about this book, but unfortunately, the articles put me under the impression that the main topic of this books was going to be about one thing I was interested in (timbre of recordings and their importance on pop music), but it was not. It did touch on that topic--if only a little--but the author really managed to ramble his way through the rest of the book with only a few moderately interesting points. Get to the point, author!

Oh, if you wonder why that stupid ad jingle just won't get out of your head, find out here!You have to have enjoyed your science classes in school, but you will find out why you have this obsession with making music. Levitin is eclectic in his definition of music and uses examples from Bach to Led Zeppelin and beyond. He was a rock musician and producer before he became a scientist.The book is dense, a few pages will provide food for thought for a week, but if science and music are part of your life this book will be on the hot shelf for months.J'Carlin"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"Lots of fluff and name dropping.And then this..Wagner \\"has always disturbed me profoundly, and not just his music but the idea of listening to it.

That a plug for the book appeared in that particular magazine should have clued me in to its nature.In any case, the book IS a decent primer for those without formal musical background... However, as a work discussing the neuroscience of music, it's definitely tedious and rambling. Nearly the first half of the work concerns itself with introducing those not familiar with music to basic structural concepts, as well as his own mini-autobiography. All of this would be fine, but this leaves only about 125 pages for the discussion of brain functions. Of the 320 pages, about 70 are Appendices and End Notes, 125 are Music Theory 101/Levitin's Name-Dropping 101, and 125 for the actual science. That's only 40% of the book dealing with the neuroscience of music. There are better works out there covering the same material."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book since I am both a brain researcher and a professional musician. First it was highly disorganized and rambled from subject to subject without any real framework. Much of what the author spoke of was not related to how the brain processes music but speaks to the way research is conducted. Even this was sparse at best. He attempted to explain the elements of music so that the majority of people could understand it. However it became too watered down and even lost me. Lastly the author was entirely too self congradulatory as to his own accomplishments. Pushing the envelope of science should be award enough. For these reasons I can not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revised Title: Daniel J. Levitin's Brain on Music","review":"There is enough self-indulgent auto-biographical dribble in this book to ruin whatever interest the reader might have had for brain science. If you want to learn about how the mind works there are many excellent popular brain science books, stay away from this book. If you want to learn about the musical tastes of Daniel J. Levitin and how important his friends are, this is the book for you. Barely tolerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book.","review":"If you like science or you have students who do, this is a neat book. We all like music, and this could make the connection between everyday life and science. It might spark an interest in a young person!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riviting","review":"I loved this book, it was a great read, and really captures the majesty of our experience with sound and the nature of the brain. Excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read \\"Musicophila\\" instead","review":"Don't waste your time with this. Poor research and full of false conclusions and analysis. Touches on some good concepts but if you are a musician you will be very disappointed with the author's shallow comprehension. Check out Oliver Sacks' \\"Musicophilia\\" instead if you are looking for something written for a discerning reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Your Brain on Music","review":"This is an excellent book written smoothly and entertainingly by a man overwhelmingly qualified to do the work. You wouldn't think a simultaneous summary of music theory and brain function would be so engaging, but there it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderfully enjoyable read on a scientific subject","review":"Dan Levitin does a better job than anyone on the planet in making the science of sound come alive to the imagination. A solid contribution in a field that is difficult to convey in the vernacular!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lackluster view of neuroscience and music","review":"Doing an undergrad and master's work in music performance and studying neuroscience as an interest at my alma mater, I came to this book with high hopes that were not fulfilled. Beginning with a jargon filled musical dictionary-like approach, Levitin takes the reader on a crash course through music and the brain. Pitch is nebulously described as a figment of the neural processes occurring in our brains (which any perceptual event could rightly be called). The chapters of this book are vaguely titled and abhorrently long with no organization. Trite quips round out this volume and leave the reader wanting clarity and concise thought. If you want to learn about music and neuroscience, buy a book on basic neuroscience and a recording of Bach's B minor Mass. You'll learn a lot more than this book tries to spoon feed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just how narcissistic is this author?","review":"Sure, the small portion of the book devoted to science is somewhat sound, but the poor writing style, the annoying narrative, and the constant name-dropping speaks to who this guy must be. This book is his 15 minutes of fame, he needs to enjoy it now. Check out the lack of any other sound publications to see just who he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"love mingus, hated this band","review":"Out of great loyalty to Mingus I saw this band play several times. He was old and sick then, heavily medicated, and beginning to die. To me, it's an embarassment to the world that he hadn't made enough money by then to retire instead of having to go out on the road with these two clowns. The man who made \\"Great Concert\\" with Eric Dolphy and Jaki Byard didn't need Adams and Pullen to show him a \\"new\\" direction. The last group of records (this one and the \\"Changes\\") were probably humiliating for him. When a great composer doesn't write all the music on his own record something is gone awry. I bought them anyway so he'd get the money, but I never could listen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must get..it..out..of...my..HEAD....","review":"This is THE most catchy album I've ever heard. YOU WILL be singing the songs to yourself within a day of listening to it, and thank god this is a mindblowing cd. Candyass was in my opinion a good cd, not the best but certinly good. VT just improves on anything Candyass did. This time the lyrics are great, and Jay's voice is still great. Electronically I'd change some stuff but not very much.I knew I had to buy this album when I heard Fiction on the radio, and thankfully it's not even the best song on the cd. Suckerface, The Oddessy, and Fiction are the best songs. In all the band has progressed a lot since their debut, and the band's music is balanced out better than Candyass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album from Orgy","review":"The best thing about Orgy is that they make the music they want to make, not mainstream radio crap that everyone will like. No matter what, I think Orgy will always have this distinction. The new album has the same great aspects of Candyass while adding some new depth in places. Overall, if you like Candyass, you'll like Vapor Transmission."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Saddening Dissapointment","review":"Orgy's first album was more than just an album to me... It was a life changing experience. To date it is still by far my favorite album, the detail and emotion in the songs was intense. I anxiously waited the release of this album and with the highest of expectations I was apalled to find... C***... this album has a very rushed feeling to it. The songs are no where as detailed as Candyass. The vocals lack the wierd confusing quality that made them original. The title of the album is plain stupid. Every song I listen to gives me the feeling that somehow the cdplayer skipped into repeat mode and i'm hearing the same song over again. Marilyn Manson wore out their guitar sounds with Mechanical Animals. ::cries:: Nothing hurts me more than having to voice my true opinion of this album.The only 1/2 decent song on the album is 'Dramatica' because it's the only one even slightly original."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This CD","review":"Have you ever found that one CD where you love every track and can listen to it over and over again?????? I did, and this is it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a real Orgy CD","review":"This album was a huge disappointment. Orgy moves in more of a guitar-centric metal direction, away from their original synth rock style. While focusing on the harder style of this record, they seem to lose touch with their melodic, electronic rock roots found on Candyass (and Punk Statik Paranoia, afterward). The album as a whole just falls flat and sound like the numerous other \\"nu metal\\" stuff that's out there. Sure, there's a few good ones on here like \\"Fiction (Dreams in Digital)\\", \\"Eyes, Radio, Lies\\"; \\"Suckerface\\" and \\"Eva\\". But, overall I was very disappointed at the direction they started heading in with this record. Luckily for the few of us who feel this way, Punk Statik Paranoia heads back towards the same \\"death pop\\" feel that made us fall in love with them on their first CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD mostly","review":"I am not usually a big techno-rock fan, but I must say, orgy has surprised me. I did not realize how talented they were. My favorite songs on \\"Vapor Transmission\\" are \\"suckerface\\", \\"opticon\\", \\"fiction (dreams in digital)\\", and \\"re-creation\\". My favorite has to be \\"re-creation\\". Orgy has a unique talent; they combine hard-core nu-metal rock with some twisted techno effects and background tracks to create an original new listen into the new rock world. Stand back, my friends, orgy rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"A head trip to listen to.","review":"I bought this cd thinking, \\"ohh it is going to be just like candyass (the first orgy cd, buy it.).\\" But when I got into my car and put it in I was amazed to hear how much better it was in sound. The mix of Jay's vocals with Paiges' bass and Amir on the V-synth was just astounding. This cd will not dissapoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"an improved effort","review":"This was not an easy album for me to warm to, but when I did, I realized what a far better effort it was over Orgy's 1998 debut. Marilyn Manson may feel recycled by this point in time so it's only appropriate we have a group like Orgy in an era where The Matrix films dominate the theaters.Vapor Transmission has plenty of appeal and for good reason . . . it's not typical metal. It's an industrial metal which would most noteably have comparible sound to Filter. I prefer the sound of latter-day Filter over Orgy a little bit, primarily due to their smoother texture. Orgy does sound better to me than Deadsy and Stabbing Westward.The large appeal to Vapor Transmission is that the songwriting has improved and the production and sound have evolved into a better direction. Bands like Disturbed and Linkin Park could learn some lessons in diverse songwriting from Orgy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"I can't believe I bought this piece of crap CD. I enjoyed Orgy's first CD, but this one just sucks!! It does not even deserve stars. This is probably the worst CD I own, and believe me I love music (this is not music). If you want my advice, don't buy this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd sucks","review":"don't buy this cd. it is the worst followup a band could bring to candyass. candyass was great, it had more of a rock edge than just straight up music out of a f reaking machine. vapor transmission is a joke, if you thought the 80's were overdone, then this will blow you away. the electronica and synthesized sounds just make this cd sound like crap ratehr than hard rock. take my advice, i dont even like them that much i like punk, but i know enough to say that candyass was kick-ass and this sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not just buy the new Manson album?","review":"\\"Hello, my name is Jay Gordon, and every Halloween, I dress up as Marilyn Manson.\\"Puh-leeeeeeze.

Please people listen to real talent such as Dream Theater, Queensryche, Rush, Led Zeppelin. This is the worst album I have ever had the displeasure of purchasing. Leave this album on the shelves PLEASE."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAAAAAY improved from Candyass........","review":"Orgy proves with this CD that they're here to stay, and that they can evolve just as well-if not better then any other band. They're a close 2nd to Garbage in my book (but that's just MY book). They are really, really improving and creating some really imaginative songs. Keep it up! Musashi"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I don't like \\"nu-metal\\" per se (i.e. Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, other garbage), though Orgy is the one exception to the rule. Their songs are melodic and catchy, yet hard and heavy (most of the time). Better than their debut, indeed.1. Vapor Transmission (intro): n/a2. Suckerface: A3. The Odyssey: A4. Opticon: A-5. Fiction (Dreams in Digital): A6. Eva: A+ (excellent song; the best here)7. 107: B+/A-8. Dramatica: A-9. Eyes-Radio-Lies: A10. Saving Faces: A-11. Re-Creation: A12. Chasing Sirens: B+13. Where's Gerrold?/Spectrum: AAverage: A-/A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior follow-up to CANDYASS","review":"Orgy's second album is a major leap forward from CANDYASS. The overall songwriting and musicianship is a step in the right direction for Orgy.VAPOR TRANSMISSION starts off brilliantly with four outstanding tracks. \\"Suckerface\\", \\"The Odyssey\\", \\"Opticon\\", and \\"Fiction:Dreams in Digital\\". All four are extremely well written songs and above all else are very catchy! Especially, \\"Fiction:Dreams in Digital\\". This is the best song on the album in my opinion. It is the kind of hard pop music I like to listen to. The other notable tracks that I mentioned above are excellent hard rockers. It might take a few listens for you to like some of the songs, but they are well worth it.VAPOR TRANSMISSION kinda loses momentum after \\"Fiction\\", and the rest of the album is a hit and miss affair, much like CANDYASS was. But, the great songs outweigh the not so great on VAPOR TRANSMISSION and I recommend it for your music collection! It is worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite improvement over their 1998 set...........","review":"Orgy, the more radio friendly type industrial rock, something that the kids may be a little more into than Nine Inch Nails or Marilyn Manson, but beside the fact they are just a bit more personable, Orgy are a very talented and clever band as well. So clever that they have invoked a series of lame clone bands (see Finger Eleven, yuck).I will say this record is a lot like Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" most instances on this album you have to listen to the songs as one, the whole cd. The only exceptions to this rule are \\"Eva\\", \\"Opticon\\", \\"Fiction\\", and \\"Suckerface\\". Take nothing away from this third of the album....because it is as brilliant as the rest.The best part of this cd is the depth of the lyrics and the texture focus. Orgy have a sound that well....once was all their own, and it's a very cool and interesting one. Vapor Transmission is a must have for any fan of Orgy or Industrial music, but how you will like this cd depends entirely on your tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Summer of 2000.","review":"It was the summer of 2000, and I just graduated grade school. The Box (an old music network) was playing Orgy's \\"Fiction\\". It was one of the best song I've probably ever heard at the time.Orgy was my key to electronic music. Years later, I would be turned on to bands such as The Birthday Massacre, Deadsy, and The Anix.Vapor Transmission is sharp, edgy, and original. No cover songs, and no filler on this album. Candyass is great, but the production quality is nothing like VT.This is the prime of their career. Melodies, unique lyrics, and crushing hooks uphold this album. It sent me into space, I must say.This is a must buy, IF YOU LIKE ELECTRONIC ROCK. It really isn't a fan amongst the \\"traditional rockers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"only liked it at first, but then...","review":"I bought the Orgy CD after seeing them in at Buzzfest (Hosuton's anual all-day concert featuring many rock bands). I thought that they were great live, but I wasn't sure what I was going to get when I bought the CD. I have to admit that when I first listened to the CD I only thought it was OK. I liked most songs and didn't like some songs so much. But the more I listened the the CD the more I began to like all the songs. Some songs (like Opticon) can get stuck in your head all day.The MUSIC is GREAT and the lyrics actually mean something. Vapor Transmission is really worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only the second half of the CD was as good as the first..","review":"I asked for this CD and got it as a Christmas present, but I never did get along to reviewing it. I sort of wanted this off of instict, the two singles off of Candyass, \\"Stitches\\" and \\"Blue Monday\\" where both great hits, and I saw a promo commercial for the new Orgy album which featured a sound sample of \\"Fiction\\", the new single. When I got this album, I didn't listen to it very much but a couple months later I really started to get into it. The first 5 songs are great journey into futuristic rock, but after that it's a hit or miss affair. Opticon is my favorite song, followed by Fiction, while Suckerface and The Odyssey are tied for third. Track 6, called Eva, is unlike the rest of the album. It is a ballad about a special person in your life dying. I do not know the specific person this song is attributed to. The Intro is ok, but not great, much like the second half of the album. All, in all, this worth buying for the first 5 songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good, end dissapoints","review":"Vapor Transmission continues Orgy's standard of rock. The opening tracks, sans the intro, start the whole cd nicely. The end seems to degrade a little and seems to switch between good and ok tracks. Eva, although one of my fav's, just doens't seem to hit the quality I think it could have been. Still, Orgy fares better than most in producing a cd where more than 50% of the songs are worth listening to. Continue the standard of excellence guys, rock on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Candyass\\"","review":"I enjoyed the debut album when it came out, and I wondered ifOrgy would change for the worse to make their follow-up album.Make no mistake, this is still Orgy. This album, in my opinion, isa %100 improvement over the predecessor, \\"Candyass\\". Itsbetter produced, more unified (almost seems like a theme album whenyou hear the intro), and the hooks are better constructed, catchier,and brilliantly executed. I had very low expectations for a follow-uprecord to a pop icon like \\"Candyass\\", and I'm happy to say Iwas very wrong about my presumption. Shame on me. Orgy did a goodjob on this record, I recommend you have a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of the middle","review":"I quickly received this product but returned it because I did not like the middle.

It's very honest about what you can and can't get out of the Internet in terms of business, and dispels many misconceptions about the market.

It has taken over fifteen years and repeated viewings to realize that Colin Baker was excellent as the Doctor and was simply a victim of the writers. I found the acting in this show excellent from all characters(with the exception of Alexi Sayle, who only gets my forgiveness because he was a Young One). However, I watch these shows for the Doctor, and by placing him in a secondary role for the majority of the first act was infuriating. The scene order just felt terribly out of place and it slowed down the pacing. I do not know if Eric Saward wrote the plot this way, but I think with a little editing and repositioning of scenes this could have been a really memorable episode. I recommend this episode only if you are a hardcore Colin Baker fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sixth Doctor's Dalek Adventure!","review":"This is one of my favorite Sixth Doctor stories. It has an interesting funeral-planet subplot which has a number of interesting characters aside from the Daleks and their plans. Everything from a womanizing funeral director who breaks hearts, to an aging assassin who is on his last mission. The settings are interesting, and there are even deeper questions about life and death involved. Definitely something to watch if you want to see a good Sixth Doctor episode, or you are a Dalek fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"_____________ \\" of the Daleks\\"","review":"This is one of my least favorite Dalek story arcs. The story isn't great, failing to justify the use of the Daleks and their creator and the cameos are weak and forced.Thanks to the 2005 reinvention of the series, not to metion the amazing revamp of the Daleks, there is plenty of Dalek DVDs to choose from and get more sci-fi-satisfaction: The Daleks (from the 1st Doctor's Beginnings Set), Genesis of the Daleks (possibly the best, see my review), Ressurection of the Daleks ( some great 5th Doctor moments)....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This was the most god-awful boring Doctor Who story I've ever seen. And there were Daleks and Davros in it! No wonder the BBC took Dr. Who off their schedule for 18 months after this story. Colin Baker was never good at playing The Doctor, and almost killed the show for good. And that stupid costume he had makes The Doctor look more like an idiot than anything else. Oh and Alexei Sayle? Not funny! I didn't laugh once. They do find some time to mention that Americans have such bad taste, but after this garbage story I'm wondering who really has bad taste.The Doctor and Peri walk to Tranquil repose and it takes the entire 1st episode. They are attacked by one mutant in a pretty uninteresting fight sequence. The story turned into a confused mess of underdeveloped characters and ridiculous plot almost from the point the Doctor and Peri stepped out of the TARDIS. So save your money or buy Genesis or Resurrestion of the Daleks instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last great story of the last great Doctor","review":"The heading says it all. Too bad the next season would be Colin Baker's last. He deserved more time on the show. If only I had a Tardis, I'd go back to 1986 and exterminate Michael Grade, but alas... I agree with the reviewers who praise Alexi Sayle's performance as the DJ. As Peri exclaims in her phoney American accent, \\"he's greeeaat!\\" Speaking of accents, most American accents on Doctor Who are very transparent. However, Mr. Sayle truly sounds like an American. The only detraction from this story is the annoying Tasambeker, played by Jenny Tomasin. This may be a politically incorrect statement, but she looks and sounds retarded. Other than that, this is a wonderful adventure worth many repeated viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Whom, Mark III","review":"This was the third early Dr. Who that I bought to see how the early ones compare to the current one.

The acting...feh.

Stunnning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated and Pretentious","review":"This is easily one of the worst books I have every read. The experience was indeed, pure agony, as one other Amazon reviewer put it. The reader of this pretentious tome is constantly distracted by bloated prose, needless parenthetical asides, and ostentatious references that are apparently supposed to be funny and clever, but which ultimately fall flat. The reader is constantly being reminded of just how brilliantly clever the author is, rather than being allowed to focus on the story and the characters, which as it happens, are insipid and unlikable. Life is way too short to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been 5 star","review":"I started listening to this audio book and was, at first, annoyed by the constant references to the author's own erudition. Ok. So you're well read, intelligent and want everyone to know it! Big deal!But then I got hooked on the characters, their relationships, the mystery and, yes, the posturing of the political/philosophical arguments in which Ms Pessl engages (or is that wallows?).For all that, I wanted this book to go on forever. I loved it! And I genuinely cared for Blue.The reader, Emily Janice Card, is brilliant. Her characterizations are amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic - after the first 100 pages","review":"It is hard to get yourself into this book, but trust me, once you do, you will be satisfied with the ending. Although the narrator can be a little annoying at first, you eventually realize that this is part of her charm, part of her character, and part of the book's special place on your bookshelf. Are all the internal references to real books? I have no idea. But this story, one that anyone who has been \\"the new girl\\" can identify with, propels you to an entirely unpredictable end. You won't expect it, but you will believe it nonetheless. I look forward to eventually reading more by this author. Brava!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like A Tough Semester, Worth The Effort","review":"Rarely have I come across a new book that divides readers so thoroughly in their opinions. This one truly seems to fall into the love-it-or-really-really-hate-it category, and it's not hard to see why. I totally sympathize with those who find it obnoxious, pretentious, slow, implausible, and unforgivably overwritten. More than once in the early going I thought about putting it down for good. And yet, I'm very glad it stuck with it. By the end, I had essentially fallen in love with Blue and was totally captivated by her mystery. The ambiguity of the conclusion is a strength more than a weakness, in my view. I will certainly be interested to see what Ms. Pessl comes up with next."},{"rating":"1","title":"as pretentious and annoying as....","review":"hmmm...what irritating, long-winded and unwieldy comparison could I possibly use to describe this book? A tired, half-stolen premise, a hollow bunch of non-characters, and a dying-to-be-clever writing style which relies exhaustively on clunky, dead-end similes. Seriously--if you went through this book with a pencil and crossed out every awkward, fourth-rate simile, you wouldn't have much of a book left. The supposedly compelling characters of the book--the dad, Hannah, the \\"Bluebloods\\" don't seem to have anything intrinsically charming about them at all; we're merely supposed to rely on the narrator's weakish insistence that they're all fascinating. There just seems to be no there there, no rewarding meat on the bones. If it were more entertaining, I'd forgive the superficiality, but it seems to be an earnest attempt at something lofty and reading it was a joyless mix of tedium and sheer cringe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh.","review":"Hung in there through page 89, then realized I'm not immortal and don't have time to deal with this.

The propensity of the writer to be \\"clever\\" in the longest-winded way possible combined with a plot that moves at a glacial pace finally got the better of me. I can see other readers' points about the endless witticisms on Americana that resonated with them but at some point this book crossed over into self-obsession and left me scratching my head. I guess there's a side to this book that holds out a mirror to the fans of mySpace and Facebook, but I didn't find myself needing that kind of self-validation."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious, cutesy drivel","review":"It's been about twenty years since I put a book down without finishing it. I'm obsessed with finding out how things turn out, even if I find I can't stand the writing. I put this book down, happily. Actually, the ease with which the book can be tossed is the best thing about it. I can just imagine the writer tittering at her deliciously wicked bon mots. The prose is agony, the characters are lifeless, the clever chapter titles are pretentious, fake and forced. After forcing a few chapters down my gullet, with a plot nowehere in site, I put this one down.

Although some of the writing is fine, insightful, and funny, the idea that a high school teacher, Hannah, spending her free time and income entertaining her under-aged students is ludicrous (not to mention allowing a sleep over). No part-time teacher has the income to make dinners for 6 every Sunday, or to take six teen agers to a nice restaurant, drink a bottle of wine in front of them and pick up the tab (let alone keep a job). I can't imagine her editors let these complete flights of fancy through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful.","review":"Like so many other reviewers, I really wanted to finish this book, and wanted to like it when I was done. Neither thing happened. Gareth was a pretentious snob, Hannah a pretentious and promiscuous snob, the Bluebloods pretentious, promiscuous and spoiled snobs, and Blue just along for the ride. Was there really anyone in here to like? And why did it take 250+ pages to finally get things going? And why were there SO MANY typographical errors? Come on, editors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tad pretentious, but the energy of the prose saves the day","review":"I was torn between 3 and 4 stars here. This book, a bildungsroman about a young girl who tells the story of a year in her life through a syllabus, is certainly one for readers who will love the allusions. The novel feels young, and I often had the feeling reading this that I had of the novels of other media hawked wunderkinds--pretentious and not as interesting as it is supposed to be. However, I ended up being drawn back in by the energy of the prose--the woman can write, there's no doubt about that. And in the end, I was pretty intrigued the by the way that the mystery unfolded, because it made me want to read it again. And what higher praise can there be than that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous new writer!","review":"I was hooked by the title, but it was the table of contents that convinced me I just had to read this book. Each chapter is titled after a significant work of literature appropriate to the action. I loved the characters and the sometimes wistful quality that comes out of the story. It's a unique achievement in a month filled with run-of-the-mill beach reads. I'm lending it to all my friends now lamenting the lack of anything interesting to read. Give it a try"},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted time","review":"I want a novel to be about life not about titles to other books.

The characters boring and I am unable to continue reading...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious elitist ill-conceived P.O.S.","review":"I won't list the reasons why I hated this thing. Not because the reasons aren't good, but because I feel like I already wasted too much time out of my life reading it. If you want to know what the book is like, just look for the most useful reviews, both the most useful favorable review and the most useful critical review, they absolutely nail the problems with this book, so I don't see why I should write a redundant critique. (Note: when the most useful favorable review is very critical, and the most useful critical review totally trashes your book, I'd say you have a problem)I'm noting down everyone who gave this P.O.S. five stars so in the future I can stay clear of any other books they like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"this is the best read i came across in the last 5 years at least. i love everything about it, the cover, the heroine, the plot, the suspense, the ending. this novel has it all and it leaves me in awe about the skills of this young woman, the author. after this stunning debut novel, i hope we will even see much more of her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot Me! Please!","review":"I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a book. I couldn't get past page 200. Here's a synopsis of those pages:\\"I just wish I could fit in so long as I don't have to do anything to fit in like be friendly or something. I've been to 300 schools and I'm only 16 and I've never had a friend except for my spectacular Daddy who also has no friends and can't keep a relationship going for more than 30 days except when it looks like he might then I'll sabotage it. Woe is me!\\"Hopefully, for those readers with no other books in their homes to pick up, the book gets better. I'm content not knowing. Cleverness does not overcome unbearable boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hang in there (and pay attention)","review":"Yes, the first half of this book can feel like very slow going, but Pessl is putting a lot of things in place -- if you skim through or skip pages, you will miss out. By the time I got to the last third of the book, I had trouble putting it down. I thought the ending was quite satisfying -- if you've read carefully, everything comes together very nicely; in fact, you will understand things that Blue herself is overlooking (or refusing to let herself see). This is not light reading, but I thought it ended up being well worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh please!!","review":"If this is a brilliant debut then what else these publishers are looking at must be really abysmal! The characters are cartoons....the writing is glib and I just kept thinking...who cares? I am just stunned by the positive reviews and the hype and I loved Secret History by Donna Tartt. If there were minus stars I'd give it one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time for another book","review":"I've never written an Amazon review before but feel I have to weigh in on this book. It's the most annoying book I've read in a long time. I stayed with it the whole way, expecting that it had to get better to live up to the hype I'd heard. But the ending is completely unsatisfying. The novel is poorly constructed, the characters lack true characterization, the whole effort comes across as the author's attempt to show off. This is an unsatisfying, overwritten, irritating novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"The New York Times gave this book a terrific review so, when it came out in paperback a couple of years ago, I went right out and bought it. I've tried three times to read it and I've given up each time. This time I got a quarter of the way through and just couldn't begin to care about any of the characters. The heroine, her father, her friends -- they're not convincing as characters and, even if they were, they'd be even more boring than they are on the page.Yes, the author is clever and sometimes funny, what with her citations and all; but after the first hundred of those, well, one tires.When I finally put this book down forever, I was angry at the time I'd wasted. Right out the window with this one. With so much good writing around, why bother with this junk?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"You'd think someone who's as desperate to show off her knowledge as Marisha Pessl would at least take the trouble of doing research and ensuring that knowledge is correct. You'd be wrong.Ms. Pessl repeatedly uses terms incorrectly, and unnecessarily includes Spanish words and phrases, most of which are misspelled or used inaccurately. I got to page 100 and, exasperated, put the book away. Reading Pessl reminded me of what I think every time I see George W. Bush trying to show off his non-existent Spanish: \\"What a moron.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Insights, about the 90's AND the 60's","review":"This is maybe a coming-of-age novel, and maybe a mystery, and maybe an explanation of how Blue's father's generation (mine, too) got it wrong. In any case, it's well written, with well-realized characters, and a plot with very interesting unresolved questions at the end. It starts a little slowly, but after the first chapter or two I couldn't stop reading. The only flaw I could find in the book is that it might have benefited from a little strategic editing of long descriptive or explanatory sections. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Similes R Us","review":"I really enjoyed this book, which I only read by chance because I found it in the very small section of English books in the very small German town we live near. I found it laugh-out-loud funny and only a little annoying. Four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of words","review":"I suspect this is one of those books that many people will like but I don't; same experience with other idiosyncratic novels such as Confedarcy of Dunces, with which this book shares the claustrophobic-making central character. The voice of the narrator certainly is consistent--no noun goes unmodified, no concept goes unexplained, no scene lacks in detail (e.g., I'm sure the narrator wouldn't eat 'a hotdog' but 'a Kahns premium twelve inch hotdog with a whole wheat bun, Heinz Ketchup, yellow mustard with just a smidgen of that relish that you buy on the third shelf of the Krogers with the vibrant green sheen and well blended texture.\\") Drives me crazy. But others must like it I'm sure. Plot? Yep, it must be in there somewhere, and I bet it's a good one too. Guess the bottom line: what the author does, she does well--I just don't have an appreciation for it. Think I'll read some Hemingway next to counteract the verbiage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit juvenile","review":"Maybe this would be a good teenager read. For an adult, the first 2/3 of the book as a trip through a young girl's high-school years and childhood. The end of the story gets juicy, but not really until then. You have to make yourself keep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"like viewing a car accident","review":"I really slipped up on this one - and let the gimmicks of the cover and a quick scan entice me into buying it. It's clearly packaged as a clever, humorous and pretentious mystery.I'm now on page 233, about halfway through the book, and am hooked on two-dimensional characters, unconvincing literary allusions and overstretched metaphors. I've been unable to tear my eyes away from the gory technique splattered across each page.But this isn't healthy so for the sake of my remaining karma I'm going to put it down. Can't recommend it unless you either have karma to burn or like your metaphors and allusions cheap & plentiful - like the steaks at the $4.99 All You Can Eat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book in perfect condition","review":"I received the book in a very timely manner. It came well packaged to protect the book; great condition.Although I believe the book to be very well written, I was somewhat disappointed with the rave reviews my sister gave Special Topics in Calamity Physics.Still worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"We get it: you're well read","review":"I gave up on this book on page 100. The prose was insufferable. What was the reason for deluging the reader with hifonated pseudo-adjectives? Longwinded, verbose, writing which fails to advance the plot which is most fit for an indie movie.Blue van Meer is too unrealistic a character. She seems a caricature, having read Mein Kampf in the second grade. Of course, in the spirit of the novel's narrative, a pretentious citation of Mein Kampf's author follows.This novel should be read as a satire of our obsession with gifted children and academic elitism."},{"rating":"1","title":"All over the place","review":"I considered not writing this review, but I changed my mind when I thought about how helpful this could be to readers such as myself. I would consider myself to be an avid reader. I have read books from many genres, and though I have my preferences, I will try to read outside my preferences. This book however was way over my head. I could not follow the storyline. I found myself going over and over pages again, and still not understanding the direction. I did not feel any sort of flow. Occasionally I found myself laughing at a line here and there, but that certainly wasn't enough for me. I think the author tried too hard to show off her intellectual skill and forgot she was writing a novel worth reading. I know this sort of novel must belong to a genre, but I think, in future, I will avoid that genre. I prefer to be entertained by, engrossed in, and excited by a novel. I did not experience this with Special Topics..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmoric, but a good freshman effort","review":"This book has often been compared toRabid: A Novel, as they are both academia-inspired suspenseful lit novels filled with elegent language and philosophy, but Special Topics is much longer and yet, somehow, slighter.If I had not read Rabid so soon before Special Topics, I would have liked Special Topics better. However, Special Topics pales by comparison. It feels diffuse. The characters in Special Topics seem weaker, wussier, and more impressed with their own wittiness than truly intelligent.I'm trying to judge it on its own merits, but when you've read a superior book along the same lines quite recently, it's difficult to be objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya got me","review":"I gave up at around page 50 or so. It wasn't coming together and after skimming further and seeing it was all the same style (?) I said to heck with it. Seems I'm running more and more into books like this. Such as Hall, Steven - The Raw Shark Text, Haddon, Mark - The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.Maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm getting Alzheimer's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive","review":"This book was the most unnecessarily overwritten piece of pretension I have ever read! Do not be impressed by the annoying references to so many other things to get to the point, the borrowed phrases and quotes from everyone from scholars to rappers. It reads like it was written by a gnat on crack who suffers from ADD. Enough already! Speaking of quotes, I have one for you in a perfect description of this book: Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothin'- (James Brown). If you are into wordy, intelligent pieces that make sense, I suggest Stanley Crouch's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"teenage angst, written for adult audiences","review":"I read this a few years ago and absolutely loves it. It was one of the best books i have read dealing with the drama that ensues in high school.The plot has some suprising twists, and is a little unrealistic, but still very entertaining"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Engaging First Novel","review":"This is a first novel and a really impressive one, in my opinion. Pessl tells the story of Hannah, an intellectually precocious teenager being raised by her itinerant professor father who gets involved in solving the murder of a teacher at the private school she is spending a year attending. It's very cleverly plotted, often funny, interesting characters and the mystery is good, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I had written this book...","review":"I'll keep it short: I liked this book. A lot.What a fun idea by the author to create the book in the manner of a syllabus. I especially loved the bibliography references dotted throughout. The story itself isn't too groundbreaking, but it is SO rare to read a book in an original style and I think the author came up with a format that works. For that reason, this book is now on my favorite books list."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't Really Matter what it All adds up to in The End...","review":"There has been plenty of glowing, gushing reviewsheaped on this book and there have been almost asmany angry, frustrated viewpoints as well.I would fall somewhere in between the two, but muchcloser to the former than the latter. The first halfof this is one of the finest things I've ever readand even though it falls off a bit in the last half,it's still really good.The references get a little cluttered and tiresomeafter awhile, but I still love the fact that theywere included. This is an incredibly intelligentnovel that is so well-written that it frequentlyboggles the mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"good plot, horrible writing","review":"I have been trying to read this book for three days now. I thought the plot sounded really promising, and was looking forward to a good read. Between the endless wordiness and run-on sentences that seem to be forming complete paragraphs, this is an absolute nightmare to slog through. I highly recommend that this author take a couple of creative writing classes; and that the editor learn to edit properly.I am VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I just don't see it...","review":"but how, how is this inflated, twee book reminiscent of Nabokov? Nabokov's use of language made his sentences feel like music and his allusions never took you out of the book. If Special Topics is music, then it's clunky, overly busy music. Possibly performed with hammers. The big surprise was just that, a surprise. There weren't enough hints throughout the book, and Blue's sudden influx of memories after the fact seemed only to emphasize that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh...tedious is the perfect word.","review":"Other reviewers said it, not me. But I don't know how they can give this book 4 or 5 stars when they're all struggling to get through it. I gave up on it more than half way through--I've got too many other options, and if I'm going to muddle through a book, it's got to keep me more entertained than this.I really wanted to like this book, and I did enjoy it at the beginning; however, the erudite \\"in\\" jokes and references got old fast. I realized quickly that I didn't like the voice of the narrator, and it turn, didn't really care what happened to her or any of the twitty kids she hangs out with.I should give my copy away to save someone else the money. Any takers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Exercise in Pretentiousness","review":"I really thought I would like this book. Although I read pretty much everything, my taste skews more toward the literary and I had read an article comparing Calamity Physics to Donna Tart's wonderful debut novel, The Secret History. I'm terribly disappointed. As other reviewers have pointed out, the book is simply an exercise in pretentiousness: \\"Oh, look how smart I am,\\" \\"look how I can manage to write twenty-two qualifiers and thirty-seven adjectives in a single sentence,\\" \\"look how I can name each one of my chapters after a classic, even if it has little--or, in some cases, nothing--to do with that chapter.\\" I know Jonathan Frazen shares an agent with Pessl, so that explains his giving a blurb for the book. As for the other reviewers, who acted too much like sheep to say this emperor has no clothes, what can I say? Shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could recommend this...","review":"...but I cannot. It was beautifully written with many pretty turns of phrase, and word-perfect observations, but that's the problem -- there was more emphasis on the words and less on the content. I believe that this writer is the clever and intellectual heroine she writes about, but she misses the soul and core of telling a story. What might have been a terrific mystery is a long, drawn-out, FLAT story line that then feeds you all the information that you might have been gathering and sleuthing to involve you in the mystery. By the last few chapters, you dislike the characters so much that you don't care what happens to any of them. Don't discount this author, she may have future good books up her sleeve if she learns to interest others in her as much as she is interested in herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, affected","review":"I admit I am not done with this book yet, but can bearly read it. This book is terribly written and the addition of peculiar, academic references (think SAT vocab prep meets cultural literacy booklist) just does not help! Who was this author's editor? Try Heaven's Lake for better first novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbearable","review":"Why did this book receive any good reviews? For all the verbal gymnastics, it is quite tedious and very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly over-rated, pretentious","review":"The book having started interestingly enough quickly devolves into utter nonsense. The author is trying hard and appears as if she's been to too many writer's workshop. Ultimately a waste of my time and effort. And I feel that despite the fact that when I started I really wanted to like the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it for its language if not the story.","review":"I read alot. Sometimes several books a week. I am partial to novels. I was initially draw to this by the title. You must admit, it inspires curiosity.I read the book in 3 days despite its 514 pages. The story was interesting but not particularly compelling. What maintained my interest was the author's gift for simile and metaphor; a bit tedious at times; but wonderous to behold.I eagerly await her next offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"An original plot and unique writing style carry the reader through a political science discourse about the use of murder as a tool to prevent corporate abuses. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wordy, wonderful coming-of-age novel","review":"This novel reminds me of a snowball rolling down a hill, slow at first but then speeding to the end--but it's a good thing. The story starts slow, building the background of Blue van Meer and her father, but then expands into a murder mystery. While the mystery aspect is less than half the book, the earlier part of the book has set up all the information we need to figure out the truth...if the truth can really be found.While it is a story of Blue's coming-of-age, it is so much more. Don't let the size of the book scare you; it starts out slow, but then you get sucked into Blue's story. I couldn't tear myself away. The ending had me gasping, rereading parts of the book and dreaming about it at night. This book is so unusual, a book to savor. Pessl's writing can be wordy, but I didn't have any problem with it. Just expect an unusual book and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious to a degree..","review":"I struggled through to page 150 before I gave up - and I don't give up on books very often. After 150 pages I was still waiting for something interesting to happen - this wouldn't have been SO bad had it not been for the irritatingly pretentious style. It's one of those books where on almost every page the reader is confronted with the author's intellectual superiority - you probably know the sort of thing - countless references to obscure books, wandering discussions on subjects of little interest, copious use of foreign phrases without translation - all in a kind of sub-Nabokovian style which sets my teeth on edge.Obviously I have some kind of blind spot - I can see that a lot of people have rated this book very highly. Try to read a few pages before you buy - I think you'll either love it or hate it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For Everyone (See \\"Not Everybody's Cup of Tea\\", Bunce, Sep 2002)","review":"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Markedly, a number of individuals did not find the tome to their liking and, truthfully, I am surprised at the number of poor ratings.Put simply, I got it. I found the book witty, sapient, and rousing. I enjoyed the plot and character development as well as the prose. If you are looking for a collegiate-level read that is out of the ordinary and thought provoking in its style, I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Literary Veronica Mars...","review":"Great book that made me want to read and re-read Nabakov. Definitely one of the more oddly paced books I've read but it's a great thing...leaving you vulnerable to the surprises in the second half. It really felt like a nice literary and smart take on Veronica Mars (the TV show). A great show with a teenage protagonist with a similar personality and set of problems. Great style -- those who are complaining about the constant references and footnotes slowing things down, etc...start reading a little slower then. The book unfolded slowly and rewarded in the end. Can't ask for much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A curious novel, a massive undertaking","review":"Since this novel was on many \\"Best Of\\" lists for the year, I was curious. While this certainly isn't the best book that I've ever read, I did appreciate its boldness. Not many novelists attempt to tackle the entire Western Canon in the way that Pessl has. Yes, the references are annoying at times, but mostly they reveal more about the main character, Blue Van Meer, and reveal a scathing commentary on modern academia. My biggest criticism of the novel is that the plot doesn't really pick up until the end. I would have enjoyed more of the momentum earlier in the novel.If you are a fan of literary fiction or of experimental fiction, pick up this novel and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"yikes...","review":"Too many tangents relating to literature the average folk has not read. Plot kept me going but this book is so overwritten. I couldn't recommend this to a friend. It was agonizing to get to the meat of this story.

I love a good book, this was not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many words","review":"A gripping mystery or at least it would be if presented as a short story of 40 pages or less.

It took me 3 trys to make it far enough in the story to catch my attention. Even then, I carried it with me only to appointments or lunch where I had nothing else available to read. I stuck with it, trying to ignore many sections that didn't seem worthwhile. I found myself caught up in it finally by the middle, only to be disappointed by the totally annoying ending. I wanted a good, solid read, and it was a potentially great story wrapped in distracting writing style.

Shiny on the outside but lacking true performance under the hood. You are impressed with the French accoutrements.....but realize there is no heart or soul. It is as if there is something odd in the performance and delivery. The voice is almost masculine in it's timbre and range....which is totally not congruent with Yanna's pictures on the net. Are the soundtracks truly Yanna's creation or is this smoke and mirrors...........????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction","review":"This was the first stuff from Martin I heard, and I just fell in love with his sound.

So it's not as lush as the real deal, as in LIVE. Artists with natural talents like Sexton's rarely release full-length, commotion free LP's. Yet I refuse to condemn his \\"commercialness\\" on the basis that Martin Sexton is one of the most talented guitar players/vocalsts around. Thus I highly recommend seeing him live for the full effect....as I intend to do very soon. Despite the candy-coating on some of these recordings, they still reasonate with the same soulful core found on previous releases like Black Sheep or In the Journey. The CD is not as catchy as The American, but I think it succeeds in conveying the spirit of his music. I would certainly encourage new listeners to check out the older stuff first. With a bit of history and a good ear, this CD will grow on others as it is surely growing on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD ALBUM","review":"Martin Sexton is an extremely talented musician and this album is extremely disappointing!

Black Sheep was incredible , In the Journey was raw and the American was good.

Where \\"The American\\" showcases Martin's ability to leap blithely between genres, \\"Wonder Bar\\" is a more unified, introspective, unwhorling. From the searingly sensual \\"Where did I go wrong\\", to the poignant, haunting \\"Elephant's Memory\\" echoing the struggles of fathers and sons, to satiric,teasing, \\"Casino Foundation\\",Wonder Bar is pure Martin.. expanded, developed: refreshingly honest, secretly perfectionistic, vocally transcendent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too religious","review":"I donated this CD to our library.

As a result, her marriage agreement is broken off. Her family is ashamed of her decision, and will no longer support her.

The plot starts out a little slow, with good character development, but the pace picks up later.

The action, romance, intrigue, and self-discovery that Tad Williams incorporates is excellent in that it is powerful and creative. I liken Memory, Sorrow and Thorn to Melanie Rawn's Dragon Star and Dragon Prince Series by virtue of its epic quality and reader involvement.

They will thank you every Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Holiday Gem","review":"It is always interesting to hear the \\"new\\" Christmas albums each year, which usually turn out the same old songs and same old arrangments. Thank God for Linda Eder. She always manages to breathe new life into old songs and for the first time in her recording career -- this album is loaded with them. Most notably, \\"Here Comes Santa...\\" medley is truely inspired as a swing, bluesy number, and the almost chamber orchestra version of \\"Drummer Boy\\" is outstanding. However, no song comes close to the amazing near tribal arrangements and vocal performance on \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" Simply put, not only is this a wonderful additional to your holiday collection but will probably continue to find its way to the top of the pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"The worlds best voice singing the holidays most loved songs!","review":"Linda Eders voice will certainly bring the Christmas spirit into your home with this fantastic collection of Christmas favorites and new songs. Stnadout tracks include her uplifting rendition of Do You Hear What I Hear backed by the Broadway Choir. Her version of O Holy Night is probably one of the best out there. Her voice is a gift from the Gods and should not be ignored.Every time I listen to hear I get chills up and down my spine. A perfect album for the holiday season as well as any time of the year. Also included are beautiful versions of Silent Night, Ave Maria, Little Drummer Boy, and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Class Act for Christmas","review":"I first fell in love with Linda last year when I saw her perform live in an intimate room called Feinstein's at The Regency in Manhattan, and I have been smitten ever since. Her voice is truly a gift and once again she delivers an album of gorgeous songs, this time for the best time of year. Linda treats these classics with respect and care, and at the same time brings her own indelible touches to the songs. Once again, her husband Frank provides terrific new songs guaranteed to fit right in among these holiday classics. The Broadway gospel choir provides magical touches as well. The standout is \\"Do You Hear What I Hear\\" done with a surprising and risky, but utterly successful African rhythm. Treat yourself now to an early holiday gift. This is one class act!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a cd to get very excited over","review":"This will be the second Linda E. cd for me to buy. To be honest, it left a lot to be desired. As I have stated on several occasions, Linda has a vast talent, but that is just half of the battle to be a great singer. With this talent there must be excellent arrangers working in your corner. You know the people who make you sound great.Well, Linda used average arrangers and got average results. Also, I felt like Linda could have used a better repertoire. I feel like Linda used too many comptempory songs on this cd. All in all, I wouldn't say this cd bombed, but I really felt like it could have been a lot better.No doubt about it, Linda is a rising super star with the sky being the limit.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good CD","review":"This is a good CD. I do not think it is as great as all the reviews said, but a good standard to have in your holiday collection. She does have a fantastic voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHILST LOOKING FOR XMAS MUSIC, I","review":"happened upon this site, and I am not buying this cd for one reason, the inclusion of The Little Drummer Boy. This piece has been recorded by everyone from the Chipmunks to the Harry Simeone Chorale to the Ray Coniff Singers to Emmy Lou Harris. C'mon! Do we need another version?? What a waste! Everyone has done it a unique way, there are no new arrangements left. The inclusion of this track tells me the producer was not using their imagination, which agrees with some of the other negative reviews. Sorry Linda, you may have a great voice, but no royalties from me this xmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Linda Eder Christmas Album","review":"Just a great classic collection.What a voice! I don't know what else you could ask for from an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spread the Word","review":"I'd love to buy this CD for everyone on my Christmas list, all my co-workers, friends, casual aquaintances and everyone who has not heard it. I don't have a musical background so I can't elaborate like others have done on the style, the arrangements, but I know what I like. The inclusion of many traditional songs, Silent Night, What Child Is This, only adds to my enjoyment of the CD. (Besides shouldn't we remember the 'reason for the season') At this point my co-workers remind me to start 'my' music if I don't start playing this early in the morning. My boss is now hooked on her version of Santa Claus is coming to Town. Truly if I could buy 100's of these and give them to strangers on the street to insure they've heard Ms. Eder's voice I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas in October? Why not?","review":"This is one of the best Christmas albums I have ever heard. And I am not ashamed to admit that I have been blasting it in the middle of October. Linda has done it again. Adding her own personal touch to songs that have been loved forever. The result is amazing. New versions of songs such as \\"Silent Night\\" and \\"O Holy Night\\" will have you spellbound, and her new song \\"The Bells of St. Paul\\", is magnificent. Don't wait untill December to get this CD. You miss out on two whole months of amazing music. But what else did you expect, it Linda Eder?"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEYOND COMPARE","review":"LINDA EDER is simply one of the most GENUINELY Talented performers working today, I have been mesmerized by Linda since hearing her first album,I recently had the pleasure of seeing her LIVE on my birthday with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra in which she performed 10 of the 13 songs from the album and just suffice it to say you have live singers and then you have LINDA EDER,truly in a class all her own! VERY Original and very moving renditions of our favorite Christmas Carols are found on this MUST HAVE CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas gift to treasure!","review":"Linda Eder has yet to come out with a less-than-stellar album, and this one is no exception. Her vocals, backed up by the Broadway Gospel Choir and an exceptional group of musicians, are phenomenal. There are the traditional carols which have been given the flair that only she can give, and of course, what album would be complete without a couple of Frank Wildhorn's beautiful melodies? Fans of \\"Vienna\\" will enjoy \\"The Bells of St. Paul,\\" a gorgeous carol with the same type of musical flavor. She gives Judy Garland a run for her money with her rendition of \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.\\" \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" is one of the most inspirational arrangements that I have heard to date. I could go on and write a book about how wonderful this CD is, but you must hear it for yourself--buy it!! You will not be disappointed. \\"Christmas Stays the Same\\" is truly a gift to treasure. Thanks Linda!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This musical is great. It is upbeat, hard not to snap your fingers along with the 50's rock n' roll beat. IT is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to smell like your grandmother???","review":"I love the scent of Grapefruit, which is why I bought this product. I was very disappointed. The smell is atroucious. The scent reminds me of cheap, dimestore, grandma perfume. It went straight into the trash! Sorry to be mean, but please don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough!","review":"This DVD has great videos of various stretches of Hadrian's Wall; well done and pleasant to look at. It also has very, very good, introductory material. This could have been a great video on the Wall. However, at only 10 minutes, one wonders why the producers even bothered. Perhaps it was meant to be shown in a visitors' center. It might have been OK for that. But for a home video, there simply is not enough material to make it worth the while. And, at over $10, the value just isn't there. Look into the various other videos on Hadrian's Wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked","review":"At first I loved it, but leaving it in the pond under the sun for only one week made it crack up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe You!","review":"This cd may say that,that they are the Original Artist,But it doesn't say ANYTHING about the original radio recordings so in short till more information comes out about it,i'd say it's gonna be ANOTHER lemon----class reunion stuff,(GARBAGE) NOT worth the gamble till the producer levels the playing field,and let's us know that this isn't another one of those GOT'CHA's.. I know i won't be wasting my money to find out.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad","review":"I would say: not bad. But so far! Where are the deep effects of the Schubert's music? Where is the feeling of this music? It's not bad for a first CD, but I don't know if I would buy the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Book","review":"I can only write about my few years with her - but I certainly have more insight about the woman not so much the singer than this whole dumb book.Lots about recording - of course he was not there - and nothing about her other than \\"and then she did\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great BP cuff","review":"I am very pleased w my purchase of this BP cuff. It is accurate and comes in a very nice case. I have been a practicing nurse for almost 50 years and this BP cuff is great for my uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"great purchase","review":"Works great, bought two other cuffs from medical supply stores that were in the same price range and both were incomparable to this one in quality. The carrying case is also very nice. Great product and great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"I bought this for nursing school and it doesn't work very well. When I let it out it doesn't fall freely. It is impossible to take a correct blood pressure using this. I will not be purchasing another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gauge isn't calibrated properly.","review":"Bought this because it was from Prestige and figured it would at least work fine. However it was shipped with the gauge wrong. It is set higher than the 0 mark. Even though it is not a lot higher than the 0 mark, it still renders the BP wrong. Expected more from Prestige. Even though it says free recalibrating, the shipping cost makes it not worth it. Figured it would require recalibrating like maybe after a year or so but not right when it gets shipped. Very disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cuff","review":"This cuff produces consistent blood pressure readings in everyone that I've used it on. You have to buy your own stethoscope, and I'd recommend an Omron Sprague Rappaport as a cheap, usable companion."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"So far it works just fine. I'm a medical student, I have this at home so I can monitor my in-laws' BP because they're hypertensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Great, works well, pack can also fit your own stethoscope, and THIN side pocket can fit your pen-light and pens. Great for EMTs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I got this sphygmomanometer for an EMT class. It works really well, and I haven't had any problems with the calibration, gauge, or cuff. It works really well and lets the air out slowly for an accurate reading. I also really like the green carrying case and the material. It's comfortable and sturdy! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I purchased this in December 2010 and after just 2 years, it no longer works. The rubber balloon inside the arm cuff has fine holes in it causing it to lose air.The only reason I gave it 2 stars was it worked fine initially and I love the color. I won't be buying a prestige product again----live and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Bought this for my daughter in nursing school, she loves it!! Very pleased, looks great and works good too! Everyone's happy"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"The pressure knob is not quite as smooth as my old one but works great. Seems to fit majority of my patients too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cuff for the field!","review":"This is an excellent cuff for the field. It has an artery indicator on the cuff to save time during triage/treatment and size range index to know if it's a proper fit. Pair it with a Littmann and you're set. Just one note: IT IS NOT LATEX-FREE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last","review":"This item seemed like a good buy and worked fine at first. However, 1-1/2 years later, the rubber hoses and pump bladder have become brittle and leak. The unit is no longer usable. Poor materials have made this a DO NOT BUY recommendation from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this in late 2009, and its junk","review":"The tubing crumbled to dust and there is air leaks everywhere.. The cuff won't even inflate.

It worked great at the beginning. Then one day it just stopped working. I am not sure what happen, but I wouldn't buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally arrived","review":"I got the item after several weeks - much longer than anticipated. Not sure what happened with that! However, once it arrived, it is perfectly fine for use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter for nursing school!","review":"I just began nursing school, and while it was not required that we purchase a BP cuff, I wanted the extra practice. This was great! My favorite part is by far how easy the valve is to work. Unlike the cuffs provided at school, the valve is very easy to use, providing an easy way to get a slow and steady decline of pressure, making for a more accurate reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional rest","review":"We've had this for a year and a half or so, and have no problems with chipping, fading, or anything of the sort. Looks like new. We use it in rotation with our other single spoon rest, it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Spoon Rest!","review":"This attractive spoon rest is nice looking and holds regular silverware and medium large spoons/utensils with ease. I've had this for awhile now and it still looks new! Good purchase!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase","review":"Great purchase,fast delivery. Was a pleasure to do business with the seller. I love the product for cooking multiple dishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word - Perfect","review":"This spoon rest fits my spoons very well and is a sturdy material which is easy to clean up. I like having two spoon rests since it always seems like I am making meals where i don't want to use the same spoon for both pans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive and practical","review":"Very pleased with this spoon rest. It's attractive enough to keep on my counter full-time, and it's big enough to hold even the largest spoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Like!","review":"I was looking for a better quality of Stainless Steel. No i would not recommend this item to anyone at the cost you offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like truck nuts....Gross!","review":"I just can not get over the fact that it looks like stainless testicles! My husband threw away the packaging or I would have sent it right back...as it is not with the effort, I am just ordering a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Spoon Rest","review":"Girlfriend broke my old ceramic one, so we decided go with this one. I really like the fact that it has two spots for spoons. In addition, it's easy to clean, it's ergonomic, and it's solid. I highly recommend it. Also, it doesn't really look like a butt, like everybody else says. If it does, it's not that distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good investment","review":"I needed a new spoon rest. One that wounldn't break. I'm over having a ceramic spoon rest! A heavy duty one! One strong enough for my heavy big mixing spoons to set on. This is the one. Very sturdy and shiny. Looks good on the stove. I finally found it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wrote this book","review":"I was surprised to find my Workbook here. It's a great little workbook if you're interested in learning how to approach gals troubled by their pregnancy in a compassionate and loving way. Lots of tips for helping these ladies and their babies. What can I say...its the best book I've ever written. LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"A huge help","review":"This book was a huge help in my QM for business course. I would have been lost without it, because the assigned text was opaque at best. This book is very clearly written and has a lot of exercises with solutions which are frequently explained. While it did not cover all of the same topics as my assigned text, it covers enough of the fundamentals that I could get a grip on my much less apprecitated assigned text."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Disgrace to the Profession","review":"This is hands down the best book written by teachers for teachers! I am recommending it to every teacher I know! As a teacher, I could definately relate to many of the frustrations caused by the gov. and administration. The new programs, more work less pay, mentoring (not all bad, but too much is too much), and so on. Read this book and if nothing else you will know you are not alone in this world we call education."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Futuristic, Fast-Paced, quick read.","review":"From the Back Cover: Hotshot. Shuttle jockey. A pilot crazy enough to try a docking maneuver that's already killed two men, and good enough to pull it off. Just the pilot the Company needs for a suicide run, to catch a sabotaged liner falling into the sun.Her name is Melacha Rendell: They call her the Skyrider.The story and book are in a very readable format, so the pages turn very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Book","review":"This was an absolutely wonderful book. I only wish that I had read a book like this when I was going to college. It is practical, well thought out and a true resource. I highly , highly recommend that parents, kids on their way to college read this and discuss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"College freshman from Birmingham finds this book helpful.","review":"I am just starting freshman year here in Birmingham, at UAB, and plan to major in math. I expect this will be hard.The suggestions in this book, which was recommended by my high school college counselor over the summer, have given me several ideas about how to succeed in freshman year.I plan to get to know at least one professor each term, plan to choose classes that have many short homeworks instead of one long one, and plan to track how I spend my time, and plan to work in study groups outside of class. I just hope other students are willing to do this too.This book seems to have many practical suggestions for me as a new college student, and I enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter disapointment","review":"I found this book to be dismal. I recieved it as a gift, but I found the advice to be narrow...perhaps \\"Making the best of Harvard\\" would have been a better title. The opinions stated are fully based on research there, and allow no room for other teaching/housing/living styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"way to long","review":"they did not answer my e-mail it took almost 3 weeks to mail it it should have taken 4 days tops"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, but depends on frame of reference.","review":"I had recently bought Fatboy Slim's On The Floor at the Boutique. That really was a fantastic album, and I keep coming back to it. I wanted to hear more of the series (and 'The Boutique' is a large series), and made this my second selection.I was pretty disappointed. Where Fatboy Slim had a lethal plate of beats and 303's, this album has a lot of remixed old hip-hop songs (Jungle Brothers and Blackstreet). This isn't really bad in and of itself, but it detracts from the main theme of the record: Big Beat. It is, afterall, the Big Beat Boutique, isn't it?So, that having been said, I liked the blackstreet remix. I even liked the Jungle Brothers remix. But I find that I feel \\"strange\\" listening to an album that preaches on and on about \\"blackness,\\" as a white person. Perhaps if the All Stars had focused on the music instead of skin color, the album would have seemed brighter and a little more coherent.Buy used, if at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely weak, even if you're a fan of Lo Fidelity Allstars","review":"I purchased both of the LFA's main 2 albums, \\"How To Operate With A Blown Mind\\" and \\"Don't Be Afraid Of Love\\" (Don't Be Afraid of Love is the better of the two hands down, much more skillful sampling) and enjoyed them a lot, but when I bought this one for [...] bucks it was [...] bucks not well-spent. There are no good songs on here for goodness sake, except for the one by The Prodigy which they didn't mix at all; it sounds exactly the same on the CD that it is derived from (\\"Experiences\\", highly recommended). I was very disappointed, because like other reviewers have said the Fatboy Slim version of \\"On the Floor At the Boutique\\" is extremely good, but the LFA attempt at it is awful. Fatboy's version is very cool and turntablist, but this one is just boring. Don't buy it, it's not necessarily similar to their albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my money. Don't expect Fatboy slim stuff here","review":"My favorite techno CD is On the floor at the boutique by Fatboy Slim so I decided to buy this CD. Worst mistake I ever made. This CD is not like the fbs one and its not techno at all. its all stupid oldskool rap or whatever you call it and the only reason i give it 2 stars is for no diggity. buy the fbs one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dungeon Keeper 2","review":"Would not work.When it was put in the computer, the screen was black.Too much trouble to send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't work under XP","review":"Great game, when it works. It needs to be run in compatibility mode and the 1.7 patch available for the game does not run under this CD. It needs an original CD, not the re-release from EA. Paid 44 bucks for a game that crashes every few minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing RTS, small problems","review":"This is one of the most fun RTS I have ever played. You get to slap around your minions, torture the good guys, and pretty much have a blast being evil. The bile demons are great, and the dark mistresses laughs are creepy. This has a very good sense of dark humor, and I would not recommend it to anyone under 13, or anyone who didn't like dark humor.We got Evil Genius because we heard it was made by the same people. Evil Genius does NOT hold a candle to this. I still play it a hell of a lot, and I still have fun with it.The only problems I have is the fact that it tends to have problems with the videos on my computer, pretty much not playing them. And the fact you cannot get multiplayer to work. If the multiplayer worked, there would be no question about giving this game 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dungeon Keeper To The Max!","review":"This is by far one of the most addictive games ever released. Much like its predecesor, DK2 is addictive, funny, and perfect in just about every other way. The best thing over DK1 is that the dark sense of humor is perfect now. much like the first, there is no cursing or anything, but the narrator and the little cutscences, everything is perfect for the dark humor theme. This game itself is definitely the best strategy game of its time. Non stop action, lots of replay value, skirmish, and multiplayer rounds out this package that should be a part of your collection if you like RTS games."},{"rating":"1","title":"game will not work","review":"shipping was fast but the game wont work. i tryed the game in more than one computer, and i did everything i could to get it to work. i am very upset!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not buy this if you are looking for some hands own","review":"This CD doesn't contain the Virtual PC.

The range of songs on this CD is mindboggling in terms of their disparity. The ones that are actually worth giving a listen to are so banal they are pretty much dime a dozen on CD's like this. This is not the first chillout CD I have ever purchased so I wasn't caught off guard or anything like that. It's just very, very, very bad music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfulfilled expectation","review":"I was quite impressed with the previous review of this item and reviews for similar lunch jars by the same company. After a suspenseful week of waiting, my lunch jar finally arrived. Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. I downloaded the English product manual from Zojirushi's website and the followed directions. I heated up the lunch jar and the food containers with boiling water at about 8 am, dumped the water, dried everything with a towel, and filled the food containers with hot food. By the time I sad down for lunch at 12:15 my food was only lukewarm, and after having the food container open for about 5 minutes, everything was dead cold. I expected my food to keep much warmer after a few hours than it did.I would not recommend use of this particular jar if you intend to keep your food warm for more than about 3 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game BLOWS!","review":"This game was entirely impossible for me to play because of the menus...as the Amazon review says, it's impossible to navigate... the game has this automatic movement in all the selection processes. You have to fight automatic computer movements to make your selections. Example- in the settings screen there's four options... difficulty, quarter length, style of play, and tutorial. Well, I would set it to Pro, 10 minutes, normal, and off, then the game would auto change one of the selections a second before I hit enter- so I had to start all over. It was IMPOSSIBLE! I could not even play a season because of it...it's awful.I hope 2001 isn't like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down","review":"I was very moved by Nicholas Proffitt's novel about espionage in the Vietnam War. What was so intense for me was the CIA's involvement in foreign governments and what a role our government played in the shaping of the war and how the Vietnamese govt's related to their own people.

I know a lot of groups from the 80's like Catus World News, The Farmers Boys, Howard Devoto, The Colour Fields and Positive Noise whose albums are just waiting to be re-discover, it would be a big disappointment from the New Wave Yuppies if nobody dares to re-issue them like what you have done for the Lotus Eaters.

Not only do the full songs (not these stupid audio clips) sound incredble, but bits of history are impacted into the play. If you still need persuasion, go to the official website (whichwitch.no) and click \\"storyline\\" then \\"scene by scene\\". Then you can decide for yourself. This is an unusual musical, but it's really oine of the best out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New York Legend","review":"Stan Edwards or \\"Mr Manhattan\\" as he is known is in a class by himself. Stan is the last of the rare breed of Jazz Singers from his generation. When you listen to each track on this record, you are listening to the honesty and depth of the man himself. Stan does more than just sing a song, he becomes the song as if each tune is autobiographical. His voice is more powerful than a locamotive and just as gentle as rose petal. Listen to this record and you will hear what America's most beautiful music is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Soul","review":"There is no doubt that Edwards has a fine set of pipes. I have heard him perform live many times, and when he's on, he's wonderful. This album is poorly programmed and overlooks Edwards' ability to swing.

Take this as an advice from a music fan from Buenos Aires, who loves the classic & the metal, the disco & the progressive, the funk & the blues... By the way: THIS EDITION IS AWESOME !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whooo! The Awful-liciousness!","review":"I love seeing Black actors get work. That rocks! However, that didn't mitigate the tired and poor script, fake fights, and low-budget production values.This movie steals from \\"Jason's Lyric,\\" \\"Bluehill Avenue,\\" \\"Menace II Society,\\" and so much more. Why make a film if it's going to be not only unoriginal, but worse than the original films?I only saw this to see mega-hottie Chino XL, but he's barely in it. And you never see him shirtless! Critics took Eddie Griffin's \\"Foolish\\" to task for only giving roles to light-skinned women. This movie too implies that only light-skinned sisters can be beautiful. It unfairly implies that it's okay for brothers to come in all complexions, but not sisters.

The shape of the \\"Ashes of Problem Students\\" label part is a different shape and has a different word configuration, but that isn't the worst part. The worst part is that the cork is too small for the opening, so when it arrived, the cork was jammed in there so far I had to pry it out with a knife, damaging the cork. The cork itself is lower quality than the one in the picture. Looking at the picture, the problem is probably the opening of the top being too large on the one I got.These are not the home-fired quality goods they look like on Amazon.

I've always been more impressed with her acting (NIGHT COURT) than her singing (BAT OUT OF HELL) and this CD contains more of her presence and personality than any record I've heard her on! It's mainly the story of a woman who has 2 encounters with a man who, while he comes across as optimistic and uplifting on the surface, is really a self-destructive personality with problems of his OWN!

Of performances in the HIP (historically informed performance) tradition, Podger's is very musically satisfying, indeed. That being said, I must also add, that when I let my hand do the choosing, Ouiga board like (for those who remember Ouiga boards), it still goes automatically for my Philips Duo edition of the Bach sonatas and partitas by Grumiaux every time. To be fair, my spouse's experience is the opposite of mine.

However, an historian Lanning is NOT, and it certainly does show in his interpretive work in this book. First and foremost, can anyone really say what the #1 battle in world history was in terms of importance? Of course not! Lanning tries to do so but it seems the more he tries and goes down his list (and why stop at 100?), the sillier this book becomes. Is Yorktown really the #1 most important battle in military history? No! In fact, it wasn't even the most important in the American Revolution, but don't tell that to Lanning. The book is written from an American-centric perspective, not from a world history perspective. This is why he ranks San Jacinto as #23, but the battle that kicked France out of Canada, made Britain the world super power of the second half of the 18th century, and set the stage for American independence (Quebec) is #29.

This all-instrumental album has a little bit of a lot of different types of music, but manages to transcend and defy genres, as opposed to just merely mix them.

The earlier design could be mounted flush with the bottom of the cabinet. They do provide unsightly plastic extensions for mounting, but their use could have been avoided.

The can gets jammed and the motor continues to whine, and it took herculean effort to get the can back out of its grip. I had to unplug it several times to keep it from burning out its motor while I tried to free the can.I cannot believe the poor design and jamming problems from the B & D namesake, much less the highly touted Spacemaker line of appliances over the years.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a child with an active imagination and who loves to pretend. Especially if you have a boy... I think they identify with the character. My brother loved looking at the pages and seeing the boy in real life... then turning the page and seeing what his \\"pretend\\" life looked like. This book also has some good lessons like, \\"When I get a shot I pretend I am a robot and it doesnt even hurt\\". Of course the next page has the little boy looking like a robot in the doctor's office. Not a great literary book but great for pictures and activating your kid's imagination. This is the one book that he would grab the corners of the page with his chubby little hands so my mom couldn't turn the pages :)! Hope you like it as much as we did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CD version?","review":"For anyone who is considering the CD version as appose to the cassette, you may just want to get the cassette. It is kind of irritating to have to listen to a whole eleven minute section just to re-catch a few lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy the book,","review":"As a lord of the rings fan, I find this audio drama offensive. The voices, the sections left out, the actual audio itself was of such poor quality that it left its listener confused, turning up the volume, and vainly trying to find out if this was a new lord of the rings, written by someone else. Usually I enjoy BBC drama's, but this was not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Rings a Dramatizaation","review":"I found these tapes to be a complete waste of money. The different actor voices were confusing and I didn't care for the abridgement. However, there is an UNABRIDGED reading of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" books (sold as three separate cassettes or CDs) that is worth the price. Instead of paying for a watered down mumbled version, I'd suggest going for the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked and dismayed!","review":"No where in the discription of this audio version of the finest books ever written, did it say \\"this is a recording of a radio program\\"! It is a really good radio program and I have nothing against that...however I wanted an unabridged reading! It is done in 13 episodes, and they skip great parts of the text! I am greatly disappointed and would advise rabid fans of the books to avoid purchasing it. A casual fan or someone who had never read the books would enjoy it very much. It has incredible voices, singing and poetry. There is certain to be increased interest in the series because of the movies coming out in December 2001. Just know this set of CD's for what it is, an abridged interpretation done with many different voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutley awsome !!!","review":"BBc's version was the best very very very good!!!! the voice acting was excellent couldnt get any better. very good voice actors, Brian sibley you did an awsome job keep up the good work !!!! Tolkien is one of the best writers ever or i would say the best in my opinion. The music was perfect,excellent sound fx. Sam was played excellently the voice actor is perfect for sam. I wish there was a sequel tellin about frodos and bilbo and gandalfs stay in the far west and about there return to hobbiton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous Piece of Work","review":"This was most definately the worst thing I have ever purchased in my life. First of all when buying it understand that it is abridged,(not the actual words of the book). Second it is a dramatization and lightly follows the storyline and misses many key plots. The voices are mechanical and don't fit the characters at all. Sometimes during playback the voices sound far away. I tried it on different CD players and it all sounded the same. I have been under the understanding that the BBC created quality dramatizations, but this was as I said, horrendous. If you want to actually be entertained buy the UNABRIDGED version narrated by Rob Ingles. They are more expensive but they will be worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings all the way!","review":"This story is the best I'v ever read! First I saw the movie and that totaly got me into the reading of the Lord of the Rings. Tolkien is very good at describing whats going to happen and you just can up the book down. Now I think it can be slow at some parts, but that is really rare. So last thing you should totaly read this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely enjoyable entertainment!","review":"As a Ring Rat, I find this gift my favorite from christmas! My daughter and I have listened to this over and over in the car, and at bedtime. Except for leaving out all of Tom Bombadill, this has all the meat of the books. I especially liked Sam singing the mournful poem of Luthien. Great character voices. Volume levels fluctuate, and some are in the distortion range. But I can live with it. A great buy, and you'll never tire of hearing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"BBC Audio Version (CD) is First Rate","review":"I remember reading the The Lord of the Rings many times when I was in middle school, and have seldom re-visited the trilogy since then. I also remember listening to parts of the original BBC version of the story on public radio. With the release of the original BBC version to CD, I have been able to re-capture the images and feelings I experienced when first reading the trilogy. The BBC version is masterfully produced and directed, if a bit meledramatic at times, and tells the story that can be enjoyed at home or on the road while making a long drive. Listening to the BBC audio version has sparked my interest in Tolkien and LOTR once again, and I plan to re-read the entire series of Tolkien novels and share them with my kids. My kids (6 and 4) enjoy listening to the CD's in the car and prefer them over listening to music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"I recently purchased this BBC Dramatization and listened to all thirteen CDs in less than a week. I was blown away by it. The acting is incredible and many of the actors characterizations are very different from the one is the movies. I always love to see how someone else interoperates a role. The score and sound effects were also very well done, bringing the listener into the world of the play quite affectively. The narration when there was any was generally good however this is where a very small drawback lies. The battle for Helms Deep would have benefited from some more narration and was therefore somewhat lacking. In all though the production values on this radio dramatization are fantastic and I definitely recommend it to all fans of both the book(s) and movies. One important point to make is that this is a radio dramatization and not an unabridged, or abridged for that matter, reading of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This audio book is NOT unabridged","review":"Not only is this audio book abridged, it's an ADAPTATION. It opens with dialogue between Gollum and his torturer in Mordor (did I miss a chapter?), where it sounds to me like they are torturing him with a stapler. Ian Holm and the rest of the cast give good performances but if you've read the books, even they won't be able to save this \\"adaptation\\" for you. I read and loved The Lord of the Rings and was looking for a nice audio version to keep me company on my long commute - well this ISN'T it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"I have probably listened to this over 30 times since I was a teenager, it is that good. The voice acting is second to none. It is interesting especially now after viewing all three movies to be able to come back and experience the story in a different way, although Ian Holm as Frodo throws me off now since I'm used to him being Bilbo. Some of the songs are a bit annoying, but they are few and far between, and the end goes on for quite a bit. Overall though, I would reccomend to any fan of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"BBC rules!!!","review":"I have heard just about every different audio version of Tolkien's masterpiece and this one is by far above and beyond the rest. It has an excellent cast of voice actors who really embrace their characters (my fav being Sam...it's just how I thought he would sound while reading) There's even orchestration and effects throughout. The whole recording by itself is a masterpiece and it does great justice to The Lord of the Rings series. (The BBC of The Hobbit is just as great!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolkien on audio","review":"The Lord of the Rings Copyright, BBC Enterprises, LTDThis boxed set of the Lord of the Rings on cassette is a reproduction of the BBC dramatization in 1981. It is fabulous. If, like me, you found the books to be the tiniest bit tedious in places (in the name of Gandalf, no!, I hear many of you saying! Sacrilege! say others), this production is for you. The cassettes are an abridgement of the trilogy, of course, but the storyline is intact, thanks to the brilliant adaptation by Brian Sibley. The acting is excellent, especially Peter Woodthorpe as Gollum (Pre-ciouss-s-s-s-s-s!), and Ian Holm's earnest yet subtle acting makes him the perfect Frodo, as well. In addition, the production is beautifully textured. Outdoor scenes feature birds chirping in the background, battle scenes have rousing scores and throughout there are other wonderful songs or sound effects to add to the atmosphere. It is simply a pleasure to listen to this production!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pursist's Perspective on LotR Audio CD Box Set (BBC)","review":"If you're looking for an exact rendition of LotR, you won't find it on these CDs. It stays true to the story well enough, but many details and characters are omitted to squeeze the production into 13 hours. Tom Bombadil is a good example. The plot unfolds differently, spending shorter but more frequent periods with the remnants of the fellowship. It's no substitute for the book, but it's time well spent in the car. If you're a selective collector of items like art, calanders, and criticisms, you'll enjoy this addition to your collection.I would have rated it higher had it been longer and more detailed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen better","review":"I thought this book had a good premise, but it failed to live up to my expectations. If you think the idea of paralell worlds sounds fascinating, go rent Sliding Doors. This book was too preachy. Finch tells the story as if she's trying to convince you that this is the way the world actually is. Instead of finding interesting ways to explain how her fiction could be science, she uses a lot of jargon that sounds almost-good and expects you to fall for it. This is not science-fiction; it's just fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on the Subject","review":"Before I started my current role, this book was given to me by a neighbor.

The exterior vinyl is heavy duty, with strong stitching and clean construction. The fit is slightly oversized, which makes zipping up very easy. Also, the zippers are of superior quality, so they slide smoothly and look and feel like they'll last a long time. The single front zip pocket, though not large enough for long bolsters, is more than adequate for a thick set of flannel sheets and all your oils and lotions. I especially like the wide shoulder strap. It is adjustable to quite a long length (which is great for my long reach) and has an extra thick curved shoulder pad for added comfort. If you are looking for a top-of-the-line, super deluxe case with all the bells and whistles, you should probably keep searching. However, if you want a very good quality, basic massage table case, for an excellent price, this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good table case","review":"This case fits the table nicely, has a large pocket for sheets and other items and has shoulder and hand straps.

Anahit, for example, is a true masterpiece. This album, however, doesn't catch Scelsi in his best domain. The textural nature of Scelsi's work is very well suited to large ensembles with an assortment of instruments, where he works with the full sonic range of every instrument to create lush and diverse textures. This technique simply doesn't work with a small homogenous ensemble, such as the string quartet. I've never heard a two hour album that sounds so monotonous and repetitive. The performance is first rate, but I just can't recommend this album to anyone but the most devout Scelsi fanatic.

HBO won't even put 13 episodes onto 4 DVDs anymore -- too many complaints from the consumers, apparently. Witness their recent releases of Six Feet Under Season 2 and The Wire Season 1; both DVD sets are 13 episodes onto 5 DVDs. What is likely will happen in January is that HBO will split up the season (like they did with Sex and the City) and release the FIRST HALF (8 episodes) of Oz Season 4.

I am only reading it because I have to. I wonder how this ever won any prize.

When I first saw the book I didn't think I would like it but when I started reading it I really enjoyed it. The best part of this book was when the four sixth grade kids participated in the Academic Bowl and I also like the way Mrs. Olinski chose the four kids to be in the Academic Bowl. I also liked Ms. Konigsburg's writing style, but I thought the chapters were a little to long which made the book seem a little long. I think this book was better then FROM THE MIXED UP FILES OF MRS. BASIL E. FRANKWELLER that I read and liked also. I would highly recommend THE VIEW FROM SATURDAY to anyone in 5th through 8th grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"The View from Saturday by E.L Konigsburg","review":"The View from Saturday is a story about friendship, love, and sea turtles. It is also the story of a paralyzed sixth-grade teacher, and her four sixth graders on a journey during the confusing summer after fifth grade. Each of them has troubles to overcome and adventures. The first young man to finish his journey is Noah Gershom, who, according to Nadia Diamondstein, is smart beyond his years--but not wise. Nadia is a hybrid and so is her dog. Ethan Potter is, yes, the younger brother of Luke! And Julian...he wears knee socks. There isn't very much to say about him.The View from Saturday is a puzzle you put together, piece by piece. The big pieces are: Mrs. Olinski; The Academic Bowl; and tranquilized dog treats. The smaller pieces are: A calligraphy pen; the old Sillington house; and four cups of tea.! This book is not a puzzle. It is a cup of tea.Book Review by Jayme"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of the Finest Novels Yet!","review":"The View From Saturday is one of the best novels that's ever been written.

Their teacher, Mrs. Olinksi, chooses these four students for her Academic Bowl and they win against 6th, 7th, and 8th graders!

I liked it because it was a story about 6th graders like me beating 7th and 8th graders in a contest. It was also about learning to be kind and care for others.

I advise you, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME BUYING AND READING THIS BOOK!!!Have you ever heard of 4 seventh graders not inturrupting each other and listening to each other nicely? NO!The four main character brats, Noah, Nadia,Ethan, and Julian are overly smart and piggish. They do not act like 7th graders AT ALL!!! They have some kind of physic connection that COULD NOT POSSIBLY EXIST IN REAL LIFE!!!I highly advise you NOT to read this book!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ok Book","review":"The View from Saturday is an Ok book. I didn't think it was all that good but it was a humorous book. The plot seemed kind of confusing because it jumps from the future to each characters past or what makes them a good contestant for the contest.

In the process, they not only create their own, kinder world, but they gentle the world around them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I wanted to familiarize myself with middle grade literature, and picked this up at Barnes and Noble. I was extremely and unpleasantly surprised to find that the content of this book was as dry and uninteresting as, say, a tome on the use of a fork would be. I cannot imagine a single middle-school student who would find this interesting, or benefit from it. In fact, I looked up the Newbery Medal to find out how they award this honor. It's no surprise that popularity among children is not considered. That doesn't make any sense to me.Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this, whether you're an adult or a middle-school student. There are a great many books that teach you life lessons without being so arcane (and mundane)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only for kids!","review":"This is without a doubt, one of my all-time favorites! I am a 40-something with no children, but when I heard the NPR on-air book club discussion of THE VIEW FROM SATURDAY, I had to rush to buy it. It is a joy to read! E. L.

I think that this was a very good book, and it kept my attention.

With more deatails and a plot the book would be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got to Be Kidding","review":"If I could I wouldn't give this book a star at all. What's the deal with the Newberry award? It seems to be an exclusive club where the same authors win over and over again. Case in point: E. L. Konigsburg. Her first book was terrible; this book hits new lows. The characters are confusing, the plot can be figured out in two chapters (read: very bored seventh graders) and she writes the most awkward sentences I have ever read. There is assuredly much better authors out there than this woman. She's terrible! The John Newberry award seems to be in the possession of a committee that wants only a very few of its club members to win. The fact that this awful dribble has even been considered for an award only furthers this belief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When i read the book \\"From The Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E.

Each time I read it, I grow to like E.L. Konigsburg morea and more as an author. She brings us clever and interesting characters that make us want to keep reading.This book is one of her best. It revolves around a Quiz-bowl team of 4 sixth graders who become friends in the process of protecting their parapalegic teacher.

I liked how the author chose to switch back and forth from present to past to explain how the children answered the quiz questions. I love how I was slowly drawn into the lives of each character.

I found it very confusing and hard to follow. There were too many flashbacks. I felt the plot was boring and there was no climax in the story. This is not how 6th graders act, very unrealistic.

Don't bother reading The View from Saturday, unless you like plain boring books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story...","review":"I picked up this book because it was on my son's required Summer Reading list and I wanted to read it along with him. (I will admit that it was probably not the best pick for a 12 year old boy who is partial to Harry Potter and Alex Rider collections. But I'm glad he got to read it.) The book is absolutely beautiful, and will stay with me for many, many years. Without being preachy, this story teaches the value of silence, of being quiet with oneself, of letting go of negativity and hatred in order to open oneself to kindness and beauty, and of the importance of friendship. It is a very simple story, with complex layers of meaning and plenty of room for projecting your own self into the themes. In my opinion, only a sophisticated middle school reader will appreciate this book on his/her own. But with group discussion, it is sure to become a favorite, remembered long after middle school ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"The View from Saturday","review":"This is a GREAT Book!

Publishers, authors, printers, (and so on) do there best to make a book others will enjoy, and sometimes there are mistakes. Just because there was a bit of a typing error doesn't mean that a reviewer needs to get all up in their face about it! Things happen, my goodness!

It was horrible. I would never recommend this book to anyone. It had absolutely no plot. The auther told you the ending on the first page. The climax was boring. I didn't even know it was the climax. There was no action at all, and I don't think that 6th graders really act like that.When I read a book I like to want to read the next page.

It jumped from chapter to chapter without any setup. It was a cute story, but if it would have laid out a nice story map in the very beginning with a list of characters it would have made more sense. This was a required book for class, if it had not been required I never would have finished it. I would have quit after the first chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was one of the greatest books written.","review":"The book was the best I've read in years!

This is just one opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The View from Saturday???","review":"For me this book was terrible. I didn't understand it at all.

My advice is don't waist your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters without Flaws","review":"This books starts out okay, and you belive that it will be another \\"Mixed up files\\" caliber book. But it is not. The main problem I see is the main characters, The Souls, don't have any real flaws. Oh yeah, sure Noah is a little know-it-all, but thats as worse as it gets. They all just do everything right and win win win. The teacher being in a wheelchair starts out promising, but it is underdeveloped and you just feel like the author was making another ploy to tell you how great it was that these four kids and their teacher made it this far. The reader is left feelling cheated that their intelligence is not accounted for. Everything is black and white in this book.

I dab my teeth dry with a towel, hold my lips back, apply the gel with a Q-tip, then put the tray on and repeat (I prefer to do the bottom teeth first).

I ride the bus to and from work and I haven't had an accident yet (except once, but that was because I accidentally slammed a car door on the caddy, so it was my fault, not the product's fault). I also like to line the cupcakes on it before I decorate them so by the time I've finished that, all I have to do is throw the top on, lock it down and I'm ready to go :-) The tray also displays them nicely and lets people reach in and grab the ones the want without disturbing the other cupcakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who designed this?","review":"Seriously, did they not test this product before mass producing it? What good is a cupcake holder that allows your cupcakes to tip over? The holes for the cupcakes only effectively prevent cupcakes from sliding while you're walking (carefully).

Given it's bulky size, and the fact that most recipes I've come across make 24 cupcakes, this seems to be a real oversight. However, it is 3 in 1 and the cupcake holder is its only failure. Turn it over and it easily accommodates the mini cupcakes. Take out the cupcake insert and it's great for odd sizes like the mini bundts, 9 x 12 sheet pans, and cakes.

But I need to drive my cupcakes somewhere, and set this carrier either on the seat (heh, I put the seatbelt around the carrier) or on the floor, and the cupcakes easily topple over even if I try to drive carefully. And only 12 standard cupcakes in each carrier? I'd need 2 or 3 of these carriers.

I'm not sure what they were thinking, but the shallow sections for each cupcake - especially the mini cupcakes - just don't work. Cupcakes need something you can set them into.

I'm not sure how many side-by-side fridges have the same measurements, but be forewarned about it if you make a lot of cakes that need to be refrigerated (I like to use whipped cream frosting on a lot of cakes).The cupcake holder is kind of silly as it only has spots for 12 cupcakes. Since when does anyone ever need to transport only 12 cupcakes?

While some other countertenors have the pitch range that Davina has, her dynamic range is beyond anyone else I've heard in this category. The top register is huge and expansive, and most impressive. And Davina doesn't just bellow. The accuracy and flexibility in the Handel and Mozart are as delightful as the amazingly long, haunting phrases of Summertime and Addio del passato. I have had the pleasure of hearing Davina live several times, including her portrayal of Mabel in \\"Pirates of Penzance\\" in Washington DC, and in opera scenes (her spin on \\"Addio\\" is...unusual) , and this recording captures the essence of the amazing abilities of this six and a half foot tall soprano with the baritone speaking voice. And the liner notes are a hoot! A must-buy and a great bargain here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Softer Side","review":"I haven't had this cd very long, but I've listened to it several times. This is definately a softer side of the industrial genre. This cd ponders more into romance and broken hearts in their lyrics unlike most other bands of this genre which are more about songs about politics, disturbing psychological states, and the dark depressing state of the world. It's a album that sounds like 80s pop but with more 21st century technology in their beats and rythyms. The vocals are quite good even though most artists in this genre don't usually focus on voice, including me. But I do like this album despite the fact that I usually listen to more intense and \\"evil\\" music such as Numb or Psychopomps. This album is good for me if I just want to chill out a little. I think I liked the previous album \\"Chaotica\\" a little better, but this is definately a worthy release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial first video","review":"First video on the DVD was very superficial and did not teach how to take a noon shot. The second was better, but not good enough to take a noon shot by itself. It referred to a data sheet which was not included. Overall not as good as the Davis Manual available on line for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for preschoolers","review":"I got a few of these sticky note pads after trying a few different removable tape solutions. My four year old loves to draw artwork and write names in the lettering space and these stay on the wall even with the house fan running, where the removable tape, art seems to fall off in a few days with no breeze. I like this because *she* can select where she wants to put the stuff up and I dont have to worry. It has not caused any problem on woodwork, wallpaper or painted drywall. So there is motivation to learn writing, and empowerment in terms of placement and overall enjoyment of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks durability, not for young kids","review":"We were very happy with this TV/VCR when we first received it. It was very easy to use and quite portable. But then after 2 weeks the play button on the front panel stopped working. A week later as I was getting ready to take it to the repair shop, my daughter stuck some crayons in the VCR slot. When I took it into the repair shop, the receptionist said not to worry about it, kids stick stuff in VCRs all the time and it's not that big a deal. Well the next day I got a call from the repair shop saying the unit was so badly damaged from the crayons that it couldn't be fixed. He said the power supply was blown, the gears broken, and a few other things. If we had bought a regular TV with a separate VCR, we would now at least still have the TV, but as it is we're back to being a single TV family."},{"rating":"2","title":"HALLOWEEN 25 YEARS OF TERROR","review":"GREAT DVD TO REUNITE ALL THE MOVIE ACTORS/ACTRESSES.

In addition to reality of sights, sounds and smells, the author ensures the reader's sympathy with the all too human Crowner, despite his moral failings, as he pursues justice. Enjoy a fascinating mystery as you increase your knowledge of medieval times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless (includes spoiler)","review":"Well, perhaps if I had read any other in the Crowner series, I might have previously developed some kind of empathy for the boorish, self-centered primary character. However, I believe a good book should be able to stand on its own, which this absolutely did not.After mulling through this entire story **SPOILER** the solution of the first (title) murder is casually tossed to the readers, with scant character development of the murderer or his motivation. And as for the more \\"primary\\" murder: you NEVER find out Who Dun It or Why!!!!

Arghhhhh.......!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far, So Good","review":"I just recently purchased this book after teaching myself to knit less than a month before. I really wanted to be able to knit socks and was obviously wanting to jump right in. I decided to get this book after reading other reviews here and I have to say that this book was a good choice for me. The directions are very clear and I am already halfway through my first pair of socks. I decided to make both socks at the same time so I haven't actually gotten to my first heel turn, but so far the directions have been so clear that I'm not really afraid of when I get to that point. I really like that the author first takes you through the different parts of the sock and has even knitted a sock in different colors to demonstrate the different parts. I also like that this books goes from very easy to progressively more difficult socks. There are about 20 (sorry I don't have the book in front of me at the moment) socks shown in this book, so I'm sure that I will be using it for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sock book EVER for a new sock knitter","review":"I am not new to knitting, but could NOT figure out how to knit a sock. This book is positively the best at teaching how to do this. Now I can knit any sock any time, any place. AWESOME. You have to have some knitting know-how and not be a knitting newbie, though. GREAT book."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time sock knitter and I'm inspired","review":"I have been wanting to knit socks for awhile. When I saw this book, and the rave reviews it received, I thought I'd take a chance. So far, so good. I started with the first, and easiest, pattern and I've been pleased with the outcome.I gave it four rather than five stars because I haven't knitted almost all of the patterns, so I don't know how easy they are to do for the beginner sock knitter. But, judging from the clear and easy-to-follow first pattern, the same detail carries through for the rest of the patterns, so I'm hoping they're do-able too.What's good is that the sock patterns utilize different yarn weights, so not all the socks need to be knit in finger or sport weight yarns. In fact, some of the patterns provide instructions for two weights, so that expands a knitter's options.Overall, this is a good beginner's book to sock knitting. I am encouraged to continue to knit socks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended, but be aware!","review":"I love this little sock book. I like the different weight yarns as well as the patterned socks. Great for the beginner (with some knitting experience) as well as the seasoned knitter. Just be aware that there are some mistakes. If you have any knitting experience, then the mistakes are obvious as you go along and you'll know to avoid making them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fun, helpful book","review":"This is a helpful book for new sock knitters. The style of the book as a sock is charming too, but of course that doesn't help you knit a sock, does it!? I like the way the patterns are laid out, sometimes letting you know how many stitches are left unworked, giving additional information which usually is not included in regular sock patterns. Some patterns have two versions, a smaller size and a larger, or two different versions depending on the yarn weight. The first sock in the book is the beginner sock, and while it is often a good idea to knit a \\"baby\\" sock as a first effort, the beginner pattern here is good too for those who want to dive right it.Be advised that there are a 3 small corrections to the patterns in the book. Search under Storey Publishing Knit Socks! pattern corrections to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condition is questionable","review":"This book was listed as \\"New\\". Well, that is questionable. The front cover has a nick out of it and the binding is rough and wavy. It was going to be a gift, but I don't feel comfortable giving it. I am disappointed. This book should not have been listed a \\"New\\". If I wanted one that was \\"Used\\" I would have purchased a used copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baffled by the gusset","review":"I am SO frustrated!! I read the reviews of this book and I ordered this book and thought \\"Maybe THIS time I'll be able to sucessfully knit a sock.\\" But I am still baffled by the gusset. Only now I'm baffled by the gusset and $14.00 lighter. Oh well. I am now of the belief that I will only learn to knit a sock if some patiently sits down next to me and SHOWS me how to pick up the stitches in the gusset.Congratulations to all of you successful sock knitters. I am in awe of you all. The book is darling and the socks that I still can't knit are really cute.Sorry.Melissa White"},{"rating":"2","title":"top notch tester","review":"This jewel of an album is my pick for the best way to test your sound system.

Fishman throws in some positive facts to try and seem neutral, but throughout the book he shows his socialist stripes and lack of understanding of basic economic principals.The sections of the book that I most enjoyed and found most interesting were the great in-depth anecdotes about companies that have a relationship with Wal-Mart.I had trouble finishing this book because his diatribe against Wal-Mart becomes more intense near the end, but at the same time his arguments have so many gaping holes. Those who understand basic economic principles will shake their head in disagreement many times as they turn the pages of this book.Overall, I feel quite dismayed because I think he will be successful in convincing many uninformed readers that Wal-Mart's impact is more harmful than beneficial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too repetitive unless you are a Wal-Mart acolyte","review":"Interesting overview within the first hour (9 CDs... yipes (9 hours)). I had to do a lot of ffwd (consumed as an audiobook) after that, as it was very repetitive information. If you are a fan of Wal-Mart or Sam Walton then this book is for you. If you want some interesting insight on what effect the largest company in the world has and could have then \\"read\\" the first hour or so - then \\"fast forward\\" to the end.The book drones on and on about store numbers, managers and the dogmatic, penny pinching lifestyles of Wal-Mart executives and their climb to the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"love-hate---balanced and fair","review":"I have no love whatsoever for Wal-Mart and often tell my friends that I hope to be alive long enough to see at least a FEW of their locations go out of business. To me, Wal-Mart is an insidious creation catering to the countries lowest common denominator, which shows no signs of stopping. With that said, I give the author much credit for an incredibly fair and balanced portrait of this gargantuan company. You'll even learn about some facts that Wal-Mart is partially responsible for that were true improvements. There lies the dichotomy of this book. He clearly shows the negatives along with some positive - which for a topic that can draw such passionate and heated debate is quite an accomplishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good or Bad, Fishman makes you think","review":"Simply stated, Charles Fishman throws forth ideas and makes you think. Some reviews will say the book is great because it demonstrates Wal-Mart's 'evil' business model. Other will say that Fishman is just another anti-capitalist. As with all reading, and information for that matter, The Wal-Mart Effect should be read with an open mind but through a filter.A great teacher will make a student think. Fishman, doubtlessly, is impressed with Wal-Mart's efficiency. But he remembers to state that efficiency and lower production costs can have long term effects that may not be in the consumer's long term interests.Take the book how you would like. The Wal-Mart effect, like the bible, can be read to say many things. But read both with an open mind and you will have more information with which to approach life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nicely researched book","review":"Charles Fishman does a good job summarizing the \\"effects\\" of the world's largest retailer - all the way down the value chain: end user prices, supplier costs, worker conditions at home and abroad, and social/environmental impacts.In the end, he proposes a solution to deal with such mega-corporations: a change in securities law that requires more transparency. A previous reviewer stated his concerns over increased governmental regulation -- likening it to \\"wolves to handle your stray dog problem.\\" However, I tend to agree with the author that we do not have adequate rules to deal with the relatively new phenomena of mega-corporations -- ones that have attained monopsony control over the market. We have strict laws to deal with monopolies - situations where one \\"seller\\" has significant control over the market. It is not unreasonable to propose greater oversight in situations where one \\"buyer\\" has significant control, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont read this if you only shop at Wal-Mart","review":"This was a great read and supported the many things that are wrong with the worlds largest retailer. I have lent this book to many with favorable response. If you do not want to feel guilty when shopping at this huge retailer, do not read this book. If you want to learn about the real cost of discounts then buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting and repetitive","review":"This book is very interesting but over-dramatized and drawn-out. The author belabors every point with patronizing prose and obvious observations. I listened to the audio version of this book and literally asked myself if I had accidentally inserted the same CD twice when I kept hearing the same thing over and over. That said, it is worth skimming through this piece to hear a fascinating perspective on the world's most powerful company."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Tale","review":"The author tells the story of Sam Walton's growth in the retailing industry. It reads like a volume of HBS case studies. It was fascinating to read. The endings of some chapters are a little inconclusive. Overall it was very informative. I recomend it to anyone interested in learning how sucessful businesses turn failures into victories."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most ineresting books I've read in along time","review":"This is an absolutely fascinating book on a subject that affects all of our lives, whether we realize it or not--Wal-Mart.The business tactics, motives, effects on the economy as a whole are on full display here and I was amazed and stunned. The Federal Gov. inability to use Wal-Mart's figures in the national inflation indexes was/is mind boggling and speaks volume of why people view government figures with a jaundiced eye.Regardless if you are a fan or critic of Walmart, this book is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Objective Analysis","review":"This is a very good, even-handed analysis of the the WalMart effect on the economy from the local consumer to the globalized manufacturing of the products we consume ever day. It was well-written and easy to read.My main complaint is that the writer at times speaks of some of what we might call the company's evils in a most dispassionate manner. At the time of reading, this feels like he is implicitly condones the actions of the companies and its suppliers (even though its clear the suppliers have little option in going along with WalMart).Overall, I think the objectivity of the author plays a key part on the effectiveness of the book. His bias is in the pages, but they do not yell too loud. Anyone looking int the effect of late twentieth century capitalism on America would be well served to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too repetitive - unless you are a Wal-Mart fan","review":"Interesting overview within the first hour (9 CDs... yipes (9 hours)).

A lot of research has gone into this book and Mr. Fishman asks, how did a shop manage to get the power to change our world. Looking at it from a business perspective one cannot help but be in awe of the strategies put in place by the Waltons and their associates. Their commitment to \\"Always Low Prices, Always' is not in any means half-hearted. It will be interesting to explore the new strategies Walmart executes to counter the claims made in this book. Overall a very insightful read and a must for every retailer to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative Book","review":"If you're looking for a book that gives you a review of how Wal-Mart has grown and what sort of power they yield now, this is it.

John Conlee and the people involved with producing this album have done a beautiful job. The love and passion he gives to each song makes you wish you attended John's home church and sat in the pew in front of him. This album has many of the great songs of the church on it but the song by Mak Kaylor and Micheal Puryear, \\"What Else Does He Have To Do,\\" is an incredible song that should be put in every hymnal printed from here on out. John nails this song. The song by Tony Seibert and Jerry Holthouse, \\"They Also Serve,\\" is a marvelous tribute to the families of our military who are left behind and sacrifice so much for liberties along with their loved ones in uniform.

The one I did receive doesn't work well with sensitive skin. It burns and leaves red patches. I had used a retinol product recently and it caused that reaction I'm sure, but since my other toner didn't I can only assume this one isn't as non harsh as others.

It took me about 15 minutes to put the stand together and another 15 minutes to figure out the best way to attach my 10\\" Craftsman Miter Saw to it. The only issue I have is the holes on the miter saw do not match any configuration of slots on the stand. Not a big deal I just drilled holes in the wood of the stand and it works just fine.

I wish I had done the math before I ordered, I would of given some of the other stands another look.On the plus side it seems solid. Though it's difficult to get your hand around the handle when it folded (pretty confined). And I also agree with the reviewer that said it's difficult to disengage the clamps that hold the miter saw base to the crossbars.

What I got was something entirely different. \\"History\\" starts out very vaguely, with Kristin, the main character, constantly referring to \\"The Ghost\\" without explanation. I had to read about a hundred pages before I finally figured out what had happened to her brother, although I guessed what it was beforehand. Kristin's dry, cynical humor was funny at first, but after a while it grew annoying. I don't see how anyone could view two hundred pages of whining and reminiscience as funny.The characters bother the reader, as well. Almost all of Kristin's friends throughout the book are mean to her and two dimensional. Her parents aren't involved in Kristin's life at all, and her mom is a bit crazy. Overall, I found \\"The Life History Of A Star\\" depressing and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Life History of a Star","review":"The book The Life History of a Star by Kelly Easton is about a girl who writes about all the problems in her life.

Although it's not necessarily for the beginner (only because of the lack of audio). They do spell out how to say everything phonetically. Without ever hearing the language previously, I feel it would be very difficult, though not impossible. That being said, it goes step-by-step, starting out very simple and utilizing a lot of repetition. This really helps you get a feel for the language, memorize it and start constructing your own thoughts. I studied Russian for 2 years in college and I'm trying to refresh my skills to travel to Russia - this book is by far the best I've seen. There are also little blurbs throughout that explain the grammar (esp. the Russian cases) in sizable chunks, and short quizzes with answers at the end of each section which really helps out. I would definitely recommend this book to those looking to improve their Russian."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best Thing Is The Price","review":"I was quite disappointed with this product, and had it not been for the price after rebate, I would have certainly returned it. For a beginner, this program can easily be overwhelming, especially in the most important feature which is the \\"immersion environment.\\" The speech pronunciation guide is a farce. I had a native of Puerto Rico listen to the female voice and she said unequivocally that it was terrible. The program gave my native speaker friend poor pronunciation grades--even when she tried over and over again. Much of the program is not intuitive. The details are not worked out well. An example is the bookmark feature which supposedly allows you to start back where you would like. No--you have to go through each and every bookmark you've made before getting to the last bookmark--and you can't name the bookmarks. I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea.

For example, the address on the rebate form that you download from the Amazon site is located in Calabasas, CA. This is an old address for Nova Development. The Company has not provided the post office with a forwarding address, which causes any rebate submissions mailed to the Calabasas address to be returned to you as undeliverable by the USPS. This fact has been brought to the attention of Company representatives by many customers and the vendor has done nothing to correct this problem. Get the picture? Nova Development will place as many hurdles in front of you as possible to scam you out of your paltry $10 rebate. We as customers have a duty to refuse to do business with unethical companies like Nova Development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spanish Premirer Review","review":"I was not a fan of the product.

Another thing I liked in this \\"day of print your own manuals\\", this program came with a printed manual with over 200 pages. A beginner really needs to sit down with the manual and read it first. I found this software to be a great way to spruce up your Spanish skills but I wouldn't recommend it for someone who has no background in Spanish.

They are all identical. So don't be afraid of buying these beautiful glasses because they are made in China, because the fact is that Ray-Ban manufactures them in China.

The rain was not even very heavy and would be described as a light drizzle. The zipper was always stuck and very difficult to zip and unzip with one hand. Also, when the tent was assembled, we could not zip the zipper all the way down which allowed many mosquitos and bees into the shelter. We set up the shelter on a sandy tent site.

I recommend this to no one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlative","review":"Downright superlative to other ghetto fab drama that has been written.

It's raw, brutally honest, loving, visual, and strangelycomforting at the same time. This is the work of a mature, self-assured artist who draws from a well of his own experiences and lets us into his life so that we see the mirror of our own. Powerful stuff. So think of a new Joni Mitchell (lyrically), or k.d. lang for stylistic variety. Garrin is original and very fresh. If you have a chance, see this guy perform live. Transcendent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent buy!","review":"I use this polish on my boots for the police academy. Excellent product does what it says, and is totally worth the money.

We desire to listen to something that is going to encourage and challenge us and not sound like the world-- We don't just want to listen to music that is going to tickle our ears.As soon as I put this cd in, I was glad I had. Normally, I prefer to listen simply to music rather than a sermon from the musician. But, I have grown to appreciate listening to such sharing especially when it helps me understand the heart of the musician and the message that he/she wants to share. Derek Webb talks about each of the songs in this cd and shares his thoughts about community, the gospel, and life.I think this cd is a great idea for a gift for a friend who is struggling with church or grace or discouraged and cynical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mix Of Goth And Death","review":"I hadn't heard any of the earlier GODGORY works, so I was a bit skeptical when i decided to buy this CD. It was a worthy buy. I assure you. Believe It Or Not, This band has only two members: A drummer and a vocalist. All the additional music has been delivered by guest or session musicians and they have done a wonderful job. Acoustic and Heavy rhythms have been mixed to the point of perfection with a smooth finish. Standout tracks include \\"Resurrection\\" and \\"Adultery\\" (My personal favourite). Apart from atmospheric sounds, GODGORY also succeeds on creating heavy, rip-roaring death metal music like \\"Crimson Snow\\" with twisted lyrics. No matter what you hear about this CD, If you like nice, slow, acoustic music and also heavy, goth-death, then this CD is definately for you. I assure you, you won't be disappointed. I would give it 4-1/2 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Mourning My Dead Dreams\\"","review":"4.5 stars. I saw this on a Listmania list and my interest was piqued: \\"Symphonic Death Metal?\\" A lot of this album is more straight Heavy Metal mixed with gothic textures and guttural vocal inflections. Songs can be brutally heavy one moment then shift into gorgeous piano and acoustic guitar passages without ever losing momentum. Remarkable, considering that most Death Metal acts go for visceral brutality alone rather than for emotional connections with the listener. There are times on this album when I am reminded a little of My Dying Bride, others when they sound more like \\"Crimson\\"-era Edge of Sanity; maybe even a touch of early Paradise Lost. Overall, Nuclear Blast has found another solid outfit with talent, brains, and for what it's worth, some excellent guitar solos. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is one of the greatest TV soundtracks i've ever listened to.","review":"It's one thing to put out a soundtrack just expect people will listen to it because they watch the show. But One Tree Hill did something that is rarely ever done outside of movies. They included songs on their soundtrack that not only speak about what's going on in the show but also speak to the listener. This whole soundtrack is so proudly showcased in the show that it makes it ten times better when you're holding it in your hands and listening to the lyrics. It's really good...I think it's the best soundtrack that I have. So I definatly recommend this to any one who likes music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant piece of the show","review":"EXCELLANT!!

I have no objections to religion for those who choose it, however, I resent the \\"hidden agenda\\" aspect of this book. If I had known in advance this was a religion-based book, I would not have bought it.

No signal when I pressed the power button, not even the noise of fans! The only reason I could think of is the excessive hot weather today, which is over 100 in the room where I put this desktop. But a PC is supposed to just power off under excessive high temperature and then recovery when it cools down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What good is speed when there are so many potholes?","review":"I bought this along with a Scanjet 7650. The HP/Vista system was quite \\"buggy\\" with frequent spontaneous shutdowns, freeze-ups, and failure of the OS to recognize the scanner. I called HP support and got the most incredible advice - I could either subscribe to HP paid help ($149.00) or reformat the hard drive, go buy Windows XP and install that on the computer instead. But no willingness to trouble-shoot the problem. I have since rolled back the computer twice to the original factory settings but the bugs and blue screens persist. I agree with Van that it might all be in the OS, but I bought this as a tool, not a hobby, so Amazon is getting it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good computing power for the money","review":"I bought this machine as my primary home desktop - to deal with everyday email and stuff as well as to keep and manage my photo collection, and later on my home-made movies. So far, I am happy.Pros: Cheap for the computing power, amount of memory, and storage space.Cons: Integrated graphics which is the biggest factor dragging down the overall Vista's performance rating (PCI Express slot for a future standalone video adapter is available though). Only one PCI slot (which is also occupied with an unneeded modem). Also, wish it were available with XP - it would then fly like a rocket!Given it five stars anyway as I got what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ran fast, failed fast, still waiting on repair.","review":"Bought this in the late fall. Really liked the performance, but in mid January it failed to even do the power on self test (POST). Spent an hour on the phone to support before they would tell me what I already knew... it had to go back to HP for repair. Estimate was 10 days to get it back. Then got an email saying they were waiting on a part and the new time estimate is closer to a month. Needless to say I'm not too happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last warrior - Larry D harville","review":"The Last Warrior was a great book which touched ever human emotion, it made me laugh and cry with the many interesting stories which tie this novel together.

However I was very turned off my her push for adding extra meats and fast food choices. Replacing sugary snacks with hamburgers, hot dogs and lunch meats in not a resolution!! These foods have very bad additives in them as well. Taking sugar out of your diet to replace them with other unhealthy foods is not going to heal your children!! She doesn't mention that eating so much meat and dairy is loaded with saturated fats! So lets replace the sugar addiction with heart disease and heart attacks????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for at all","review":"The author used a lot of words but didn't seem to say a whole lot....while I'm with her on sugar being bad, she doesn't give many reasons as to how or why it's bad. I think it would have been helpful to have some of the statistics I have read in other books about the toll it takes on your health. Basically the book says to very gradually phase out sugar and give your kids lots of protein, which is another problem I have. It puts an unbalanced emphasis on protein needs. She recommends some foods that aren't healthy in the sake of getting protein in (is she aware of some of the health issues associated with too much protein?). Protein shouldn't be the focus, it should be healthy eating with no sugar. I was very disappointed overall with the whole thing and it was rather a waste of time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I had this 30 years ago!","review":"This wonderful book is filled with information I wish I had had when I was raising my children 30 years ago. It would have understood the wild mood swings and instant tears that so drove us crazy. It wasn't the fault of our parenting skills, it wasn't a flaw in our childrens' personalities, it was just that we have sugar sensitive children and a sugar sensitive mom.I am thrilled to have this knowledge now, though, so that it can help my grandchildren. Just keeping those little bodies fed with the right foods can make all the difference.When I look at the news of all the children who are overweight, being diagnossed with ADD or ADHD and being put on drugs, I am hopeful that their parents will read this book and find a simple way to reverse these problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Products","review":"We love this video and all videos from Preschool Prep!

I was shocked at the huggy-feel-good nurture your baby books. All of them have the tone of how to have a baby for dummies. I wanted some real science, unfiltered and without the emotional crap. In my research for a book that would tell me the details of human development I happened on this book.I really liked this book.As a layman it was a good place for me to go back and review all the biology that I learned many years ago. It was also good to know what all the measurements, blood tests, and various poking and prodding all meant. Having some of a science background it was a good overview of the whole process. Knowing the various complications at different parts of the pregnancy was also good to know.If you're squeamish about looking at dead babies with a variety of birth defects you should probably not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had bought Moore's Embryo Instead","review":"I'm currently using this book in my 1st year of medical school. I feel it is not well organized, user friendly or as in depth as is needed for medical education. Moore's illustrations and explanations are much more helpful. I wish I would have bought that intially. Please save yourself the headache and buy something, anything other than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to learn from","review":"This is probably the worst science textbook I've ever used. An avalanche of facts are presented with little or no connection or motivation. I have spent hours trying to decipher a single page, and the figures are often confusing instead of clarifying. On top of it all, the English writing is terrible (the book starts with a sentence fragment: \\"From a single cell to a baby in 9 months.\\"), and is replete with errors.One gets the sense that someone has condensed a much longer book into the current version, leaving out the parts that connect and make sense of the minutiae. If you have a choice, use Carlson's Human Embryology and Developmental Biology or Moore & Persaud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brief","review":"I am not too fond of Langman's. It is brief, meaning that you will get a statement of facts but won't necessarily get an explanation or a logical correlation or an in-depth explanation of the processes. Just facts.

I have never had embryology before and thanks to this book, I never wish to have it again. I found this book extremely difficult to understand and full of errors.

Many of my professors often referred to other books because they are much more beneficial. I suggest Moore's Embryology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a confusing subject even worse","review":"It's hard to believe that people love this book. It's our text for first-year embryology in med school, and it's pretty awful. More illustrations would make it better; defining terms before using them would make it better; better layout would make it better and less confusing (who on earth was the graphic artist that designed this thing?).The Simbryo CD is marginally helpful; it has monotonous music (think porn-movie soundtrack) and doesn't have nearly enough detail on the particularly confusing stages of folding etc. The MacBaby software covers the early stages much, much better.Strengths are clinical correlations and the focus on human embryology.I hope to find a better book before our next exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow Text.","review":"I used this in my first term medical embryology class. It was particularly helpful because it was extremely easy to follow while still conveying all the important information.

You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embry-terrible!","review":"I can't but help wonder why this book has not been consistently rated poorly.

There are other books available that can help you make more sense out of the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended at all.","review":"I'm a first year medical student and our school (unfortunately) clumps embryology in with Gross Anatomy. I hated every second of the embryology portion because the book was disappointing. The professors did their best to explain things, but if there was an area that I didn't quite understand, the book was no help. It threw me into so much detail and had way too many errors. I would recommend a high-yield embryology book or some other review. Way way way way way too detailed for the time that we have. Not recommended.

My friend lives a distance from me so I had never shared it with her. I was absolutely thrilled to find a copy. You don't have to be a barbershopper or even a singer to enjoy this show. It is superb in many ways and extremely entertaining. Everyone, including my small grandchildren, found it most enjoyable. It is an extraordinarily well done recording. We all loved it and you will, too, if you get it.

The sound of the recording is muddy and suppressed and thus renders the music inaccessible. One of the other two reviewers remarked on this aspect earlier but seemed to downplay the significance. This is not to remark negatively on the mastery of the conductor Ander Previn or on the Royal Philharmonic. It just so happens with some classical recordings that no matter how brilliant the intrepretation (which strikes me as average for the symphony 4), a flawed production can be the ruination of any album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the fine print","review":"Read the small print on the DVD cover - if you already own Neighborhood Animals and Baby MacDonald - do not bother getting this DVD.

She, in a previous novel was caught having an affair with a client's wife and was rewarded by being made a partner when she should have been fired.

I hadn't noted he was the reader when I loaded them in to my car stereo and started to listen but I didn't get very far into the discs before I ejected them in dismay. He's just not a very good performer, I'm sorry to say. This is a performance medium (audio books) and the book rides on the shoulders of the performer. In trying to sort out the performance from the plot/story, I can't say as I was that impressed by the latter either but will admit, I might have given the more neutral tone of the printed book more of a chance. It was painful (sorry, HC) listening to the audio version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I am a big fan of the Bolitar series, but I was tremendously disappointed in this installment. I realize that Mr. Coben had stepped away from the characters for a while, but I almost didn't recognize them in this book. One of the nice things about book characters is that, unlike us, they don't have to age in real time, they don't have to endure the same challenges that we do, and because of them remaining essentially the same, they can be a refuge for us readers. They suffer, they have their hardships, and they change in essentially minor ways. But they are always recognizable and comfortable to come back to. I didn't like where these characters were taken and it made a sparse plot even harder to enjoy. I never give book details in my reviews and I won't start now, but I will say that I didn't like who these characters (some of my favorites in all of this genre) had become.

At the onset of the novel, he makes a promise, keeps his promise and then manically redeems himself for the promise and his loyalty. The interplay between the mother, who has a missing child, Myron and the husband has right-on dialogue.

Pulled this book off the library shelf by chance and devoured in nothing flat. This is tale-telling thrillers at its best. The reader is not likely to accurately portend the storyline's outcome because of the number of twists and turns. But that isn't as important as the entertaining ride the reader is taken on en route to the climax. Protagonist Myron Bolitar is supported by some of the most eclectic and colorful characters around - the lethal Windsor Horne Lockwood III, the sexy and sensual Esperanza, and Big Cyndi who defies description.The other Amazon.com reviews do a great job in summarizing the book's plot. But nothing can prepare you for actually reading \\"Promise Me\\" and being totally enthralled by it. Coben's writing takes you from the extreme of funny to the other extreme of distrubing all while maintaining that taunt suspenseful thread that keeps you hooked. A real 5-star treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"In a very short review, I was sorry to see Myron Bolitarrevived.

SO...my advice is to read the other (seven apparently) novels featuring Myron Bolitar if you get the chance, before reading this one.That said...I really enjoyed both the storyline and style of writing once I got the hang of who everyone was.Nice touches of humour and emotion as well as plenty of intrigue and suspense. I'm not normally into senseless thuggery but 'The Twins' were certainly interesting characters :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Coben, please don't do the audio for any more of your own books.","review":"This is probably a good story, as most of Coben's are; however, the audio version is in a word booooring.

The readings of Jonathan Marosz were Wonderful. Then I got to book 8 - read by the author. PLEASE Harlan - stick to what you do best. You do the writing, let Jonathan do the reading. This reading by the author was a big snore - after the first CD unabridged, I opted for an abridged version just to get to the end sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Myron's Back!","review":"This Coben book is a bit different than some I've read. It doesn't jump into the action on page 2; there's a bit more lead up to the storyline. I love the characters of Win and Myron, and was glad to see them back. Coben uses the usual in new technology and pop culture references throughout his book. The \\"bad guys\\" are a pair of chewing twins, which fit perfectly in the stable of HC baddies. I only gave this book 4 stars because I felt the ending was too contrived and left me going \\"huh\\"? (which I usually don't do at the finale of one of his books!). It is highly recommended for the HC fan out there and all thriller-lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Link","review":"First, I have always thought that Coben's stand-alone novels are stronger than his Myron Bolitar series. Second, the Publishers Weekly blurb identifies Bolitar as \\"the former Boston Celtics basketball star.\\" It makes me wonder if the blurb writer has read any of the books. Bolitar was a Duke basketball star, signed by the Celtics, but who had his knee destroyed (a story in its own right) before he played any regular season basketball for the Celtics. Third, Coben's reading, contrary to the PW blurb, is distracting and underscores the weaknesses of the book. Coben reads too fast in narrative sections, so that he almost stumbles over his own words. In addition, his voices are awful. His women's voices sound like a bad transvestite, and his men's voices all sound like the cartoon character Goofy. The novel has the usual baker's dozen of plot twists, but this time around it's just not engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bolitar Addition","review":"This episode leaves at a great point in the series and makes one hunger for even more Myron. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much juggling.","review":"Fans of Myron Bolitar (me included) wanted to catch up with what has been going on in his life. However, Mr. Coben tries to put it all in one book; this is an example of too much information and not enough explanation. New and past relationships are mixed right along with several past characters, who make unsatisfactory cameo appearances. Add to this a plot which isn't as tight as Mr Coben's other books. There were too many balls in the air, and a few were dropped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writers who read","review":"I just started this audio book and I have to say that I am truly amazed that it never occurs to writers that just because they are great writers doesn't mean they can read well. If they can't, they take away from the enjoyment of the story by making the sentiments sound trite and contrived. Good readers bring a book to life. For example, I never read a Harry Potter book because Jim Dale does such a wonderful job. I have yet to find an audiobook, read by the author, where his reading did anything but take away from the story.All of this said, I still enjoy the outstanding writing. Unfortunately, it's in spite of the author's read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I was anticipating this new Myron Bolitar book since it has been a while since a book in the series has been released.

Myron is at his best when his heart is on his sleeve and in this one he's wracked with guilt and pretty damned determined to get to the bottom of things. Harlan Coben has a knack for humor and action, and no one combines them better, or more poignantly, that he does.

If you liked the earlier novels in this series you will like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Myron's Back","review":"It was great to see Coben bring back the Myron Bolitar gang. It was like being reunited with friends that you haven't heard from in several years.As with all of Coben's books, there were plenty of unexpected twists & turns. It is another great job of writing.The door was definitely left open for more books based on Myron, Win & the rest of the gang."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ha! A great read","review":"I, like other reviewers, am glad to see Myron Bolitar back in Promise Me, along with the rest of his crew. I am especially glad to see that Coben's story telling ability only seems to get sharper and sharper as time goes by.Part of this book has a familiar ring to it. I, like many parents I know, have offered their children the same service; \\"If you ever find yourself in a position that you have to drive under the influence or ride with someone who has been drinking, call home and I'll come a get you....no questions asked and no lecture delivered.\\" This same offer, made to a friends daughter gets Myron into a fix that could ruin his life.As with all of Coben's other works, Promise Me, has a tight plot with great dialog and great characters. If you've read other Coben works, then this is one you'll want to add to the list....if you haven't read him, then you've got a big treat install for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bolitar's Back (so I'll cut it some slack)","review":"I've been reading Harlan Coben's books since his debut novel hit the stands back in the day, and was glad to see that Myron Bolitar was being brought back for this novel. Cobe has crafted another one of his family-mysteries, but put old series regular Myron in the middle of the mess. While the story was fine, having Bolitar and his associates at the front and center seemed forced at times, especially when two hit men appear on the scene for two chapters, apparently just so Win can kill some people. The characters and situation added nothing to the plot, much like Myron's visits with his parents and ex-flame Jessica also added nothing much to the plot. It was nice to revisit the characters, but not EVERY character needed to appear.I did cruise through the book in a day, and recommend it highly. It's just not quite as good as I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I've listened to all the books in the series and they have all been fantastic, this one read by the author was a disapointment. All the characters were ruined by the authors horrible interpretation, next time around he needs to go back to Jonathan Marosz reading the book. The story also lacked the fun and adventure of the previous books, this was like Myron Bolatar light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tightly-wound suspense in this mystery novel","review":"Though I've read several of Coben's books over the years - and enjoyed them very much - this is the first one I've read featuring his Myron Bolitar character (apparently a recurring character in his earlier novels).I have to say, this book has motivated me to find and read those earlier books.This book is crisp, witty, suspenseful where appropriate, with a tight and surprising plot; I hadn't come close to figuring it out by the end. I enjoyed the characters very much, as they're fully realized three-dimensional people. Coben's style is also very engaging, with a very deft touch and a sprinkling of wry humor in all the right places.This book zips right along; I sped through it in two sittings.I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"One of those books that grabs and keeps you reading until the last page which gives a ending with a twist"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best","review":"I love the Bolitar character and Coben's plot twists.

I'm sure the story is pretty good since I've read Harlan Coben's books before. But the narration was truly awful. Slurred sentences, skipped words. Indecipherable to the point where I had to replay chapters just to figure out who is who.Don't know if Mr. Coben was trying to save $$ by narrating his own book, but I'd highly recommend that he hire Scott Brick or Len Cariou to do his narration in the future. These guys narrate for DeMille, Baldacci and Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to writing!","review":"I'm a big fan of Harlan Coben's previous non-Bolitar works and thought I'd give this audio CD a go. What a disappointment! Coben has two voices: one for Bolitar and another hybrid snooty/feminine/smarmy one for whomever Bolitar is speaking to at the time. The \\"other\\" voice doesn't even stay consistent from one line to the next - listen to his interactions with Claire or Erik if you need convincing - it was difficult to keep the characters straight if there were more than 3 in one scene.Stick to the writing, Mr Coben, and leave the audio to the pros."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total garbage.","review":"This toaster does not get hot enough to toast bread (on any setting). there's no way you could cook a pizza in there.

It then also contains the Hebrew Text of the S.Y. (Kalisch's edition). What it does NOT include -- and my entire reason for ordering the book -- is the Hebrew original of \\"The 32 Paths of Wisdom.\\" This was a huge disappointment to me, having sought for many years for a current published version of it. Nonetheless, if you know what you are getting, the book is a fine buy at a fair price. You can't get a copy of Westcott's translation much cheaper. The manufacturing, though simple, is adequate (good quality paper, folded and stapled).

But, still, it was a good book.(Can't critize it too much, since he's my teacher you know...)I would recomend that you read it, if you haven't already, even if you aren't a sci-fi fan. Okay, that's all I have to say. (Hey, even though it doesn't sound like I read it, I have!)(And what do you mean only use two html things?

William F. Weldpaints a political picture that makes Animal House appear to be a tame, frat house. Terry is a superb antihero type of character who makes the sleaze flow. His spouse provides amusing, anthropological glimpses into the DC zoo. The support cast of legislative and executive Beltway Bandits add a feeling of authenticity that makes understandable the ironic contradiction of contracting out under commercial activities Vs enforcement of the Davis-Bacon Act.

They easily differentiate themselves from and possibly supersede other small jam bands with their songwriting and playing ability. The lyrics sometimes have a ballsy triteness in their rhymes that is nothing less than hilarious. My favorite aspect of the CD is how diverse sounding the band is. The Big Wu shifts from G Love/Sublime sounding vocals to a String Cheese sounding acoustic guitar solo to a harmonious \\"Phil and Jerry\\" duet jam. The drummer controls the dynamic level quite well and never seems afraid to turn it up a notch when the music calls for it. He is one of the main reasons the jamming sections of the CD don't sound forced, but rather progress naturally. Highlights include Silcanturnitova, Precious Hands, and Red Sky. I strongly recommend this CD for anyone even remotely interested in this genre of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun Song","review":"The Way You Love Me by Faith Hill is one of the more fun songs on country radio today, pop radio as well. This single has a remix for the pop radio, which updates the song a little and its nice.

You must get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!!","review":"This song gets worse, more annoying and obnoxious sounding with every listen! If Faith Hill is trying to do pop it's not working!

Probably made in 1960s. I have the original owners manual so I knew exactly which part number I needed. Unfortunately the first thing they sent me was a pressure valve, not a gasket seal. Doesn't look anything alike. They quickly recitified the situation and sent me the gasket seal. Unfortunately, it is not made to the right specifications. The rubber is too thin and it does not seal the lid. Therefore the stream escapes around the lid and I no longer have a pressure cooker. So do not buy this item if you have an old pressure cooker. Even though I needed an S-9885, this one is not made right and won't work. It needs to be thicker rubber.

It turns out that Intel has not developed (nor they seem to be planning to) linux drivers for this card.Hopefully I was able to return the Intel WLAN card, and I'm currently using a Orinoco dual-wlan (802.11a/802.11b) card on the Thinkpad's Cardbus slot. Unlike the Intel \\"solution\\" the Orinoco works beatifully.Until Intel stops meaning \\"wintel\\", avoid this card, unless you use WinXP, which is apparently what Intel wants you to do, along with Microsoft.That some companies would use their market domination to prevent competition and letting the users run alternative operating systems is a shame. Hopefully other vendors of Wireless lan cards (see above) are fully supporting Linux."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work under Linux","review":"I wish I could recommend this product, but it does not work for me under the Linux operating system. Intel normally has a good track record providing technical documentation so that open-source OSs such as Linux can have drivers for their products. However, in this case, no such support is available. This wireless card simply does not work under Linux because no driver is available. Rather, Orinoco cards are still the best way to go for Linux 802.11b capability. They are available under many names as Mini-PCI cards, such as the Dell Truemobile 1150.In addition, Windows support for the PRO/Wireless 2100 is also flaky. Specifically, when coupled with a Netgear wireless router, the card will often loose signal to the router, requiring either the router or the computer to be restarted."},{"rating":"2","title":"replacement","review":"Overall I'm happy with the mount, this was a replacement for the original that came with my Garmin after the pin kept falling out.

He continuously adjusts the mount and keeps it in his car which sits out in the heat; hence, he's gone through at least two of these becuase the hinges crack after so many adjustments. Once I mount this, I rarely move it - just insert the Nuvi and pop the Nuvi off. If I need to take the mount off, I release the clip holder but let the mount slowly release itself rather than trying to forcefully it off immediately.

Marriages will be stronger. Siblings will be happier and baby will feel secure in his surroundings.I can not belive the critism of this book. Ezzo constantly urges mom to check milk supply and devotes a section on monitering weight gain and physical development. He even states that you are flexable instead of clock-deppendent.This book has changed my life. I am rested and can really enjoy the time I have with my children. My children also know how to focus and play on their own, so I do get housework done. People who see me out always comment on how well behaved my kids are. I do not contribute this to luck.

Soon Fenn finds out whats going on and her husband and baby might be in danger. Could her partner played by Jerry Kroll (Second to Die, Starkweather) be in on it too? Well if you're very interested in it take a look but it's pretty formulaic with cringe worthy dialouge and bad acting. The action even isnt that good. Fenn is wasted big time here. Van Dien isnt a convincing bad guy.

Lewis quote that has been running through your mind lately. This book is also helpful if you engage in theological conversations and/or debates. The quotes included in the book are good encapsulations of the gyst of many of Lewis' insights into human nature, Divine nature, and Divine human nature. Some sections that I have found especially helpful in informal philosophical debates are \\"Free Will\\", \\"Sin\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"Love.\\" Any diehard Lewis fan (without a photographic memory), who loves being able to quote him in sermons, academic papers or in conversation, could greatly benefit from having this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swimming Into The 21st Century a Dynamic Compendium","review":"Cecil Colwin has produced an encyclopedia of information about competitive swimming, and he has presented it in such a readable format that anyone interested in the sport will find challenging ideas, well-documented and engagingly illustrated, on almost every page.

However, I find that with Doom 3 and the expansion pack I don't have fun playing it. The blood and violence is just to intense. Newer and better graphics didn't help this game at all. The graphics engine is awsome but needs some blood and gore settings.The orginal Dooms had secret areas, monsters didn't always jump out at you and more thought was placed into the level designes. Ammo also wasn't laying all over the place and forced one to some planning. Doom 3 just doesn't add up (reminds me of the newer Star Wars movies).In conclusion: For some people the fun factor will be greatly reduced due to the violence factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need a fast computer.","review":"I have a pretty good computer, I ran doom 3 on it with mild slowdowns, but they were there.

You are on a platform and fighting this guy... someway. I say that because the game is so jumpy at this point, you don't know what your doing. I couldn't finish the game. The reason it is so jumpy here is because it is in an open environment, not a closed in space like alot of the other areas.

Don't waste time with this blend that misses the distinct appeal of both genres.In the end, if you like the sound, go for it, buy the CD. But do NOT buy this looking for good highland piping or traditional scottish music. THIS IS POP MUSIC, the pipes are added to get attention, a gimick that seems to have worked.

Ever since Neil Anderson, anti-pyper extraordinaire left the band to pursue a solo career, things have taken a turn for the worse. Never heard of Neil? Well, before you consider yourself a true fan, check out any of the independent albums featuring this paragon of piping. If you were to hear but one of these fine albums, or even tracks, you would be overwhelmed by a Seven Nations in their prime. Tracks like God, Under The Milky Way, Big Dog, and so many others actually had soul, body, backbone. With their new release (and new \\"piper\\", Scott Long), none of their original zest remains. They are truly hollow shells of their former selves. It is a travesty of justice that so many new fans will have never heard the real 7N.

SAT starts out with a tight metal-tinged but catchy rock married to lyrics of romantic longing. That longing continues but the musical accompaniment changes radically on the remaining tracks. Using mostly acoustic guitar the band opens up the Chairman of the Board's songbook playing straight covers with punkish energy and panache. It doesn't seem like it should work- but it does. Based on guile alone these guys rate a 5. The EP length makes one wonder if their unique ideas began to run out though.

Fassbender's character does 'wake up' towards the end of the movie in that respect but it's too little too late. We never understand what makes Brandon tick and no amount of gazing helps us learn anything about him. The metaphorical white walls of his apartment sure aren't any help; it says virtually nothing important about the character though we're to assume it does. [Note to the director: We've already been exposed to this cinematic trick, several times.] The movie is unnecessarily long too; Carey Mulligan's little song, for example, did absolutely nothing to advance the razor thin plot. Nor is the nudity central to the plot. This movie is also devoid of incidental music, which supposedly makes this story more realistic.

It's as if this film wants audiences to believe something tragic will cause pause in the sex addict's behavior.

It seems typical of movies that are coming out over the past few years and currently - fantastic actors, lazy script. I'm just glad I didn't pay for it outright.

Fairly riveting and very well acted. The final third? So far-fetched and ridiculous that I have to give the entire film a thumbs-down. I think it's a copout when a writer has to kill someone off to add gravity to a story, as if what was originally on the page wasn't enough. Why can't this JUST be about a guy's sex addiction? Added to that, the part where our main character metaphorically and literally crosses the street to have (shame of shames!) sex with another man because he's so desperate for sex (complete with swelling score to underline his depravity) is nothing less than backhanded homophobia - not to mention just plain lazy storytelling.

The story is stupid, and all the people in it are irritating, self-centered, self-pitying jerks. Who cares if such obnoxious people are unhappy? Besides, they're all straight. No wonder they're all screwed up: they're trying to have sex with the wrong sex. How could that make anybody happy?It's time to take a break from watching movies when I start watching dumb, irritating movies about heterosexual angst like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart. Strong performances and content.","review":"Yes, it is sexually explicit and there is also a very bloody scene that I will not spoil. But these scenes are few and quite brief. Still enough for the NC 17.Fassbender and Mulligan do a stunning job as a brother and sister who cannot get along but need each other anyway. He is a sexual compulsive and she is troubled and maybe prone to depression or instability.You can tell how much he hates his life as the story unfolds, and she doesn't like hers much better.The ending will leave you wondering if he learns anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shame","review":"I thought this movie about a sex addict was very good. It is a depiction on how some sex addicts live in the real world, but at least in this case he only ruins his life and his sister, not like other stories in which lots of other people are involved. Overall a good film and great acting from Michael Fassbender. His other great role was the android David in Prometheus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"It would be a 'Shame' to not watch this movie. Good acting. Very intimate short story. Simply put, it's worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting subject","review":"I liked the actors and the story was good. I wished there had been more background on the family history.

It is pretty blatant. I was watching a talk show and Michael Fassbender was a guest. I thought this guy looks familiar. When the moderator started talking about Fassbender's penis having its own website, I knew who he was. This movie is about a sex addict (Fassbender) whose sister comes to live with him. She has sexual issues of her own and both of them spend a lot of time in the nude. There is quite a bit of full frontal for Fassbender. I thought the story of how the two get along and the affect the sister has on his life was very intriguing. I really liked the movie and I'm glad that I bought it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar caliber performance ny Fassbender","review":"Just bought this the other day and viewed it last night for the first time. I must say I was shocked on how powerful the performances and the storyline were. Yes the film is rated NC-17 for sexual content. But that shouldn't sway you away from viewing this incredible story about addiction and trying to come to terms with it. This was in my opinion one of the top five films of 2011. I can't wait for the next Fassbender/Mcqueen collaboration. The Hunger and Shame were both very exceptional pieces of filmmaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film","review":"Why Michael Fassbender didn't get an Oscar nomination for this is beyond me. His performance in this film was phenomenal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aptly Named","review":"The Shame in this DVD is I wasted nearly 2 hours of my life watching it.The main two characters are sadly disfunctional and I spent the whole film wondering what the point was.It never really became apparent and I found the film dark and depressing. No insight was ever given into why the two siblings were so disfunctional. their downward spiral was gloomy and incredibly sad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

He's such a gifted piano player, has a lovely voice, and his arrangements are so perfect you want to crank up the volume and belt out the tune yourself. He has such sensitivity and emotion, knows just when to change tempo or syncopate a beat. I've driven many miles to see him perform and I'd love to do it again. He's the best, and this album is his finest. Absolute perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made for a finger puppet!","review":"I wanted finger puppets that were more like stuffed animals and less like felt 2nd grade projects, these little guys are office mates (I work in a creative environment with adults). They are good quality and don't feel cheaply made, but probably not as durable for small children or pets (read: not a chew toy) without supervision; I see small things like fuzzy tails and protruding ears sewn on that my nephew and/or personal live-in zoo of pets would easily damage for a messy and violent death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Dance Steps","review":"I work in a child care facility and my staff were looking for the words and music for the cha cha slide. They were teaching the children so they could perform it at their preschool graduation. Well let me tell you it was a hit and the parents even joined in.Ever since that night, the other preschool classrooms wanted to have some fun too and I let the other classrooms listen and dance. My only concern is that I don't get to use it too much because it is always on loan. I wish I had more copies! Thank you for helping my staff keep their children learning fun ways to listen,exercise, share and socialize with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally got it!","review":"I first heard the cha cha slide in Iowa City when I was in a ball with my boyfriend.

The Cha Cha Slide is one of the worst albums ever created. Just listen to the music sampler if you dont believe me. My friends downloaded this song as a joke, and play it really loud at parties so we can all laugh. Anybody who likes this type of stuff probably likes the Macarena too. And anybody who likes the Macarena has a serious mental illness. Download the Cha Cha Slide if you want side-splitting laughter, but if you actually buy this CD, consider yourself on the absolute bottom rung of the musical world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cha-cha slide","review":"This is delightful! It taps into some of the basic steps from dance and weaves them together with a great beat. Most importantly, though, it enables a person, like myself, to feel a simple, fun, and energizing rhythm. It is a GREAT way for people to share an activity together, especially those who may not be able to find common ground in verbal communication. Get it! Do it with family (especially dysfunctional ones during the holidays) and friends.

Ravensburger is a wonderful puzzle company with high quality pieces. If you are used to the 1000 piece level of puzzles, you will be surprized how much longer it takes to complete a puzzle with only 500 more pieces. We took three weeks to finish. There is a 1000 piece version of this castle and if we had it to do over, we would have gotten that level. The best experience we recieved from this puzzle is finding out that 1000 pieces is about our limit to have fun without becoming bored. There were several times we almost gave up on the dark areas of this one. We have purchased many puzzles from Amazon and of the several puzzle companies represented, Ravensburger has the highest level of consistant quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puzzle of Neuschwanstein Castle","review":"It's a beautiful puzzle, but, as you other puzzle goers know, it's very tedious. However, it's a wonderful challenge and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Puzzle Ever - Not Fun at All","review":"This was my first Ravensburger puzzle and I absolutely hated it. It has softclick technology which means the pieces lock together so loosely that you cannot pick up a section of the puzzle without having the whole thing break apart. This puzzle has few colors and it was not a good time. I purchased online. If I had seen it in the store I would not have bought it. The pieces are small, do not snap together snugly and are a general pain in the but. I will not buy a Ravensburger puzzle again. I am very disappointed with this puzzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful puzzle","review":"My husband has a picture of this beautiful castle in his office, and has a desire to visit it some day.

Luckily for me I tore mine right in front of my house moving fairly slowly.Stay away from these. Cheap, soft plastic with no strength whatsoever. They will last a few hundred miles at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than Death, not quite, but close","review":"I expected to like this book having really enjoyed Sherry Gottleib's Love Bite. Instead I found myself bearly able to stay awake - the vampire as detective plot has been over done, and the mystery was fairly easy to figure out but the real let down was in Jace's constant preoccupation with his sexual prowess. This was over emphasised to the point that every other aspect of the book was secondary to the state of Jace's penis. The other characters were two dimensional and Risha (the vampire) went from being a fully fleshed out character in the first book to being the person Jace was sleeping with in the second. Worse Than Death is proof that the state of someone's penis is not a replacement for plotline or character developement."},{"rating":"1","title":"tiresome and toothless vamp mystery......","review":"This supposed erotic vampire mystery is soft on mystery and wooden on erotica. The \\"love scenes\\" between the main characters play out worse than a Penthouse forum entry.

Long term, I'm not sure if it is the answer, but I don't really care. For the cost of this book I've avoided more pain than I can describe. My lumbar curve (if you read the book you'll understand) is still not what I understand it should be, but heck, at least I now realize that it is out of whack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chiropractic without bonejoint snapping","review":"Interesting book. The author's thesis is that all parts of the body need to be in alignment: all body parts should be square and plumb in order to avoid miscelaneous aches and pains. Egosque uses the force of gravity to bring the body into alignment.I have had back pain for years following my spinal lamenectomy. After about a week of trying them, Egosque's \\"Ecises\\" seems to be helping to ease my pain. I recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groin tear caused by Supine Groin Stretch","review":"In physical therapy, I was given the Supine Groin Stretch to help improve my posture and the way I walk. Even though it was only for 5 minutes each leg, that was enough force to tear my groin. I have been in pain and barely able to walk for over two months now. Unfortunately, \\"Pain Free\\" does not include instructions to modify the exercises, but assumes everyone can do them safely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth time or money","review":"I was completely disappointed with the Egoscue method. I have two herniated discs and had a severe flair-up when I got this book. I read it right away and followed the exercises religiously. I got absolutely no relief. I am very active and play sports, so the only thing I think this might help is people that are not active and those that don't take part in any exercising at all. In all honesty, I can't see how doing things like squeezing a ball between your legs or laying with legs in the air helps anyone at all. Don't spend the money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hundreds of little slips of paper.","review":"I've given hundreds of little slips of paper to people who walk by me walking with their shoulders turned so the backs of their hands face forward, with whom I get into casual conversation and hear about their hurting backs, or why they can't go to the gym any more.It's wonderful when you can graciously allow gravity to suggest to your muscles how they should be reacting.I haven't found that this method replaces a chiropractor, but is rather complementary to him, and to massage, etc. etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"unorganized hodge-podge","review":"Even though some of the exercises appear to work, finding the correct one to use is like wandering through a department store.

This is a great starting point to have some quick relief to persistant low back and shoulder pain. I was able to immediately perform the majority of the simple exercises and the text description and example pictures makes it fool proof to apply his exercises. One tip I can offer is to pay attention to how to align yourself during some of the floor stretches - as a former massage therapist, the alignment described, if accurately followed, provides a significant impact.

I believe that Pete Egoscue is definitely onto something. The bones do what the muscles tell them to, plain and simple. I found it easy to look up my areas of pain, and follow the routines in the book, then graduate to the next routine as things evolved and changed.An added bonus is mental relief.

This exercise was to be done 60 times each day and called for twisting the arms in the shoulder socket while on all fours, putting weight on your arms and collapsing the back in a donkey position. I can't tell you the sleepless nights from the pain. Two cortisone injections later, I am in physical therapy the pain is slowly going away and my shoulder is getting stronger.

After inflating the cuff with the valve closed, which works fine, attempts to adjust the valve, so as to obtain a gradual drop in pressure to give time to make the necessary measurements of blood pressure, results in the pressure dropping so quickly and erratically that a meaningful measurements are almost impossible. After looking closely at the valve's construction, this wasn't a faulty valve I happened to get, but one that is simply not of a quality needed for this type of instrument.

If you are hearing sounds on the bell (small) end, but not the diaphragm (large) end, you need to rotate the axis (by which the 2 chest pieces are attached to) 180 degrees. You will hear a click.

I bought this book in order to study for a DSST exam on the Civil War. I find myself going back to it now just for the joy of reading it. By the way, the book does a super job of getting you ready for the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe Amazon's info","review":"First, let me say that this is NOT a review of the feature. This is simply a notice to alert people that the information Amazon is providing is NOT what this feature is. I ordered it because my mother wanted it, but this appears to be the sequel to the original. Amazon lists the actor information (\\"Sigrid Thornton, John Waters (III), Don Bridges, Michael Carman, Cliff Ellen\\") from the original, NOT from this sequel. This, while titled \\"The Rivers Run\\" is really \\"All The Rivers Run 2\\" with actors John Waters (III), Nikki Coghill, Parker Stevenson, John Jacobs, John Alansu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read For Heat Exchanger Geeks","review":"Most texts spend only a chapter or two on heat exchanger design and performance. This book really dives into the details. You'll need a pretty good knowledge of the subject matter to begin with in order to fully comprehend the topics. This book contains tons of experimental data that can be used to predict heat exchanger performance.The book has several examples and is easy to follow. A great resource for anyone involved in the development of heat exchanger models. I particularly use this for hvac design and find it works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"compact heat exchanger","review":"i wanted the design of air cooled unmixed type of heat exchager for refrigeration system"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!","review":"I bought this because in the high-crime city of Los Angeles, where I'm forced to stay for the moment, people constantly vandalise cars and steal gas.The directions are simple. Insert without turning cap. To remove, turn key 1/4 to the right and pull. Except that the quality is such junk that it bends on the way in and then gets STUCK. I can't remove it from the tank now. Will pay more to get a brand name from the Honda dealership but I don't want this piece of junk and can't recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep watching your old videotape copy.....","review":"Total waste of DVD format. The soundtrack has a wicked flange to it, especially in the quiet, atmospheric moments that make the show. The video is also sub par, with very little contrast when the scenes get dark, again a major part of the show. After seeing the Season One special edition, this thing is worse than your videotape recording from when it first aired, the one that you've watched a million times. Be patient, and hopefully they'll do it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOK! LISTEN! LEARN!","review":"If you're looking to get this disk you are most likely a TP fan. If so, listen to these reviews! I was too quick to finish off my collection to read through them before I bought. I learned the hard way. As you will see with most of these entries the sound is horrid! Some say they had no trouble with this. But notice how a lot more of us say we did. The picture is semi low grade also. But the biggest disappointment by far is the sound quality. I have a better copy of the VHS from '89 then this thing.If the prices available were a bit less, it might be a little more worth it, just as a tide over until the U.S. release. But I would say just wait it out. None of us knows when the U.S. release will come available. So if you're serious about picking this DVD up, look around for a really good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that bad.","review":"After reading all the negative reviews I was a little skeptical of this disc. Actually, it's not that bad. It played fine. Dolby sound was good with no hum. The colors are a little washed out compared to the season one set. Not that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where there's no sense, there's no feeling.","review":"It's the TP pilot episode which makes it a must have for the TP collector but is this really the best they could do? Whack out a really crappy direct tansfer, ignore all the phase distortion in the sound and just get it on the market for a few bucks? Was Ben Horne involved here? There is so much love and detail in the \\"Episodes\\" collection of the series that I can't believe this was actually released to the public. David Lynch, help! Push some buttons, make something happen. Get a better pilot with a few extra features released. I'll rebuy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have dvd!","review":"I bought this a couple of weeks ago in the mail from hong kong when i found out the new box set didn't have the pilot. Its absolutely necessary to view this if you're lookin to get into twin peaks. And, trust me, its worth it. Twin Peaks was the best tv ever got. And the best thing about this disc is they didn't tag on the ending you find on the Twin Peaks video warner put out. It ends exactly the way it did when it first aired. If you love twin peaks purchasing the new box set is imperative in order to get the entire show on disc. And since you won't have the pilot there, well , you should get this too.I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twin Peaks Import DVD","review":"Well heres the dirt on it. Its a very good dvd because its Twin Peaks. The Pilot. The episode that started it all. Its just a shame that this is the only way to get the origanal pilot. Its in sped up Pal format so its a little speedy talking and music.The origanal is 96 minutes, and this has been sped up so much that now only rns 90 minutes. The picture quality has that grainy, color bleeding look of one of those old sitcoms on the BBC. Definitly the worst quality I've ever seen of a dvd. Lets just put it this way.....I would complain if I bought a VHS tape that had picture quality like this. $29.99 is a bad price for this disc, unless you are a devoted twin peaks fan. 1 star for quality, and 5 stars for the actual pilot episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgruntled of england","review":"twin peaks.what can i say! mybe one of the most oustanding surreallist comments of a generation, but feeding on extremely realist subject matter. a master piece; of scriptwriting, direction, acting. lighting --- name it, it was/os magnificent.WHY IS IT ONLY REGION 1WHAT HAS DAVID LYNCH GOT AGAINST THE REST OF THE WORLD?when will it be released on region 2?and for the amtter, when will we get to see mullholland drive?"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality \\"Import\\" DVD","review":"This is a very poor quality DVD.The audio is comb filtering continously and the video is has many conversion artifacts. The image is at times grainy, and at other times too dark. It doesn't even compare to the \\"First Season\\" DVD in terms of audiovisual quality.This is not a bad review of the content. I love Twin Peaks and the Pilot episode is great. This is just a very poorly made DVD. It is listed as an \\"Import\\", but really looks more like a bootleg. I would wait and buy the domestic version when it becomes available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Sound","review":"I purchased this DVD imported from Singapore. Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE TWIN PEAKS and the Pilot is awesome. However, how can anyone watch it with a metalic sound that makes your hair stand up?? I find that unacceptable. The Pilot should have been part of The Season 1 set...but it wasn't...so, if you really want to get it, it's better on VHS, even though it's harder to find one that hasn't been over-played to affect the picture quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Audio - Wait for a Better Version on DVD","review":"I am a huge fan of Twin Peaks, but this DVD is terrible. The audio is out of sinc with the film, i.e., you hear them talk, then see their lips move. It was painful to watch. Even though I think the Twin Peaks pilot is one of the best things ever to have appeared on U.S. television, I have only watched this DVD ONCE because the sound is so bad. There is talk of a \\"definitive\\" version of Twin Peaks coming out in October 2007. Hopefully it will include a remastered version of the pilot. If it doesn't, buy the UK version of the first season, which includes the pilot, unlike the US version. But whatever you do, don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one that started it all","review":"This is the first episode that aired. It sets the foundadtion for the rest of the series and draws you in to the seemingly eternal question, who killed Laura Palmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAHAAAHAAAA! THEY ACTUALLY CHARGED THIS MUCH FOR THE PILOT!!! I KNEW THEY WOULD!!!","review":"When I made the decision to buy Twin Peaks from Amazon.uk, people said I was nuts. I had to go out and buy a new dvd player anyways, so I got one that adapted to European Dvds. I told people they were planning on \\"trying\\" to sell that pilot for as much as the season itself.Lo and behold! There it is. These guys are rip offs! I'm going to wait for the next season and buy it from Britain as well. It's a real shame we gotta get ripped off from our own country.Johanna"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie, movie, movie","review":"I met Pam at a presentation in Alaska at our local Nature Center. This is the most incredible story. It would make a fantastic movie. It is filled with such adventure and near-death survival, that even Hollywood couldn't have written a better script. The book is easy to read, hard to put down, and filled with humor, pictures, and fascinating adventure. She started out with a very small team of dogs, no money, and a determination and spirit as big as Alaska. A must read for all kids and those with a love for adventure and the great outdoors, or those wondering how to overcome obstacles in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best kind of adventure","review":"Pam Flowers, at age 46, height five feet, weight around 100 pounds, did what few people, let alone a small woman, would dare to do.

The programs built on each other, but are not in the right order. A the main topic, war and dying to protect others was lost on my little ones (4yrs) and there was not even a comparison with Jesus dying to save us. Just missed its mark. We won't watch it again, but I will get another DVD to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary, Depressing, Dead-End Kids","review":"Gaah! How this ill-lit little movie ever got tagged \\"comedy\\" is beyond me. Hopeless lives, clueless kids. The boys wanting sex to prove they're men (right ... 16-year-old, uneducated, unemployed, and apparently unaquainted with any grown-up men!) The girls wanting to belong to a man so they'll be less likely to get gang-raped. It's as though the director fantasizes his teenagers never take a look outside the projects, and how likely is that? The setting is supposed to be New York, not some terminally isolated poverty pocket off the map."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too fantastic","review":"after reading many reviews i decided to rent this movie.

If you're not hung up on the neighborhood colloquialisms, you'll love this film.The beauty of this film is that all the characters are treated with respect and humanity, without ever getting dull or preachy. It often feels like a documentary because it's shot on location, without experienced professional actors---yet the cast does just fine, better than many familiar Hollywood faces in many Hollywood formula blockbusters.Both romantic and comedic without ever nosediving into schmaltz, with an upbeat ending that doesn't insult your intelligence. Too bad this film didn't go into wider distribution, because its more or less universal appeal would've garnered it a far wider audience than it has found so far.Too bad Hollywood's forgotten how to make films like this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth seeing once...probably never again","review":"After all the fanfare I kept waiting for this movie to get good. There were some subtle subplots going on. It is mostly a tale of poverty and inner city coming of age. I don't feel I really took anything introspective away from this movie, and it wasn't artistic cinima. It had a few good laughs, lots of sibling rivalry drama, disfunctional teen love/infatuation, an overprotective grandmother caretaker who doesn't know what to do, etc.Was it interesting? Not for everyone. Was it funny? A little. Was it inspirational or introspective? Not for me."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],x={key:0},H={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(M,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-a8baff4b"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/6.md","filePath":"quotesmag/6.md"}'),R={name:"quotesmag/6.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
