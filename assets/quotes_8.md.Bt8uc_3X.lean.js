Hard to top again!","review":"Tim McGraw is my absolute favorite country artist! He never ceases to amaze me with his zest for singing from his heart! I guess if I couldn't have him, I am glad that another tallented artist, Faith Hill, got him. They are never found in the tabloids and they are both amazing artists. This album is better than his last, and that baffles me. I thought that \\"Everywhere\\" was the best, and there he went and proved me wrong! KAM St. Louis, MO"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Place for Tim","review":"Tim McGraw's \\"A Place in the Sun\\" is his greatest cd thus far. Throughout the cd you feel his love not only for the music which he is singing, but in select songs, his undying love for his wife. His love for the songs he is singing intensifies the pleasure for the listeners. This should be rated 5 stars or A+. Definetely a hit. Even listeners who normally do not enjoy country music can definetely appreciate this musical selection. After listening to this there is no question in your mind why he is the most popular male country singer at this time. You also won't wonder why he won the country music male vocalist of the year award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Like that...","review":"I love the song Something Like That..Actually..I don't love it. It's ok. The problem with country today is that it lacks depth. Taking a look around the country industry you'll see that it's the most placated and perversed genre. The big labels have taken advantage of the listener and produced album after album that sounds exactly alike. Tim McGraw has a good voice..yes. The fact remains that he doesn't really write most of his own stuff. If you wanna here some country that has real value check out: Charlie Daniels Band, Conway Twitty, Hank Williams, and today's best stuff Phil Vassar, Alabama, Garth Brooks, and Brooks and Dunn. If you want other music that will truly leave you reeling check out Pedro The Lion, Bright Eyes, Modest Mouse, Burning Airlines, Braid (RIP), and Texas Is The Reason.

I started listening to it more, and now I'm so glad that I bought it. I guess Shania has to move over because Tim has definitely added new demensions to C&W music.

But this album is. . . boring. No catchy hooks, words are kind of sappy and it seems that a bit of Tim's fire has been burned out.

Well, he did on this album. Although it has its bright spots, A Place in the Sun is mainly sappy and regular. Not A Moment Too Soon and Everywhere have much more heart in them and have country ballads in them. You can also tell because Tim produced Jo Dee Messina's new CD, which totally stinks. Tim needs to stick to traditional country, because that's where he's at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim McGraw is great! This CD is his best yet!","review":"I've always liked Tim.

A vivid recording - you can't really ask for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this compilation!!!","review":"When I bought this cd set, I imagined having a wonderful collection of 100 retro hits of the 80's. Whilst I certainly don't doubt that these tracks are from the 80's, they are not indicative of the wonder & magic that one associates with that rich period in the annals of music history.The packaging is alright - the cds are neatly inserted in sleeves made of card paper. The upside is that the audio quality is excellent.However, if a music buff like me needs to make an outright effort to remove this cd from the drawer & listen to it, then I don't doubt, for a second, that you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Oolong Tea","review":"This oolong tea from Dynasty is really quite excellent, better than most expensive oolong tea.

But the basic ideas of building layers of protection for one's assets have not changed.The main thing I learned from this book is that asset protection is relatively expensive. The things we're compelled to do to ensure we won't suffer a catastrophic loss are both time-consuming and costly. It was because of the expense and time that I haven't tried to implement the most powerful techniques advocated by the author. Others may have more to protect and feel a greater urgency, and for those I highly recommend this book with the caveat that the forms are dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"I bought these mini DVD and they do not work with the video camera, always appear an error.

Its battery life is amazing, I've had mine now for about two months, have been using it non-stop, and it hasn't shown any battery fatigue at all.

In order to use the scroll wheel, you have to move your hand back a bit. The mouse is already short and this then causes the mouse to be under your fingers but not under any part of your hand. As a result, you can't really rest your hand on the mouse and that is less than comfortable. I guess, if you had small hands, this wouldn't be a problem. My hands are average for a tall guy and I haven't experienced this problem with any other mice. If you're just looking for a laptop mouse for shorter uses - or if you very small hands, this one may be for you. Because everything else works pretty well. (Kensington could avoid this problem by moving the scroll wheel to the tip of the mouse.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good functioning Mouse, but flawed design.","review":"The mouse works really well, however the door for accessing the batteries is poorly designed and will break easily over time, when you have to switch batteries in and out, like mine did.

I am currently using this mouse with a Macbook Pro and the Mac has no trouble finding the mouse when I turn it on.The down side is the poor design of the battery compartment. The very action of slightly squeezing the sides of the mouse releases the battery door. The design is such that the contact springs for the batter are perpetually working against the retention mechanism! there is no way of adjusting the retention strength as the barbs are simply injection molded plastic.I am a designer and I find that using this mouse for a full day of work requires reassembly on the order of 10-20 times a day.

Almost every time I touch the off-on switch it breaks loose, very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design of battery housing.","review":"The battery housing of this mouse is accessed by a spring-loaded door at the base of the mouse. The door is released by squeezing either side of the mouse. Whenever you pick up the mouse, hold it to switch the power, or hold it with any sort of grip, the door pops open and the batteries fall out. Exceptionally poor design.Otherwise, not a bad product.

The film is grainy, as though someone recorded it off of a VHS tape and then burned that onto a DVD. There are several scenes where a fiber appears on the left side of the screen, and there's a continuous white line on the top border. The audio is subpar, and there are times where there's a split second delay between audio and video. It's a bit surreal, which would be ok if this were a Stanley Kubrick film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"The movie, in and of itself, is a good one (4 stars); but the quality of the DVD is amazingly bad. If I had known that it was even possible for a DVD to come out so badly, I wouldn't have bought it. To boot, it's not in widescreen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Bought it for a friend. She thought, as I did, that it was a great movie. It has been played many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of Me","review":"One of the best comedies ever!! Steve Martin's acrobatic comedy role is priceless and Ms Tomlinis brilliant as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"another excellent teaming of martin and reiner","review":"what a great accomplishment teaming steve martin and lilly tomlin together in an '80's comedy some times sorely over-looked.it's also another winner from the likes of carl reiner who also directed some of martins other great comedies such as the jerk and dead men don't wear plaid.if you like martin and or tomlin than this film should not disappoint.moments of comedic genius abound for both martin and tomlin.when martin first tries to walk once he has found that tomlin has taken over the left side of his body is pure comedic talent.there are alot of parts in this movie that are laugh out loud.a good comedy that shouldn't be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"side splitting","review":"This is possibly the funniest movie of all time. Steve Martin is a genius at the top of his game here. If you have a single funny bone in your body you will be rolling on the floor with laughter. You will laugh so hard you cry. This film is irresistable. Get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good times...","review":"This is one othe movies made in the good times when Steve MArtin still could make the audience laugh with his acting... It has a good plot, good sequences, very good script."},{"rating":"2","title":"good film","review":"this film is still funny after all of these years.Stevie Martin is still one wild&crazy Guy.Lily Tomlin is equally funny.this is pre-Jerry Springer ERA stuff.what was weird in 84 became normal on Jerry."},{"rating":"1","title":"scam","review":"This movie was and is a piece of crap. Yes, it was cheap. Yes, it was a VHS. Yes, I threw it in the garbage because it would have cost me more to send it back than I paid for it.It was a copy! ! ! ! Even the box it was in was a COPY. Beware to everyone who buys from this party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Steve Martin Meets Lily Tomlin","review":"In my opinion, this is one of Steve Martin's best movies. It's a comedy with heart (my favorite kind) and the premise, together with the casting, works remarkably well. Lily Tomlin initially plays a super-rich, bed-ridden grouch. Her plan is to enter the body of a woman whom she has paid to allow her to possess her body on her death. Instead, through an accident, she ends up in Steve Martin's body, and they battle for control. Thus the title -- why not take \\"all of me\\"? I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a lighthearted, feel good comedy for all ages!","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen over the years. If you like the kind of slapstick comedy that Christmas Vacation, The Jerk, and Major Payne have you will enjoy this one. I would recommend this one to anyone who wants a good laugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapponinted","review":"I'm very disappointed because the product description read \\"Closed-captioned\\" and guess what, it is not closed-captioned. I don't have a problem with that, but I wanted to watch this movie (which I love) with my husband, who has a hard time understanding English and has never seen it. Now, I'll have to watch it by myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Reiner-Martin Collaboration","review":"Carl Reiner and Steve Martin return to collaborate on this off-the-wall 1984 comedy about the conflicts with gender roles. As with many of their other collaborations, this film is a cleverly crafted comedy to be enjoyed by all.Steve Martin plays an attorney who falls victim to a bitter and crippled woman's (Lilly Tomlin) failed attempt to transfer her soul into that of a youner one (Victoria Tenant)who's even more sinister. Tomlin and Martin's characters try to find the guru who made this happen but they're hampered by a now reluctant Victoria Tenant who wants to keep Tomlin's vast wealth for herself. During their search, Martin and Tomlin must deal with the foreign habits and dispositions peculiar to their sexes.This is a great comedy about gender roles and what might be the causes to the battle between the sexes. A film not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happily Surprised","review":"When I ordered this product, the seller only promised \\"All of Me.\\" However, when I got the DVD, it was actually a 3-disc set that contained two other Steve Martin movies. I has to say I was pleasantly surprised.This was the perfect gift for Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like this movie","review":"Big fan of the major actors in this film: Steve Martin, Lily Tomlin, Victoria Tennant. Think the premise is good and silly but really love watching Steve Martin play both his and Lily Tomlin's parts in one body.Great music, good silly fun way to spend a few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"What woman hasn't wanted to know what a man was thinking?","review":"How exactly do you get alone time when you have someone sharing your body? Wait until they fall asleep, duh!My favorite is Steve Martin sauntering down the street with Lily Tomlin in control of one very feminine looking hand. These two have a lot to teach each other about how to live life and they sure will if they ever stop bickering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three in one","review":"I never get enough of Karen Kingsbury's books, so it was great having three books in one cover.

You'll be hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Closure","review":"Wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but at least now I can lay the story to rest and move on with my life. I started watching the series when I was in high school and only recently had the time to finish the series (college will do that to you). The collection (all seasons) come in a really sturdy case, which makes the collection very visibly appealing to look at, and the story itself is very interesting. I bought this during the black Friday sale, so that made the value even better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed garbage.","review":"What a disappointment; bad scripts, bad acting (except Vanessa Redgrave), poor direction - but with those scripts, no wonder! - flat and boring.The unbelievability of the 'plots' is an insult to the viewer.What was a fun series has turned in to dull, monotonous, characterless and vapid waste of time; could do well as a US daytime soap.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these people?","review":"I am an avid Nip/Tuck fan and have all the seasons on DVD. I have been really sad that this will be the last season, but after seeing the season premiere, it might be for the best. This was the worse Nip/Tuck episode I have ever seen. Who is this evil Liz and these OLD, tired, worn out doctors? Who is this new actress playing Teddy? Why does Teddy's character go from a mysterious wild child to a woman who wears $150,000 earrings?This episode had hardly any substance... just smidgens of Christian and Liz fighting, Sean having trouble sleeping, Matt not knowing what he wants to do with his life, etc. The tiny bit of drama with Sean and sleeping pills in the last fifteen seconds is nothing compared to Kimber being kidnapped by the Carver, Matt finding out Ava was a man, or Gina being f***ed off a balcony.This episode was nothing like Nip/Tuck normally is, and this time it was not a good thing. I'll watch the whole season, but here's hoping it gets better from here on out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nip/Tuck","review":"I was surprised to receive my DVD so fast.

The book is long, detailed, and yes tedious. I was warned before hand concerning the book, thanks Matt, of the nature of the discussion. Buttrick is a master, there is no doubt. He knows every thing and every one concerning preaching. This book is not for the average preacher, most would have no clue what he is talking about, it is mostly theory. This book is beyond me, I am not that good yet to practice this methodology. But the book was helpful in polishing the pulpit. The book is like fine sandpaper, it puts on a beautiful finish on a preacher, but you have to be polished before the paper would do the job. If you are a top notch preacher that needs the most challenging material and style, this book is for you.

Just the right amount of heat, and it is a flavorful heat, not just a sting. Thick and satisfying, and easy to keep at the office.

As far as shelf stable soups go, I thought it tasted a lot fresher than shelf stable grocery store stews and meals that are available by the boxed mac n cheese.

I have two main objections: 1. It is not organized in a way that makes it easy to look things up. There have been times when I knew the information was in the book (since I had seen it before), but had to just flip through every page to actually find it. 2. It's very incomplete. I cannot find a command in this book that takes me to a given line in a file. I suspect the book fails because he tries to cover everything. I do not expect a pocket reference to cover some nonstandard HTML mode, or how to use Emacs as my mail reader. I want a reference on how to use it to edit text and code.

I find it very efficient in preping wood for finishing, but I have also found it to be great for sanding between finish coats. I use a lot of lacquer on my furniture and cabinets. The 333VS, set at low speed, with a fresh sheet of 180 or 220 paper, quickly levels any flaws without gumming up the paper. The secret is low speed and constant movement of the sander. Single speed sanders tend to melt the finish not remove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would look into another sander","review":"It seems it would be easy to design a nice orbital sander. It's a fairly basic tool. But I've found the Porter Cable to have a couple really annoying flaws. First, the dust filter tends to spin with the pad and paper. As it turns it tends to catch on the cord and drag it into the sand paper. This mostly happens when sanding the edge of a board, but you end up having to hold the cord out of the way with one hand. Not cool... Secondly, the inside of the filter, before it is really full, becomes lined with dust, blocking the air flow. The filter then blows off, causing a mess and a dust cloud. You can plan on this happening about once every half an hour of sanding. Not cool either... Thirdly, (a matter of personal preference) I tend to like the shorter orbitals. They are easier to control, and less taxing on the wrists. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"I stole this from my brother and now I get my own","review":"I have been looking for a while for a good sunscreen for my face that will not feel oily/greasy or make me break out.

Overall it was just okay, and even though able to evoke an emotion or two, which is why I believe the reviews are so kind, it doesn't stand up to the original (as a TV show it's not the greatest either). It is different than the original, in that half the plot is omitted and it's modern. Maybe in later episodes they fill in the rest of the story.

I finally had to take it to my dad's house where he had to use his electric screwdriver. I gave this product two stars because of the fact that once it was all put together it is pretty sturdy. It is definitely not easy to put together like the box said which is why this product does not deserve a higher rating. Please do not buy this product with your own money, if you get it as a gift and decide to keep it make sure you have an electric screwdriver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this","review":"This product is shoddy to say the least. It's the only thing I've ever bought that wasn't worth the time and effort to even put together. The screws don't line up with the holes, there are no pre-drilled holes in the wooden dowel rods and the cloth material of the cart is of extremely poor quality-paper-like. There was also ink on the material that smeared when touched. After an hour of fighting this thing during assembly I chucked it all. Actual carpenter skills and tools should not be required to assemble something like this.I've never seen such a poor quality product. I would rate it at less than a star if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so practical once your baby turns toddler","review":"It's good to store baby items and have easy access. Since it doesn't have solid base so expect it to sag when you put too many things in it and it's quite wobbly too. The wooden rods that support 1st and 2nd shelf slide out after awhile. They should just sew it shut then it won't slide out. Now since my baby turns toddler I can't use it as before to store folded baby clothes, diapers, powder and lotion cause he'll pull everything out. Since it's wobbly he can topple the whole thing. So now I use it to store his toys and books which he'll still take out."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this product a -5 rating, I would","review":"The pieces in my set were mislabled such that putting the organizer together did not work according to instruction (it wasn't my error, either, lol. My engineer husband verified that the instructions and the labeled pieces did not match). Nothing was pre-drilled, and assembly was difficult even discounting the incorrect labeling. Once correctly assembled, the organizer was very unstable and 'rickety', for lack of a better word. Munchkin, Inc. refused to any remedy unless I completely disassembled the item and emailed them video proof of the mislabled product. Given my extraordinarily pregnant condition and knowing that it would take even more time crawling around on the floor to disassemble, I passed. I'll chuck the organizer and won't be giving Munchkin, Inc. any more of my business. Don't waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea, but Poor Quality","review":"I liked the idea because it could hold alot of the basic necessities for a baby. But I have a few complaints about this piece. First off, it said \\"Easy to Assemble\\" ~ it would have been easy had the screws actually fit into the metal rods properly. The tips of the metal rods were crooked/slanted so it was really hard to get the screws in. A couple of the metal screws supplied were even the wrong size and had to improvise with what we had at home. One of the base legs started cracking when I placing it to its corresponding top leg. And the kicker after all that, the cart was slightly crooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"We spent hours trying to get this item together, with no luck. The holes do not line up and the pieces broke while trying to put it together.

The screws don't fit/line up with the right holes and the directions are crazy. It took my husband and all his strength to get the screws in as far as they would go. I have a toddler running around, and I am concerned about him scratching himself on one. I placed it in the room so the side with the bulging screws is to the corner.That being said, it seems like a great idea. I have put all of my supplies for my coming baby in the cart. It's small enough to be out of the way, but large enough for tiny baby things. Once the baby gets bigger?

This one and a deluxe version. I bought the deluxe first for my changing area and its been great. Only took me a few minutes to put together and has held up well. I needed a temporary place to store some of my older son's clothing so I went to buy another. I couldn't really tell the difference between the two versions at the store. From the picture it just looks like this one is missing the diaper holder. So I bought it to save $10. Boy am I sorry. This one is terrible to put together. It took me 45 minutes of frustration and power tools before I gave up and let my husband finish it. And I am pretty handy with these things. It's just okay now that it's assembled. It holds the clothes and when his room remodel is finished I'll probably toss it. Where the deluxe one will have future uses, just snaps together and it overall a MUCH better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flimsy","review":"This cart is nice because you can wheel it around the house and we placed it in our living room next to the portacrib, but it cannot hold much weight (the photo is misleading with all that stuff stacked nicely!).

To be frank this might be my first product which looked so simpler but is one of the toughest to assemble together.

It's NOT easy to assemble. It took him over an hour because he had to dismantle it and put it back together. We almost gave up and took it back. The instructions aren't clear and the holes on top didn't match screws. Also color parts and instructions were horrible. It's wobbly after all this work and assembled correctly. I didn't look at the reviews before I bought, which I should've. I just needed some extra storage along with my dresser. I'm using it with light things but it's fragile. Save your $ and buy something worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shabbily made and not worth the price","review":"I purchased this cart because I thought it was reasonably priced around $20. I was just looking for a simple organizer for the nursery. The pictures are deceiving because it looks like a sturdy cart, but the legs are made out of cheap wood and come in two pieces per leg. The quality of the canvas material is poor; the sewing is haphazard and not even in straight lines. It doesn't even hold a lot of weight--if you're looking for a true organizer to hold all of the things you need for a nursery (multiple packs of wipes, lotions, towels, etc.) then get a stronger cart. Needless to say, I returned it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not stable","review":"The organizer is well thought out with 6 cubbys. I store all of my son's clothes in it. However it is very unstable.

On the first machine, the clip on the paper tray broke (it is rather flimsy). Xerox replaced that machine with a refurbished machine which did not feed straight. The third machine (also a refurbished machine) did not feed at all - right out of the box. Since we'd had so many problems they sent us another new machine. This one has developed spotting in the printing. None of them have been able to print on my letterhead (the ink smudges). I love the variety of functions, and wish it actually performed.

First, the small man confused me (bright colors, strange texture), but when I gave him my first \\"squeeze,\\" I was in love. However, two weeks later, my cat, Ronald, tore a small hole in the Mogu. Within fifteen minutes, my life was over. My house was completely covered in white bits of foam. Not just the floor--it was bonding with everything in the room. I was taking several with my medication. It was impossible to avoid. That was over 10 months ago. We moved to a smaller apartment, but found that the styrofoam followed us.

Yes. Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy successor to a great game I think.......","review":"Thief 1 was one of my favorite games of all time. The premise of sneaking through the dark with nothing but your wits and a few paltry weapons (guess what, you ain't the Quake marine) gets the ol' blood pumping like nothing else. However what were the good folks at looking glass (yes...it is looking glass and not ion storm) smoking when they decided on system requirements? Requiring a Direct x 7 compatible video card is ludicrous. I don't know anyone who has a system that can run this game. That is setting yourself up for disappointing sales guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"Wow! Looking Glass is on a roll folks. Thief, System Shock 2, now this. The story is great, especially the way it is told (quick movies about the various factions followed by a story board format narrated by Garret the thief). The gameplay is suspenseful, the AI believable. The attention to detail is amazing, especially the little bits of dialog said by the characters as you stealth around. Better than the original with: level design, emphasis on human opponents (instead of undead/monsters), lots of cool gadgets, graphics Worse than the original with: some problems with the interface here and there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call me Garrett","review":"it is indeed a really good game and a different playing experiance, but you need a lot of patience. the controls are slick and the AI is good. looking glass has made a great game. the graphics and sound are not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Strategy Game","review":"When purchasing this game, I was excited.

The only problem is it's rated M for Blood and Violence, and my parents don't like my playing M games.

I kept getting stuck on some unseen barrier, and the map they give you shows your general location, but was not detailed enough to pinpoint where I was and show me how to get around whatever I was stuck on.My husband played for one afternoon, and didn't see much of anything either.

The Casing Mission was extremely hard until i finally got the idea. Anyway, i think that this movie was great but I did not care for the Mechanists that much. The Hammerites rocked so much in the last game. You could never tell what they would do and they seem to be more interesting to know about then the mechanists. I would want to see more of them in the next game. Another thing I wasn't sure about was the plot. i mean it was great but Thief 1 was had alot more plot twists.

But more importantly than appearances, the smell of the cologne from the new bottle has a much more powdery aroma than that of the old bottle. My girlfriend confirms this suspicion as well.

I recommend this Bible to parents who want to teach their children from a more simple and modern point of view and still get the true gest of what the King James Version is saying .

The next few chapters dealt primarily with how you would use very expensive digitizing equipment (think laser telemetry), and how to touch up data artifacts. The last few chapters deal with outputting your project. I saw nothing on modeling and animation using Lightwave as the primary tool. I'll give away the big secret of the book right here: Build a clay model and photograph it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"I was excited when I saw this book, being fairly new to LW6 (although experience in other apps). I saw it as a chance to get good with the character animation toolset. However, the book is mostly general character animation theory, and has little to with Lightwave at all. Sure, it has valid info on designing and storyboarding characters in 3D, but I already know that -- I wanted detailed information on how to apply what I know to Lightwave 6. I'd advise on skipping this one. There's better info out on the web, for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Particle board comes apart","review":"I made the mistake of ordering 3 of these before trying it out first. Like a lot of un-assembled furniture, this lateral file comes with the usual assorted hardware of Ikea-style turn fasteners. It looks ok but the problem is the cheap particle board... turn a screw just a little too much and you're toast- the wood breaks right off leaving you with no way of getting the unit properly assembled.Besides that, I tilted one while trying to move it (while empty) and the cheap plastic foot broke right off. I had to use a piece of plywood as a patch to fix it. There's no doubt this will not hold up to repeated use and am not putting anything heavy or of value on top of it. Plainly put it's not good furniture, if you manage to get it assembled it will likely only weather a couple years of use. There's cheaper furniture out there, but not by much. I spent an entire day putting together the three cabinets and learned my lesson. I will never waste my time with such cheap crap again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice wall rack!","review":"Very nice look to it and the packaging seems to be better now.

She sings about everyday feelings, and some not-so-every-day issues, which everyone experiences. The sweetness of her voice belies the depth of feeling she expresses through the songs.I especially like \\"Does she cry\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it used","review":"An artfully packaged stereotype of simplistic harmonies and recycled lyrics sung by a young singer drawing upon a limited life experience for creative juice. It would be good as background elevator music but I wouldn't recommend spending money to buy it new. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Framing Caroline a well articulated expression of life","review":"Parsons has wonderfully articulated the ups and downs of life, especially the struggle for an identity and the search for one's meaning. Songs like \\"Framing Caroline\\" express the desire to be one's own person, while a song like \\"Two Different Hearts\\" explores love and relationships in the late 90's. To truly appreciate the music from Framing Caroline, you have to see Parsons live. She is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kat's New CD","review":"I came looking for this CD, because I saw Kat performing songs from her new CD \\"No Will Power\\", before it was released, when she opened for Dave Mason. Full disclosure statement, after meeting her at the Mason show, I helped her out with some legal issues on the project, so she gave me a liner note credit. However, I'm not shilling for her (although you may feel that way). In fact, typically, this wouldn't even be a genre that would normally interest me, as I'm more of a Classic Rock and Funk fan. I haven't received Framing Caroline yet, but I can tell you that \\"No Will Power\\" is excellent (she's selling it herself right now on her web site www.katparsons.com). The album is about breaking up. The title track, in my view, is the standout. It's very Alanis Morissette, without the angst. I highly recommend it, and I look forward to listening to Framing Caroline. Thus, this rating is for the new CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gray's anatomy?","review":"I cannot fathom why this text is called \\"GRAY'S ANATOMY for Students,\\" as it bears no relation to the original text.

When I ordered the book it said it was in very good condition. When it arrived, the cover was all bent and ripped, and some of the pages were the same way. Would return it, but i dont have another month to wait to get another book. I guess this is what you get for looking for the cheapest way to get things done. The sad part is that when the package arrived, it said it came from chicago, I live exactly 23 minutes from Chicago, so I dont understand why something that was at most and hour away would take a whole month to get to my doorstep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled, wandering, uninformed.","review":"Being in the asset management consulting field I thought this highly recommended title should be as insightful as Swensen's \\"Pioneering Portfolio Management\\".

The story is the same as a lot of fantasies out there. A special boy coming to terms with his power. But unlike Eddings, who has used this plot over and over, this books characters are not entertaining at all. The writing is mediocre, and the plot is subpar. I mean, an army of zombies?

Buy Tigana or Song for Arbonne for a REAL fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Generic","review":"Some of Watt-Evans books are pretty good, so when I saw this one I picked it up. Big mistake. Did he consciously try to write the most generic story possible? Village blacksmith, disliked by his peers, is \\"touched by the gods\\" with supernatural powers, and is fated to go forth and save everyone from an evil power, blah, blah, blah. People, just because you like sci-fi/fantasy doesn't mean every such book is great. The other reviewer was right - go pick up a book by Guy Gavriel Kay (\\"A Song for . . .\\"), George R.R.

From its gurgley beginning to its scrambled math-pop finish I was taken aback by the simple complexity of the songwriting. In this only audio CD by this native Northwestern collaborative, we seem to see inside the songwriter's head. His depth of emotion, blanketed by the spacey guitar riffs, totally brought me in to the scene. Descriptive and unique, this album is one that I would never have leave my collection at the hands of a pawn broker."},{"rating":"2","title":"What ever happened to soccer bumper stickers?","review":"The cultural importance of soccer in America was first brought home to me back in the early 70's with those classic bumper stickers such as, \\"It takes leather balls to play soccer,\\" and \\"Soccer's played on grass.\\" Well, I don't know if soccer ever really took off as a sport in America, but they did have the best bumper stickers of any sport around back then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save your money!","review":"I am sorry folks. I read material on the paranormal of one kind or another all the time and, have done so all my life. But, this book borders on being unreadable. If you have a PhD in Geometry, Algebra and Physics you might be able to understand this book. For all I know it might have been sent to her by a Space Goddess. But, this book could have been written in Latin and, I would not even have noticed. This book is as dry as reading footnotes in a physics book. If your going to write a book write it so your readers can have a change to understand what you are saying (I am a college grad with a major in Accounting). This book should not have been published.

Quite the Contrary, I am a Tarot Reader, and have been quite convinced in the presence of the visitors since reading Richard Dolans excellent UFO's and the National Security state. So I am pretty well open to the potential Ideas in material like this book. However, I was barely able to force myself through the first 100 pages of this work, in the fading hope it would get better.The only thing the author seemed to be Channeling to my mind, was the Plutonic Ideal of pure BS. Perhaps however I am wrong, it is difficult to imagine a person who actually speaks the english language writing such awkard prose. So she might have been channeling a Pledian after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intersting book!","review":"I the beginning it took me a little bit to get used to Barbara's style and the concepts, considering that this was my first read by her. Nevertheless, the book is wonderfully laid out and explained so thoroughly that however complex the ideas (which were completely foriegn to me)became comprehendible, mind expanding and exciting! it is almost a text book like approach, very systematic and scientific- I loved it! Paired with Gerry's gentle meditations especially towards the end of the book were extremely helpful. When I finished the book I was in complete awe (and tears) perhaps for having gained such a fresh new perspective and a deeper understanding. This was a great book, I recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"intriguing and confusing","review":"I bought this book after reading the author's website and listening to a recorded interview of her views on the 2012 benchmark.She sounded highly cogent, intelligent, sensitive and serious.I could not understand most of what she was talking about in this book; there were too many references to matters I'd never heard of before; this process continued throughout the book so that by the end I had no idea at all of what she was discussing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Overall Intro to Mental Magic","review":"Marvin Kaye's \\"The Handbook of Mental Magic\\" is one of the best books to begin for those who wish to learn about mental magic. Not only does he cover the basics of most mental magic, he also gives new and interesting twists to some standard effects. Check out his effect \\"In Stygian Depths\\" to see how effects can be dressed up. In addition to many great effects, one of the best things about this book is its bibliography. I have used that bibliography to expand my library of magic and related mental areas. I can't recommend this book to highly for those interested in a basic foundation for mental magic and a great bibliography to expand on this interesting field of magic. The only weakness this book has, if any, is that it is dated and does not have some of the newer material in the bibliography"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"When I heard the previous mini-album of the show with Petulia Clark and David Willetts I was not very impressed, so I didn't have high expectations here.

Sorry, Petulia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much telling, not enough showing","review":"There's a good, rich story here, but it doesn't make for the absorbing novel it should. Wenner, a fine journalist, hasn't quite made the leap to a successful fiction style. There's too much summary narration, and much too much explaining of themes, ideas, and characters' motivations; I wish she'd trusted the story itself to carry more of that weight. I feel sure it could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate Wenner has written a beautiful book!","review":"Annie Waldmas balances the needs of two children, a husband, a career and a dying father as she struggles with the shame of deception, a passion for the truth and the meaning of family.

My professors obviously wanted a light read to finish the year off, and this Oprah \\"book of the month\\" is just that: light. Everything in this book is on the surface, there are no insights that are left to the reader to discover and work out. I will agree that there is a good premise behind this story, but it never gets off its feet. I found myself laughing at the fake drama that Wenner creates throughout this novel. I found this novel highly unrealistic, not because of the story but because of its form. My worst critique deals with Annie. She is self-involved, obnoxious, inconsistent, and one of my least favorite literary characters...period.Please save yourself the dread of this book, and pick up a Faulkner or Steinbeck instead.Jeffrey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not carry-on size","review":"This was much bigger and bulkier than expected - it's definitely too big to be carry-on size as I had incorrectly assumed. But it's not so huge that I'd want to keep it for using as checked baggage. I will be returning this. Don't make the mistake I did, take a close look at measurements closely before you buy. The overall quality of it does seem good, but I think you could find just as good for much cheaper elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners... Don't waste your money","review":"In contradiction to an earlier post which expressed this was a good book for beginners, I would highly recommend beginners and those with desire for practical implementation to buy Lin and Costello's book. This book lacks in the quality and quantity of its examples. It may serve as a good reference for the more theoretically motivated person (e.g., those in the academic publishing community) but if you want to own just one book, don't get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent practice for NYS Regents","review":"This book is a valuable resource for help in studying for the NYS Bio regents.

'Ronan' is much better and consists far more grown-up music than the average Boyzone-album. Of course most of these songs are love songs, but they are not as stroppy and the texts have more contents than you could expect from the singer of a boyband. The major charm of this album is that Keating doesn't copy Boyzone-songs or other styles, or that he doesn't use all the cliché's and the tricks possible to make a pop song. He tries to find his own, adult style, in which he succeeds quite well by combining nice pop music with traditional Irish elements. At that, this album contains two really outstanding songs, \\"Life is a Rollercoaster\\", a quite original song at that, plus \\"When You Say Nothing at All\\", a beautiful ballad. Also \\"Heal Me\\" is very nice. Ronan Keating has also a really nice voice and hey, without wanting to sound pathetic: he's got the looks! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"RONAN","review":"I can't wait for him to get to the USA. The first time I heard him was from a friend that brought some of her CD'S from England. I was impressed. He has a great voice. She also brought the Boyzone Group.

The album is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Ronan puts his voice to turns to gold!!!","review":"I am Ronan Keating's best fan here stateside, and I have been waiting for so long for his solo album to come out. It was absolutely worth the wait!! The songs on this album are superb, beginning with the infectiously poppy \\"Life is a Rollercoaster,\\" and ending with the breathlessly beautiful \\"Once Upon a Lifetime.\\" Of the ballads, my favorite has got to be the soulful and sweet \\"The Way You Make Me Feel.\\" I just can't help but smile when I hear that one. The up-tempo tunes such as the Irish flavored \\"If You Love Me\\" and \\"Keep On Walking\\" will have you up and dancing! I am extremely familiar with Ronan's catalogue of work, both solo and with his group Boyzone, and I have to say that this album definitely continues his standard of excellence!

The book is generally easy to read and starts with a short summary of vector calculus, complex analysis and linear algebra. However I'd say that this is only usable for brushing up, and shouldn't be used to learn the stuff from scratch. The rest of the book is not too challenging and contains many examples.My main problem with this book, however, is that it is not strict enough when it comes to the math.

Andre Previn was still in prime condition as a pianist at this time--how he kept his technique up for so many years while conducting is a mystery--and Julie Rosenfeld and Gary Hoffman are fully equal partners with him. The Ravel Trio is never rushed, and there are some tempos in the first movement that are downright slow. But the whole affair is highly loving. Previn's piano playing assumes the qualities of the best French playing, with a traditionally liquid sort of sound. This is especially winning in the Debussy Trio. It was written when the composer was 18, but is a fully mature and accomplished work. In places it may remind you of Massenet. The string playing here is especially satisfying and virtuosic. The sound engineering on the CD is excellent throughout, with a full tone and superb balances between the instruments.

Too bad that Anthony Beevor's plodding prose sucks the life out of the story. Seriously, this reads as if he was simply reciting a collection of note cards. He's really done a lot of research and seems to have a solid understanding of the time and the lives of the protagonists--but he is utterly unable to bring the story to life. This happens, that happens, suddenly she's in Germany, suddenly she's a movie star, the evidence is certainly there to surmise that she was connected to the Soviet secret services. But in the end, so what?

Instead what we have here is a family history of Chekhova's years in Russia during the Revolution through the 20s and Nazi years in Germany. It all seems rather skimpy and vague.

I no longer own the MHS recording, because it was the most wretched compilation of Russian Orthodox hymnology that I ever had heard. Most of the music simply was ugly. I lent the CD to other Orthodox friends, each of whom was equally repelled by the selections. Many reverent and moving recordings of beautiful Orthodox chant and hymnology are on the market.

Their singing shows it. It is clear and precise, not to mention of the highest quality. Some of the Russian choral albums I have (e.g., the Monks of Zagorsk; the Yale Russian chorus) have shown sloppiness in their articulation and harmonies. Not this group. This album is by far the best of the 40 or 50 Russian choral albums in my collection. It is the standard by which to measure all others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Might of the Russian Male Choral Sound","review":"The Russian liturgical music, especially that for the high holy days of Christmas and Easter, owns a mystery all its own. This splendid recording by the Chorovaya Akademia conducted by Alexander Sedov is a fine a sound as any produced on recording. Though few of the composers (with the exception of Tchaikovsky and Grechaninov) are well known outside Russia, the works are all beautifully composed and hauntingly performed. There is somewhat of a sameness to these religious works (little variation in tempi, expressive range, dynamics) but the overall effect is one of humble spirituality.This is a fine example of the Russian choral music that is growing in popularity one the recorded repertoire and it is for this listener one of the best.

The male voices, with their clear texture and incomparable range, leaves one with wide eyes and a loose jaw. It seems as if sometimes the deep bass notes are ones which have never been reached by humans before. This is made for those who like their Russian music written in the minor keys. The liner notes state that much of the music was written for Christmas, and leave it to the Russians to evoke such a feeling of dark mystery and attach it to that event. It is not background music. It is meant to have your undivided attention. After you've listened to it once, you'll have no hesitation arranging time for another hearing.

H. Byron Earhart accomplishes this in his short book: Japanese Religion: Unity and Diversity. Earhart plots out the entire course of Japanese religious history, from prehistoric times to the post-world war period.His overriding thesis is that Japanese religions, while diverse, strive for a certain level of harmony. The same can be said, generally, about Chinese religions. Certainly, the different religious traditions in Japan have had moments of friction, and there have been major cases of religious persecution. But compared to the West, the incidents are few and far between.Earhart is a fine guide through the twists and turns on Japanese history. The third edition was written thirty years ago, so this is a flaw with the work. This book will not reflect current research, and will also fail to track Japanese religion in our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"PU filter","review":"The price was great and the shipment came very fast.

Despite the \\"15 AMP\\" rating, the saw is a bit underpowered (when compared, for example, to the DeWalt).2. Awkward balance, and tends to wander in the cut, but maybe this is the result of just being more accustomed to using a conventional right-hand blade saw.3. Dust port is an annoyance. It's not practical to hook this up to a vacuum for most jobs, and if it's not in place, the dust gets all over the work and the user, as compared to a right-hand saw with rear sawdust discharge. PLUS -- you have to remove the dust port in order to get the saw back into the storage case.Summary: Scrape up more $ and get the DW 364. The difference is like night and day."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't give it 5 stars before I use it.","review":"I just purchased this saw and have yet to use it.

What was disappointing was that there were barely any speaking parts for the main stars, just monosyllabic responses to questions asked by the supporting cast.

There are many moves but only one works. The one where you sidestep, otherwise dont waste your time learning the others.The franshise league is all but realistic. There is no structure like the Madden 2005 series franchise.

It was exactly the product we were expecting - and the seller and Amazon were great doing business with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Bought this for my son last year - it was a requested item. It took him a day or two to figure out how ride it, but not nearly as long I thought it would. He loves it, rides it all the time when he's outside. It's obviously harder than a skate-board, but apparently not too hard for middle-school set to figure out. It's very durable, like I said he's ridden it almost every day for a year now with no problems. It's good exercise and good for coordination. My only concern is making sure he has a helmet on when he uses it. Otherwise - highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the fast shipping","review":"Wow, thanks for the fast shipping. I got the item 2 days after I order it.The items was in very good shape. Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Figure","review":"I bought this for myself to play with (I'm 35) and after all the presents were opened and toys, video games, and everything were forgotten (about 4 hours after Christmas), this was the ongoing favorite of the season. Everybody, younger (down to 8) and older (to 45) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching. It's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such. This is a GREAT present for 11-18 boy. Fair warning though, there will be some good spills on the fairly short, steep learning curve - helmets, knee pads, blah, blah, are a must (and a video camera!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What they don't say before you buy","review":"What they don't say before you buy is that you can expect to eat up wheels with this board. A 16 year old at 150 pounds ate up the wheels that came with the board in under two weeks.When contated to ask why, the company immediately blames the inexperience of the rider and tells you to buy more wheels. At $12-$20 per set of replacement wheels, the additional costs mount up quickly. The purchase price is only the start with this product. If your going to buy this, you must also purchase additional wheels. Otherwise the board will sit idle until you can get them.That having been said, the board is otherwise enjoyable and fun to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"RipStick","review":"The product was delivered in perfect condition and in time for me to give it to my 9-year-old daughter for an Easter gift. Since it was pink, and since she is the only one she knows with a pink RipStick, she loves it that much more. It gives her much more exercise than the old style skate boards, so I love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"hours of fun","review":"This product is amazing. It is so much fun. It combines skateboarding, snowboarding, and surfing. I live in hawaii, and i know what is like to surf, and this is almost just like cruisin on a wave. Ive also lived in alaska, and you can pretty much turn the same on a ripstik as you do a snowboard. So much fun. I would suggest, to get the ripstick value pack though. I weigh about 140 pounds and my wheels are almost done with. Hope this was helpful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Experience","review":"This was a great experience. Everything has worked out great - price, purchasing, receiving and using this Ripstick. My son loves his Ripstick. He is not a big skateboarder.

I would highly recomment it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ripper","review":"Very good product keeps the kids on the move and requires some skills to ride.

I had my doubts about how much she would use it, but I am finding I didn't need to worry. She loves her new ripstik and is on it nonstop, especially when we are at campgrounds. Wonderful purchase for active kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripstick","review":"I was hesitant to buy this for my son who begged me for months. He finally earned enough money for it and as soon as it got here he has been riding it ever since. I/we have no complaints so far. He actually likes it better than his skate board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, Great Price!","review":"I was doubtful when Amazon priced the red model at $45... way cheaper than other colors... was even wondering if it is truly a Ripstick brand. My daughter had a pink version from Walmart that cost $75. Well, my doubts was cleared when I received the goods. It is indeed the Ripstick brand. Both my wife and daughter are now having great fun together. Product is well made and can withstand impact without mechanical damage. Despite daily usage on roads and concrete, the wheels are still running smooth and in usable condition. Balancing is definitely more challenging than Roller-blades or Skateboard. So it's advisable for first-time user to wear protective gears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"I bought this for my 13 year old granddaughter and it was the hit of her Christmas. She was outside and trying to get her balance in minutes. It takes some effort to learn how to ride this, and I think you have to be young, but she was up and going in short order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I can't keep my 7 year old son off of it!

Within a couple of days, they were pros!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"I got this for my birthday last summer and absolutely love it. I got the hang of it immediately and it a lot of fun, and even a pretty good work out. One thing that I wasn't happy about is that I rode it a lot when I got it and the polyurethane wheels wore down really quick, and I had to buy a set of new wheels. When i went to install them I realized that I only needed to replace the back wheel. The new wheel has held up since then and I still have another one for when that goes down. The front wheel hasn't worn down hardly at all because all of your weight goes on the back when you are riding. I'm pleased with it and is good for almost anyone. I find it easier to balance than a normal skateboard and it can hold well over 200 pounds without showing any sign of strain. I have ridden it for some pretty long distances but at about the 2 mile mark your legs really start feeling the burn. Bottom line: it's a cool idea, and a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE the Ripsticks!","review":"My kids absolutely LOVE their Ripsticks! I have 7 year old twins, they figured out how to ride them the first day, and ride them still almost everyday :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsomely FUN!!!!!!","review":"I got this for my daughter for Christmas. She had limited experience on a Ripstik because she mainly only rode one when her friends would let her. As soon as she got it, she went into the basement and practiced, and in a VERY short time, she was riding it and \\"grinding\\" like a pro. This was probably the best overall gift that I gave her this year... and I got the best deal to boot. No fighting crowds at the malls... and home delivery to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a longboard instead.","review":"These are fun for a little while but everyone either switches to a real skateboard or they simply quit using it. If you buy this it will spend years collecting dust. Get a Longboard. something with a flexible or at least slightly flexible deck. Good set of longboarding trucks. and good wheels. Look at the highest rated youtube videos. you wont find the best boards on here. Except maybe a Loaded brand board."},{"rating":"1","title":"What they don't say before you buy...","review":"What they don't say before you buy is that you can expect to eat up wheels with this board.

He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week. Then the wheels broke. He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.

She specificly requested this one in this color. It is beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of fun","review":"Bought for my 12 year old daughter. She loves it. Looked like a lot of fun, so I started to try to ride it too. For what it's worth, I'm 40 and could never ride a skateboard as a kid. After a few days of getting adjusted however, I can ride the Ripstick pretty well. If I can ride it, anybody can. Bonus: it' s a great core/ab workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loved","review":"Great Christmas present, received timely and quality of product was what I had expected. 13 year old daughter loved and was also able to take apart and fit in suitcase for traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripstik Caster board (Blue)","review":"I was very pleased with the ripstik. It was a Christmas gift for a 9 yr. old boy, and he loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the inexperienced","review":"Unfortunately as a parent, I should have done more research on this product. My son has no experience with skateboards, let alone a ripstik. He used it once, fell off and had to go to the ER. Ended up selling the ripstik within a week after Xmas. Anyone considering buying this for their child, be sure to find out more on this on the internet and others experience. The ripstik only has two wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is great because you can showoff","review":"i really like the ripstik because you never have to keep pushing off the ground for more speed like you do for a skate board or scooter. you can just keep floating along on your piece of moving ground. the only problem is that its hard to learn, but that only adds to your bragging rights when you master it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheels break too fast","review":"I was really annoyed when only after an hour of riding it, the front wheel shattered. I called up the Ripstik company and they sent me some free wheels, but the problem there was they were the same wheels that shattered! If you purchase this ripstik you should also get a pair of better wheels. I recommend the WAVE wheels. They have better bearings and much better speed and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chord solo masterpiece","review":"Any fretted instrument player will appreciate the virtuosity of the chord solos that make up this CD. This is also among the most listenable ukulele music you can hear. On James' first CD he worked with a plectrum (pick). This CD is chord solos. Normal chord solo work involves playing a chord and adding melody notes. James pretty much uses a different chord for each melody note. I have seen James perform and I attended a workshop where he explained how is able to do this. Please note the joy expressed on his face on the CD cover. I have never seen a musician that seemed to enjoy playing more than James does. His smile is infectious. Buy this CD and catch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute story","review":"Great way of getting the kids to see how important keeping the house clean is.My kids absolutely love the Berenstain Bears books. They want me to read them every night before bed. My 5 year old son's favorite thing to read with Mommy. Also they really love the show too. Sweet, and wholesome storytelling. Nice and innocent. :) So good for kids. Totally recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No lesson taught","review":"I've loved Berenstein Bear books since I was little, and as a parent I love that they teach a lesson. This book showed that if they don't do their chores then the house is a mess but it never got around to teaching the lesson, such as sitting down and discussing the problem and assigning kids chores, etc... I was VERY disappointed. It just didn't follow the character of the previous books. Thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The trouble with formulaic writing","review":"First of all, let me say that I don't *completely* hate the Berenstain Bears books, despite the frequency with which I have to read them. A lot of them have provided launching points for productive conversations with my kids.This one, however...what the heck? I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that it goes a bit too far. The poop on the floor just is...bizarre. And it isn't just one picture of it; it appears in the book three separate times. There are also two kind of crazy drawings of Mama Bear where she just looks like she has completely given up on life (although if I were married to a lout like Papa Bear I might give up, too).There are definitely better ways to get the message to kids that it's not OK to let the chores slide. Piles of poop with stink lines coming off of them are really not necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Zojirushi SFBAE12ST Tuff Wide Lost Vac. in 8 months","review":"My tuffwide is BETTER as it lost vac. after eight months, as other users lost vac. within six months.I only use it for dozen of times. Probably, it has design error, as it failed suddenly (even I took good care of it -- never battered, drop on the ground). Be careful, if you are planning to buy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost vacuum after six months","review":"My tuffwide lost vac. after six months in service.Sad, really. I have one over twenty years old that still works. Battered, missing a handle, but can tell hot from cold.Like the design on this one and had hopes. Amazon, of course, points out that if it had failed in 30 days... I am on my own and plan to fill the former vac. cavity with low expansion foam. Otherwise, it functions well as a hot water bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beat the House 2 Beats Me","review":"I have had Beat the House before on my ealier computer and it was a great game to play, I really did enjoy it. That is why I bought Beat the House 2, but unfortunately it would not work on my new computer which has a later version of Windows, Windows XP. It works on Windows 98 so I gave it to my daughter. This is not a good version to get unless the company puts in a patch to make it workable for Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8.I rated it high for fun because the games it has are good and enjoyable but I rated it I don't like it overall because I can't play it on my computer.a good Video Poker Web site is: [...]which at least has a great version of Video poker as well as other games to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"I cant comment on the microwavable bowls, I tried this from the regular cans but I can sure comment on the taste.

Distinctly metallic taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"It's just a philosophy graduate student complaining that the world of English literary theory isn't grounded in the rigorous confines of philosophy. He even prepared an eerily meticulous little outline for us throughout the entire book, with little subheads alerting us to counter-arguments and such. It starts to get vaguely interesting when he puts down different literary theorists, until you realize all of this has been said before.ALSO make sure you know that this is self-published with a blurry photo of the author not even looking at the camera--it could actually be almost anyone--with no quotes from reviews. The high price must be due to the fact that it's self-published through iUniverse."},{"rating":"1","title":"To old to be usefull!","review":"I looked forward to reading this book... then it arrived in the mail and I thought I had gone back to the 1980's. The info is so outdated that this book is not even usefull for anything but laughing at. I'm sure it was great in it's day but please don't wast your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe that a book like this got published","review":"This is basically a manual for how to consistently stalk and harrass someone to ruin their life, how to avoid anyone catching you, and how to stop anyone believing your \\"target\\" when they try to tell anyone about it. You would have to be mentally ill to want to carry out these things against someone and create an unrelenting campaign of violence against them which they can't prove. Anyone who buys this book and uses these tactics needs to face up to the fact that they ARE A STALKER and a weak, manipulative coward who doesn't have an actual life of their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the normal touch","review":"If you want some good ideas for a bathroom but still have that normal look, don't get this book. Stainless steel toilets and a sink in the shower stall with a mirror are some of the weird ideas that come out of this book. They even show industrial toilets that are mounted to the wall rather then the typical floor mounted toilet.Some very strange colored tile patterns and designs and one bathroom even has old wood on the walls to give it that barn look. What kind of person would have wooden swing doors for a shower door and a bail of hay to sit on to change.This kind of reminds me of abstract art that you would only find in California."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamtime Again","review":"Once again I find myself praising the Frenchman's work.These tracks have an incredible,surrealistic-quality within the production of this albumn.As my review of \\"A Grand Love Story\\"suggest that no good music lover \\"shall deny the listening aural pleasure of any \\"KID LOCO \\" project.

Counseling Treatment and Intervention brings the fields of social work and criminal justice together in a comprehensive text with equal applicability to both fields. There is much attention to cultural and gender differences in this text as well. Highly useful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Story!","review":"It may have a title I don't like to utter, but don't let that stop you. This book had me from page one. Burt is an extremely well thought-out character much like Paddy Clarke and Buten's language is poetic yet completely fits the Burt's vocabulary. Thank goodness this book was reprinted for those of us who missed it the next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler Warning","review":"This is an extremely weird book. At first I didn't like it. The whole novel discusses something that Burt did to Jessica. I wanted to discover what that was, so I kept reading. It's discovered that Burt and Jessica had sex, but they're only eight. Which is weird. It's not \\"dark\\" or \\"twisted\\" like it has been described to be many times. Most of the time I just skipped to the end of the paragraph because Buten goes on and on about some uninteresting, pointless perspectives that Burt has. This book should be YA. It was such an incredible waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!!! A MUST HAVE!!!!","review":"This is the best instructional video i've ever seen!Not only does it go into the technical side of drawing, but it deals with the methodology behind the creative process. You learn alot about creativity which is lacking from anything else i've ever seen on the subject of drawing. Don't be fooled by the title, I found this video useful for every subject matter that I create, not just monsters.As a teacher of character design, I cannot recommend this video enough! As an artist, I'll say that this would be a great addition to your reference collection! And as a student, I'll say it has been one of the best lessons i've ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming!","review":"This was a nice video that is filmed like a documentary, but you are pulled in by the relationship the teacher has with his multi-level classroom students. It also gives a little glimpse into daily life for these French children.Speaking as a French teacher, as French movies go, this one is very school appropriate, with only one bad word in the subtitles and no inappropriate scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll spend such a nice moment!","review":"I first saw this movie at the theatre with no real expectations. What a pleasant surprise!! Everything in this documentary is touching; the teacher's stern but caring attitude, the students' interactions, the beautiful photography.

Saar during his time at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.I can say without hesitation that Erik did not translate for the incident he talked about on 60 minutes, nor did he witness any of the interrogations he wrote about in his book. Because of his limited skills in the Arabic language, he was kept behind a desk doing paperwork.It is apparent from reading his book, Erik is trying to make a fast buck on the so-called stories that were always going around amongst the Interrogators. Yes Erik, they were just stories that were made up to entertain folks.I think a better book for reading would be the one that someone should write about you Erik, and how you have pulled the wool over the eyes of the world.Erik is not only a poor Arabic Linguist, he is also a liar.Erik, shame on you Brother.

It is not based on a true story. In fact, the author goes to great lengths to point out that it is a FICTIONAL story before you even begin reading. I have taught the novel every year since 1998. I have read it over and over. It is very much fiction. That being said, this movie is a Disneyized version of a novel, and they follow the story about as well as their other adaptations; which is to say, not at all. The names are slightly the same, and there's a mountain in it, but that's pretty much where the similarities end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with region","review":"I have not been able to view this dvd because it is encoded to Region 1 (USA); I live in the UK which is region 2.I am having many problems converting it to region 2.Keith J.Salmon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mountaineering adventure","review":"Excellent family movie, all good clean adventure with a moral, with many very realistic period Alpine climbing sequences.

The whole movie was sad, I did not even wait for it to finish. I was very disappointed. The hair set the tone for the film, which depicted bad casting, bad play, and most of all bad stylist. The film was really really bad. So bad, I left a movie review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"This is terrible. Why did they even make it? I love Jennifer's movies and I love Hawaii Five-O but this has got to be the worse either one has ever done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Rom-Com","review":"As a fan of romantic comedies, Jennifer Lopez, and Alex O'Loughlin, I loved this movie. Yes, it followed the typical plot structure and conventions of romantic comedies, but, so what? (Why aren't action movies, and other movies aimed at men, criticized for being even more formulaic than rom-coms? Only so-called \\"chick-flicks\\" are judged this harshly for following the structure of their genre.) I wasn't expecting a masterpiece that would sweep the awards shows. I was looking for some fun, heartwarming entertainment, and this movie delivers. Jennifer Lopez is wonderful at physical comedy, and we saw another side of Alex O'Loughlin. Having only seen him in intense, brooding roles, I was surprised at how well he delivered in a comedy. As a bonus, we also got to enjoy Tom Bosley in his final role, a bittersweet moment for his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex O'Loughlin makes this movie","review":"Very good fun. While Jennifer Lopez is the \\"star\\" of the movie, don't sell Alex O'Loughlin short. He REALLY makes this movie great! His reactions to the situation(s) is what truly makes this a great comedy. Looking forward to seeing more of him in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"From my wife Sarah: All I kept thinking was - how could Jennifer Lopez have agreed to make this movie? It was boring, slow, silly and just completely unbelievable.Actually I don't even mind when a movie is unbelievable if it has something entertaining, interesting, funny or thought provoking. But this was a TERRIBLE script with lots of cliches. There were parts that were meant to be funny but were utterly rediculous. The romance part was absolutely unbelievable, and on a scale of 1-10, chemistry was about zero. Jennifer - you're so much better than that! I hope you'll have better movies in your future. Unfortunately I can't recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute film","review":"I would consider this another guilty pleasure rom-com.Only reason I initially was curious about it was because of #AL but J'lo does a good job,considering some of her works(Gigli ha!)Who knew?!

This was an absolute waste of 2 hours. This movie is completely predictable with nothing even remotely original about it. Terrible acting and completely unbelievable. If I could give it zero stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"This missed the mark on so many levels....","review":"I really love romantic movies, even the mushy ones. I can overlook slightly bad acting if the script is good. I can overlook a bad script if the acting is good. Then there is The Back-Up plan. This film was very bad on every level. There is a saying about bad acting - \\"They phoned in the performance\\". In this case I wish they would have because at least then I wouldn't have had to watch as well as listen to this horrible movie. I kept fast forwarding to try & find a part that was better. It was consistently bad throughout. I have seen both of these actors do some good work. What happened here? I didn't think Alex O'Loughlin was far enough along in his career to walk through a performance. I really enjoyed Moonlight and he was one of the leads in that. I have also enjoyed a number of other films with Jennifer Lopez. It is a mystery how one something can go this wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not JLo's best performance","review":"I mostly really like Jennifer Lopez movies. She's just cute as the dickens, and her hair is so pretty. I saw The Backup Plan a couple of weekends ago and it just wasn't up to her fun, playful standards. The writing was terrible. It made her and her co-star seem like robots out of the fourth grade (but with adult bodies, including reproductive capabilities and really, really fast-growing, relentless stubble). Their courtship was not credible, waaaay less so than any other JLo movie. I'm willing to sit through goofy entertainment, but this one was really a waste of my time. I should have used my time to floss my teeth instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"Wooden Characters and Shameless/ Telegraphed Cliches. Really, really BAD movie. Made \\"How to Lose a Man...\\" look like an Oscar Winner. Total crap. Thought it would never end."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously terrible.","review":"predictable and painful. Jennifer Lopez and whoever her co-star is have absolutely no chemistry. The plot is ridiculously stupid..The ending..the beginning...the middle...ugh. This movie is offensive to single women, pregnant women, single men, people in retirement homes, OBGYN's... and people in New York. 2 hours of my life I will never get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex makes the movie. JLo is as usual ho hum","review":"Alex O'Loughlin makes this movie...totally. It is hard to believe him with JLo. It is an odd pairing. I have never been impressed with Jennifer Lopez as an actress and she seems totally out of place in this movie. I can see why she wanted to make it to appear with Alex, but it was a let down after watching his chemistry with other actresses. It is 4 star just to watch him, but otherwise a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Jennifer Lopez and she plays her character in The Back-up Plan well, but the movie lacks plot, surrounding cast.","review":"I love Jennifer Lopez as an actress and as a musical artist. That being said, first of all... in this movie, she plays the character and part well, she is at her best. However, the supporting cast and surrounding characters are boring, the plot is flat, and her love interest does not play his role well either. The movie had potential, and it the first 15 minutes are pretty good, from then on, everyone else just sinks the ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is a MUST SEE!","review":"The Backup Plan was hilarious, romantic, seductive, entertaining, sweet, and so much more! I laughed, I cried, and I fell in love. Alex O'Loughlin is sexy and an amazing actor, and Jennifer Lopez was wonderful as always. This movie is a MUST SEE (not for guys, it's a chick flick). There are very few films that have the elements of good acting, humor, entertainment, and romance; this is definitely one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back Up Plan","review":"I love Jennifer Lopez movies. That being said...I was so disappointed in this movie. For one thing, I thought it was very crude. It was so unnecessary to put all the crude visuals (do we need to see Jennifer Lopez sitting on the toilet, or someone giving birth in a baby pool and defecating in front of everyone!!) Come on...it could have been a cute movie if they hadn't put all the nasty stuff in it. Don't waste your money and I definitely would not let little kids watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, awful, awful","review":"I went into this movie with low expectations. I know romantic comedies are predictable and cheesy. But this is one of the worst I have seen. I think I laughed once when the dog did something silly. Way over the top and I was almost insulted by all the stereotypical pregnancy jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Very cute movie. Very entertaining. Not much depth pretty fast paced. The lovely Alex O'Loughlin is soooo dreamy and I love him now. Jennifer Lopez has done some good work in some movies but though she plays this character a lot, she is not believeable. Her character is not believeable and looks way to put together for someone in her circumstances. In some shots you can imagine they yelled cut for makeup and hair to come in. Other than that it was nice way to spend an afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"back up plan...","review":"HOpe you have a back up movie to watch if you rent this one. It was a disappointment from the beginning. The story line was okay not moral but okay. The acting was slow and hard to watch. Some scenes and dialog I would not recommend to my 13 year old. Can't recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Back-Up Plan","review":"I already saw The Back-Up Plan 3 times!! It is funny and very entertaining, Alex and Jennifer have an amazing on screen chemistry! Alex is funny, charming and played his character Stan realistically and believable, not to mention so sexy! I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I, just. Cant.","review":"I love JLo and I LOOOOVEEE Alex O'loughlin (you know he fine), but this movie is HORRIBLE. So, what if it's predictable? That doesn't bother it. It's the fact that the storyline is atrocious...not the main premise but little things like how they met-- why the heck is this guy so head over heels for her? It just doesn't seem natural. Speaking of unnatural....THE ACTING!!! OMG...Alex, you are so much better in Hawaii Five-O. It;s like all of them read the script the day before shooting. Way to kill my ladyboner, CBS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Alex O'Loughlin!","review":"Overall, I really, really liked The Back-Up Plan. A typical J-Lo Romantic comedy, it was sweet and funny, just as I would expect. There were a few parts that were just a little over-the-top (the stew scene!), but mostly it was fun and made me laugh and even drew a few tears. Alex O'Loughlin is simply to die for, and I was completely in love with him myself by the end of the movie. Just a fun, all-around Chick Flick, for romantic comedy lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different view! PLEASE READ before you buy","review":"WEll yes Jennifer is adorable BUT don't be fooled by the \\"cute\\" modern subject of this movie or the title. There are SO many WEIRD twists and rideculous, bizzare and DISTURBING sceenes it was just so GROSS at times- i can't believe she agreed to make this movie. Now if you WANT to watch (first sceene) her being examined by her gynocologist - while he pulls a bloody instrument out of her -Then knock yourself out! If you WANT to watch a woman having a baby in a kiddie pool while ALL her friends stand and watch and you get to see WAY more than you want to -- then have fun - the plot was WEIRD and made no sense and NO guy would fall for her like that - it was just ODD!! I wouldn't waste my money on buying it - I was sorry I went to see it! what a waste of my time and her talent!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful","review":"This was the longest two hours of my life. It was boring and predictable, it had a made for television feel to it, aside from the completely awful birth scene which would have never been shown on TV. If you really want to watch this film, I would suggest to borrow or rent as you may find that it is not worth the money to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"J lo mmmm","review":"We liked this movie because it brings easy comedy to a stressful and frustrating time. It's enjoyable comedy situations that most understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This product is a great deal... The quality is excellent.... I recommend the purchases... Excellent and good... I'm really satisfied..."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Don't waste your time this is horrible and a waste of time. People who are giving this movie a 3 stars or above should be ashame of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAINFULLY STUPID","review":"Don't waste your time on this because it is soooo incredibly stupid and just plain bad. Horrible! The characters are unpleasant, there is no chemistry between them and the script is stupid. It is especially sad because I normally like these actors, but not in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Hours of My Life Gone","review":"Uhg... Boring, boring, boring, then something funny, then boring, boring, boring, boring, then something funny. Like the dude's explaination at the park of what is like to have children.Story was weak, really weak. My wife gave it 1/2 a thumb up, and I gave it 2 down.If you can watch it for free, and you have a magazine or book to browse while you watch, it is watchable. Or if ya just need a nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money it really is that bad in fact crap.","review":"I suffer from chronic illness so I look forward to watching engaging movies that help me cope with my lot in life. As the movie progressed I kept hoping that it would improve by the end the only improvement was that I will never have to watch it again. The script - crap, the acting - crap, and the money I paid for this piece of crap well why not round it off - crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've Ever Seen","review":"This is the most unbelievable, poorly acted, terribly written, god-awful excuse for a movie EVER. Total waste of 2 hours. This movie has enough plot and quality acting for a 30 second pampers commercial spot.0/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just palin bad","review":"There was no believable chemistry between the main characters. The main funny part of the movie was when the little dog fell over with the cart. As a matter of fact the dog was the funniest character in the movie. J-Lo's one dimensional acting did not work in this movie at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"More disrespect toward natural relationships and fathers","review":"Maybe a great case for men who want to be fathers to find egg donors and surrogate mothers!Seriously, though, this movie takes today's realities regarding dating and parenting and proposes a \\"solution\\" that potentially removes the father from families. I understand that in this movie the woman actually finds a man, but in the \\"real world\\" not all women do find father figures for children.The glorification of single motherhood and the removal of fathers from the \\"family\\" (due to irresponsibility of their own, the mother, and/or the current \\"family court\\" system) are huge problems in America today. What we need is a society that values men's role in children's lives, and encourages preservation of families--to include the father/husband.This movie isn't worth the money spent--plenty of better, traditional, romantic movies are available."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They thinking?","review":"What were they thinking? Obviously they weren't, with such a ridiculous film. The sad thing is it's a waste of good talent. JLo has great charisma on film and Alex O'Loughlin was hypnotic in Moonlight yet somehow managed to come across in this film as a real nerd. So many gimmicks in the film and an unbelievable 8th grade dialog and plot make this film simply unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!","review":"Do not buy this movie if you liked wedding planner or monster n law, this is nothing like it and its not even funny..very upset about this one j-lo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Review","review":"This DVD was for my daughter. She asked for it on her birthday. It came promptly when I ordered it. It was an excellent price compared to the stores. I will always get movies from Amazon. The movies come in good condition. Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for guys at all","review":"If you want to score romance points with that special someone, choose a different movie.It's awful. AWFUL!!!!The only thing more macabre than seeing Mr. Cunningham in his final acting role was Maribeth Monroe's birthing scene. I would definitely fast forward through that. Just gross!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little funny - a lot crude","review":"A few genuinely funny moments overshadowed by too much vulgar language and crude gags. J-Lo is bright and funny, but this project seemed beneath her. Not a good moral lesson for younger family members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakin Hilarious!!","review":"You will laugh out loud! I think women and men who are close to or thinking about having a family will really appreciate this too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my faves","review":"I really liked this movie and I have watched it too many times to count still makes me LOL. JLo is a great romcom actress"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Jennifer Lopez but this movie was horrible","review":"I bought this movie and wish it was only a rental because I won't be watching it again. I absolutely love Jennifer Lopez movies so I thought I would love this one as well but there was some scenes that were so vulgar I just couldn't enjoy this movie. There was absolutely zero chemistry with her and the leading man played by Alex. Very disappointed and would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOO FUNNY!!","review":"I LOVE THIS CUTE FILM.

Nothing about statistics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good designers guide","review":"This book is very good R/C airplane designers guide.

Looking forward to next edition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More 'Aero' Than 'Practical Techniques'","review":"I bought this and Martin Simons' 'Model Aircraft Aerodynamics' at the same time, thinking that I'd have all the bases covered: Simons for aero, Lennon for construction techniques. Silly me. Why would I think a book entitled 'Practical Techniques for Building Better Models' would have anything to do with construction?The reality is that both books cover the same topic: aerodynamic design. In my opinion, the Simons book does a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACK! Why did I buy this?!?","review":"The title of this book is misleading. It should be called, \\"Model Aircraft Design for Aerospace Engineers.\\" I have read graduate computers science text books that are easier to understand. There is little, or no attempt to define the terms for a beginner or your average modeler.Before you buy this book, try to read the first and second chapter. If you understand half of what is described, then you might want to buy this book.Had there been a glossary, I would not be writing this review.

Buddhists are normally peaceful people and Tamil Tigers and people who support them like this one hate Buddhists.....Please get a life...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, boring passages about a womanizing wanderer","review":"I'm a little surprised most people praise this book. In my opinion, the writing was boring at times. I actually glanced over pages. I actually thought the main character was a disgusting, murdering, womanizer. I do see the relevance between the great contrast of good and evil, but I'd rather read Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" over again instead of reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gratest unkown book from Hesse","review":"Undoubtedly, one of the best books by Herman Hesse. The story of these two characters shows a beautiful dichotomy between a spirit hungry for experimentation and another starving for knowledge. The relationship between these two characters will stand the test of time.There is one reason he did not get 5 stars, he wrote Steppenwolf, do I need to say anything else?Enjoy this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hesse's Master Work","review":"From a writer more commonly working in shorter fiction, or at depths that require intense concentration, this book is an masterpiece of extended prose that balances depth and lyricism, scenery and thought, secular and divine. The dualities compliment the exploration of the two lives - the golden voice and the self-regarding man. But only by the names are these polarized, they could be argued to be either. As you finally leave the book you may feel expelled from a world and time more wonderful than the one you wake to, and with a closing movement as stunning as the final pages of Grapes of Wrath or Growth of the Soil, or Family Moscat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible writer!","review":"The writing style of Hermann Hesse is stunningly beautiful. His sentences are poetic, sensitive and philosophical and his message is profound. Along with Siddhartha this is the finest book I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite books","review":"I've read other Hesse books after this one including Siddhartha and The Glass Bead Game (both have been given more praise and prestige than this one) but none of Hesse's other books engrossed me the way this one has. I read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but Siddhartha's better","review":"I went into this book with higher expectations than I should have, but it was a good read nevertheless. Siddhartha is better both in philosophy and theme, but this has another perspective on finding your path. The problem arises when a novelist tries to describe art and attempts to define it with pure subjectivism. Another problem is using a priest as a philosopher of reason and logic, which is contradictory to his belief in mysticism and faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"big let down.....","review":"If I was going to be locked up for 10 years and they let me choose just one book to take with me I'd grab Siddhartha. So when I read the reviews of Narcissus&Goldmund; I couldn't wait.Now I find it hard to believe the same person wrote both books.N&G; is lacking in all respects and there is no ending - throughout the book there is a poorly defined attempt to create or illuminate a conflict (which is sloppy) and there is no resolution at the end. What an empty book. If this is Hesse's work then I wonder whom he stole Siddhartha from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a famous book purportedly dealing with the conflict between science and art. Narcissus is an austere monk striving for purity in thought and logic, while Goldmund is the artist reveling in the sensual pleasures of the world. I felt very cheated in reading this book. The book is filled with too many gratuitous descriptions of sex and the conflict of science and art is dealt too pedantically with oft-repeated, clichéd ideas. I found two novel insights in this book. One was that joy and pain can be depicted by the same lines and forms in art. The other was a description of Goldmund's feelings in a fish market and he is moved by the callousness of humanity in the face of these dying fish. It is not a new thought, but writers rarely touch this topic of the accepted human cruelty to animals that is carried on under the guise of survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hesse's finest novel","review":"Having read all of Hesse works, I find them all fascinating and profound, but none more so than Narcissus and Goldmund. This masterpiece explores the balance between living for yourself and living for others. These two characters and how they relate and understand the other is just beyond words. I first read this book in High School and over the next 20 years have re-read it many times. It never grows old as it invokes our innermost desires and failures. Do miss out on this great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The search for salvation foiled by the duality in our existence","review":"The author through Goldmund and Narcissus finds duality everywhere: \\"...either a women or a man, a wanderer or sedentary burgher...\\", \\"...either a thinker or an artist...\\". There seems to be no in between for Herman Hesse: \\"All existence seemed to be based on duality, contrast.\\" , \\"...no one could...experience freedom as well as order, combine instinct and mind.\\" This may or may not be the most valid or practical view of life but duality and contrast create tension and that's what you need for a good story. And if you are a gifted writer an appealing tale can be told about two monks struggling to resolve this eternal tension. That is what Hermann Hesse did (and much more that I have failed to mention)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Read?","review":"This book is nothing short of an all time classic read. It should be on the reading list for every school on the planet!If I'm going a tad 'over the top' it's because I love this book and feel it deals with the inner conflicts of male adolescence more eloquently than any book I've ever read.The two medievel characters, for me, represent the quest for learning and sprituality contrasted with the pleasures of the flesh and our emotional life but I see them as two sides of one person.I've read and enjoyed a number of his works but this is by far my favourite and I fail to see why it's less well known than Steppenwolf.What next after such a profoundly enjoyable experience, there can be only one choice -The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel.Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational, but you have to be ready for it!","review":"Narcissus and Goldmund is not a light read. Hesse's message isdifferent for every reader; the way it should be. The love, respectand enduring friendship of the two main characters speaks its own story; most of us are not whole beings, but need the qualities we lack in another to reach that goal. It is sad really, that each man was not complete, but beautiful that both realized what the other gave to him. I agree that the characters were arrogant and the descriptions at times lacking in vigor. Women were mere sex objects awaiting the presence of the beautiful Goldmund to satisfy their desires. This, I found to be a turn-off.The dull scenic descriptions and lack of action are purposely designed for more focus on the spiritual message. Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It might be good..if I could open it!","review":"I don't usually offer reviews but this game is frustrating me.I finally got it loaded, set my keyboard to my favorite keys and was ready to go! Well...I \\"went\\" a couple of times. Once I quit the game and then went back, it wouldn't load! I'm going to uninstall it and reinstall, just to give it one more chance.The main problem is, I just finished Clive Barkers' Undying and American McGee's Alice. These two games are excellent! I was sad when I finished. In fact...I still go back to Alice. No game can compare to the eerie, unsettling, enchantment that it offers.The bottom line is that KISS Psycho Circus is not impressing me at all. In the future I will stick with EA Games.

Imaginative setting, more monsters than you can shake a stick at, frantic pace, and KISS (sorta). However, it's so full of bugs that it becomes unplayable after a while. Even with the latest patch it crashed a lot. And yes, I made sure all my hardware drivers were up-to-date. The worst problem was the corrupted save files. I'd click to load a saved game, and my entire system would lock up. The game's official discussion forum, which appears to be gone now, was full of people saying how buggy this game is.

While the earlier books had each had at least one contribution that would justify the purchase of the book for just about any audience -- from kids reading to themselves, to parents reading to kids, or to avid comic fans of just about any genre or age, this volume is _just_ silly and will probably satisfy none of these audiences. Don't be fooled by the star billing either. Lemony Snicket's contribution is good, but certainly not up to the standards of the Unfortunate Events series. Neil Gaiman's contribution is no Coraline.

This is like writing a book for the blind, but not allowing it to be published in Braille. I have not read this book because of the above reason, but would suggest that anyone reading it wonder how accurate and helpful the information is if they can't even see far enough to make their book text to speech enabled for the very people they are professing to help.

If childen learn to print the whole alphabet at a rate faster than 40 letters per minute, they never have reading problems, as long as this is accomplished by the middle of first grade.Dyslexia is \\"the apparent inability to remember what words look like\\". The is a risk for kids who cannot mentally envision written syllables, like \\"cat\\" or \\"man\\", early on. If they don't learn by the end of first-grade, they are left with the mistaken notion that reading is a matter of \\"sounding out unknowns\\". See Adams on this for more explanation.Older dyslexics are a serious problem because, as a psychological defense mechanism, they act as if they have lost the desire to read. For them, speed-reading techniques are best, in order to break them of the habit of always trying to sound words out, rather than developing the ability to recognize and identify them, and groups of them, instantly at sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on dyslexia","review":"I wish that I'd read this book sooner. Very comprehensive description of what dyslexia is and what you as a parent can do to assist your child with learning to read.

Very detailed and the author is very knowledgeable on the subject. I will be referring to this book in the future once I complete it, I believe. So much to take in at one time. I only gave it 4 stars because I feel that there's quite a bit of repetition in the book. Possibly to make it longer, I'm not sure. But the repetition drove me crazy. I wanted to scream, I get the picture! sometimes. But otherwise the book was so good that I won't need to buy another one.

Shaywitz covers every aspect of dyslexia from the hurt and confusion a dyslexic faces to the causes of dyslexia to how to teach a dyslexic.

I ask the parents to read my report and then buy the book and meet with me after they read it. This book is a blessing!In my meetings, I specifically address why their child is having difficulty storing words in long term memory and I refer to Sally's explanation. This helps the parents understand the need for a sequential, phonics-based reading program for their child.

I picked it up and read part. I was really overwhelmed by my son's difficulties and the text is initially dense. However, it does give a great understanding of the dyslexics' brain. I loaned it out and lost it. After speaking to another parent of a dyslexic who read and reread it, I decided I needed to try it again. This time I skimmed the first section and focused on the second half which is much more about 'what to do'. Since my school system denies that dyslexia exists, and some of his ESE teachers did not seem to be accomplishing much, it was great to have this guide. It gave me the knowledge and confidence to speak to educators and others about my child and to help develop an educational plan for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive information for learning about dyslexia","review":"I learned quite a bit about dyslexia in this book. However, I almost didn't buy it simply because the title of the book portrays that dyslexia is something that is negative. There are frustrations with dyslexia, but there are also many positive qualities that people with dyslexia possess. I struggle with having this book out in my house because my daughter is proud of her learning difference, and we do not feel like dyslexia is something to overcome, rather something to embrace.

My mom had one, not the premier model, just the regular one, for almost fifteen years. I just bought this one with the special pump. I have to say that I expected it to look cheaper than the one my mom had, but I was wrong. I've noticed that after over fifteen years, they still make their products the way they used to. What surprised me the most is that they are still made in Japan. Zojirushi airpots are pricey but they are worth every penny you spend. They last longer than other airpots and keep the water hot for more hours.Update: I forgot to say that it's better to fill it all the way up or at least half of it because if you pour inside only a cup of water or coffee, it will be warm the next day, not hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zojirushi Air Pot","review":"I have been using the Zojirushi Air Pot to store hot green tea.

My only addition to the other reviews is that the pot is not designed for use with dairy or juice products. Once I saw the no dairy/no juice warning, a quick call to Zojirushi revealed that the pump mechanism may not be able to be cleaned thoroughly enough to remove traces of these easily spoiling liquids. Since I wanted to use this for hot chocolate -- as well as coffee -- this may not have been the best choice for me. Otherwise, I am thoroughly satisfied with the quality and performance of the air pot.60 Day Addendum: With only 4 uses, the pump mechanism has failed. It won't get enough suction to pull liquid up. I'll be able to replace the pump unit, but it seems like the quality isn't what I first suspected.

The lid doesn't come off, just flips up, so it's difficult to clean. The glass liner makes it fragile and he worries about transporting it over the long term. The biggest frustration is the leaking. The air pot need to remain upright at all times or hot liquid spews out everywhere. There is no seal or anything preventing the liquid from leaking. It's not a defect, but a design flaw that was overlooked for those who transport this item. If you plan on keeping the item on the counter all the time and using only hot water, then this may be the product for you.

This is an enlightening book of short stories written from the perspective of the author who actually lives in Alaska in a rural area of the tundra. Each of the stories has a different introspective message which is vetted through the eyes of someone living in this small village in Alaska.Something I appreciated more in this book than in others which were more historical that I have read is just how COLD it is up there and how difficult it must be for people to live there. The author really shows through Western-ized eyes how inspiring and amazing these communities are--it's almost like stepping back in time the way they live--except that they have snowmobiles and motorized boats. :)I really enjoyed this book even though I usually don't like short stories.

I would equate these two books with Tarantinos two films, 'Pulp Fiction' & 'Jackie Brown', the first also being a masterpiece, but the second leaving you wanting. Not that 'Jackie Brown' or 'A Place Beyond' are wastes of time, its just that compared to what came before, and the fact that they are basically the same subject matter, you expect that level of art and when you dont get it youre dissapointed as I was with this book.If youve already read 'Last Light', and still want a good book on the \\"Alaska Experience\\", im reading his latest now and let you know how it is when I finish.But if you havent read 'Last Light Breaking' and are looking for a book in this genre, waste no time in buying it, its truly an amazing book. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is not meant for timelapses","review":"Whenever I take cross country road trips, I set up my camera on a tripod in the passenger seat and have the remote shutter handy to take shots every few seconds to create a timelapse.

After 10 or so prints, I couldn't take it; there were no combination of settings that would give me an even reasonable quality print.

Of course the drain is jammed there, but that is whole point of using tool. this tool is inherently badly constructed tool.

Thanks Archos for the great product and support."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"First thing I like to mention is who pay who off. The review stated that u get 15 plus hrs of audio play. Not.... I am luck to get 8 hrs. Battery life is really sorry. I have not try placing any video on yet... I am totally disappointed in the system. Trying to sync music is adventure in itself. The system occasion freeze up for no apparent reason. It sounds good; the build in speaker system is very good. I don't feel that I will every buys an Archo product again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of flash support","review":"This product is horrible. While the wifi does work well, it doesn't support flash ... which means it is almost useless to view any video or audio format on the web (think, for example, no youtube). While the sound quality is much better than the ipod, the unit freezes up at the slightest movement. In addition, the idea that you have to pay $40 to for software updates to use most audio and video formats is just poor business. Finally, unlike the ipod, the Archos has no software to organize your music files on a pc. Rather, you have to spend hours doing it with the windows explorer...and forget about the automatic updates for podcasts. Seriously, this was a complete waste of money. For the same money, by an ipod and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER AGAIN","review":"I was glad to receive this item which I use for videos only. I feel that I was not given all the information about the product. I am surprised that Amazon would allow this to be sold without any knowledge of the product. I cannot even imagine that I can have the information about the Archos 604 because the seller erased all of that, why???who knows.

Order direct from Archos site or reputable vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Video, poor audio","review":"Got the Archos to be able to take it with me when I travel for work and have movies on my flights. The recording with the DVR station is great, but in order to hear what I recorded in a quiet room I had to have the volume turned up to 99%. Hearing the audio with any background noise is impossible. I contacted Amazon and got a replacement, that part was great, but the new one I have to have the volume up to 80% to hear anything in a quiet room. I also found the that for the jack out to TV you are required to by the archos cable as it has a different pinout than a standard cable that comes with your video camera etc. Needless to say, I will be returning the ones I have an buying another hoping it was just a bad manufacturing batch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"Shoddy hard drives, horrible customer service.

The processor is a bit slow but not so much that you can't enjoy video. One great thing about this unit over the new 605 is that the Wifi is already intalled with the accompanying software for surfing.Pros: large screen, easy interface both touch and button, good quality, metal construction lots of storage (30 gigs).Cons: a bit slow, too many plug ins and a propriatary usb cable (if you loose it your screwed unless you buy more than one or have the DVR station)Do your own research before you buy lots of resources on the net.Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Western","review":"I first saw this when it came out at the movies in the early 70's. In the beginning, the actors seemed like they were waiting to, well, act. It finally picked up after the robbery of the the train and the betrayal of Link by Gauche. Bronson and Mifume's characters are working on opposite ends at first. Mifume has seven days to get a highly important sword back and he uses Bronson to help him because Bronson knows the gang that took it. Bronson goes along, but only to get revenge. Along the way they meet with Indians and outlaws, which make for some excellent action. I don't know of another movie that brought the old west and the old east together like this. There is no comparison, not even today! The two learn to respect each other and work together. Bronson is so cool in this movie! Mifume is excellent as a samurai determined to complete his orders.

Why? This game sucks. Why? Go online to see for yourself. What about online?1) Everybody shoots 3 points and easily scores with defender's hands on player's face, almost every time.2) Everybody dunks and there is virtually no jump shot from within 3-point arc.3) Everybody blocks shots like piece of cake. It's so ridiculous you can have Yao, Shaq and Duncan block 10 times or more in a game.4) Everybody lets the computer play the defense.Conclusion: Is this a basketball game? I guess not. You can just treat every game as a 3-point shootout contest, a dunk contest, a shot-blocking race, or whatever you like. You can also simply just let the computer play for you rather than you play the computer. This is just sad. I am playing ESPN NBA 2K5 instead, which looks more like a basketball game to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that real sort of boring","review":"too boring to play. i thought the controls handle weird. i really don't like this game.the sports games from this company are starting to get boring. they use to be good. not any more.you will like this game if you:think o.j. is innocent, support bin laden, think gay marriage should be legal.

I spent a lot of time unlocking everything in the NBA Store (by playing 2 min. quarters on easy and going 20/20 from the field gets 2500 pts.). I also adjusted all the player ratings, which are completely off by the way. I couldn't believe how bad some of the players ratings were. Once I adjusted everything though, this game become VERY realistic, besides the fact it's almost impossible to run the floor on a fast break. It was the best bball game I'd ever played...until it went glitchy. I took it back to the store, and they said they've had problem with every EA 2005 sports title for PS2. I've been a loyal supporter of EA ever since they started making sports games (1992 - NHL Hockey for Sega Genesis), but now I'm very hesitant.

The few bright sides to it is 1. scoring is more challenging and therefor more realalistic and 2. is the \\"free for all\\" mini game they add where basically you and up to 3 friends each control a player of their choice against one goalie to see who can score the most goals.

For many years I have had Links 2003, but going from that to this is a huge step forward. This game takes sometime to get used to all of the controls, and also gets harder has you get on to pass the legends tour, where you play with legends such as Arnold Palmer, Ben Hogan, Seve Ballesteros, and the legendary Gary Player. While you play tournaments you win money so you can improve your equipment to the best name brands including Callaway Golf, Nike, TaylorMade, and everything else known. You also get to customize your appereance including face, nose, lips, everything. And get to pick from clothes, shoes, hats, watches, etc. This makes the game funner so you can get sponsered by different name brands if you where and use their equipment.

This is the best!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Game!","review":"I've been playing the Tiger Wood's PGA Golf Tour series since day one. I've always been satisfyde with how clever and entertaining the games have been. I would certainly reccomend buying the 2005 version.Besides the over all game-play being entirely better, there are alot more challenging goals to fulfill. It's easy even for a newcomer to play these games, since the controls are straight-forward. Making the game less work and more play.The only problem I've noticed with my 2005 copy is that the camera sometimes \\"get's out of whack\\". A quater of the time the camera loses itself when making important close shots. Making the game a little frustrating because I find myself always asking \\"Did it go in?!\\" Besides this little quirk the game still isn't ruined. The rich entertainment pouring out of it far exceeds anything. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most playable Tiger Woods game ever on ps2","review":"I had a copy of this and gave it way years ago, how times have changed!

I don't like when the main characters discover they are in love right off the bat. This one keeps the romance going, and the tension between the characters when they meet is very well done. At first, the Earl, who rescues Perdita for the purpose of using her as a 'tool' for revenge, is very unlikable, calling Perdita a slut (which he assumes she is) and he doesn't treat her as a human being. Understandably she grows to dislike his treatment of her so she chooses not to talk at all, basically to piss him off. When she does decide it's time for him to hear her talk, she doesn't tell him her past history, for fear that he would no longer give her a roof over her head.I took off a star because I thought the Earl's realization that he was in love with Perdita was a bit abrupt, and the ending made me kind of loose interest once all tension between our characters was gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better, could be worse","review":"gets the job done, matches my UpStage.. doesn't stay in the ear too well, falls out more than it stays in. i find myself holding it into my ear while using it, which kind of defeats the purpose of handsfree."},{"rating":"1","title":"bluetooth","review":"talking on it sounds like you are far away my phone customers say.

I just finished reading a much better book called \\"3-minute Ab's\\". It was much easier to understand, the exercies are eaiser to perform and the only thing that is sore after your abdominal exercise is your stomach(not your back).

Despite the pictures used in the advertising, it doesn't work well for hot dogs, hamburgers, or steak - a ten dollar charcoal pan will produce a taster meal, be easier to clean up, easier to store, and cost way less money. This works better if you buy the wire grates and use it like a gas stove.It's heavy, setup and teardown are not that easy and are best done with two people - it has a tendency to collapse into a noisy heap during setup/teardown or if you try to move it after set up since the legs don't lock in to place when it's raised. The lid doesn't lock down either - there is a latch but it is so loose it flops back and forth.A sharp looking grill, but my old Colman two burner camp stove and folding camp cook table are more useful, easier to set up, and easier stow."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT REALLY WORKS","review":"This little grill fired up right out the box.

THESE NEED TO BE RECALLED","review":"I purchased this grille on 4/09/2012 and finally got a chance to use it on 5/16/2012 (AFTER AMAZON'S LOUSY RETURN WINDOW for this item). When I assembled it and tried to fire it up, only one of the piezo's would light the burner, checked all gaps and they were correct, turns out the one burner was NOT grounded. Upon further inspection 3 rivets were missing and one broken off of the underside framework. This unit on LOW will char hamburger patties in a minute and the patties in the center of the grille will hardly cook at all. The grille's are impossible to clean and if they are ceramic coated I couldn't find any. IMHO Coleman is riding their name to the max as this thing is only fit for the scrap pile.

Standing up the grill for use and then collapsing it after use is awkward- you can't see what you're doing and, again, it is fairly heavy. The worst part of this grill is cleaning it.

The top's locking mechanism is idiotic, when you fold it up to transport it, and lift the handle to move it, the lock pin falls into the open position so the grates fall out of it. So, unless you like a little grit in your burgers, you have to carry the stupid thing, which defeats the whole purpose of it having wheels. Another disadvantage with that lock pin, it's not only put on backwards, it's so cheap, that even laying flat in trunk, it comes undone, and the grates hop halfway out, and the cheap tin top will smash itself out of shape on the grates. I got three uses out of this grill, and I'm throwing it away. I could've taken the wife out for lobster dinner three times, and had money left over, had I not wasted it on something with Coleman's name on it.

Food that is high in fat like chicken or foods that are delicate like salmon, or small like kabobs get scorched within 60 seconds on this grill. Either thick steaks or indirect heating is all that it is good for. If I keep one burner off and use the other on medium, the cooking time seems to match a larger grill, but then the grilled flavor is also diminished with indirect cooking. The gas canisters seem to last long, which is another good feature.In summary, while I won't dump this grill and get a different one (cost prohibitive), I will not buy the same brand when it comes time for replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Bought this to take to football tailgates, and it did not disappoint.

It is sturdy and folds up and down with all the ease mentioned in the other reviews.However, it cooks to fast even on low heat. I believe it is because the grill plate sits to close to the flame.

I then tried to move it, however, and found that I can not latch the lid closed if the grates are in the stove, so I have to remove the grates each time I want to move or store the grill. This was a pain while camping since the grates were a mess, and I did not want to take them out until I got home (or pack them in the car while they were greasy).My friend's LXE does not have this problem, but when I called Coleman, they informed me that this is as designed, and it should not latch if the grates are in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Clean.

It's annoyingly heavy and awkward and large to transport. But what's worse is it's an absolute pain to clean. Basically your option is either to spend as much time cleaning it as you do cooking on it, or having rusty grates and grease fires. The grates fall off if you stand it too up right while transporting. The lid lock is lousy, the heavy grates fell on my foot. There is no low temp on this grill. It's way too hot. Cooking is extremely uneven. Cooking sausages on this thing is impossible. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressed - Coleman road trip grill","review":"I've been quite impressed with this grill. I've had it for a few month now and the cooking power is strong, very hot and cooks everything thoroughly with no cool spots at all. Easy to clean and compact. For a full grill of food, uses about 1/2 a tank of the small coleman type fuel to cook completely. Cook time is the same if not shorter than a larger, standard grill. Only downfall is it's klunky to move once you have it setup as you really have to watch holding the legs. If you are not moving it once you get it setup, no problems at all... very sturdy. I would highly recommend if your looking for a very good quality mobile (or even a stay put) grill."},{"rating":"2","title":"road trip grill LXE","review":"Upgrade from my previous coleman grill.

Unfolding the grill takes about 2 seconds...your grandma could do it.Now, my one negative, I would actually prefer if it was a touch smaller. I couldn't fit the grill horizontally in my Mazda 3.

'La mer' sounds great in this recording, but I was shocked when I listened to the two Respighi pieces. In particular, the 'Pines of Rome' sounds amazing. I've heard the piece before, but not like this. The CSO brass plays it with an unheard of level of precision and splendor. If you like this piece, definitely pick up this CD; you won't regret it. In addition, the sound quality itself is pretty impressive for a recording made 40 years ago on analog equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Bought this for my Dish Network setup after tragedy struck the original.

To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. Hefner is still one of my favorite bands, although they have since disbanded, no pun intended, okay maybe a little.Every song on this cd is memorable, meaningful, and heartfelt. The singer may not have the best voice, in fact some may say he has a terrible voice, but it's very distinct, which in many ways makes it more enjoyable and leaves a lasting impression on the listener.It's hard to pick a favorite track, as each song is catchy and original. This cd has a very raw quality to it that really adds to the melancholy mood displayed throughout. If I had to compare Hefner to another band, I'd say they're an English version of early Weezer stuff. If you like indy rock you'll love Hefner. Check them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fidelity Wars","review":"I bought this CD without knowing who Hefner was, taking a gamble on it really I guess.

It makes me think of the 8\\" chef's knife made into a 6\\" knife. It's great for trimming the fat off a tri-tip roast and is easier to handle than the 8\\" chef's knife while doing this task.

He seems to yelling out a slogan \\"Destroy the Sikhs in any way possible\\" under biased Mc Loed's flagship. The lack of faith in the Divine Living Guru Sri Guru Granth Sahib is thoroughly visible through Gurinder Singh Mann's work. This book is a crime against the Sikhs and the religion. How low one can anyone go to hurt Sikh belief is unimaginable.

The author purposes that Goindval Pothis are the source of Guru Granth Sahib which is an incorrect statement. Prof. Sahib Singh, a renowned Sikh scholar, refuted such propositions almost 100 years ago. Maan, Pashaura, Harjot etc all are twisting facts and intentionally writing to mislead the readers. Many Sikh scholars have refuted Maan's book and his foolish baseless opinions. I would recommend staying away from such writers who call themselves \\"Sikh scholars\\" and get their degrees from a Christian missionary (Mcleod). These people have no clue about what facts are and Sikhism is all about.

The book can be found online at [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research based on unauthentic manuscript","review":"The work is pooly researched and based on an unauthentic manuscript, which the author refers to as the Goindval Pothis. Before selecting and basing one's thesis on a primary source, it behooves a scholar to ensure that it is authentic. Gurinder Mann has failed to do so. Scholarly analysis, _Early Sikh Scriptural Tradition: Myth and Reality_, by Balwant Singh Dhillon (Amritsar: Singh Brothers, 1999) shows that Gurinder Mann's _The Goindval Pothis_ and subsequent works are highly problematic. They are based on his pooly written PhD thesis. Dhillon's aforementioned work is a definitive refutation of all of Gurinder Mann's research. Save your money and purchase Dhillon's work which provides a much better understanding of the Sikh cannon and also gives insight into work by fading scholars such as Gurinder Mann."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story of 60s Campus Life","review":"I first read this book when it came out about 7 years ago & am just now getting around to reviewing it.

Then there was the woman's brother who was an officer in the local police department who reportedly said he would protect his sister at all costs. And then there were missing documents...

I still use it and like it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big for Small Ears","review":"This work well, however they are still too big for my ears. One inevitably keeps popping out, which makes it difficult to keep it on my head. The sound quality and everything else is great, I just wish the ear buds were smaller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short lifespan","review":"Buy a couple of lattes instead. These don't last beyond a few wearings. Not much money, but other cheap ones have lasted longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Debris","review":"Fairly disappointed. I was expecting much more from it. Basically, it's about a guy driving around showing debris (sometimes driving up and down the *same* street!). Very irritating \\"soundtrack.\\" Could have been summed up in 2-5 mins. I didn't rate it a 1 because it did provide one of the things I wanted - images of the devastation. Otherwise, it would have been a \\"0\\" or a \\"1\\" tops. Good intentions, but pretty bad execution. Sorry... I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best calendar I bought last year","review":"I bought about 25 different calendars as gifts last year. This was the funniest and best received of them all. If 2004 is anything like 2003's was, it will bring a smile to your face every single day! I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lament","review":"Only one small change graces this release from the one just before it (EASY LIVING, Contemporary; 1985), his comeback album after many years off the scene, and that's Buster Williams on bass. Williams has a beautiful ringing tone that offers excellent support as well as handsome solo spots. CEORA is a Lee Morgan tune that gets a tender treatment here. PERDIDO is a bit of a surprise and HALF NELSON, a Miles Davis composition, is right up Morgan's Bird-lined alley. The only disappointment is LAMENT, which is taken too slow and feels draggy. Frank Morgan fans will find much to like on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"X Files Strategy Guide","review":"This is an excellent guide. I would not have finished the game without it. It gives detailed instructions on what to do. It made the game alot less frustrating and alot more fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book for help.","review":"This is a great book for The X-Files: The Game. It has everything you'll need to know about the game plus funny messages, a section that explains the little things you don't understand, a picture gallery, an interview with the director of the game, and a quick walkthrough for agents on the run.The only thing I didn't like about it was the small nit I found that made me have to hesitate to go on with the game. I would greatly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the romance?","review":"This is another of those books that I could not finish. Incredibly stupid plot and poorly devloped characters. If you are reading romance novels for romance (which would be the logical idea), you will not find it in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I am really not into buying books by authors I have not read before, so I took a chance with this one. Boy, was I glad I did! This book was amazing, and the characters are wonderful. The story didn't drag out and you could feel the love Tristan and Haith shared. I will be reading from this author in the future. I know Heather Grothaus will be on my favs. list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking ,amazing , It's the new Feeder Album!","review":"This new album by Feeder is breathtaking. With brillant traks such as Paperfaces, Insomnia, Day in Day out , Radioman. Every track is a hit. Feeder have come along way since there first album Polythene. These guys are great musicians. This new feeder album is a must get for Christmass. This album beats all albums so far this year. It even beats Macey Gray. It is a shame feeder are not signed to a bigger label. Feeder are signed to Echo which are a small label compared to the likes of Island etc. Feeder deserve so much more recognition than the likes of Oasis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly disappointing","review":"After being thouroghly impressed with \\"Polythene\\", I was slightly disappointed that this album was not an improvement on the first. Thanks to the title track, \\"Tinsel Town\\", \\"So Well\\" and high energetic bursts like \\"Insomnia\\" and \\"You're my Everergreen\\" the album is great for the most part. Songs like \\"Radioman\\", \\"Day in, Day out\\" and \\"Dry\\", however, slacken the pace and although these songs are good, they lack the Feeder magic that populated their previous outing. This is still a great album, but with \\"Polythene\\" before it, I had come to regard Feeder as something quite special."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"This one of the best albums I've heard. My least favourite track is Tinsel Town but even thats not bad. Paperfaces is just an amazing emotional song and probably worth buying the CD for alone. Theres also some brilliant pumping rock songs such as Insomnia, Waiting for changes and Hole in my head. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than amazing","review":"This is gonna be breif..coz theres not much to say.. its an amazing album....the best of all their album's to me..!

I really love Robert Young and Billy Grey - they make the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Glasswrights Test","review":"Got the book for a cousin who was missing it from her collection. Came in good condition. Really happy with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pity","review":"Although this is a strong series, and the world is well-developed, this was a disappointing entry. The characterization seems to have slipped a little, and the plot is degenerating to the point that it's starting to feel like a soap opera.Klasky can do better; I'll probably read the next one (assuming there is a next one) only because she raised a couple of questions in this book that I'd like to see answered. After that, if the writing, plotting and characterization don't improve I'll probaby wave this series goodbye."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine read aloud or reader for ages 9-12","review":"This classic children's book is about Toby, a gifted student who moves from Manhattan to a small town and has trouble getting along with the other kids. He's socially awkward and, while he's smart, he's not particularly good at baseball or bike riding -- things his new classmates seem to value more highly than smarts. Toby is made fun of several times and so he first tries to get along but then decides to get revenge! This leads to an adventure in which he and three other boys must ultimately work together to make it through one adventurous, spooky night spent in the town's \\"haunted\\" house.The author is a fine writer -- dialogue is realistic and metaphors and interesting language abound. With short chapters, this is a great read aloud book or even a solo reader for kids in the 4th grade age range."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic for all kids!","review":"I first heard of this book when I was in fourth grade and our teacher read it to us about 25 years ago. At the time, it was just called Toby. When I grew up and had children of my own, I searched high and low for a copy. I thought I would never find one, but I did...and I couldn't be happier. My oldest son has read it, and I look forward to reading it with my youngest son when he reaches that age. I think it is a book that every school library should have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PureAyre is just food-grade hydrogen peroxide with vinegar. Don't believe the hype.","review":"The PureAyre formula is a mix of vinegar and food-grade hydrogen peroxide. He added minty botanicals for the slight fragrance. Spread the word.The reason he can spray it into his mouth and body is because he is using food-grade hydrogen peroxide that is heavily diluted.This is not an assumption, this is fact. I know the formula. You can achieve the same effects by using Hydrogen Peroxide to break up the molecules and remove the odors."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK","review":"I had to give this product a 1 star to rate. I don't feel that it should receive that. The product is the biggest waste of money I have ever seen, does not work for cat urine. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this. It's cheap and doesn't offer much protection","review":"The way this case is built it should be priced at $9.99, and it still would be a rip off. Look elsewhere, because the build quality is terrible and it's not worth the money. Typical bottom of the barrel cheap chinese junk here using the lowest quality stuff they can find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love The Case but ...","review":"Bought the dual transmitter case. Love the case but the hinges do not allow the top to fold all the way down placing stress on the bottom. After 20 or so uses, the rivets are coming loose. Light weight and made to hold a Spektrum transmitter and small amount of supplies and tools. Love the case so I will take it to a music store that repairs guitar cases to have them replace the hinges so the top folds all the way down. Will update you when I get the work done. Remember \\"A nose heavy plane flies poorly. A tail heavy plane flies once\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spektrum logo indeed","review":"When I bought this case, I had made the assumption that it was made out of aluminum. It is not. The main body seems to be made out of fiber board. The corners are made out of some sort of metal though. The handle feels kind of flimsy. The overall quality is not as good as expected for the price paid but I'm keeping it because it was a gift. And probably the most important thing to keep in mind is that it does a great job of keeping my DX8 safe and secure with extra room for trainer cable, charger and electronic components."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Rug!","review":"I love the rug! It fits perfectly with my room's color scheme! And it's so plush! It really makes my room!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actual colors are horrible!","review":"The rug looks bright and cheery online, and I was excited to put in our upstairs hallway as a light and airy runner. However, the colors you see online are not at all what you actually will get. The pretty yellow is actually a mustard color, and the green is almost neon. It is more than a little awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was terrible and the packaging was misleading","review":"They are extremely old episodes where Emma Peel( pictured on the cover of the dvd) never appeared on it at all. Watching the start of the episodes made you think that John Steed was going to appear in at least on the lost episodes, but that never happened. So why buy it? I thought that they are lost episodes of the male/female duo. big disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it . . .","review":"I wanted to read these short stories and fall in love with each and every one. I just felt like something was lacking. I find it to be mundane and near poorly written. I hate the simplistic descriptions, there's no artistic quality to it, which makes it seem like any one could've written this piece of nothing. The stories are interesting but they lack something that cannot be fingered. I'm sorry I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I love this collection of previously unreleased material for a number of reasons. First, there's evidence of a fine rock band here that had it given the chance of directing its own future would have went all the way to the top. Secondly, because there is more of all the band's influences on this album than on their released material. Thirdly, the track 'My Love For You' is absolutely AOR at its best. Rock on lads."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great summer read","review":"So maybe it is because I finished this book on the beaches of Long Island that I was so pleased with it, but the fact remains that the author does an incredible job of painting the picture of Amagansett in the 40s. The character development and scenic descriptions are incredible. Once you get past the first 40-50 pages, you get most of the names straight and it is smooth sailing after that. A very good story, well told. A much better read than Atonement."},{"rating":"1","title":"an okay phone","review":"This phone worked well for the first few months, but then the hand set went dead. The answering machine works but there is no way to access the menu with out the hand set. so now i have to buy batteries for the hand set. all in all its not a bad deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, battery died prematurely; battery no longer made","review":"I bought this phone for Christmas of 2000; it gave a good performance until very recently. Sound was good on it, no echo, no static. However, exactly six months after purchase, the battery died and I've been informed that the battery is no longer made. There is no reason that the battery should have died this early, as we always kept the handset on the charge cradle. I'm glad this phone didn't cost much or I would be pretty mad about the 6-month life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phone for the Price","review":"I wasn't expecting much when I bought this phone since price was my main consideration. But I have been pleasently surprised. The phone is sleek, clear sound, has a good range, and holds a nice charge. The volume settings are perfect. The Loudest setting actually is LOUD! When I go outside while on the phone, I have yet to hear static. Great phone for the price! I'd buy one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product","review":"I purchased the VTech 9108 primarily for its affordability, easy to use features, its sleek styling, and its light weight. Unfortunately, after about a month of use in a single person household (i.e. I don't have kids and I never dropped it!), static during calls increased, along with odd clicking sounds. Progressively, the phone has worsened so that the channel changer does not have any effect. I overhear other people's calls frequently, and the static increases so significantly after about 7 minutes of talk time (something in the phone wiring must be heating up after a certain amount of use), I can't even hear the other person. The warranty which requires one to send the product back insured, followed by weeks of waiting for the company to decide whether to fix the phone or send you a new one isn't really worth the effort and the fact that one has to get a new phone anyhow during the wait. Very disappointing phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Head","review":"Purchased This head recently to replace a stock standard Pearl Pro-Tone Snare Resonant head- Improves the sound of the Snare so much, worth every cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference for NNP school too!","review":"Just to share that I have, over the years, used this book to look up, reference, review,...just about anything you can think of from general reference to the RNC and now for NNP school. This book covers a variety of topics, even now that it is \\"older\\" it still has its place for use. And now for the price, it is definitely a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's not 'Heads'","review":"not as much for the little one to do. There are however a lot more shiny parts and it is smaller, for better or worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book, but keep some clear packing tape around","review":"We have a set of 3 books by this author: Alphabet, Heads and Tails. My one-year-old son loves all of them, and he has enjoyed them since he was about 9 months old. Though we have many many books, he frequently will point out one of these books to read. I like Tails best because it is a bit sturdier than the other two. That said, one day as he was flipping through the book by himself, he managed to pluck off one of the foxes' tails with more ease than I expected. Fortunately, I was able to repair the page with a little clear packing tape. I'm sure my days are numbered before the other fox or the pig suffer a similar fate. However, my son loves these books so much that a little repair work here and there is worth it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as Heads","review":"The title says it all.

Just keep an eye on it...","review":"My 1 1/2 year old daughter recieved this as a gift and she loves it! There are many things to touch and pull. (Two wagging tails and one that pulls up to reveal new things)I will warn you that I have had to patch this books twice.The first time was for the pull up tab. She managed to rip half of it out of the book. The pages are not cheap and flimsy... my husband was \\"watching\\" her at the time and she had the time to sit and really yank on it a few good times. And since she was only pulling on one side... Well... It was a quick and easy fix.The other patch job, is actually mentioned by another person here. The pig's swatting tail... she ripped the poof off and I managed to find it two days later.This is a great book that any child would love! :) Just be sure to keep an eye on her while she's playing with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever for Toddlers","review":"Perfect gift for first birthdays!

Can hardly wait for Christmas to give it to her after seeing it and the \\"Heads\\" book I also ordered.Showed the books to her parents and another friend.

My daughter loved it so much to the point where I had to read this book to her more than ten times a day for a few days at one point. The words flow very nicely - easy for little readers to remember. Nowadays, my now 29 months old daughter has the entire book totally memorized and reads it out loud by herself a few times a week. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner from Van Fleet!","review":"Great spin on the \\"Heads\\" version. Lots of fun actions throughout the book. My daughter loves the shiny, crinkly dots on the peacock tail. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for children","review":"This book is great for all children-it has \\"touch and feel\\" items, as well as lift flaps, etc-it even has a scratch and sniff! Great way to learn about different types of animals and how different they can be. I bought it for my daughter, although she doesn't have any interest yet, since she's only 2 months old. Even my older niece and nephew (13 & 10) like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"tails is a great tale","review":"My 18 month old can not put this book down. Not only is there a lot to touch and feel, but there are flaps to open and tabs to pull and lots of colors. If your toddler likes animals, they will love this book. It is also made of very sturdy material, so unlike most flap and tab books, my daughter has not been able to rip off all the peices. A great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for toddlers!","review":"My son loved this book so much, I now give it as a gift to anyone turning one. I have yet to meet a toddler who doesn't like it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because over time the pictures can get ripped. Overall, well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 1 yr old's favorite book!","review":"My 1 year old LOVES this book. It's his absolute favorite. I have to read it to him before bed every night or he won't go to sleep. He won't let me read anything else to him. I have to by another one because he ripped off the pig's and fox's tails. Everytime he gets to the skunk he says \\"pee yooo\\" and waves his hand.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST","review":"My son loves this book SO much he's totally destroyed it since getting it for his 1 year old birthday. I'm ordering a new copy today, plus one for my niece and a friend's baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read, Even for the \\"Big\\" Kids...","review":"This book has it all, a topic that entralls children, engaging text, lively drawings, moveable parts and textures that range from bumpy to spiney. The drawings are a story unto themselves, and are likely to appeal to adults as well as children. While this book is marketed for pre-schoolers, a dramatic reading can have third graders rolling off their chairs laughing.The warning in a previous review about the pungent odor of the scratch 'n sniff sticker is accurate. Scratch 'n sniff at your own risk. It stinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our rating . . . Two tails up!","review":"I purchased this book for my son when he was 9 mounths old. He is almost a year old now and he loves it. The big smile that lights up his face when I hold up this book is evidence of this book's worth. His favorite pages are those with action - the pig's tail swats and the foxes tails wag!I think I might just buy another one just to have it in reserve, he's a bit rough on the book, but it's stood up well so far.Tails lets the baby become involved in the reading process. We love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educators Recommend","review":"Toddlers love Tails ! At least that was our experience when we brought this fun, interactive book into a Head Start classroom. As its name implies, this is a book about various types of tails-from tiger tails to pig tails.Each double page features something to touch (a shiny blue peacock tail), manipulate (a wagging fox tale), or smell (a skunk tail). The final two pages picture each of the creatures the reader has met throughout the book and allows them to count from one to ten.Included are: foxes, pandas, pangolins, weasels, chipmunks, alligators, and tamarins, as well as the previously mentioned tigers and pigs.The book itself is brilliantly designed and engineered. The covers are thick hardboard. The interior pages are heavy and sturdy and will hold up to repeated readings. We suggest that you buy several for your classroom-its that good.Tails receives our highest recommendation.Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son Loves It!!","review":"My mother-in-law bought this book for my son last week. He absolutely loves it! He is 21 months old. He wants this book read to him several times a day and he is getting really good at identifying the animals and doing all of the \\"tricks\\" himself.

This was pretty much a waste of time, money and emotion. If the authors purpose was to see how many times he could invoke the vision of Algerians as crude, evil and heartless, I guess he was successful for whatever reasons. Looking for a ray of light in an otherwise grim tale, not in this book. The blurb writer on the book jacket makes polygraphs for blurb writers seem attractive. The constant repetition of Middle Eastern profanity was almost laughable, but did add to the word and page count. I don't even want to recycle it at our local used book sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun","review":"This is a fun CD.

This one was hard to understand and I consider myself well versed in the art of candle work. I didn't learn anything new from this book and I didn't like the spells. This is only my opinion. Check out \\"The Little Book of Candle Magic\\" by D.J. Conway. So much information in a tiny book. Or \\" Practical Candle Burning Rituals\\" by Buckland. Once again - I have nothing against this author, I just thought this particular book was not particularly informative. Blessed Be... Kari Belle"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Complicated","review":"I of course tried Buckland's Practical Candle Magick with success and was curious I got this but advanced does mean advanced. I agree with one other review- dress the candles? Where I live in the Twin Ports area who can get stuff like candles and incense and also pentagram amulets, etc at local stores even something like Wal Mart had roly poly votive holders the same ones as seen on online occult shops. I haven't tried any of these yet. A lot of where the advanced part comes in a lot of this stuff is hard to get and pricey- like a crystal ball those are usually at least 50 bucks. Not as well suited for younger audiences who rely mostly on money from parents plus whatever they get these odd jobs here and there like mowing lawns or babysitting but still barely anything like 20 bucks. Overall, I would still say this is worth getting but a little on the tacky side with some unintentional humor with the drawings.

Unfortunately, both she and I have received more teasing than I expected. The doll does indeed wear what appears to look like a thong. This is something to which today's teenagers have become accustomed but I still find it inappropriate for younger children. My family could not help but tease me for buying something so inappropriate but my niece took it personally. She called in tears saying, \\"my doll has a thong!\\" Needless to say, I never wanted to hear my sweet niece say the word thong. Now for her birthday I have been instructed to find pants or a diaper for her doll. I don't think this diminishes the quality of the doll for older kids but I want those buying the doll for younger kids to know before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross and Disturbing","review":"Why would I want my \\"baby\\" doll to appear older than me?

Looking at other laser mice, noticed that this laser sensor is considerably higher off of the table surface that most other laser mice. Maybe this is a design flaw that causes this wandering.

Unfortunately, I think that some issues with graphics come into play that aren't exactly the game's fault...i.e., this game doesn't look good on the PS2.

I suggest that you should buy College Hoops 2K5 instead. These are the reasons why:1. You can only edit the names of 325 players in the game. That's only 27 teams that you can completely edit! This really takes away from the game if you can't name all the players you want to.2. The computer's defense recovers too quickly when you force a turnover, making fast breaks nearly impossible to get.3. The graphics are not up to par in this game and are nothing compared to ESPN College Hoops 2K5. It's time for EA to update their graphics for their college games.4. The discipline system for dynasty mode has an insane amount of players getting in trouble. This is even more of a problem in this game than it was in NCAA Football 2005.5. The game is basically NBA Live with college teams. There's no difference between the 2 games, gameplay wise.6. College Hoops 2k5 is $20 cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"adequate at best","review":"I will admit that I bought the silver version of this phone/answering machine because it looked pretty. However, its performance is another story. There is a low but audible buzz coming from the unit that can be heard as background noise in my greeting. When I called my sister from this phone, she said she couldn't hear me as well as usual and that my voice sounded a little choppy, almost digitized (although I could hear her perfectly). I find it disconcerting to use the phone because when I speak, my voice is amplified in the earpiece; but when I pause in between sentences, it sounds like the line has gone dead. On the positive side, the unit is easy to operate and has some nice features like message retrieval from the handset. The sound quality of incoming messages is much improved over my standalone GE answering machine. The range of the phone seems pretty good and the unit takes up minimal space. But overall, I would not recommend this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life span, no customer service","review":"The life span of the battery and the charger itself is short. I purchased one of these, lasted 3 mo. The retailer replaced it for us (even though they didn't have to) and the replacement lasted only a few months more before the battery died. We replaced the battery (BYW, we followed instructions on charging & battery maintaince to the letter) only to have the battery charger in the base die. Calls to customer service were fruitless. Automated 800 number had no option for troubleshooting our problem and referred us to a toll number (317 AC) that had the exact options as the 800 no. No option of talking to an actual person. You should know that GE doesn't make its own phones but subs manufacture out to a company called Thomson Electronics. There is no phone no. given to call GE directly, I guess because its your problem not theirs, or web site reference for either GE or Thomson.

This is not a matter of wear and tear because we hardly ever used the redial button.Another design flaw: if you scroll through the caller ID list and then press \\"dial\\" for a long-distance call, the call fails because the phone isn't smart enough to put \\"1\\" before the 10-digit number!

When it came, upon my first listen, I was a little disappointed. I now have to say, I've changed my opinion. I believe this her best album since \\"Red Hot R&B\\" in 1987. Although not as cohesive as, say, \\"The Force Behind the Power\\" (1991) Diana manages to grab and hold your attention on nearly every track. Her voice has never been more clear(\\"He Lives in You\\") confident(\\"Carry On\\") or moving(\\"Someone That You Loved Before\\"). Although I still think that \\"Gone\\", off TMH is still her best 90's ballad. This album is just an incredible display of her talent. Motown REALLY dropped the ball with this one. Fortunately, their abuse hasn't discouraged Diana from continuing, but how much more of this can she take?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Day is a Another Day for Diana to Try Again!","review":"As a tremendous fan of Diana Ross, I was once again disappointed with her latest effort, Every Day is A New Day. While the writing is pretty good and Diana is in fine voice, her material simply is not worthy of her talent. She needs to find a strong producer who will pull the performance out of her and maybe a new label. Motown is not giving her the promotion and material she needs at this point in her career.

Its is all lost with this depressingly dreadful album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boss can do better","review":"Giving this one 5 stars just because it's Diana Ross is like having a friend who never tells you you're wrong because he's your friend - there is more harm done than good. From the Supremes to the early 70's, there is massive evidence that Diana Ross has the means to deliver much better than this set of mediocre compositions.

It is antihistamine, one that makes you drowsy and wish for a new day. This collection of groggy tunes doesn't have the power of her old ballads and the chorus sings for her, she is not even trying! The only ray of light in this cloudy musical disappointment is the remix of \\"Until We meet Again\\" with a good marketing and a EXCELLENT video she can have a smash hit and perhaps make her think about what works and what does not in this current market.I think a mix of \\"Every Day..\\" would help big time.

With a name worthy of Diva status, an instantly recognizable, glorious voice and clout beyond clout this album was poised to be a smash hit. Instead, we get an album of half baked, mediocre slush. The opening track shows some promise, but after that its all down hill. A few more up tempo songs (come on, Diana you know a good disco groove when you hear one!), some better writing and a team of hot producers and this album would be great.

She sounds more committed, serious and mature on this material than she has in a long time. That's a step in the right direction, and a smart one, but I wish there were a couple more uptempo numbers to balance the slower ones. It's a great CD, and the performances are generally good, but her performance on Carry On begs the question, \\"If she can sing like that on one track, why not on others?\\" She seems to reserve really strong performances for once in a while tracks like \\"The Boss\\", \\"One More Chance\\", \\"Swept Away\\" and \\"Tell Mama\\". I honestly didn't believe she could sing this well and soulfully anymore, but she can. So can we dispense with just a little of the sultry cooing and get a little more of this truly inspired singing? Grievances aside, I consider this CD one of her absolute best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice change. Hopefully a comeback.

This is my all time favorite DIANA ROSS song.Ross has gotten much better with age. Her nasal high pitched tone has been replaced with pure perfection.

The forceful dance tune \\"Until We Meet Again\\" is a sure fire hit if the public gives it a chance. The amazing \\"Love Is All That Matters\\" is written by Diane Warren. Warren is responsibe for writing such hits as \\"Because You Loved Me\\", \\"Unbreak My Heart\\", and \\"How Am I Supposed To Live Without You\\". This song is also one of the themes to the Brandy and Diana movie, \\"Double Platinum\\"!Diana once sang \\"The Boss\\" in 1979 and it is another example that times doesn't change EVERYTHING! Diana is still THE BOSS!Cory"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM - DITCH MOTOWN","review":"I picked up this album as an \\"import\\" and it has yet to be released in the UK. Motown appear to have ignored it in the USA which is a shame - there are some strong tracks to promote. Let's hope that EMI do a better job when it finally appears here. The best track is not even mentioned on the cover! \\"Until We Meet Again\\" (dance remix) just calls out to be released as a single - it could clean up in the clubs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana could do much better","review":"Diana needs to get a producer to put her back on track. This entire album needs to be remixed!! Only the Hex Hector remixes of \\"Until We Meet Again\\" display the standard Diana used to have. This collection will not be jump-starting her career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diana Ross Tries Again","review":"Whenever there is a new Diana Ross album, there is always a flurry of publicity around it, and this effort is no different except that it doesn't quite warrant all the hoopla. Ms. Ross has once again tried to be hip and trendy with her music rather than thoughtful about it. She scores best on tracks like SOMEONE THAT YOU LOVED BEFORE and UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN while NOT OVER YOU YET is also a decent entry but surprisingly sounds like it doesn't belong on this album. Ms. Ross could indeed return to the top of her craft if she went back to being the Diana of the seventies and early eighties and stopped trying to emulate Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and even Macy Gray. So while EVERY DAY IS A NEW DAY is not a bad album, it is a dull one and Ms. Ross's fans will be happy with it if only for its presence in the pop world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly dissapointing entry by a great talent","review":"This is a distressingly dull set of cookie-cutter songs that are enlivened only with Ross' clear and supple vocals. The album starts out promisingly with the arresting \\"He Lives in You,\\" complete with tribal back-up vocals. The rest of the album sags, until the interesting \\"Hope Is an Open Window.\\" These two very good songs are lost, however in the rest of the album, which is basically a collection of filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP!!!!!","review":"WHEN DIANA ROSS PERFORMED ON THE MOTOWN SPECIAL AND ASK SOMEBODY HELP ME, NO ONE HAS DONE IT YET. THIS ALBUM IS LIKE THE WORST. THE SONGS WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER, IF SOMEONE WITH A VOICE LIKE PATTI LABELLE OR NATALIE COLE HAD DONE THEM. MS. ROSS YOU ARE A GREAT ACTRESS AND YOU REALLY SHOULD STICK TO ACTING. DIANA HAS NEVER BEEN A GREAT SINGER AND AFTER YOU HEAR THIS ALBUM YOU WILL SEE THE VOICE HAS BECOME WEAKER THAN WHAT IT ALREADY WAS. I RECOMMEND DONNA SUMMER'S \\"LIVE AND MORE ENCORE\\" AND NATALIE COLE'S \\"SNOWFALL ON THE SAHARA.\\" THESE TWO LADIES ARE REAL SINGERS."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHER, PLEEEEEEEEEEZ SAVE MISS ROSS!!!!!!","review":"This is the last album ever made by Diana of new material,and the worst. The songs are dull, boring and unmemorable.What ever happened to Diana Ross of \\"Upside Down\\" and \\"The Boss\\"??? While CHER is still burning up the charts and theclub scene at 56, and she still shines like a grand diva should,once you get out of rehab Miss Has-Been Ross, think of allthe damage you have done, all the people you have hurt overthe years, and you better come up with something to regainyour fans and your career. This last album, and the fake Supremesreunion didnt do it.Dont get me wrong, Diana is a great talent and legend, but maybe that was the Diana Ross of many, many, many YEARS ago.Dont waste your money on this one....mine has been collecting dust for over 3 years now, i dont even know where it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every other album was a better album.","review":"This is a monotonous album in its own nature.

Her voice is simply beautiful ! All of her songs are filled with such emotion. As always. Diana's performance is simply the best! No other artist is close to her!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The brilliance of Diana Ross","review":"My collection of Diana Ross music is extensive. Yes the RCA years were more pop than soul, but her latest recording of \\"Every Day Is A New Day\\" is an examlpe of great music performed by a legendary artist. I especially enjoy listening to the third track(Until We Meet Again). Since the summer tour--RTL was canceled before it reached the MCI Center, in Washington, DC. This new cd has helped to to deal with my disappointment. In addition, there is the eight track (Sugarfree)which is produced by Chuckii Booker. I would be remiss if I didn't nention track number ten (Hope Is An Open Window), the use of the literary work of Sonia Sanchez brings both a power and depth to this song. I for one do not need radio to tell me what is good music. Diana's latest video has never been played on BET (except when she received her star). Do yourself a favor, put on track number eleven and CARRY ON."},{"rating":"2","title":"huge diana ross fan","review":"Diana Ross returns to her roots on this one and has never sounded better! One would have thought this would put her back where she belonged - at the top! By far her most stunning work in years giving us a hint of the old Motown days. The breathy,seamless quality in her voice to which she usually sounds best on are complimented on tracks such as Not Over You yet, so they say and until we meet again whilst there are great,funky,r n B tracks such as the album title,Got To be free and carry On.A winner! Highly recommended and one of the best in Ross' seemingly never ending catologue."},{"rating":"2","title":"a soulful album","review":"A nice soulful album, good voice, production and arrangements. Why the hell is miss Ross still working for Motown. Please leave Motown asap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another letdown","review":"I keep buying her latest and always get letdown. She no longer sings with any energy, just breathy and syrupy. She needs to let someone else do the producing and get a vocal coach. Don't buy this one, just maybe the maxi-singles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Fresh and Alive","review":"It takes a few listens to appreciate the CD, but Diana still sounds great and her selection of songs is eclectic but it works. Highlights are Love is All That Matters, He Lives in You and the remix (and hidden bonus) of Until We Meet Again. Definitely worth every cent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this happening now of all times?","review":"This is my second time in writing a reveiw and I find it to be very much needed. I listened to this CD many times and I really do love it. It is so nice to hear good music from one of my favorites. I find it a shame this CD has not gotten promoted. I have told so many people about it. Even friends who are not Ms. Ross' strongest fans, love this CD. What is the problem Motown? or is it Motown? I and many of my friends find it very difficult to keep promoting it. This is really sad. I mean, how much can we continue to do without support from the record company. Somebody should explain. It's only fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does this Lady never get's a hit? This album is LOVE!!","review":"\\"The Boss\\" made it agien. Okej! This is my number 1 favorit artist in the world,but. This Lady never lets anny thing bad comes out on the market. She may not score a big time hit with this one, but sure as ... she's leading the music process. This very well produced album, gives you wonderfull music with a big hart and spirit as few other arts can express. For me she will never be \\"Someone That You Loved Before\\" a great song. And \\"Not Over You Yet\\" is another great song, infact al the 12 tracks on this album is very great music to feed you ears with."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing and wonderful","review":"Diana is back ! With a new and most refreshing sound. This is sure to excite all her long time fans. Simply wonderful. Simply Supreme! l."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another solid album!","review":"Diana Ross still sounded strong on this album. Much of this album is very well done. The Malik Pendleton-produced songs are superb, given that this is the same person that did songs for Mary J. Blige and Zhane. The lyrics are inspiring and positive in most places. I enjoyed listening to more than half of the album several times, proving that Diana Ross can make dynamite songs! Ross may not dominate the music charts like she used to, but she I still think that she has many more albums like this, because of the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of the Heart","review":"This is the most significant and richest album Diana Ross has issued in her nearly 40 years as a recording artist. This is an album which challenges thelistener but also is a throughly enjoyable listen start to finish. Only an artist of great maturity and high standards could have selected these songs--all of them literate and meaningful--and interpreted them with suchcare and heart. The theme of this album is loss, loyalty, new beginnings, faith and self-reliance. The songs, arrangements and Miss Ross' performances are far above the disco stuff so many people seem to want but don't seem to understand will be forgotten as quickly as it was a sensation. It isn't as hard as you think to get a hit record but it is harder than you think to produce a record with value for the heart, soul and mind. This album is a beautiful achievement, with its fun moments. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"diana is capable of better songs","review":"i am rather disappointed by diana's latest release. i was hoping that she would record better songs...what she lacks in this album is the help of better producers like david foster, jimmy jam and terry lewis or babyface. although lyric wise they seem to be rather meaningful, there should be better melodies. outstanding tracks i feel are 'until we meet again' 'not over you yet'."},{"rating":"1","title":"All you have to do is dream, dream, dream.","review":"It was a surprise for me. Diana is back to Motown. A come back to this past glory seal does not mean success now. If she wants to sing blues, this CD must specify it is almost about this mood, I can heard one or two, but twelve is much more for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately...","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed by this release. There were far too many slow tracks, and the songwriting was, for the majority of the songs, quite mediocre. For someone with the reputation of Ms. Ross, she should be making better albums. Her last one, \\"Take Me Higher,\\" was even more disappointing, so this album is a step in the right direction... barely. Her voice sounds great, but honestly, she needs to work with producers that get the emotion out of her and into her singing. It makes no sense to me that the first single released from this album is a remix of an album cut, tacked on at the end of an album which should have every other song remixed as well. Too bad she didn't capitalize on the dance music trend... her cover of \\"I Will Survive\\" on the last album was fantastic, and an album of cuts like that (a la Cher) would have been amazing. Sorry, Ms. Ross, as much as I'd like to say good job, I just cannot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Album Of Her Career","review":"I am one of Diana Ross' biggest fans yet I can find few good things about this new CD. Four songs: Until We Meet Again, Love Is All That Matters, Someone That You Loved Before, and Carry On are vintage Ross at her best. The rest are dreary lifeless urban dirges that have no energy and bury her incredible voice in stale productions. Even He Lives In You never picks up any steam. It is sad that fans of Miss Ross have waited four long years for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Elementals","review":"This is not the best of works by this author. The format for linking stories together utilizing time and elements as a thread was a good technique. However, the stories had little to do with one another. Never the less, I still found the book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really 2 and a half stars","review":"The first two stories in the book are very well written, and I had no problems at all finishing them. In fact, it was hard to stop reading until I hit the third story. From that point on, the book went on a downward spiral. If possible, I recommend borrowing the book from a friend and sticking to the first half of the novel. You won't miss much by skipping the last half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pilates DVD ever!","review":"I'm a total newbie to Pilates but I was looking for something to help my stomach, so I tried Pilates on vacation with an instructor and machine and I liked it. But I was worried that when I got back home I'd lose my way without the equipment. But the \\"Best Pilates\\" CD was for me, the bridge, between the machine and doing mat work by myself a home. Now I do it all with just myself and a mat and the disc and now I'm way into it, it just works great for me, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Beginner's Pilate Workout!","review":"I have purchased several beginner's pilates mat workout DVD's and this is by far the best one. Sarah Picot is an awesome instructor and I love when exercise DVD's show how to modify the exercises. I recommend this highly and notice results doing pilates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too easy","review":"I have been doing Pilates a couple of times a week for about a year. I mostly do DVDs but I wish I could afford to take classes where you work on the reformer. I figured the second best would be to do this video where they incorporate exercises from the reformer. I started with the beginner version and planned to work up to the harder ones, but that may have been a mistake. The problem is that the exercises are so easy that I don't feel a thing and they don't work my body at all. I don't have the time to do an exercise DVD that doesn't even do anything. I now wish I'd bought the intermediate or the advanced instead, maybe one of those would have been better. I would recommend that if you have some experience with Pilates, you should not buy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but lacking a few things.","review":"The music on this CD is just beautiful! Just listening to it will take you to everyone's favorite galaxy \\"far, far away.\\" Includes soaring melodies like \\"Anakin's Theme\\" along with powerful selections like, \\"Duel of the Fates.\\"However, I was a bit disappointed with this CD. Following the excellent releases of the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition soundtracks, this is a big let-down. First of all, not all the music is present. (While watching the movie I noticed a few selections they decided to leave out.) Plus, it doesn't follow the layout of the movie like the Special Editions did.All in all, a great collection, essential for the Star Wars fan, and anyone else who loves great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"This is, BY FAR, the worst soundtrack that John Williams has ever created. It seems like there is total lack of swashbuckling crescendos as there was in The Empire Stikes Back. Granted the movie was totally awful, poorly made complete with terrible acting and forgettable characters. VERY FORGETTABLE. Sometimes the music makes the movie...well the opposite is noted here. My suggestion to Mr. Williams: If the next Star Wars sucks like Episode 1, look for a better story to match your talents as one of the greatest composers. If you choose to stay, May the force be with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"again, two thumbs up!","review":"john williams has created yet another music masterpiece, yet it lacks some of the magic that made the original star wars trilogy so special. in the original saga almost every main character has its own theme, yet here only anakin and the stupid jar jar binks have one. what happened to queen amidala, or obi wan kenobi? also, this is like a compressed score of the music that is present in the film. the music in the CD is not in the same order as it appears in the movie, and is like each song is summarized. anyway, my favorites picks are anakin's theme, droid invasion and the appereance of darth maul, duel of the fates, and qui gon's noble end(which is actually the movie version of duel of the fates, since \\"duel\\" only appears on the end credits and is not actually an scene song)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Greatest!","review":"I never really liked classical music before until I sat down and listened to the music in the movie. It is so awesome. I like to just listen to the music to cool off or something, it pipes me down. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, but order would be nice.","review":"The beautiful thing about Star Wars music is that you are able to put in the CD close your eyes and see the movie. This CD doesn't allow you to do that. It is still worth the purchase unless they release a more comprehensive chronological soundtrack. The CDs released with the special editions were great. That is what they need with this CD. I want to be able to close my eyes and visualize the movie when I listen to this music. What is on the CD is phenomenal Williams fare. He is a genius. On Anakin's theme he adds a slight hint of Vader's theme; very eerie. If only the music was in the same order it appeared in the movie, this CD would get five stars. On a purely musical stand, it definitely deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another John Williams classic.","review":"The CD has great music, alot of it sounds fresh.

From the beginning, you can tell the author is invested in the truth, as you are, and digs to find it.

It's really an interesting read, and it's thought provoking (if you care about this kind of matter, that is).

With a cast of true singers like William Tabbert, Florence Henderson, and the sublime Ezio Pinza (who'd earlier brought his operatic bass to the role of Emile in SOUTH PACIFIC), this recording's an aural treasure trove. In one of those vagaries of the repertoire, none of the songs became standards, but with numbers like the title song (soaringly rendered by Tabbert), the impassioned, \\"I Have To Tell You\\" (Miss Henderson), and the exuberant, \\"Welcome Home\\", you have to wonder why. In the end, perhaps the most affecting piece is the curious, \\"Be Kind To Your Parents\\", which rounds out the sumptuous score, faithfully rendered on this Original Cast Recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie worth keeping","review":"William Tabbert, Walter Slezak, Ezio Pinza and yes, young Florence Henderson are a delightful cast.

The best ballad, \\"I Like You,\\" is sung by the son to his father. \\"Welcome Home\\" sounds promising but isn't addressed to anyone.

The sound quality is actually pretty good except when the 2nd line is in use--no cross talk, but plenty of annoying clicks and \\"hits\\" that can be heard in the VTech's handset. Ten number memory speed dial memory is inadequate and no speed dial listing on the set or cradle is also big negative. Also, unless you sit on top of the telephone the button descriptions and LEDs for Mute, Conf., Hold, etc. are impossible to see--even from 2' away. If I had it to do over again, I think I would shop a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product","review":"I bought this product months ago and it has been nothing but trouble, it screechs whenever you try to pick up the handset from the base.

Corigliano's music bristles with energy and at the same time can still to a very beautiful calm. The piano concerto is exactly like this. It is one of the most phisically and emotionally exciting pieces of music that I have ever heard. The work is mostly atonal, but there are some very nice tonal sections in the piece. The third movement is proof of that. I do not usually go for atonal pieces, but the piano concerto is one of the best that I have ever heard. The last minute-and-a-half of the final movement is absolutely astounding; it's jaw-dropping! The other pieces on this CD were excellent too. I especially liked Tournaments. And Corigliano's orchestrations are some of the best I've ever heard!

This novel is woven of mini episodes and mood peices that, taken as a whole, form a tapestry of experience as well as the history of a war-torn region. Funny, moving, and beautifully written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Character sketches in the Namibian veld","review":"Orner's novel comprises character sketches at an isolated boys' school in the Namibian veld. It's not about plot. The very short chapters--sometimes just a paragraph and at most a couple of pages--are an unusual choice for a novel; they don't really stand alone, but they don't really form a cohesive whole either. Orner does a good job of depicting the various characters through stories they tell each other and the observance of their everyday life--variously touching and humorous. However, those little chapters and characterizations started to wear on me after a while, and I felt I'd had enough long before the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past page 60","review":"After reading the other reviews, I feel a little self conscious and perhaps lacking.

I couldn't get interested in the characters and found the whole exposition off putting. I had high hopes, having traveled to Africa 7 times and having Namibia at the top of my list for next to visit. Unfortunately, this book was just a bore that I had to fight hard to get through as far as I did.Some may love the writing style. Just be aware it's very different.

With great production (provided by Mathematics, Tata, Dred, Smokin' Joeh & DJ Devastator) and great lyrics, this should be on the top 10 list for '99 of all hip-hop enthusiasts. The Wu-Syndicate (formerly Crime Syndicate), in my opinion, is one of the hottest groups fallin' out the Wu-Tang Family Tree. Backing up Myalansky & Joe Mafia are off/on member Napolean, 12 O' Clock (Ol'Dirty Bastard's lil' brother) and the little known MMO (Money Makin' Organization) consisting of Trigga & KGB a.k.a Ill Knob. Kids, go home and break open them piggy banks cuz this album is a must have and is certainly not just for the dedicated Wu-Fans. It's simply off the hook.

Joe Mafia and Myalansky have the most unique way of throwing alliterations into the mix of their rhymes. Tracks like \\"Thug War\\" \\"Where Was Heaven\\" \\"Ice Age\\" and \\"Weary Eyes\\" can bring me to tears, while tracks like \\"Global Politics\\" \\"Metropolis\\" \\"Ghetto Syringe\\" \\"Ask Son\\" and \\"Bust a Slug\\" just leave me amazed. Cats in the industry better start recognizin Wu-Sydicate, cause as hard as it is, these guys outshine the Wu-Tang themselves.

Unless you are desperate for something with gay content avoid this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proofreader, anyone?","review":"Yes, another example of a dreadful Prima Guide. There is this profession called \\"editor\\", which publishers usually make use of in order to catch mistakes. It would seem that, for the genre of strategy guides, catching mistakes is a secondary concern to making sure to put out the guide in time to coincide with the release of the game. The lists of equipment, which should be cross-referenced, aren't. So, one never knows what equipment is actually found in the game, let alone where it would hypothetically be found. Just plain sloppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very inaccurate guide","review":"This guide has many errors as far as what certain character (enemy) classes are immune to. The game itself is not that hard and you really don't need the maps in this guide for anything. So this guide basically fails at the one thing it could have been useful for. Really, for the money that Prima makes selling these guides, there is no excuse for putting out a shoddy product filled with mistakes. As another reviewer said, you can find better, more accurate guides online. This is definitely one guide that you should pass on and just save your money. Even if you loved this game like I did, this guide is not worth the investment (even for a few dollars used - I got mine cheap and ended up just giving it away since it's pretty useless)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun advice","review":"Although a tad bit smarmy in her choice of references and her overly dramatic vocal inflection, the content of this CD set is entertaining and has a few points that will resonate and stick with you (like \\"sticky eyes\\"). Some advice offered seems definitely conflicting - don't smile too quickly and at anyone without first discovering who the recipient of your attention is; but then, smile as an overture or prelude to converation, responding with the openness and friendliness of a little puppy, for who could resist this?Much fun to listen to in the car, almost like having your sweet old aunt sitting next to you sharing lots of good suggestions for conversational skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather listen to Spongebob read this book.","review":"I had to quit after starting the second cd. Her tone and overly enthusiastic approach for every single concept almost sounds condescending to the listener. She would be better suited to read children's books to a daycare class. The author does have some good pointers IF you can stand to listen so I gave it two stars. I was however very disappointed on the advice for starting smalltalk. \\"Just say anything\\" is not advice!

The author's voice is terribly irritating and is worstened by the overdramatic way in which she reads. I suffered through CD #1 and got half way through #2 before I just couldn't take it anymore. The reason I listened so long is because I kept waiting to get some little tidbit of information that might help me justify the $25 I spent on this audio book. No such luck. The content of this book is nothing more than trite methods we have all heard over and over again. The author gives these methods long, silly names and attempts to pass them off as new ideas.

Spend your money on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical CD","review":"Collectors of historical recordings of military music should rejoice at this release. I completely agree with the comments made on the previous review. There is simply nothing like this available for us collectors excepts perhaps for the cd they Brandenburg Historica sell of marches from Saxony. The marches are taken from recordings from the early part of the 19th century so make allowance for the sound, though some of the recordings have almost modern sound. I look forward to future releases.

I've read one other biography of her before this one, which does not hold a candle. You come away feeling that she was a real, down-to-earth person who had the same wants, feelings, and desires, who was just as human as everyone else. But she took a step further and rose above her frailties to try and right the wrongs in the world in her ever humble and compassionate way. You do not find too many people like her who would give selflessly and not want anything back but only to make sure your happiness came first.I was also impressed with the thorough bibliography, footnotes and chronological order in the way Mr. Paris wrote, which reminded me of how Ms. Hepburn wanted order in her life also.All and all, it was a fascinating and riveting read into a life that could not help but touch and grab at your heart strings."},{"rating":"2","title":"DELIGHTFUL MUSIC, DELIGHTFULLY SUNG","review":"Offenbach was a master of light musical theatricals; von Stade, a mistress of song. Put them together as in this recording and you have the makings of a delightful hour of listening. Hopefully, for those not yet acquainted with the original productions from which the songs are taken, these fine renditions will prove a stimulus to buy or borrow some or all of the increasing number of these which are being made available by means of DVD's.

Lucky for me I held out and was able to get Oakenfold's mix and more for a lot less. All remixes are solid. The opening Paul Oakenfold mix is nice, the 8mm and 16mm mixes are both interesing, the Salt Mix is passable, nothing special. And any DD fan should already have the Night Version, which is also good. But the hands down winner is the Tall Paul Newman deep house mix. A solid dance/club tune that will get you moving. Far and away the best track on the album and on its own is worth the price of the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to have Remixes, but one would have done it.","review":"I'm thrilled that Duran Duran have released a new set of mixes!

I thought the whole scandal involving Byrne's character's family was a tad contrived. I won't spoil it for anyone but, needless to say, it seemed like it was a bit of a filler.The main love story works mainly because of the onscreen chemistry between Hugh Dancy's quirky Asperger's syndrome affected persona and Rose Byrne's caring understanding and funloving view on life.The extras on the DVD are run of the mill although the interview of Rose Byrne by three film students was a nice change of pace.Great to see the corrupt captain from \\"The Wire\\" in a classic bit part as a friend of Dancy's recently deceased father who plays a bit of a replacement father figure in his scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"scratched","review":"The DVD was received in adequate time but when i opened it there were a lot of scratches and skipped a few scenes when i watched it.

I have old scars on my cheek from a bad acne outbreak about a year ago. It didn't do anything. I also had some new scars on my upper lip, and they were gone in about two weeks. If your scar is brand new, then this stuff is great. If you're looking for something to get rid of older scars from acne, surgery, or having a rock thrown at your face; go for something more intense like SCARpin.Also, the bottle isn't that generous in size and quite expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"No change in burn mark when used alone","review":"I didn't see much of an improvement when using this by itself.

After 6 weeks it developed 2 rust spots, one of which I scraped off with my fingernail, leaving a blotch revealing that this item has a lacquered finish that apparently protects it from rusting. The finish is easily scratched and when so, the metal under it rusts in that spot. Why would a \\"stainless steel\\" item need a lacquered finish?

It was a big disappointment.The first song is the \\"U. S. Armed Forces Medley.\\" Well played march music but with no vocal and not appropriate for a McDermott CD. One wonders \\"Why is this here?\\" The tune of \\"Lili Marlene\\" was so improvisational that it was barely recognizable. Perhaps I'm especially critical of this one because \\"Lili\\" is one of my favorites. If you want to know what it should sound like, and hear a basis for comparison, find the Marlene Dietrich version. As with many of the songs on this CD, the vocal was overpowered by the accompanyment, which was consitantly overloud and disappointing in almost every song.This CD was a poor vehicle for John McDermott's voice and talent. Skip it and buy \\"Battlefields of Green\\" or one of the \\"Tenors\\" CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep, dead, no crisp!

Nor is it the class Felix, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the entertaining movie I was hoping for","review":"My daughter left the room after about 20 min. into this dvd.

At about an hour and 15 minutes, you'll be wondering why they didn't cut out all of the horrendous musical numbers and just make it a half-hour show.Dave Coullier (Felix) is typically annoying, even when he isn't acting annoyingly. His attempts at Felix's voice are grating.The one positive that I can say is that the animation style is appealing. I don't know much else out there like it. The lines drawn around the characters, which are much thicker than what you would see ordinarily, make the presentation visually-appealing.Other than that, there are better titles available, even at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set -- shoddy packaging","review":"Mostly a great set of music that goes a long way toward dispelling the myth that Monk's Columbia sides weren't worthy of him. Unfortunately, this set drops a star because of the shabby packaging. It's artistically quite nice, but Columbia makes the same mistake that it did with Armstrong's Hot Fives set -- the way the discs are housed is stinko.This time around, they're held in place (at least for a while) with little rubber hubs glued to the cardboard folder. While it's charming to have the black hubs as part of Monk's beard when the CDs are in place, it's not going to be as charming when the hub glue loosens after a few disc removals, and the hubs fall off or the glue gets on the discs themselves.In short, Music: 5 stars, Package Execution: 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - Satisfaction","review":"My first Monk album was Monk's Dream from Columbia. I loved that album 15 years ago and had been searching for the same satisfaction from the multitude of Monk recordings from the Blue Note Years, Presitge, and Riverside. What Monk's Dream offered that the prior work lacked, was production. Raw, edgy, spontaneous ...yes all those recordings offered that. But I longed for that sense of confidence, tightness and richness of sound Monk's Deream provided. I found that in this set which makes sense since Monk's Dream came out of these sessions at Columbia. So what if these are reworks of the old stuff...they sound just as new and gripping \\"produced\\" as they did in their earlier days without big money helping out. WIll I throw out my older stuff and just play this? No chance..there is a time for polish and a time for purity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Normally I do not write reviews. But with this product I decided I needed too. I purchased this item for my Subaru Legacy Sedan. It said on Amazon that it fit. Actually it did. The problem is it doesn't work.

Hardly any of the tracks on this album are funk, and as for Queen being the opener... it speaks for itself. To me, funk is typified by an active bass line, compelling beat and sharp guitar or brass; any or all of these are lacking on most of the tracks here. What you get instead is a collection of slothful, disparate songs, hardly conducive to dancing. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wild Trees, not.","review":"I purchased this video after reading a fascinating book by Richard Preston, \\"The Wild Trees\\". The protagonist of the book, Steve Sillet, is featured in brief shots during the video, but there is really nothing about the other characters in the book. It does present the historic plight of the redwoods as well as an account of a marathon hike to collect data through the known, but often uncharted redwood territory, south to north. I had hoped for more video views of the redwood canopy. Overall, it is an interesting look at a biome that has nearly vanished."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but poorly constructed","review":"This tack trunk is a lot of fun but not well made.

This is no surprize. The author gives us an endless array of jargon cobbled together in a way that obviously makes sense to her. To others better acquainted with her meanderings it is not only poorly written, but what is presented as fact is fiction, and what is fiction is frightful. One reader repeatedly copied and recopied a phraze from the book, over and over, as if by doing so she could make sense of it. Sadly enough, there was no sense to be found. But people are unreasonably trusting and that trust is egregiously exploited by anyone who promotes this book as something of quality and worth reading. It is unintelligible. When no longer looking for the sense in nonsense, it becomes humorous and pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Summary For Growing Bonsai","review":"This book is the perfect starting point for any one who is interested in the art of bonsai. With its 101 steps it depicts the whole process of bonsai making, however the book does not go in to greater detail. I had to turn to additional literature to successfully complete the processes that are described in it. But if I had not had this book I would really not know where to start. In addition to the useful tips, the book includes beautiful pictures and clear illustrations that help with the understanding of the art.

It has tips but that all they are, its unspecific and it only gives you basic shapes and tells you its important to create a balance and other methods without ever teaching you how or why. And it makes it seem like all bonsais are the same, when the species is very important and does matter in the selection of stuff, like shapes for instance. This book is alright, but it should only be bought as a companion, not as a guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Pictures. No tangible information","review":"There are a lot of gorgeous pictures in this book unfortunately if you want to know how to start a Bonsai this is not the book for you.

Completely useless for a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information too broad, too thin","review":"For my purposes, interest in keeping my newly purchased bonsai plant alive, this book falls fairly short. The amount of the book that pertains to that is a few paragraphs. The rest of the book covers what seems like every aspect of bonsai growing, spending a small paragraph on each topic. So if you want to know how to grow a bonsai, transplant, or really do any one thing, you might want to think about a more in depth book, because this one comes off as something that should be in an elementary school library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonsai Info Booklet","review":"Bonsai 101 was an introduction into Bonsai plants for me, info was readable and ease to comprrehend, excellant 1st booklet to read about Bonsai"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginner Book for A New Bonsai Owner","review":"I ordered this book along with my first purchase of my first Bonsai tree.

I bought this book as a beginner and having read it, am no more informed than I was before.The information available for free on the internet is far more in-depth and useful than this book.

But other than that - and with the possible exception of \\"California\\" - one soon tires of Wainright's flat, nasal vocals and the overall monotony of most of his melodies.

Wainwright infuses every verse with heartfelt emotion, making the most of a generally dark serious set that nonetheless is ethereal and magical. In years to come, this artist will be a legend - no doubt about it. He's talented as a songwriter first and a singer second, yet few other artists are successful at both the way Rufus is. Whether singing about tragedy or love, Wainwright is part Dylan, part Sheryl Crowe, and yet always uniquely his own voice. A winning combination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Stuff","review":"One in a million is ole Rufus and here his sound is a little snappier, a little sharper. The music-hall edges and Cole Porter style swagger are still present but in clearer focus. His debut was terrific, don't get me wrong, but I feel that with extended airplay this grower gives a little more. Highly recommended for all intelligent songwriters out there.."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with these bad reviews?","review":"I usually never review on Amazon, but I notice a lot of not so flattering reviews on this album so I thought I'd share my view. I (personally) love Rufus Wainwright's music. Everyone's tastes are different and it's all subjective, of course. His voice is beautiful though and very original. His songs are romantic, charming, beautiful, and quirky all at once. I can't say that everyone will love this CD, but I gave it a chance and I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The quality of this cd was far lower than I had hoped, based on his previous work.

I love that song and I really love the poetry and originality of Wainwright's lyrics. He creates moods and searing images. The background instrumentalization is wonderful and experimental at times, and I like the vocal harmonies. I do agree with the review that there is a certain melodic sameness with many of the songs; but, other customer reviews confirmed what I felt must be true, that this is an album that burns gently into your soul after several listenings. Plus, he has a resonant and malleable voice that sinuously maintains its integrity in different vocal ranges."},{"rating":"2","title":"magical mystery tour","review":"buy this cd, borrow this cd, steal this cd... just get your hands on it, and dive in. i hope you have already taken the journey through his previous releases. this is another trip worth taking. music, voice, lyrics - he offers a complete, completely mesmerizing package. highs and lows this good are not normally achievable sans illegal chemicals.Rufus is a world apart, a world i love to visit, and i am considering a permanent move there. when i get my loft in rufusville, you are all welcome to stay. but don't wait, visit rufusville today. it's wonderland. it's a fantastic cabaret. it's a magical mystery tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD from a really good singer.","review":"Rufus Wainwright is certainly a rarity these days.

I packed a textbook, 16oz H20, 16oz coffee, and a Dell Precision M6400 with power brick and mouse. It fits, but the plastic clips that attach the bag to the shoulder strap are crap. One broke under the load and I found out something else. While the back panel is padded to protect your humongous laptop, the edges are not padded. So when the bag decided to free fall, it landed on the corner of my laptop. So far, the only damage to the laptop is a dented corner. The laptop corner actually cut through the bag's canvas, and so there is a cut on the bottom of the bag now. The dent is bad enough that I almost soiled myself when I saw it. To Dell's credit, the laptop seems to be functional.Thanks a lot High Sierra, for cheaping out on the most mechanically critical part of this bag.

The only let down for me was that it tends to rip when taking hard shots with an ice hockey puck (but surprisingly enough, not that often).

He does not describe the contents of the computer programs they use. (trade secrets?)This center offers, \\"personal cognitive fitness trainers and a broad, all inclusive cognitive cocktail.\\" (whatever that may be?)

It combines state-of-the-art knowledge about the brain delivered in a very clear and lucid manner with enjoyable cultural and historical digressions. I liked Goldberg's other book, The Executive Brain, but this one is even better. It is refreshing to see a serious scientist stepping out of the ivory tower and developing practical applications. The idea of cognitive fitness through cognitive exercise is fascinating and I can't wait to start!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy platitudes, some interesting points, no payoff","review":"I recommend that you read the Scientific American review that you can find above. It contains just about everything this book has to offer. The ideas about brain hemispheres are interesting, but you won't learn much more by reading the 300+ pages.The Wisdom Paradox has a very promising premise and the topic is very important and the author has a mighty pedigree, but still the book leaves you emptyhanded. The most infuriating part is the last chapter that describes a program for cognitive fitness, i.e. a way of enhancing your brain power. And that's it: a description! Nothing else. The author doesn't give the reader a single exercise, but he just pats himself on the back for inventing such a wonderful program.You won't become any wiser from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading \\"The Wisdom Paradox\\" is a wise choice","review":"Highly recommended. A fascinating, well-conceptualized proposition that educates, integrates, and provokes at many levels. Dr. Goldberg's clarity of writing makes intriguing concepts understandable for lay persons, yet challenges experienced neuroscientists to re-think old paradigms. Who wouldn't be interested-from either a personal or professional perspective-in coming to understand how our aging brains change in \\"style\\", and can be strengthened throughout our lifetime? While there is no guarantee that reading Dr. Goldberg's book will make you wise, reading, understanding, and practising the \\"wisdom\\" the book offers is certainly a step in the right (or left!) direction.GBS, Saskatoon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviews look excellent!","review":"I havent bought the book yet, but the generous amount of free pages Amazon allows you to peruse clearly tells me this is a book way overdue, and in fact the destiny of our country may rest on many of the ideas and strategies in this book.

JR himself isn't even a legitimate professional gambler, he's just a writer who happens to sell mediocre, long term losing plays on his website. The math method he describes in chapter two is worthless, he claims that that simple method will hit 54% against the spread but it's not true. You won't hit anything higher than 50% using that method.Miller has very little understanding of proper bankroll growth, especially in regards to the kelly criterion.

One can follow along in the text; this is very helpful.The format of the text, however, makes it somewhat difficult to review, and there isn't even a vocabulary list at the end of each chapter! This is a serious flaw. I would prefer also extensive review exercises at the end of the chapter. Instead, there are only small practice sessions embedded in the the text. I would like this format--it makes it seem manageable--if only there were also review sections at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good; an amazing value","review":"The speakers speak slowly and clearly -- not to be taken for granted.

Unlike The Two Towers, not an RPG, you run around without getting attacked, and when you are attacked the fight isn't determined by your swordsmanship, you have to attack in an orderly fashion, each person with there own turn, and the can't be hurt unless it's the other person's turn.

This book is just an expensive reiteration of what you get for free with the program.The CD: On a Macintosh level, there are only demo programs which you could download from Macromedia.com for free. Occasionally, the book would ask you to import a certain file that's to be used w/the tutorial and *NOT ONE* was present in the CD. - go figure!Overall: I believe that the authors should first read through the tutorials that Macromedia provides and then publish something that would actually be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"I bought a couple graphic design books from The Coriolis Group before.

Using the trial version for almost it's 30 days, downloading the PDF File for a manual I learned enough that I had to skip ahead to chapter 7 of 12 before I started reading content on subjects I didn't know from the Macromedia manual. I read the author's apology on the missing files on the CD but after customers spend good money for a product they should get what is advertised.. what they pay for. I could certainly see the frustration for a new person that has no or little experience in graphics to follow the tutorials on the CD. In short....

(you can use the PS3 in the case and it has a area to carry a good bit of the accessories but it doesn't have room for the PS3 intercooler). You have to completely take the PS3 out of the case to use the PS3 if you are using intercooler. If the seller had mentioned that I wouldn't have bought it.

It's one of those little ones with the handle and the wheels on it so you can pull it behind you, but still offers tons of support. I can fit plenty in there, (PS3, 4 controllers, a 32 disc holder, power and a/v cables PLUS my 15\\" Macbook pro and accessories) with room to spare. So before you go looking for a \\"designed for PS3 case\\", try going to a retail outlet, like Ross, and seeing what you can get for $39.99.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why there is a hole at the bottom of the bag?","review":"I got this bag for my PS3.

Great for those on the move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the Job done!","review":"I've had this for two months now and it gets the job done. It's sturdy enough to keep it safe and secure as long as you don't drop it. Honestly though, if you drop your PS3 in any carrying case it's not good. The zippers work fine and are sturdy. The velcro closure for the accessory pouch also work fine. The accessory pouch might need to be a little bigger for you if you have a lot of EXTRA accessories. Overall, the bag is inexpensive, it makes transporting the PS3 quick and easy, the bag is sturdy and you can play it while in the case. I recommend it to everyone I know that has a PS3. I think they even make them for the Wii and 360. Also, listen to what other reviewers are saying and place a soft towel between your PS3 and the velcro straps that hold it down to prevent any light scratching. I've done so since day one and no scratches yet. But just get it already, chances are you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice console organizer","review":"I was very pleased with this organizer.

Although it's listed as a Playstation 3 G-pak, it's actually a universal case according to the information in the case itself. The only notable \\"flaw\\" that I found is there is no good way to store 2 controllers. You can get them in by loading them in front of the main Playstation 3 unit, but there should be a designated area for them. However, when you consider cost and quality, this case is just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case","review":"Over all this is a good sturdy carrying case. The PS3 fits well in it and the Velcro straps keep it in. You can put four controllers in the top pocket, but there is no room to spare. I put my cords in the case after zipping it up most of the way. The two main grips I have with this case are One- the air is some what restricted while the PS3 is in the case so I always take it out. And Two- I don't like the disk holder. I think that it is a good as they can make it given the case and the fact that it will be in several potions but I have had my disks fall out a couple of times. Overall this is a good case that will serve you well."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely perfect carrying case","review":"i bought this case because i needed a portable/transportable carrying case for my PS3. since i bought it my PS3 has not left the \\"safety\\" of the case and with proper care my PS3 has no scratches, dings, or even running problems like some people claim to have with their PS3. this case is perfect for quick plug and play as per the access flap on the rear. i keep thinking that because the flap is latched by velcro that the bottom will fall out and my PS3 will drop out of the case but it has yet to happen and carry it back and forth everyday! the fabric that this product is made of is very durable and can withstand much abuse without getting even so much as a tear.i say this is the carrying case to get if you travel with your PS3 quite often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghostly nostalgia","review":"Today it seems it's vampire romance.

His ride from the train station doesn't show up, but he's helped out by a cute but mysterious girl. Wanna guess what happens next?Without giving the plot away, I still find the ending poignant but upbeat, and have a far better understanding of the adults in the village than I did back then.

The result is a compilation CD that's a must for those who wanted good, clean Rap with a message.Aside from Grandmaster Flash and RUN-DMC, this CD plays solid beats with many \\"One-hit wonders\\" such as Digital Underground, Marky Mark, Young MC, and PM Dawn.

And as much as a I love shooters, and the dual-wield system, it really does get dull. And I've only had the game for a day and I only have 2 more levels to go. It gets easy, the hard, then easy again. However the graphics rule. Last time I checked, other games that came out recently *cough Halo 2 cough* didn't go into as much detail in the movies as giving the people pores and showing them sweat.

This is by far my best bond game.Now, lets get on to the graphics and physics. The graphics is really good, especially on the weapon such as guns and grenades. The physics are great.

The part that I really hate is the fact that you have to shoot the guys 10 or more times to get a hit and they run around like a bunch of panzies while you're shooting at them. OK, I expect them do do a certain bit of running around, but after a while it gets to be like a game of \\"ring around the rosies\\".

ONLY good thing about the game are the graphics. The eye powers are nifty for maybe... two seconds? The multiplayer was the worst form I've seen in years for a Bond game. No bots? We have the technology. Beating your little brother a million times gets old. This game could definitely have been spiced up. It had potential, and it did not realize this potential. This game is only for the most diehard of fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certifiable Piece of Crap","review":"EA has ruined the Bond franchise as far as I am concerned. Don't be confused that since it shares a name with the 1996 Goldeneye title for the N64 that it is good.First off lets establish one thing about this game, that you are supposedly a bad guy. But instead of doing bad guy things like robbing banks and blowing up things that make civilians tremble and fear you, you just go around fighting Dr. No another bad guy. So in reality you are just a pseudo goodguy.The entire point of the game is to run from point A to point B killing a legion of bad guys with the same four guns. The levels are long and legnthy and often hideously pointless, because as I've established before you don't do anything except escape or get to point B. Classic Doom is more fun then this.So if your thinking about buying this game - Don't save yourself the money and treat yourself to a body piercing in a sensitive place, as it will be more enjoyable then playing this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Childish","review":"This game, when I first fot it, was the best.

After you use up all your weapons you have to use and extremely weak pistol with unlimited ammo. And after under cover for 2 seconds your health goes back up!

The space battles really are the best of the whole game. Depending on the ship choice you make, you can either go after the enemy fighters or you can destroy the enemy capital ships.The ground battles are fun as well and you get a wide variety of terrain to fight over, from cities to swamps and everything in between. You have a number of different weapon choices as well, based on the class of fighter you choose.Additionally, there are bonuses that can be applied to space battles or ground battles.As for the negatives about this game, I would say that after a while it gets old. You get to play different sides but you're mostly fighting over the same planets, with the exception of a few.Everything considered, I still consider this a great game and well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"good, but not great","review":"this game was an alright buy for me since i found a used one for much less. I wouldnt pay the retail on it though. The gameplay itself is pretty fun if you are into battlefield 2 and battlefront 2. The loading times are a hamper(about 30 seconds, after you customize your round) and do prevent the game from being a pick up and play game. It is a fun game but doesnt seem to wow you after you play and make you want to go play again, nor is it very addictive. The units can upgrade to become a jedi in this game. The Jedis are very annoying and tottally dominate the battlefield so i recommend turning them off.I would say it is one of the better psp games out there, but dont pay full price for this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"First gta now this!!","review":"It's really a good game, the second best game for psp by a long shot (gta was really good too).

For instance,the controls. If you are runningaround trying to complete a mission, you don't have time toplay around with the triangle,square,circle,and X buttons.It's just annoying! Why couldn't it have target lock andanalog stick control? The only reason mosy people say it'sa great game is because they don't want to admit that their$50 went down the drain! Sure,it's got it's ups(like goodgraphics,neat weapon selection,and dark side/good side choice).If you want a good shoot-em-up game,I would stronglyrecommend Grand Theft Auto(Liberty City Stories).

I must say, this is the worst game I have ever purchased...ever! There is no story...in fact, there's nothing resembling any kind of direction or clue as to what you have to do, save for a small, vague blurb at each mission. Furthermore, when playing a mission, you spend 80% of the time just figuring out what you're supposed to accomplish! You die WAY too easily, which makes this game frustrating from the start. If you complete all the missions, you get nothing...absolutely nothing! Finally, the play control is painfully awful. This is a game that should never have come to the PSP, since it's completely vital to use either two analog sticks or a keyboard and mouse.Don't waste your time and money on this, whether it's just the game or the PSP bundle.

All the classics are here played live with an intensity that only the live setting can provide. There are a few tracks that make you scratch your head and wonder why they were included however- Track 6 seems out of place here, Track 8 is not one of the better tracks, only 2 out of 14 is a pretty good deal I'd say. I did miss 'Gangs in the street' which is strangely missing. A good disc nonetheless. Sound quality is definitely 80's- big sound and loud with a lot of women in the audience(naturally hence the band title)screaming in unison. Packaging is also very good with a tribute to late(missing?)bassist Scott Smith. Now the next step is a live dvd, the 80's Toronto show would be my pick. Are you listening Columbia?

I almost considered returning it for a box fan that would be louder since sound was the original intention but this wound up working prefect after some trial nights.

Why they even bother with the first two is beyond me. I guess low and medium would work well if you were trying to do a scientific experiment where you were trying to get a feather to dance in place.Do not get this item if you want to stand next to the fan and get cooled off on a hot day. It won't happen.You literally have to get within one inch of the fan housing to get anything that can even remotely be called relief on a hot day.As far as the construction is concerned, I know that, as a kid, I discovered toy surprises in Cracker Jack boxes that were made of thicker plastic than the base of this fan.It's cheaply constructed, it has virtually no power and, if you want to get cooled off on a hot night, you might throw it in the trash like I just did."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was the Immortal Sin","review":"I purchased Immortal Sins after an Amazon search for all films featuring Shari Shattuck. The list was short, but I find her to be exotically attractive and inclined to play seductive roles. Whether she is or is not wearing clothes, this typecasting is perfect.Unfortunately, this film did not even approach the 2 star rating which probably marked the zenith of Shari's film career (On Deadly Ground with Steven Segal). The plot was probably written by a six-year old with a crayon, and could have been edited into a film of about 10 minutes in length without losing anything. Further, the film was shot in what I unimaginatively refer to as dark-o-vision. If there was anything of interest to see it was probably so dark in the film you wouldn't have or couldn't have seen it anyway.

Scripture says that Jesus was a priest \\"of the order of Melchisadek.\\" What that means is that Jesus, like Melchisadek, was a priest by the direct operation of the Holy Spirit, not because he was ordained by any organized religion. Jesus was the inheritor of the age-old secret hidden wisdom of the Western spiritual tradition. Clarke gives us superb insights into that tradition, showing, for example, that much of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Gospels are spiritual parables (and probably not historical). They are stories to aid the spiritual initiate to the highest mystical realizations. I recommend the book to serious Jewish and Christian seekers.

Unfortunately it comes off as cheesy, like dialogue you might find in a bad 70s porno. I actually cringed during certain parts of the book, and at one point I said outloud, \\"Ohmygod, who talks like that?\\"As for the overabundance of sex, well, it IS erotica so I expected lots of steamy yumyums, but I expected them to be...better. More erotic dialogue, more detail and a hint of emotion from the characters. Nope, not in this book.If erotica is your thing, I highly recommend checking out Emma Holly.

I read the negative feedback and felt leery about purchasing it. However, I am very glad I went through with it!

For years, I was forced to have my bed in the middle of my bedroom, now that I have the vent extender I have so much more space since the bed is now against a wall!

That is not an issue for me since all it needs to do is redirect airflow, and a sturdier, more brittle plastic will snap if stepped on, this platic won't. My issue with this is it states that it clips on to the vent. It does not, as other reviewers commented. I used a little clear shipping tape, but I didn't feel I should have since it is clearly dishonest advertising.

The dilemmas faced by the Romans of the mid fifth century, both east and west, are very well brought out.

While looking over the reviews, I wanted to add my two cents.CONSTELLATION is a great movie about family, loves and forgiveness. Carmel Boxer, played by Gabrielle Union, narrates her life story. She begins by telling you about a love she shared with a white soldier, Bear, during the time when it was clear that blacks and whites shouldn't mix. As the film goes on you realize that the family is gathering to mourn the loss of Carmel and it's apparent that times have changed as her younger brother, Helms, played by Billy Dee Williams, was married to a white woman and their daughter married a white man. While times have apparently changed, Helms and his daughter are both dealing with so much hurt from the past.

However, The characters and the set were the only good parts of this film. As for the storyline, it is totally all over the place. Whoever wrote this movie seemingly had a bunch of ideas and just threw them into one movie with no order or smooth transition from one scene to the next. The movie jumps around too much and you have no idea why this scene is following that scene. Totally unorganized and poorly written and directed.

Real great, but too disjointed. For one thing, why did they feel the need to lie to Helms about the actual funeral? and although I understood the majority of the film, I find it distasteful that Rae Dawn Chong's found Helms so attractive due to the fact he was married to begin with.

Sound quality on the phone calls varies depending upon the Internet connection and traffic, but for the most part it's at least as clear as a cell phone, most of the times much more so.For anyone who has problems with their computer sound after installing this, you need only go to the control panel and tell it to send computer sound to the speakers, and telephone sound to the \\"USB device.\\"It tells you this in the instructions, but I noticed a few others complained about this in previous reviews. As always, read the manual. In this case it's not painful, as it's barely more than a pamphlet.Really, there's not much to it. If you already use Skype then you'll be up and running in minutes and you'll never look back. Even the speaker phone part of it works nice.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T buy for the Speakerphone","review":"I recently switched everyone in my office to Skype for phone lines. We needed a good speakerphone for conference calls. In the past I have used Polycom Skype speakerphones, with good luck, but my new laptop seems to have a dead microphone port. Result? Had to switch to a USB speakerphone. This seemed like a good deal, good price, so away my One-Click went.The speakerphone is terrible. Good volume, but the callers cannot hear you unless you move directly over the phone. The vaunted Skype integration via software is a pain: non-intuitive, and requires working the phone and the PC at the same time. Finally, if you want to use a headset AND this phone, forget it: while you can reconfigure the software to stop sending calls to the phone, it still insists on ringing the phone and lagging hangups.I'm heading to return this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Phone","review":"I've been using this phone daily now for about 2 months.

(spoiler: the polycom is MUCH better).the only thing that works kind of ok is when the skytone is used with skype. even then most buttons on the phone don't work right (and the manual does not even explain what most are actually for, like SEND). vol+ and vol-? no effect! the sound quality is 3 stars out of 5. what bothered me the most is that the big green speakerphone button does not switch the speakerphone on in any other application other than skype. so even though the device gets a brownie point for functioning as a sound card with those pc's that dont have one, you can hear system sounds/audio only through the handset... go figure...in summary, its only $40 bucks, but it does not really work as good as it should. if you only plan to use it with skype you might be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"The speakerphone is worthless","review":"There are much, much better speakerphones for Skype.This phone was very light, and the inconvenient part of it was, it kept moving around the desk. The LCD screen is small and not very well lit up, which meant that it was very hard to read.In terms of the look and feel, it's not so bad, and it has the familiar shape of a regular phone.In terms of usability and quality of the speakerphone, I heard some muffled voices when testing with someone in another room, and static.Another con: there was no recording option. If you're going to speak with it for customer service calls, business calls, or just for any important call, I'd say, get one, for the same price, that has a recording function. This doesn't have it, and it comes pretty handy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT Integrate well with skype, messes your PC Audio Controls","review":"Though cheap, this phone does not integrate well with skype, some of the buttons on the phone like the 'in', 'out', and 'del' do not have any or the wrong effect on skype software.

You don't just pick it up and dial! I just got it, but can't seem to figure out how to pick up a call, without hanging up on it.Also, as others have stated........ it seems like it should be able to read the skype contact list and transfer it enabled to dial capacity. but even though the skype contact list says \\"+\\" and \\"1\\" before each number, the phone will not register it to dial it that way. Therefor you have the number in the directory on your computer- but you have to enter the codes and the # manually for calls out using the phone.

I had no problem with the size of the screen.I use it when I am on the treadmill at the gym and with the volume turned up as high as possible, I am still able to hear the movies pretty much. The only problem is that occasionally when it is in my gym bag and in its own case, the \\"on\\" switch will be pushed by something in my bag and the battery will need to be recharged so they could work on making the switch a little more resistant.I plan on purchasing earphones that block out a lot of environmental noise and hopefully it will allow me to use this DVD player at airports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed","review":"Don't waste your money this thing is not well made.

Rahat has a beautiful voice, and all tracks are in the traditional style, not bastardized for a Western audience.It's not really fair to try to compare Rahat to Nusrat, is it? Rahat has a strong and unique voice in his own right, and I enjoy this CD very much. I just wish there was more of his music available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rahat can sing!","review":"I saw Rahat Khan in Chicago at one of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's final shows. Nusrat was very, very late arriving, and Rahat took centerstage (with a rendition of Mera Piya Gar Aya) to placate the audience which had started to hiss and boo. And what a turnaround. He won rapturous applause for an electrifying performance. Only 17 at the time, Rahat stole the rest of show too, outsinging the others (even the ailing Nusrat) with his soloes. It was clear that he would be the one who would claim Nusrat's mantle. It is good to finally see a solo release by Rahat, though the lack of sound clips here makes a buying decision difficult. The one track I've heard (Khaban Wich Meray Toon Na Aa) was great and indicates that this release is in the traditional (rather than fusion) vein."},{"rating":"1","title":"below average","review":"Dont waste your time and money, No way this in near to the way Nusrat Fateh Ali used to perform."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL KNOWN SONGS TO TAKE YOU BACK IN TIME","review":"This single CD contains all the tracks of 2 separate albums, originally released in the 1970's on vinyl.

This soundtrack has two disks and contains the the song \\"Jedi Rock\\" from Jabba's palace and the celebration song at the end of the movie. \\"Luke and Leia's theme is beautiful, while the action music makes you feel like you are right there in the movie. I think that every Star Wars fan should own this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"As disappointing as the movie for which it was made.","review":"Sad to say, and even more so to hear, but the Star Wars saga took a tumble with Episode VI, and the soundtrack was no exception. I didn't get the original LP, though I enthusiastically did so with A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back. Different than those two releases, it was only a single record, and to be painfully honest, it STILL doesn't need more than one disc! Much as with the movie, the music, while featuring some interesting and even fun bits (\\"Jedi Rocks\\" is a hoot!), is largely a rehash of the themes of the previous two movies. Without any discernable fire or vitality to the effort, it comes off as a limp copy of better work, kinda like the lame re-working of William's stellar Superman soundtrack for Superman II.

Whoever designed these things should be fired!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent headphones, horrible for running","review":"These headphones fit comfortably, produce decent sound (nothing special) but do not stay on your ears while running - despite the fact that they are advertised as \\"Sport\\" headphones! I spent half of my time running holding them to my ears or catching them as they fell out.Another annoying point: the cord is the type where one ear is much longer than the other (so that you can wear the player at your hip). Some people like this but it drives me crazy and the cords constantly get tangled. I have to untangle the earbuds before every use.However, if you just want some white earphones to match your white iPod then buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Intended for Use During Movement","review":"Stupidly, I bought these for running without readings reviews. They did fit in my ears nicely but would be ripped off with the slightest tug while jogging. Also, the plastic on the cord rubbed off exposing the wires after only two months. The plastic used to encase the wires is too soft to stand up to movement. The sound is pretty good but only buy if you plan on remaining stationary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Out When Running","review":"I bought these for my I-Pod Nano to wear while running. They are continually falling out and needing readjustment. Impossible to use while excercising. One of the problems is the left ear cord is shorter than the right which creates and imbalance of weight distribution. This causes the ear pieces to be jarred out of the ear canal. The sound is good, if you are not moving. I will have to purchase a different design. These are impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap for a reason","review":"Like every self-respecting iPod owner I wanted white headphones that matched. Also, I'm no audiophile, but I'm starting to recognize average sound from good sound.Since the Apple ear buds just don't stay in my ears very well (they sounded ok I guess) I decided I needed something different. These looked like the perfect solution. They were not. Maybe it's the shape of my ears(!), but they literally hung down and didn't stay remotely close to being secure in any way, shape or form. Maybe your ear is shaped differently, I see other people with the Apple ear buds fit perfectly in their ears. But for me, they were useless.I can't even judge the sound quality since they were so hard to keep in place.I'm going to try the Sony MDR-EX81LP headphones I think. Everyone at my gym seems to like that style. Plus the over the ear thing won't bother me since I don't wear glasses. I'll post my review of them soon after I get them - there's hardly reviews of them out there right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not built to last","review":"I have had these headphones for several years. Like many of the other reviewers, I got them because the earbuds that you have to jam into your ear canal are not comfortable for me. They are comfortable enough, but I've been looking for a new pair of headphones because they are falling apart. I have tape holding both earphones together as the rubber coating between the wire and the ear piece has completely separated on both sides, exposing the bare wires beneath. Also, the ear hook on the left side keeps coming off, and often manages to find its way far beneath my desk at work. These were good at first, but for the price you'd think they would be of better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This product dislodges from your ear with the slightest movement, forget walking, jogging or running with them. They require constant adjustment...very annoying to wear. They will become the newest addition to my electronic junkbox.I would recommend Sony MDR-W08L Vertical In-The-Ear Headphones, these are lightweight and stay put."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessible handbook for refocusing on a daily basis","review":"Very easy to read and practical. I was surprised at how these prayers actually help with daily issues such as distractibility, stress reduction, and family conflicts. There is a great prayer to substitute for the cruder expressions that come to mind in certain traffic situations! I wish I'd had the book when I was younger, and will probably give it as an add-on to bar and bat mitzvah gifts. Felder's approach is so non-dogmatic and respectful of each individual's different approach to God that even my adolescent daughter has been \\"caught\\" reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insights for living a more meaningful life","review":"I liked this book because it was an unthreatening and insightful introduction to prayer. No one ever talks much about prayer, at least not the daily kind of prayer one might do in the morning, before meals, and at night. This book explains how to do it from a Jewish perspective, and makes a strong case for the benefits of prayer to a person's life. Since reading this book, I've tried to say a prayer before eating - it's great because it slows down my eating and adds some holiness to my day. If you're looking for a way to focus some of that nervous energy we all generate to something larger and wiser than yourself, this book will help you start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely powerful.","review":"Larry Felder is a wise and gentle soul. With all the books out there addressing the public's desire to either return to their roots or to connect with some sense of large spirituality, few can match Felder's ability to give concrete steps for each of our hectic lives.

I bought this book blindly because wasn't able to see the table of contents to view the song list. Nor did Amazon.com list the songs available in this book. I figured that with \\"120 best known Christmas songs\\", how could any of the common popular songs be left out. Well, if you're looking for Frosty the Snowman, Silver Bells, The Little Drummer Boy, Here Comes Santa Claus, Jingle Bell Rock, Sleigh Ride, The Christmas Song (chestnuts roasting..), and some other REALLY well-known songs, DON'T LOOK HERE CUZ THEY AINT HERE. But songs like, \\"The Boar's head Carol\\", \\"The Friendly Beasts\\", \\"Pat-a-Pan\\", \\"Wassail Wassail\\", and \\"Bring a torch Jeannette, Isabella\\" are all here if you want them.

Gets the job done.","review":"I recently purchased this grinder and have ran about 100lbs of meat through it. It is powerful enough to run beef straight through the medium grind, but with game meat, I noticed that it will really bog down if you don't do the course grind first and then the medium grind.One other key tip I noticed is if you cut your meat in strips and feed it in, it will just pull the strip in and you don't even need to use the push tube. The real work comes when you are doing a re-grind. That takes a while to pack the meat in and feed it through.All in all it was definitely worth the money and will probably be purchasing another for double action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and efficient","review":"Bought the grinder as a replacement for the Kitchen Aid's grinder attachment, which puts metal shavings and motor grease into the meat. This grinder works just as you would expect, with no compromises. A machine that does a single job and does it well; not a kitchen \\"gadget\\" with a dozen options you'll never use or a toy. A little loud, but does the job without a lot of take-aparts and cleanings.I would have rated it five stars, but the plastic pusher was cracked on arrival, and had to be epoxied back together. Compared to the beefy construction of the grinder, the thin plastic pusher seemed more like it was designed for some other (much cheaper) grinder. I wouldn't return the grinder for that, but as a package it was less than perfect as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died on 4th use","review":"This noisy little monster made it almost to the end of its fourth batch of sausage, then let out a terrific howl and expired.

Even when it's not breaking down, it sounds like a chainsaw cutting through an iron tree.Let's see how the seller responds to my return request...Update: December 11, 2012Seller requires ALL original packaging, including the box, otherwise, no refund or replacement.

First I only suspected because they are very light. Also they shine differently from the body. The body, at least outside is stainless steel that's for sure. Then I rubbed those parts with my figure, they turn into black. Aluminum particles are of black color. As long as you keep running with your figure, it is black.

And this would be a refurbished replacement.Hardly worth repairing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Overall these are good headphones. I use them when I travel, mostly to cancel airplane noise.If you've never used cancellation headphones, they are great to remove constant background noise, so in a plane that means you can better listen to your music/movie without having to put the volume insanely high. Note that noise cancellation does not cancel voice chatter, so don't even try to use this in an office -- in this case you want over-the-ear cups for good isolation.They fold easily but folding the whole thing in the accompanying case takes a bit of practice and patience at first. It's a tight squeeze but I now manage to store my iPod nano in the case too. It then stores easily and it is pretty light to carry around.Otherwise they are ok comfort-wise, just a tiny bit tighter on the ear than my older Sony noise canceling headphones. Sound-wise, the bass is a bit too much boosted even for my taste; a bit of equalization on the iPod fixes that easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"my movie ears","review":"A good product.

Now having used the Sony's for about 3 months, I really miss my old Sennheisers.Even when folded the Sonys are still pretty bulky. Unlike many noise canceling headphones, the Sonys don't fold flat which makes them really hard to pack into a notebook bag or carry in a jacket pocket. Also, the noise reduction is not that great. In noisy environments I find myself checking to see if they're turned on.Sony did get a couple things right: the battery holder is compact and sleek, and there's the perfect length of cable. In comparison to the Sennheiser PXC-250, these Sonys pick up less interference from wireless signals."},{"rating":"2","title":"headphones","review":"bought these as a gift. the bf really enjoyed them on his 9 hour flight three days later. haven't used them myself, but i'll take his word for it that they worked beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sound quality","review":"I'll actually be returning these. The sound quality is horrendous- overly boomy bass and muddy midtones. The quality improves slightly when the NC on, but is still very colored.Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Beat these even in 2012","review":"I've had these headphones for 2 years now and just had to write a review and give credit to Sony for these great headphones. I stopped by the local BB store and compared the new popular brands Bose and Beats. I plugged in my iPhone to each of the latest headphones that this store had available and the Sony's are way better. Not only offering sound cancelling but with the added power from the battery, the bass is amazing, rich deep sound, great mids and highs. Excellent for all music, just a really great all around headphone set. Again, I've had these for two years, and I noticed Sony had released a new version of these also with battery power, I wasn't able to test those. If they are as comfertable and great sounding as this model, they should be a great set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall","review":"I like the travel case part of this product. The noise canceling part of the headphones wasn't very effective. These headphones are on ear not over ear. I searched for over ear and this was in that section. Overall the sound quality was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy; noise cancelling doesn't work","review":"I tried these and the noise cancelling didn't work; actually less noise with the noise cancelling feature off.I returned these and bought the Sony MDR-NC60 and love them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"I like Sony products, but this one wasn't up to expectations. It is very good in terms of noise canceling, but it is not comfortable and it usually cause me headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality and noise cancelling","review":"The only good thing of this product is the reasonable price, and the case goes with it. The sound quality, as many people mentioned in the review, it very poor. You have to turn on the noise cancelling function to hear a bearable sound, which is ridiculous. Don't even mention the noise cancelling, since it is not effective at all. I used it on two flights, and it only reduces about 20% of the engine noise. It is way worse than the Bose one, but considering the price, it makes sense... I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what was advertised--great sound; not great noise cancellation","review":"pros:great sound qualitycons:sound cancellation is insignificant. (at points couldn't tell the difference between active noise cancellation being on and off)conclusion:great sound quality but if you are looking for both features look somewhere else"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Price","review":"I have used these headphones for two 8 hour flights so far. While the noise canceling is not spectacular, it certainly does a decent job considering the low price. It was enough to take the edge off the loud engine noise (Airbus A330) and make the flights just a little more bearable. You can certainly tell the difference with the noise canceling on versus off. The construction does appear a bit flimsy, but they survived being sat on at least twice, so I am satisfied. My ears did feel a little pinch after the 4 hour mark, but I can't imagine that anything strapped to my ears that long would not be irritating to some degree. Overall, I would recommend them to the value-conscious consumer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musician's review","review":"In noise cancel mode, these headphones sound great. They have a flat response and sound very natural. The highs are not too crispy and the lows are not too boomy. They block out external mid and high range noise effectively, though some lows might creep in and you cannot use noise cancel in the wind. They sound awful with the noise cancel off and are useless in that mode. I drive a diesel truck and I have no regrets at buying these headphones. They have soft pads and are lightweight and comfortable and I very much appreciate the sound quality. I found Phillips earbuds to be way too crispy in the high end and returned a set of Koss QZPRO because they sounded terrible.If you are looking for good sound in a noisy environment, these Sony's will do you good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet & Comfortable","review":"I recently purchased these for a trip to Europe. I tested them out on a flight to California. I found them to be quiet and comfortable. I wear glasses, so some earphones grind the earpieces into my head. These did not. I am extremeley happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound good, but not well made","review":"I bought the first set of these a few months back.I was impressed with the sound. The noise canceling works to a degree, well enough for me and I liked the way it also creates an EQ curve that eliminated some of the midrange honkiness that many smaller headphones have. However, one side simply stopped working only a couple of weeks after I bought them. I returned them to the store and got another pair, thinking the problem might have been just with that pair. The second pair lasted a while longer, but one side (the same side) has now stopped working in these. The problem seems to be related to the circuitry in the small switch/battery compartment. At this point, I've given up on them. I have cheap old headphones that came with some junk cassette player I bought 15 years ago that still work, guess it's back to those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony Nc40","review":"Real nice product, it's a very good option considerating the value and the quality that you are going to have. It really doesnt cancel very much noise i think not the 90% promoted, but 80% or 85%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact size and decent performance","review":"I was tired of lugging around my Audio Technica noise-cancelling headphones in their gigantic case. These may not sound quite as good as the more expensive AT ones, but the sound and noise cancellation are more than adequate. Plus they fold up into a case small enough to slide into an airplane seat pocket, where the case for the ATs practically required its own overhead bin. These are also more comfortable as they don't completely cover the ear, though I needed a break after a couple hours of listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good headphones, noise canceling not so much","review":"While I agree with previous reviews that these are comfortable headphones, I have had problems with the noise cancellation aspect of them. I bought them with the intention of blocking out the hum (both man-made like conversations in a library or mechanical like airplane) and they are only satisfactory. Often they will actually cut out the noise of whatever podcast I am listening to, which seems to defeat the purpose. Overall I wish I had spent a little bit more and gotten a pair of headphones that would do the job better."},{"rating":"1","title":"very cheaply made fell apart 2nd use","review":"Bought these and used twice, second time the plastic headpiece snapped. Very thin plastic. Sony will not replace. Buy something else if you want to use more than twice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy These","review":"The sound quality is mediocre, and without the EQ/noise canceling switched on the natural sound of the drivers is pathetic. I mainly use them just for the noise canceling, which probably gets you 10 or 15 dB of attenuation. I have no idea where they get their claim of \\"80% noise reduction\\". They also broke pretty quickly. The drivers separated from the headband. There are so many junky headphones out there and this is just another pair. I am an audio professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad product","review":"Bad, buy some other. No bass is heard wrong, they sound weird, have the battery on or not makes no difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurts My Ears/Head","review":"I didn't even have the chance to try out the noise cancelling.. didn't have a AAA battery on hand. Unfortunately for the headphones, they're very uncomfortable in a way that I have them on for more than 5 minutes and my head starts aching. I don't have a large head (usually I run into the problem with things are too big for my head) and my younger sister tried them on and had that problem too. They press against your ear in a way that is rather uncomfortable. I haven't had over-ear headphones in a while but I don't remember my last pair being like that.The sound seemed pretty good and the earphones themselved muffled sounds without noise-cancelling on, but there's really no point in having them if they give me a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Eater","review":"It consumes a lot of batteries; you have to change the battery almost every two days. The battery chamber is heavy and annoying. It is expensive product compared to its quality. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice headphones, NR a little weak","review":"I took these phones to France and back a week ago and they performed well.Pros- Sound quality- Excellent case with space for a spare battery- Airplane headphone socket adapter included (Air France still have the old school socket)- Fold up nicely into small caseCon- Noise reduction is much less effective than my Radio Shack headphones purchased at half the price. Not horrible, but not as good as others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Things are not what they seem","review":"I'm a very big fan of the Beatles. This dvd is somewhat of a disapointment. There are 4 songs listed on the dvd box that are not on the dvd. The fool on the hill, I am the walrus, just to name a few.Most clips are from the Ed Sullivan show.

It seemed the writer wanted to tell the story without sensationalism. He succeeded to the point that the story moved slow and was not compelling. I wanted to like the book more as I admired the writer's intent. I was surprised that by the book's end, everyone affected was still clueless and blaming the events that occurred on ghosts and hauntings. This made the ending very unsatisfying to me. Read it if you're looking for an accurate account of the paranormal. If you're looking for chills, you won't find any here unless you are easily frightened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so interesting book.","review":"The book starts out fairly interesting, but then lapses into constant descriptions of noises and things that go bump in the night. The part about the old woman who abused dogs was creepy, but if you are looking to be scared out of your wits, this is not the book for you. There just was not a lot of meat here, and by the end of the book, you do not really feel as if you have gotten to know the family in question really well. I recommend Elaine Mercado's \\"Grave's End\\" for those who like to be creeped out. I really do not believe in the supernatural, but I do like these books for strict entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"This book is very porly written.

Regardless of personal beliefs, this collection of music will touch your heart and soul. Through Nusrat's voice, it is abundantly clear that this is a man leading a performance of talented artists through an emotionally intense musical experience.For those not familiar with the works of the Ali Khan family, this is an excellent starting place. The songs are long and cover a range of energy and emotion.For those familiar with other Nusrat recordings, this particular recording is a bit \\"warmer\\" than what is often encountered. In particular, there seem to be more tracks in the recording and more focus was placed on doing a true mix as opposed to trying to capture the sound in a more traditional \\"live recording\\" fashion.This is an excellent recording of a tremendous artist at his best. Highly recommended to both to the initiate and the long time fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Up!!!","review":"Why do we need a book about the evil insides of Hollywood?? Not only is this book flooded in self-promotion and third-rate insights, it serves no purpose. Bravery isn't writing a book about how bad the Hollywood film industry, bravery is DIRECTING that movie and taking the heat from THE PRODUCER if it fails. Remember, society judges by the auteur theory, which means the director takes full responsibility for the film.Plus, like an earlier review stated, if you need to read a book about this sort of thing, you probably don't realize the following: there is no Santa Claus, Rosebud was his sled, and soap opera stars don't exist in real life. \\"Killer Instinct\\" serves as a way for a typical producer to get more of what they're REALLY after -- money and attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"lightweight","review":"This book is pretty flimsy.

He's about the only one, though. Her portrait of Oliver Stone as a drug and sex-obsessed maniac is pitch-perfect (and believable).Come to think of it, an enterprising director could make a damn good film out of this story (I see Sarah Polley as Hamsher, Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Don Murphy, and Stanley Tucci as Oliver Stone.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product!","review":"Product as described, works like it should, wished the power supply was a bit longer though!

Tried it on a couple computers with different operating systems, Windows 7 64-bit and Windows Vista. Emailed company again. They gave me a return authorization number. Really? The postage to send it back would have cost almost as much as the cable did. So, this piece of unuseable hardware sits in a box.To their credit, the company did respond within a day or 2 of my emails.

This particular Joyride was an obscure indie flick.This album, sadly came out and went out of print way too quickly for anyone to even notice, but it can still be found in various places. But it's a great sampler for the 4AD fan. Nearly all the tracks feature some great songs by 4AD artists, such as Lush's \\"Desire Lines\\", Spirea X's \\"Chlorine Dream\\" and the always wonderful \\"No Motion\\" by Dif Juz.

There are some good books that help you improve Sudoku skills but this is not one of them.

So much so that I'm now online to get my next Vorderman Sudoku book.Her method takes you through 4 levels of difficulty explaining techniques for solving at each level and diagramming solutions as they are worked out.She also has scores for the puzzles which adds a little spice. For example, if your time is less than X minutes you get Y points, etc. The harder the puzzles the longer you have to solve them, but the times are often pretty challenging.Interestingly, I found that I trusted Carol to provide solvable puzzles. Some of the books I've picked up have puzzles that don't seem to be solvable - one of them even had wrong anwers in the back, i.e. the grid in the answers didn't match the grid given for the puzzle.I recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn how to solve Sudoku puzzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the (instructional) beef?","review":"Have you ever wandered who writes 5 star reviews?

Based on the reviews in Amazon, I got this book to see what else could I learn. What a dissappointment!!!The book is very basic, as others have pointed out, it only goes through very simple instructions. The book is divided in sections: Easy, Medium, Difficult and Super-Difficult, preceeding each section there are a few pages of instructional material, followed by 40-50 puzzles.The instruction is tidiously verbose, making it difficult to follow. It takes a page to explain something that could have been explained in a paragraph.

He sings exclusively in his native Italian language on these recordings and the record is in two parts. the first 12 songs are more operatic in structure, containing moody, solemn passages in which Lanza's voice excels in the passion and romantic solitude that this kind of music is so well at expressing. the remaining eight tracks are a series called The Vagabond King and it's song structures are a little bit more of the old Hollywood variety, beginning with the cheery \\"Drinking Song\\" (which was a high rated hit in the u.s.). Mario is joined by soprano Judith Raskin on 4 of the songs and his singing is in English for these songs. this is a great introduction to the world of this fabulous singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Few Could Sing Neapolitan Songs like Lanza","review":"Neapolitan music is very special and unique. It requires singing from the soul and heart and a voice that articulates the language and its many nuancesMario Lanza was not Neapolitan but he mastered the dialect and the music and the lyrics in a way that few have been able to articulate. As always, Lanza gives a wonderful performance on this album which does not need or deserve the pieces from the Vagabond King.The greatest voice of this century and the twentieth century comes out in this splendid work.

And we are in the Mother. She is our Mother and the Mother of all things. The Mother is Love. If we look to the Mother, the Mother will show us The Way. If we turn our backs on the Mother, the Mother will turn her back on us. We are nothing without the Mother. We must be One with the Mother. The Mother is all.The End.There is no story. No character development, no historical backdrop, no plot. There is only the Mother, and frankly, I wish she'd go away before she bores me to Death. If you're looking for something to tide you over until the next Jean Auel book comes out, this isn't it. Zena is about as interesting as Aba or Oga. (Who??? Exactly.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish the book","review":"In the beginning It felt like I was reading about a group of apes.

Nothing like the book, Clan of the Cave Bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focus on 3 women in early man's hisory","review":"Slow moving and shallow. The three \\"heroines\\" are all named Zena, not Xena, Warrioir Princess. Seems, from the writer's point of view, that sex and the woman is all-powerful. Controls man and his actions. Very weak story. Kept waiting for the BIG insight. Yes, I'm a man. Yes, I love nature. Yes, I love and respect women. No, I did not enjoy this book. Never felt magical to me or really spiritual. Early man and women were much more complex and thought provoking than are found in Circles of Stone. Characters were never fully developed.

Although there is definitely an appeal generated by the plot, I feel the characters are what brings this book to life. Although lambert does spend a lot of time reiterating her main points about the goddess in slightly different ways, i didn't mind much, because each time I, as she would put it, \\"felt the inexplicable truth of her words\\". the concept of woman - power, while i agree comepletely, does get just a bit repetitive after awhile. however, the descriptions, scenery, relationships and inner struggles all helped to make this book a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opteka Wide Angle & Telephoto HD Lens Set","review":"I recently purchased the Opteka .5x Wide Angle & 2x Telephoto HD Lens Set for Samsung HMX10C MX10P DC173U DC575 for around $30.00. It seemed like a good deal but as everything that is too cheap, it turned out that the the telephoto lens did hardly nothing in comparison with the camcorder's original lens. meaning, I just used the camera lens instead of the telephoto because it did not get me any closer to the subject. Needless to say the tripod and cleaning kit are useless, just something else they include in the set to call more attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good reading but exhaustive","review":"I am sure people who are interested in the American history of the latter part of the 19th century will find this book useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and not very informative.","review":"Chadwick's book was rather simplistic in approach. I looked forward to possible new insights in these individials and found none. I had the pleasure (or misfortune) of attending a book reading/discussion by Bruce Chadwick. He made several mistakes in his prepared lecture, he rambled, and he said at the begginning that he \\"did not want to write this book.\\" After spending an hour and a half listening to him speak, and another several hours reading his book, I also wish that he had never written this book. I would recommend that someone read individual biographies of Lincoln and Davis and come to their own conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two American Presidents","review":"I can make this short and sweet. This book is trash. Chadwick should stick to journalism or fiction and leave history to the historians. Definitely a lack of research or knowledge about either of the subjects.

I enjoyed the concept of a dual biography and tracing the movements of the two presidents during the Civil War years. But, after piecing together the facts, Chadwick doesn't add much depth as a writer or historian. He had an interesting game plan, but poor execution. Depending on the reader's level of Civil War study, there may be enough here to ignite an interest to read more. (It does have a great bibliography.) If you do pick up the book, be prepared for an annoying amount of misplaced facts, mistakes, and repetitive information. This book screams for an editor which it seems the publisher never provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great IDEA for a book.","review":"A parallel life of the two great antagonists of the Civil War ought to make for an exciting book. Unfortunatly, this is not it. This project cried out for someone with the gifts andd insights of a Plutarch..or a Shelby Foote. unfortunatly, the resulting text is turgid, wooden, and lacking in philosophical depth. The struggle between Lincoln and Davis was a a struggle of Philosophies and of spiritual ideals, a clash between rival understandings of America, and even of the human condition. However, that is conveyed in this well intentioned, but flawed volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Presidents - An Easy Read for High School U.S. History","review":"This book is very interesting and easy to read. There are many interesting facts about Abraham Lincoln that are woven together so that one gets an idea of what an interesting and unique person Lincoln was. His character is very nicely described. The character of Jefferson Davis is not as well revealed. I would recommend this book for a high school book report for US History."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best way to transfer video to your Ipod and PSP","review":"The Neuros Recorder will record video from any video source in MPEG4 and 3GP format.

OR I'll get the video channels but one of the audio channels will be off - just the left channel is recorded.Additionally on the highest level of Quality (TV mode) the video compression is still poor and very blocky - I was expecting much higher quality at this setting then I get.If you're considering buying this I recommend considering instead a A/V capture card for your computer - which should not have the flimsy connectors to it to cause you grief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work well","review":"I have tried this product on different TVs.

If you buy the 4 seasons, you expect to receive all 4 seasons and not 3 and 3/4 seasons with \\"Winter\\" cut short 50 seconds into the first movement. If the track was recitative It could be more easily overlooked (like the several other cue errors in this release), but that is not the case.

I was taught at school that the British Government did what it could without understanding what it was dealing with. This book describes the Irish situation, at all political, economic and ultimately human levels. The story follows the Irish travels to Northern US, UK as well, basically a pitiful struggle to be allowed to survive. Doesn't come across as biassed against GB, although now I would be.A book well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite season","review":"Not only is this the best of Coil's 4 season releases, Ametyst and Hierophant are two of the best songs in their entire career."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cure for Dressage Test Nerves!","review":"Entering a dressage show and preparing for your first test can be a nerve-wracking experience!

She even fills us in on something important to those of us who compete -- awards!Written in a down-to-earth voice, but with very clear instructions and recommendations, this is a must-recommend for dressage instructors whose students are venturing into the showring, or for the veteran who is looking to have all the critical information (including lists, rules, etc.) all in one place.Highly recommended! (I've already bought several for Christmas gifts for my dressage-showing friends.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview book","review":"I got this book used. Seller was excellent, super fast shipping and great price. The book itself is quite valuable, it has a bunch of information on how to show dressage and step by step on what will happen at a show and tons of checklists to help you be prepared. Great if you haven't been to dressage show or getting back into it after a long hiatus like myself, also great if you suffer from nerves because it has a plan and if you stick to the plan, you will do the best you can do. Obviously, since it is a book, a couple of things are out of date, so go ahead and check on the internet with the USDF for the latest about helmets and tests. But overall, great book to get you started and to help with those show ring jitters.

For instance, NBA Live 2004 is great. The graphics are excellent and the controls are realistic. I enjoy playing the game.I recently purchased NBA Live 2005 and am disgusted by what EA did to the series. The graphics are choppy, hard to see, and the players have a white reflection on them. It gives me a headache to play this game for more than an hour. I have gone back to playing NBA Live 2004, as it is a far superior game.I am not going to say the cliche, \\"I'll never buy from them again\\", but I am going to look elsewhere first before I purchase another EA title.NBA Live 2005 for the GameCube is just horrible.

The book is readable and gives you an appreciation of the detail and precision, all of the handiwork that go into a well-crafted piano. It also shows that a piano is not just a standard item -- pianos are crafted for individuals (Horowitz likes a light, responsive touch, Rubenstein wanted a more resistant touch, some performers want different tones depending on what they are playing). The only drawback (unless you're a Steinway groupie) -- it's rather self-promotional, a well-written, well-illustrated 143-page Steinway & Sons advertisement, but fascinating nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the coffee table, in a good way","review":"88 Keys is beautifully presented; a large-size book full of fine colored pencil sketches, broken down into chapters on each aspect of the piano.The book is best suited, and was probably intended, to be a coffee table book at Steinway sites. It provides an overview of the process of building a Steinway, making note of all the innovations that make Steinways pianos the most popular today.My only reservation is this: I bought it hoping that it would be geared toward the reader interested in the engineering and perhaps physics of piano building. The book provides only enough detail to *just* satisfy this interest, but I walk away like leaving the dinner table still a little hungry.Nevertheless, this book took me, in its storybook way, from no knowledge of piano manufacture to an overall satisfying knowledge. I'm definitely eager, now, to visit the Steinway factory and see it all for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I think B Stewart's review sums up a lot of the problems here, and I agree with what he says.My feeling is that 99 Keys was intended to be a coffee table book. The writing is pretty terrible, and the organization is even worse. The best comparison I can think of is that this is like a high school paper on Steinway -- some kid sat down with a bunch of books and did his best to distill them all in to one text. I don't think this would have been published had it not been a Steinway descendant at the helm.I'm also not a fan of the constant marketing angle. 88 keys is like a big ol' brochure; saying nothing remotely negative or even insightful.And I'm tired of the illustrations. Why is everything a drawing? Why are key illustrations left out, but some of the page is occupied by a \\"timeline\\" which is totally meaningless and useless.Out of all the books I've read on pianos, this is the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit For The Coffee Table","review":"88 KEYES is written for music lovers. It is not intended as a manual on the construction of a piano. It reminds me of a college course on the history of science for liberal arts majors who are not interested in becoming scientists. The book contains a history of the Steinway piano and the people behind it as well as a description of how the Steinway piano is built. It is written with clarity and lavishly illustrated. The book is definitely fit to grace the coffee table. The author incidentally is an accomplished actor and also a fifth-generation descendant of Steinway's founder."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a believer","review":"I have always been prone to allergy related sinus infections.

On days when I don't feel quite right, as if I'm fighting something off, I'll take 2 capsules.

When people die from AIDS drugs, for instance, the word \\"death\\" is studiously avoided.I have seen medical articles documenting the fact that more people now die of toxicities from AIDS drugs than from the vanishingly opaque syndrome we once called AIDS.

She is not the singer in the Carter Family and should have left Ring Of Fire stand on Johnny Cash's CD.A better choice would be her sister Anita Carter's Ring of Fire CD which was recorded in '63-64. One of the best singers in the world and the orginal artist to cut R.O.F.June's sisters and mother new when it was time to quit performing. She should have the same insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move On & Save Your Money","review":"This recording is a major disappointment. The artistic ensemble is top flight, the song selection good, and the production is fine. But it is embarrassing to listen to a singer who is so obviously past her prime. The only reason I can see for getting this CD is nostalgia. As another reviewer said, I also suggest getting Anita Carter's Ring of Fire recording. While the production is not as slick, the core of the music, the vocals, are outstanding. June Carter Cash's accomplishments are to be honored, but this CD doesn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"More, June, more","review":"We found this because my wife remembered hearing \\"Far Side Banks of Jordan\\" at a concert over 20 years ago in Dwight Illinois.

The start has a few writeups to catch the viewers up. After that, it got much better. Peter O'Toole was very good as always but looking quite frail. The horror of a government shooting people down at the sacrifice of the Mass was shocking. How easily this could happen here as well. This was a story long in being told, and was conveniently ignored and not shown in most of the USA. During the 1920s, it was the USA churches and Catholic groups, especially the Knights of Columbus, who supported and lobbyed for the relief of Mexican Catholics from their oppressive government."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserve an Oscar","review":"What a great movie.

As a faithful catholic I was amazed that I never heard this story before.

Eva Longoria will not be getting a dime of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that great","review":"This movie documents a series of events that occurred in Mexico in the 1920s. Deciding that the Catholic Church was a focus of dissent, the Mexican President(dictator) cracked down on the Catholic Church. The Vatican responded by closing all church services in Mexico. A group of dissidents start an armed revolt and win a few battles in the countryside. Then, the government and Vatican come to a compromise, the reason for the revolt dies and finally the rebel force is wiped out. One of the many sad stories of government oppression and insurrection that make up such a big part of Mexican history. Very depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right wing propaganda","review":"When a movie has a critic rating of 35 and users rate it so high in Amazon you can tell there's either a lot of personal emotions on this movie or there's a campaign to improve this movie's ratings.Make no mistake this movie is BAD.This movie was made by the Mexican religious right wing (Yes, we have a very strong one) to try to justify a \\"War\\" between the cristeros, who started it by assassinating teachers who were trying to provide secular education to rural Mexico, and a government that handled this crisis very poorly; all ended with the help of the US who had just realized how much oil reserves were available in Mexico.Watch it if you like catholic propaganda movies, avoid it otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Greater Glory","review":"For Greater Glory was very enlightening regarding this time in Mexico's history.

I use the 24 hour dial as a second time zone which is a rather novel idea for a simple watch. Although, it does gain time at about one second a week, which is less than the reported specs. The E6B ajustment is easy to turn, but for a right hander it is rather cumbersome to operate while the watch is on the left arm. The adjustment knob could have been located on the right side of the watch. Otherwise, it is a very nice watch for the price range. The flat lens is really pretty much glare free."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Independence Shines","review":"Hruby's first novel is a winner! She has found the heart and soul of a woman who is fiercely independent, and shared it with her readers. Catherine is a woman who struggles with her sense of self because society has dictated the rules, but she doesn't fit. She is the square peg and the world around her is the round hole. No matter which way she turns or who she tries to please she is distinctively herself, much to her fiancee's chagrin. As the story moves on, we are witness to her family and friends, all who support her and love her as she struggles to figure out who she is and what she wants. Every woman needs a safety net such as this underneath them, and Hruby brings it home."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I'm the wrong audience for this novel","review":"I bought this book at a library book sale because it was short and a paperback so easy to carry while traveling. I didn't know anything about it and so had no expectations. As I read the novel, I became increasingly annoyed and distracted by the triviality of it, which resulted in a \\"who cares \\" attitude toward the characters in the story. I didn't really finish the book -- finally giving up toward the end, though I slipped away to the end to see how it would turn out. The writing is competent, but unless you are interested in relentless descriptions of weddings and the struggles of a young single woman in NYC, I'd give this novel a pass. Unfortunately, I was in the mountains of Wyoming and had nothing else to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant contradictions","review":"Funny, the \\"negative\\" quality that bothered other readers is the very thing that drew me in to The Trouble With Catherine. Does that make me a sourpuss? I don't think so. What Hruby recognizes is that the most interesting characters in fiction and life are the ones whose flaws are apparent rather than hidden beneath layers of mannered insincerity. It takes a certain amount of bravery to walk out on that ledge, risking the scorn of people who prefer the pretty surfaces of things. I'm looking forward to Hruby's next effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected at all","review":"Having just read \\"The Charm Stone\\", I was ready to be impressed with this book. It was a disappointment in most ways. It takes about 200 dull pages to come the point, (which, by the way, the reader will figure out about page 60), and is generally slow. I never managed to identify with either the hero or heroine. In fact, the heroine is dropped out for a couple of chapters and you find that you don't even notice or care. The ending was superficial and unsatisfying.This book had the potential to give us an intriguing Otherworld, but simply fell short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you must and have nothing to do.....","review":"I must say that this was not what I thought it would be, the book I mean.I have read two books of Ms. Kauffman and it seems like this story is missing something.In Royal Hunter, I thought that when it comes to the main char. the story is going somehow very slow and rushing when it was about the others.When I was about 2/3 of the book, still nothing happened in the story.(saving the future queen and country)If I've known I'd chosen another book to read but I think it's ok when you really have nothing special to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not THe Best","review":"The 1932 serial Shadow of the Eagle stars John Wayne in one of the many films he made before he became a major star.

After that show, I bought this CD at the shwag table.Unfortunately, when I got it home and popped it in tht player, it didn't quite hit the mark. There are some very stellar moments but they are few and far between. Also, if their live show was any indication, it seems that they've drifted more towards a harder, edgier, punkier, alien spacewoman synth sound than is present on this albumn.My rating is heavy handed with 2 stars, but would have had 3 stars if the quality was consistently good, or 4 even if it was consistently good as the best tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not a BOOK","review":"This bad document, this is not a book.

And if I do not have the box with me I cannot.All in All worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforunately is great, but ...","review":"This little gadget is amazing and the effects sound beautiful but it doesn't work at all with Windows 7, at all, after a couple of seconds you will not get any sound. By the time of this writting (march 2010) Line 6 hasn't been able to release a steady driver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cultural Gap Almost Bridged","review":"It is extremely interesting to read the customer reviews such as the one which gives this book a low rating because it has \\"an unsatisfying ending\\". You will find a review at Amazon.co.jp on the same book saying the exact opposite. The best part of the book, the Japanese reader says, is the ending. The rest of the book is just a prelude. In spite of the favorable rating by most of the reviewers of the English version, these opposing reviews speak more about the book than all the rest. It is a book that almost comes across over the cultural gap. As such, the English version - despite the numerous informative passages - is something of a strip tease as well as a mystery. Don't expect an American novel. This book will not easily fit into a familiar formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This is an exceptional book. There are layers under layers of plot and the characterizations are truly brilliant. Miyabe is amazingly deft and I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Translate more Miyabe","review":"I liked this book very much and lent it to many others. I agree with the other reviewers here that it transcends the mystery category. Recently saw one of Miyabe's ghost stories performed at New York's Japan Society -- that also was excellent. Have been looking for other work by the author but it appears nothing else has been published in English. It would be great if Random House (or another publisher) would pick up her backlist and translate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I read a lot of detective fiction, but usually not contemporary thrillers because they tend to be far too gory for my taste. I bought this on the recommendation of a friend, and found it thoroughly enjoyable. The central mystery is tightly plotted, and the characters are well observed.I loved that I learnt a lot about Japanese culture that I wasn't previously aware of. I think it's true to say this story coudn't be set any where else, because there are key plot points that revolve around some idiosyncratic aspects of Japanese law.When I first read this book, nothing else by Miyuki Miyabe had been translated, now several other titles are available in English, and all of them are on my wish list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"This book was completely disappointing. I am amazed that it received so many 5 star reviews and that it won prestigious awards in Japan; that is just mind boggling. As pointed out by the other 1 and 2 star reviews, this book is long winded, rather dull, has a repeating chapter format and then just abruptly ends without any resolution AT ALL. I felt like reading this book was a complete waste of time and would recommend that, if you are considering reading this book, reconsider and maybe select another book. This author received so much credit, from this book it is hard to imagine the other books being any better. I might try another book from this author in the future but I must admit I am very hesitant to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"All She Was Worth","review":"There is a nice part about Japanese accents. The book was very odd, even I think I understand what the author was trying to do. It wasn't a real detective story. It was more mapping lives of people without financial literacy and the ethics of Japanese society. \\"Workers of the world unite; you have nothing to lose but your chains.\\" Karl Marx"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good!","review":"Of course I bought it for the price.

Well... not this version of band music and marches. The recording engineering is of poor quality. Even if the sound quality were good, it couldn't help this particular performance. The performance is very bland. It lacks any dynamic range and certainly lacks in spirit.After this purchase, I'll stick to more well-known groups, like Williams Fairey and Tokyo Kosei."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hockey game!","review":"I heard this game is cool.

It was a simple fix, but the product would be better if it had metal around the screw holes to prevent this from happening.Other minor comment is that it would be nice to have the router latch in. I've got mine mounted on the ceiling and if something gets caught on the cables the router will easily slide out of the mount."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good thought for the Airport Extreme","review":"Though delayed, I wanted one for my Airport Extreme.

Airports have been hanging on the wall without any problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for practice of situations","review":"This is a great book to practice different situations with your friends or read on your own. It shows you different SOAP charting, nurses notes, doc orders, pt H&P. All the same info as you would find in a chart, you can learn how to read it, how you can write it yourself. Situations are general (most common) diseases you learn about in the beginning of classes. This is the exact same book one of my instructors used for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic SF Reader","review":"Ah, 'The Mendicants'.

Wodehouse's Blandings Castle stories. Peter O'Toole is terrific as the rather foggy-headed, pig-loving Clarence, Master (sort of ) of Blandings Castle, and Richard Briers is Gally Threepwood come to life. Intimidating Sisters, young lovers, and Beach the Butler are all played to perfection. Tremendous fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be misled by the title","review":"Don't be misled by the title of this import CD -- it is not, as I had hoped, an import version of the surprisingly fabulous 1994 Carpenters tribute album of the same name, with tracks from alternative music acts ranging from Shonen Knife to Cracker to Matthew Sweet to 4 Non Blondes. Instead, it's a smarmy rehash of Carpenters songs by a bunch of artists (unidentified here) who add nothing to, and in multiple cases detract from, the original versions.

Bourelly filters the Hendrixian musical experience through Funk and Free Jazz prisms, producing music that has the right balance of rhythmic thrust and harmonic adventurousness. \\"Trippin'\\" is slightly more mainstream than some of his other work, but it is nevertheless a quality listen. High points include \\"Supernatural\\", \\"Love Crimes\\", and \\"Stranger.\\" Bourelly's guitar is stellar throughout; alternately searing, funky and cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"All The Way With JBP","review":"If only as a point of reference about post-Hendrix guitar, you should get \\"Trippin'\\". \\"Love Crime\\" \\"Garden of Love\\" \\"Stranger\\" and the title cut sear with great writing, inspired singing and killer, I repeat KILLER GUITAR work. I went to see Jean-Paul everywhere he played in NYC in 91 & 92 just for \\"LoveCrime\\" alone. If you love Vernon, swear by BB, Albert & Freddy and realise that this is another of the great Miles Davis sidemen. Get a copy of this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"ECCENTRIC GUITAR GENIUS","review":"This may not be the easiest CD to get into, but when you do it is very,very rewarding. BOURELLY can play the guitar as well as anyone and has most probably captured the spirit of HENDRIX better then just about everyone. His musik doesn't fit into the HENDRIX mould and is highly original, with heavy grooves and tasty solos that for the most part stay right away from all cliche's. His tone is very HENDRIX and his vocals also pay homage to JIMMI. The lyrics are there to fill the space between solos and the grooves are vehicles for BOURELLY's exceptional and eccentric guitar stylings. After a few weeks this is almost permanently on my CD player and I am still discovering new things. If you like the guitar you should have this. Another example of totally original guitar work that can also entertain and challenge.P.S. If you want to get into BOURELLY, this is the CD to start with. The others I have bought arn't quite as good or consistent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mouth Watering And Body Sweating","review":"If you ever had \\"miss Jane gorgeous teacher\\" in your life and you wanted to give her more than a red apple these is the video to buy....buy....buyIf all women looked these fabulous you would beg for all women to be forty"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forkchops","review":"Cheap plastic stamped forkchops.

If you were around when these films were released, it's a great memory to have but also, to share with your kids. John Williams score to the Star Wars series goes way beyond just film music. It's become part of our culture really.

What kind of garbage is that?! George Lucas pours huge amounts of money into restoring and unecessarily adding to the original films, but he won't spend a little bit more for the one, most important element that actually made each of those films exciting. Instead, he offers gimmicks. Who cares about new packaging, which sucks by the way, and ooooooh!, screensavers!, I'm gonna run out and spend $55 dollars, so I can own those never before released screensavers and forget all about the fact that, once again, John Williams' treasures have been robbed of a proper treatment. Nothing but disrespect for the man who single handedly brought orchestral film scores back from the dead. Shame on George and shame on Sony for such half ass work."},{"rating":"1","title":"DSD but no SACD??????","review":"what gives? They remastered these in DSD but they don't have an SACD release of these? Is Sony going Beta on us again? It seems that if they went through the trouble of remastering them in DSD, they would also go through the trouble of recording them on SACD. If they did, I would actually buy them. Since they didn't, they can rot on the shelves for all I care. Especially since I already own the Special Edition versions. This soundtrack would be another perfect opportunity for Sony to showcase SACD, instead they decide to blow it.BTW, the 1 star is for Sony being putzes and not for the music itself.

Greg Giuffria is of course a first-class keyboard player. But his instrumental skills don't compensate for the more serious drawbacks on this CD. The songwriting is rather uninspired, with few interesting melodic ideas. Further, the gravel-laden vocals don't fit well with this musical style. Greg Giuffria has played with several other bands, so listeners who enjoy his keyboard work would be better advised to buy the either first two Angel albums, or the first few albums by House of Lords. These were both more melodic and more progressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"just get these 3 CDs!","review":"I got this box after listening some Morillo and Mixmag releases of the Eivissa (aka Ibiza) night.

In a world where all CDs have started sounding the same, it was an exhilarating pleasure to listen to Pia Taylor's, We Follow Jesus. You can tell that a great deal of time and effort went into putting this project together. Every time I listed to it, I hear something new. The musical performances are great -- the vocals inspirational. It has been a long time since I have liked so many songs on a single CD. I just hope that this product reaches the same type of prominence as a CD from Fred Hammond or Kirk Franklin. This should be heard by as many people as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Think carefully about why you want this towel before you buy it. If you need a towel that dries quickly (like for the beach), then this would be great for you. If you don't need the towel dry until the next time you take a shower, then probably a less expensive towel would do just as well. What I don't like about the towel is that it rubs/drags across wet skin instead of glides the way a cotten towel does. It does NOT feel soft and luxurious. It dries quickly and takes up very little space, but it does not feel good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost","review":"Well, the reviews made it seem dreamy, but it's not quite there for me. The fabric is thin, so it makes it a bit strange to dry yourself off.Also, it's a cream color, and not white at all - I'm disappointed in that, for sure.I think I'll go back to plushy cotton towels - this was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic towel","review":"I had read how nice microfiber towels were. I'm certainly sorry I believed the people who said this. What a total waste of money. It took this towel, another small worthless micro fiber towel and a regular terry cloth towel to get my hair and myself dry after taking a shower and I have short hair. This microfiber towel was completely worthless as far as getting you dry. I could get drier using a thin worn out regular towel, than I did with this towel. I wish I could get my money back for the worthless thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"pluses and minuses","review":"What I love: Using this towel to dry my long hair -- when I wrap it around my hair like a turban, it's amazingly light and it stays put, unlike a regular towel. For this reason alone, I use it every day and will probably get at least one more.Pleasant surprise: I thought it might catch on my dry skin the way microfiber sometimes does, but I haven't had a problem with that.What's just OK: It seems to be no more (or less) absorbent than my thick cotton towels, and hanging in the bathroom, it takes just as long to dry.What I don't like: I don't think it looks as nice hanging on the towel rack as my colorful cotton towels do. It would, however, look awesome in a sleeker, eco-modern style bathroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing--just pushes water around","review":"We were excited to try this towel after reading all the great reviews, and were really disappointed. We used it as a bath towel, and it's just worthless. It pushes the water around by doesn't absorb--flat out, it doesn't dry you. Or at least, it doesn't feel like it's drying you. Definitely not for everyone, and not for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin and powerful","review":"These towels are the most absorbent towels I have met, but they are not the soft, plush towels that belonged in a five star hotel. They are thin, quick drying and rather ruff. Towel warmers are lost on them since the heat dissipates quickly. The towel does not slide across wet skin pulling water with it so a new technique of patting must be learned, which can be tricky when drying one's back. However, once the drying technique is learned you may never go back to traditional cotton towels since these towels dry the body qui"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Micro Fiber Towels","review":"These are the best micro fiber towels on the market and they are great to pack and take with you on a trip.

They are so much thinner and lightweight than regular towels - they take up less space in the washer. This is a great benefit. The greatest benefit of all though, is the improvement in the health of my hair that I have experienced. I have been using this each morning on my hair for about 2 months and have noticed a significant increase in the shine and smoothess of my hair. I wrap it up each morning as soon as I get out of the shower and after I comb my hair. I continue to get ready until all that is left is my hair. By this time, my hair is just barely damp and a quick blowdry only lasts 3 minutes. I have had less breakage with this reduction in exposure to heat (blowdryer). My hair looks the best that it has in years. I'm thrilled! I also bought the one designed specifically for hair, but I perfer this one because it is more comfortable and seems to absorb better."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best of the quick dry towels.","review":"I have bought nearly every brand of quick dry towels and can say that this is the best. The surface feels more natural and less like a synthetic. The waffle style absorbs water more quickly and thoroughly and also dries more quickly.

Come up with 12-15 popular songs and ways to butcher their artistic integrity.4. Find some 11-year-old with PhotoShop to make the cover art. Remember, the bigger \\"KIDZ BOP\\" is, the better!5. Market your CD with never-ending commercials, chock-full of kids that didn't even sing the songs and probably will never be seen in the acting world again, \\"But THAT'S NOT ALL!\\"s, and demands for COD/debit card payments.And voila!

My son absolutely beamed over the pictures, espicially the peas, the dog, and the firetruck. I love that I'm learning with him, and it is easy because the pronunciations are spelled out in a way that is easy to understand. He knows over half of the cards in Spanish by now. Additionally, and unforseen, my eighteen year old and her boyfriend like to hold the cards up and try to pronounce the words in all of the languages: Spanish, French, Russian, German, Hebrew, Japanese.

My kid loves these cards to toss around and throw. They are very poor if you want to teach with them. The items on the cards are from the videos. So for instance, a bear is a plastic bear with a violin from one of the videos. Some of the items are difficult to identify for this reason. Also they have things like rooster and chicken (which are difficult to differentiate) and a clock that looks like a toy. I let my son throw these cards around and bought two sets of DK My First Flash cards (Animals and Numbers and Counting), where a horse looks like a horse and not some stupid toy from a video(a.nd they are cheaper!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I just purchased these for my 7 month old and was disappointed to find most of the pictures are photos of stuffed animals (lamb, pig, owl etc.) and not photos of the real thing. The picture of a bear is playing a violin and the star is unidentifiable. However, I do like that there are several languages printed on the back and the cards are big, bright and durable. These cards would have been excellent if only a pig was a photo of a real pig and not a pink ball of fluff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor product","review":"Each card is related to some Baby Einstein video, seems like they are constantly cross-selling their products.What's worse the pictures are not prototypical of the word being introduced, e.g. most of the animals are stuffed toys which barely look like the original.Extremely disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in these cards.

For example, the image of what is supposed to be a bear--- is actually a plastic bear figurine playing a violin!!! Is that what we want to teach our young children??? A bear is natural, big, living creature....and I have never seen one play a violin! The same goes for the image of the duck, frog, fish, etc... they are all images of ugly plastic toys! These cards are poorly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"why not use photos of real animals?","review":"I'm so disappointed in these cards - I plan to tape my own photos or cut outs from magazines to fix them.

They do have educational value and are generally well done. The description of the flash cards includes the following \\"Each beautifully illustrated card features real-life images...\\". What about 50% of the cards featured were \\"real-life images\\" of stuffed animals. I expected a photo of a cow, pig, rooster, etc. There were photos or photo-realistic images of the fruits, but not of the animals. It was like a catalog for the toys used in the videos. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you use in conjunction with the videos","review":"I bought this cards thinking that they had true photographs of the actual objects. Instead, the animals are the stuffed creations from the videos and not photos of real animals at all.

I think this set is only useful when used with the videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped","review":"The concept for these cards is great, but I do not recommend you buy them. The pictures of the animals are not of animals at all, but of stuffed toys that barely even resemble the animals \\"depicted.\\" Children would be confused by, for example, a frog that barely even resembles a real frog. I pulled all of the \\"warped\\" cards and have used the remaining ones with my daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I definitely agree with what another reviewer wrote that these are just a plug for the videos.

I wouldnt waste my time or money on any of the baby einstein flashcards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other cards in the series","review":"These cards display stuffed animals instead of real animals. They are usually the same animals featured in the different videos. Some of the animals aren't recognizable to a young child, so they aren't very useful. There are some useful cards, like the pictures of some fruits and vegetables. However, these cards are overall very disappointing. Instead of real instruments, they feature play horns that, again, are likely featured in the videos.

In such cases, the make or break factor is how well the book is written. If you can figure out the ending, the key is in the telling. Is the book bad enough that the reader puts it down or good enough that, despite the predictability of the plot, it is worth staying with? In this case, it's clearly the latter. King clearly knows his way around a newsroom; considering his background, he should. But he doesn't just know it, he makes it come alive and gives a good feel for the pulse and pace of putting out a paper (alliteration not intended). He puts a nice spin on stock situations (the pressuring editor, the stoic detective, etc) and weaves a tale that holds attention. I really liked the book and found it a compelling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye","review":"King is definitely one of my favorite authors.

The bracket mounts onto your camera or DSLR rig with the twist of the knob which tightens it to the camera or rig. The tightening of the lock down part is a bit weak - just needs some occassional tightening but overall, this really does the job of allowing you to split 2 items into a spot on your camera that only held one i.e. light & mic, mic and monitor, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elegance was SOOOOOOOOOO much better!","review":"This little volume was obviously written on the heels of the much better \\"Elegance\\", a book I found both helpful and fascinating.

There was nothing I liked about it, and I actually threw the book away.One other comment: the paper this was printed on was flimsy and looked like newsprint.

Don't look to us for sympathy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An excuse for sin","review":"Mr. Warnke is a proven liar and a false prophet. To claim that he is a victim of Christian \\"witch\\" hunting is to ignore the ... sins he has committed in the name of Christ. Truly he is the victimizer! If only Mr. Warnke would repent of his sins and come clean, like David of the Bible.

If you played through the game once, the guide offers no additional use in changing your gameplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly romantic and heartwarming","review":"I agree with the others that Jill Barnett has an exceptional ability to make her readers FEEL, laugh, and cry with the hero and heroine. The undercurrent sentimentalism and idealism make the very emotional story even more beautiful. Another remarkable thing about this book is that the supportive characters (Alec and Joy, for example) get enough pages that anyone who didn't know them before will rush and read their story the moment they finish \\"Dreaming,\\" though it is definitely one of the books you never want to see the end of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like Barnett's other efforts!","review":"I read bewitching before I read this one and I have to say that this was not quite what I expected. The heroine was PATHETIC!! All that \\"prone to accidents\\" mixed with her begging the hero to love her was sickening! The hero wasn't even very likeable- hero my butt, he's a drunk jerk! She gives no real reason for his drinking other than to say he feels giult over his father & brother's deaths. I found myself skimming over pages just to get to the end. This was over the top with regards to a pathetic heroine & a drunk, callous jerk...overall, a real waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice dream.","review":"If you loved \\"Bewitching\\", you'll love \\"Dreaming\\".Letitia Olive Hornsby, a curly-haired, blue-eyed hellion thinks that Richard, the dashing, handsome, and totally disreputable son of the Earl of Downe, is the white knight of her dreams.Letitia's courtship of Richard is full of accidents, and he soon has the bruises to prove it.When a ring of dangerous smugglers makes them prisoners, Richard falls in love with his insufferable, although unforgettable, cellmate.Great supporting cast.Warning: Do not read in public, you'll laugh out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost exceptional book...","review":"I'm not a big fan of romances in general, but Barnett's 'Dreaming' is worth reading. It contains lovable characters, an interesting plot, and some funny moments. I particularly love the hero and heroine's interactions with each other. Certain scenes would take me from tears to laughter in a matter of paragraphs.Maybe I'm just a relentless romantic and was glad that Letitia's persistance finally paid off or maybe it was the way Richard slowly fell in love with Letitia, but something made this book one of my all-time favorites.However, I couldn't give this book five stars simply because it assumes that the reader has finished some other Barnett work. I didn't care about the characters of Joy and Alec and wondered why they were even in it. Maybe if I had read the previous book, I'd care about them, but I didn't and felt precious page space was being wasted on them. That and the somewhat strange use of magic kept me from giving 'Dreaming' five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story","review":"This was a very good read!

There is an ever elusive man in every womens life but in this story it was the very elusive Letty - she just made no sense! Ever. The author could have developed her characters self esteem, maturity and decison making. However there was nothing and I was left reading a book about a 10 year old girl and her crush.

Unless you like a heroine that is a little girl that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book although funny at times is also too shalow for me.","review":"There are two types of Ms. Barnet's novels, one is where the heroine is so childish and dimwitted that I feel like shaking her from time to time (e.g. Bewitching, Dreaming, Wild); the other one is where the heroine has a good common sense, can be serious but still funny and loving (e.g. Wonderful, Imagine, Carried Away) these novels I would strongly recommend for my friends. Dreaming simply fell into the first category, which is way I gave it only 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one's for the recycling bin.","review":"I've been reading romance novels since I was eleven, but this is the first book I've read that has ever seemed to have been written BY an eleven-year-old. Letty's \\"dreaminess\\" and hopeless infatuation with Richard made her seem like a cross between a child and a mentally handicapped person. Richard was simply the typical, jaded hero whose opinion of Letty changed inexplicably from her being a pathetic disgrace to a desirable siren. The fiascos and side characters throughout the book were just unrealistic and irritating, and the only genuine scene is thrown in haphazardly on the last few pages. The book was okay for a quick skim, and I think the author shows potential for talent, but clouds the basics with inane attempts at humor. I don't plan to read her other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard, the Earle of Downe, is far from a hero type.","review":"But Letty, the awkward, disaster-prone, girl-next-door, sees that the true Richard is indeed the knight-on-a-white charger that she's dreamed of all her life. The hard part is convincing Richard of that....I don't normally care for reluctant heroes, nor heroines who wear their hearts on their sleeves. But there's something about Jill Barnett's writing that makes it acceptable--the characters, the dialog, the hilarious situations, the suggestion that the most unlikely dreams can actually come true in spite of all odds.I haven't read \\"Bewitching\\" either, but you can be sure I will as soon as I get hold of a copy. In fact, I'm going to be hunting as many of Jill Barnett's backlist as I can find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, funny historical romance..","review":"This was an excellent sequel to Bewitching. Jill Barnett carried on the characters from Bewitching and used humor to bring them to life.I would recommend this book to anyone who like's romance novels that are highly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it, don't buy it.","review":"It is a horrible movie as every one of Frank Sinatra's that I have seen are. In this one Frank tries to alternate between a wise cracking comedian and a cynical alcoholic and fails at both. The film just doesn't make it and it is way too long. If you have to see it, get it from the library or rent it, don't waste your money buying it. I can just imagine the crowd leaving a theater back in the 50's who paid their money to see this one just because it had Sinatra, Maclain, Dean Martin, etc. and were sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Dave Hirsch (Frank Sinatra), an ex-soldier and writer whose best work is in his past, returns to his small-town roots only to be confronted by hypocrisy at every turn. Every element of this meandering drama is predictable and every character a stereotype. We never get under the skin of Sinatra's character to understand why he is so moody and brooding, thereby compromising his role as a foil for the community at large. It was difficult to understand the intense loyalty he provokes in the gambler Bama (Dean Martin) and the floozy Ginny (Shirley MacLaine). Magnificent work by MacLaine and supporting actor Arthur Kennedy, as Sinatra's brother, are not enough to save the film. The climax is overwrought and predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic in anyone's language !","review":"The movie is as good as the novel. The standout though is really Shirley Maclaine's portrayal of the hapless floozy for which she was Oscar nominated.

It is one of my favorite albums. I haven't been able to find that version on CD so I decided to buy Reiner's version and Eugene Ormandy's version to see if either were close to Stowkowski's interpretation. I was very disappointed in this version. The quieter passages are so low that you have to raise the volume to hear them and then lower it again for the louder passages. Also, the violin solos, which I feel are the most beautiful parts of the piece, are difficult to hear unless you really raise the volume. The violin solos represent Scherezade and should stand out. The Eugene Ormandy version has much better sound and comes much closer to Stowkowski's version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bedtime story book","review":"I grew up on fairy tales, dark stories with ambiguous meanings.

It's hard to get balances right with all the leakage and reflections you encounter in a live environment. But this CD is really good, probably because it was recorded in a smallish venue, and by a great engineer. Landau's band's dynamics come across well.

Superb album and perhaps the finest mixing I've heard yet on his work. In my opinion, the top songs here are: the title track, which is classic Dwight; Intentional Heartache (haven't heard this much energy and fun since Long, White Cadillac); I'll Pretend (wish he'd do a duet with Marty Stuart); and \\"...Love Again\\". On the other hand, I was hoping for a little more bluegrass/Appalachian sound, but as always, his next album will be better and I'm sure will include a good barn-burner. Not sure what I think about the funky intro to \\"She'll Remember\\", but hey, it's Dwight, and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I Have Heard This Year","review":"I have been a casual Dwight Yoakam fan since he arrived on the scene and must admit I had not heard much from him in a while. I heard Don Imus mention on his show about a month ago that he had heard DY's new CD and he couldn't be more effusive in his praise. Knowing that the I-Man has a great taste in music but can also be ascerbically critical, I took his comments to heart and bought Blame the Vain on the Tuesday of its release. I have to give DI credit, DY and BTV simply blew me away. I don't think there is an average song in the set (all superior) and I also think it breaks new country ground while pulling in and paying respect to those sounds and styles that have defined the genre. If The Beatles ever did country, I think they would have sounded a lot like this. And that is not a bad place to be. Kudos Dwight on this superb, trailblazing release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor: buy this album","review":"I have turned many people on to DY who swore up and down they \\"hated\\" country. If you're looking for more substance and texture (both music and lyrics) in a 3-4 minute song than can be found in many other forms of popular music, Dwight Yoakam is your artist.Pardon the analysis but Dwight understands basic emotions of the human condition, and it's on display in his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best album of 2005","review":"this is the best album of 2005 to me anyways. i just love everysong on this album i listen to it at least twice a day and will for a while. you cant go wrong with dwight yoakam he is my very favorite country artist ever. i have been a fan since 86' with guitars and caddys. and in fact i think this albums comes close to those days, its that good. if not better. listen , buy, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"DWIGHT'S BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!","review":"Count me in with the others who've praised this exciing new disc. By surrounding himself with a great band and his own solid songwiting make this cd a real winner. The passion that Dwight and the band have for this music is clear cut and a real treat to listen to.

You will get the 2 discs that were offered as extras. HOWEVER, you will get a duplicate of the series finale disc \\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\". In other words disc 1 of THIS set is the same as Disc 3 of the \\"Season 11\\" set. Which means, if you want the equivalent of the Megaset in 12 sets of 3, you will need to trade your duplicate to a friend for a copy of the movie. Personally, I am glad I waited and bought the megaset. At the time the price was better, and plus where I got it, I had a gift card from a supervisor to cash in, plus some \\"bonus bucks\\" from that store and a 30% coupon. So all I had to \\"shell out\\" of \\"my own\\" money was 50% of the \\"list price\\".

I wish the lead female role would have been hers. Of course the first movie had to explain how Val came to be a knight. I hope the film company will make another one.

While the book is stunning in its revelations about the virulent hatred which can lie beneath the surface of an innocuous-seeming merchant or housewife, it shows that a brave citizenry can and did conquer it.

This is not quite as bad as soukous and ndombolo, though. If a copy comes up for under ten bucks, maybe give it shot, but you won't miss anything if you don't.There are a few toe-tapping numbers that would sound good if you heard the radio or at a party, but, so what? There is a lot of wasted talent on this record and it's ashamed that Franco's musicians and singers couldn't dig deeper. The first song is the same as the seventh song. Yes you read that right. Franco and TPOK wrote 2 songs a week for over 30 years and Franco wrote half those songs himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Henry knows all of BC hunting like the back of his hand","review":"This book if filled with tales of the great outdoors in beautiful BC.

They swim in schools and I was thrilled that it worked.On my second kayak fishing outing a couple of days later, the watch receiver kept saying \\"no signal\\". I made sure I was using the correct channel, the distance wasn't too far, etc. It turned out the transmitters battery was dead. I had a second transmitter with me (the RF-45) and that one gave me a signal, but its non-replaceable battery also died by the end of the day. At $25 per RF-45 transmitter unit, I realized it was cheaper to buy the Norcross Hawkeye F33P Fish Finder that I can use with rechargeable triple-A batteriesNorcross Hawkeye F33P Fish Finder.

Ari Marmell. It satisfies on so many levels, I hardly know where to begin. Not only does it wrap up the nearly 13-year story arc established in the roleplaying game, but it also gives some much-needed insight into the motives and methods of some of the line's most enduring signature characters in these, the final nights. As a piece of gaming fiction, Gehenna, the Final Night is superlative. As a first novel, it's a remarkable achievement. Even those whose taste for the game runs tepid are sure to get a thrill out of this wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first love affair with the signature characters and more!","review":"I love this book, mostly because I love the slick, clever characteristics Marmell applies to the characters. In truth, this is the first V:tM novel I've read, being a fan of the game. Anyhow, the story and its end were satisfying and the plot shifts were less-than-subtle which also helped in alot of the action scenes. The one thing that itched at the back of my mind was how much Marmell alludes to the fact that they're vampires, comparing them more than once in a chapter to the mortals. I'm not going to make examples and it was the VERY least of problems I found in the book. Great book, plot, characters, and action sequences. A must-read for those who love the Dark Fantasy genre or players of V:tM or ToJ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This album is a joke.

Commander Dudley \\"Mush\\" Morton. The author served under Commander Morton and much of what he learned, about aggressiveness, tactics and the handling of a crew under great stress, was aboard the Wahoo as Executive Officer. The Wahoo was lost with all hands and this book is a fine tribute to Commander Morton, his crew and the Wahoo.

Before he skippered Tang, O'Kane served as exec aboard Wahoo. Using American and Japanese records, he was able to do a magnificent job of recreating Wahoo's final patrol, which resulted in the loss of the sub and all hands aboard. Readers who enjoy this solid bit of historical re-creation ought also to buy Clear the Bridge!, which details O'Kane's patrols and loss of Tang, and his imprisonment at Omori camp along with Pappy Boyington of VMF-241.

O'Kane's writing style is somewhat wooden and the narrative does not always flow well; but he was there and is the definitive authority on the Wahoo and her Captain, Dudley Mush Morton. His speculation of the Wahoo's demise is somewhat dated due to more information that has come to light from Japanese archives.... A better read is Flucky's account of the Barb, \\"Thurnder Below.\\" But if you want to know about the Wahoo or WWII subs, you have to read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Being a retired naval officer and former submariner, I was very familiar with Dick O'Kane's exploits on Wahoo during WWII. I thought this book would really tell his story, but in my opinion it did not. The story is certainly there, but this book is so poorly written that I couldn't get past Chapter 3. An editor who had submarine experience and an experienced co-writer or ghost writer would have helped also. Each page left me with a feeling that there was more to be said, things just weren't complete.CAPT O'Kane seems to leave out much of the technical explanations of the submarine and how it is operated. Maybe things get a little better further down the line, but right now I'm not going to waste my time finding out. I'll just sit back and remember this courageous submarine captain based on what I knew prior to trying to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in the west","review":"Ben is the main person in this story.

I only felt two of the songs on this album, Homicide and Queens Is because Prodigy is in that one. I don't see how he can have so much confidence, all he has to do is listen to his own album and see that it is nowhere near the greatness of other artists.

But ultimately, like christ, she succombs to the evils of this society..

While there, I tried to place myself in the role of one of the victims arriving by train and living in one of the barracks until my death. The author does give a realistic portrayal of the fate of so many humans. One must admire Wallenberg for the risks he took and the creative ways he used to help the Jews in Hungary.

And according to all available evidence, Bresson pushed reality to its furthermost possible extreme by actually having all of these outrages visited on the living beast who was Balthasar in the film. The animal's suffering was authentic. Personally, I would question the compassionate spirituality of a director who expressed his artistic vision by repetitiously, almost compulsively torturing a helpless animal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joyless film","review":"What a disappointment this film was after reading a stellar review of 4 stars on [..] The review compared Balthazar the donkey as a type of Christ, a suffering servant who doesn't complain and then finally dies.

Relationships were surface and there was nothing uplifting or transforming regarding the film's characters. Instead, the film is depressing...devoid of hope and true faith.

American heiress, Julia Lofting, living in England, leaves her domineering and cruel husband, Magnus, after the unexpected death of their young daughter. She then buys an old Georgian house, which she hopes will pave the way fir a new beginning for her. Unfortunately, not only wont her husband leave her alone, but the house seems to have a mind of its own.Before she knows it, Julia is living a haunted existence, and her life continues to unravel. As her house of cards comes tumbling down around her, Julia discovers much about the house and her husband. Unfortunately, none of it is good. As the past intrudes upon the present, the feeling of dread and angst mounts as the story barrels down to the grand finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anticlimatic","review":"I really don't understand the comparisons to \\"Rosmary's Baby\\", \\"Julia\\" lacked the wit,intrigue and mystery that RB did and had one of the most anticlimatic endings I've read in a long time. What I found to be true about this book is that the favorable reviews do a better job of describing the intent than the book itself. By the end you are left wondering WHY the ghost was so evil when it was alive. What was it about it's personality that made it want to continue to live to haunt others. Well when you find out these answers , you are left disappointed especially after the build up of the first 150 pages. The novel Ringu did a 100% better job of letting you know the horror behind the supernatural being. This novel really left it up to the reader to imagine those circumstances. This is not one of Straubs best."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"Quite honestly one of the worst manga I've ever read, the transition into an American manga has either left Corrector Yui a far cry from what it was meant to be, or it never had any potential in the first place. The word balloons are mangled with a terrible, ugly font, and the story is lame. The characters have all the depth of crustaceans, and the entire thing rings of a cheap cardcaptor sakura bootleg, only not as cute or interesting. Yui has no strength as a main character and her supporting cast are all either forgettable or annoying. I say steer clear of this book at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The River Cottage Cookbook","review":"Good, honest easy cooking with a twist.

One suspects that former Legionnaire Windrow was a gunner. This book also uses material that Bernard Fall's classic account does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly impartial","review":"It has been nearly forty years since Bernard Fall wrote his epic history of this battle. Martin Windrow's work starts with respectful reference to the earlier volume and then adds a new dimension to the story. This is a dispassionate evaluation of the French experience in Indo-China, culminating in this incredible siege. As opposed to conventional wisdom, we learn that the Viet Minh did not do everything right and that the French did not do everything wrong. The book is well-paced, considering the length of the work and the amount of information presented. Even the notes are readable...and worth reading. If you want to understand something about SouthEast Asian, French, and American history, begin with Fall's Hell in A Very Small Place and then immediately proceed to this excellent volume. It will be time well-spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still no book","review":"Very disappointed that it has been 4 weeks and I have still not received the book.

The pre-taped top is actually part of the height, which meant that the bottom came out too short on the first window I did.

Another thing was that the drinking and goofing off was way over-acted, making you think this was nothing more than a bunch of drinking and laughing stunts gone good. Also, the part of Sean Parker, was way over-done as well, portraying him as only an out-of-control partier and womanizer trying to take advantage of Facebook.2 stars....at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Social Network","review":"I fail to see the \\"Revolutionary\\" and \\"Brilliant\\" or the \\"Best film of our generation\\" Mind you I am 29 but how redundant and pointless and dull have we become as a society from American idol to glee to a zillion others having to do with fame or musicals and then of course a movie about the founder(s) of facebook really?

It was pretty obvious that this was the intention of the seller because the dvd was sent to me in a single disc case. If I had only been notified that I was purchasing a single disc I would not be that upset but I feel like I was in someway cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Over-Rated","review":"This movie received a lot of hype, so I actually ended up buying the Blu-ray. While the movie seemed well-scripted and the story telling seemed well done, there really was not much story to tell. Pretty straight-forward plot about an ambitious coder who used a clever marketing strategy to tweak an existing idea to make lots of money. He makes some poor decisions, which costs him a good friend. I could have read about it on Wikipedia.If you want to see a good story on the evolution of technical superpowers, watch the Pirates of the Silicon Valley. I actually learned something from watching that one.Bottom line, Netflix this movie, don't buy it. Unless you buy into the hype, because that's all there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Oh boy, was this a boring movie. In order to make it not boring, they tried to show a lot of semi-naked women. But, it didn't work. So, if you like boring movies that disrespect women, then this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The subject is certainly promising: a youngster creates one of the most successful companies of our day.The problem is with the script and casting. The characters are mostly unlikable. The central character is so conceited that he does not condescend to attend classes regularly, and pays no attention when he drops in. The same arrogance characterizes him everywhere. The male Harvard students show similar arrogance, though to a lesser degrees. As for the female students, they seem to be in school just as groupies for the sex parties.The directing/scripting calls attention to itself away from the story through the gratuitous use of flashbacks and the mannerism of having the characters speak very fast.'The subject deserves a better treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too much for the older viewer","review":"this is an excellent film but it is probably a little too much for the older viewer.Not saying that it is not true but only saying that sometimes reality is more than the beholder can bear and this film tests the limits at times"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorifying the Worst of Humanity","review":"First, I'm 23, not some old prude lashing out at Facebook because I do not relate to it.Everybody was telling me to watch this movie. I even had a friend compare me to Mark Zuckerberg and while initially flattered, I never felt more insulted after watching this. He's selfish, greedy, and morally bankrupt. He backstabs and takes pride in his insecurity like all hostile nerds do. He objectifies women, capitalizes on hurting people, and delights in humiliating others. He's a tool and a jack***. What's more disturbing is this movie is glorifying it as people come out of the theater talking about how brilliant instead of disgusting Mark is. But I guess that is the status quo. Nobody cares anymore. Narcissism is cool. It's all about \\"self\\" and the \\"I do what I want!\\" attitude.I consider deleting my Facebook at times after seeing this; just can't bring myself to do it as I would lose contact with people abroad. Nobody emails or calls anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opened my Eyes to Facebook,and great story and actors ..","review":"I went to go see this movie in theatres with avg expectations at best, but let me tell you this movie delivered and then some. I had no clue the actualy story of how Facebook got started and was unaware that the guy who started Napster was even remotely involved. I am not sure how accurate this movie is to the true story but none the less, it was a well written story, and this movie wss CASTED perfectly having Jesse Eisenberg (who I feel doesnt get the acting credit he deserves, being compared to Michael Cera WAY @ MUCH), and Justin Timberlake did a incredible job portraying the guy who started Napster.I have a Blockbuster online membership,but this is the kind of movie you want to own imo, and they have a great deal for their 2 disc special edition DVD,but since I have a Blu Ray im getting it on Blu Ray which I hope includes the same material.Check out this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"elusive, socially inept strikes gold","review":"i was excited to see this film based on all the buzzzzzzzzzzzz about it.

Be like him and you'll succeed in life? Not quite an inspiration for the young generation (if you take away the money).If it's a a fiction, it's an interesting movie.

Not very nice people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of boring, slightly confusing","review":"I think the teaser had all the interesting parts. I almost fell asleep... even while being slightly confused by the jumping back and forth between various hearings (didn't realize there were two hearings until halfway through the movie). The only intersting things for me were seeing how crazy nerds can get about computers and of course watching Justin Timberlake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest Movie; Just ok as fiction.","review":"Imagine that you do something large, wonderful (mostly) and you become famous.A well regarded film producer makes a movie allegedly about your actions, uses your name and real names of others, but it's fiction. \\"Composite characters\\". And it contains just enough true information to LOOK like it's not fiction.Hint: Zuckerberg got involved with his current girlfriend during sophomore year of college. Whatever reasons he may have had for creating Facebook, romantic relationships do not appear to be a strong underling factor.Ignoring the dishonesty, I found the movie to be just ok. The main reason I watched it (on an airplane BTW) was because the film itself had become a major issue, something of a cultural milestone, and seems to be winning awards.So, IMHO, it's just not that great of a movie, and it is misleading as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"MINT","review":"Awesome movie, awesome collector's edition.

I gave it one star because of the photography of Harvard and Cambridge...other than that it would have gotten a -0. In fact the movie gave my girlfriend a headache.

The first time I saw it, I thought it was an okay movie, I didn't understand why there was such a hype over this movie - maybe because it was based on Facebook or maybe because the main actor (Eisenberg) was from Zombieland. I just didn't get why there was such a hype. When the movie hit DVD, I bought it for the low price ($13) and watched it again...and I was speechless. It was truly amazing. Andrew Garfield, my favorite actor, is in it and he was amazing in it. He is such a good actor. I just thought the movie was extremely good.

When I did watch the movie I was shocked. It started with a 15-minute boring dialogue between two bad actors and the boredom kept increasing with every scene. I gave it one star because there is no zero stars to rate a movie. I can say with confident that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Bad story, very bad actors, very weak scenario.

However, \\"The Social Network\\" is just that - a business drama, at face value. It offers little of exactly how Facebook has changed us, or the nature of social networking; the fact that Facebook is at the heart of the story is purely consequential.If you want to be entertained for 2 hours or so, \\"The Social Network\\" is a good choice; just don't expect anything more than a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film.

Oh I love the finished result but it makes me feel bad for the cast and crew. 99 takes!

I honestly don't know how much of it is true & how much is purely for entertainment, but either way, it's a great film everyone should watch. Amazing what this one brilliant college kid did for people all over the world.

(Of course, I'm even more amazed at all the gushingly positive hype for Facebook). Regardless, this movie is slow to develop and centered around an entire cast of characters that are completely unlikable. Half way through the film, my only thought was, \\"Who cares?\\". A bunch of dysfunctional, self-embroiled kids put up a soulless website that attracts another bunch of dysfunctional, self-embroiled kids and then otherwise intelligent adults value the whole nebulous thing at an astonishing 25 billion! Did we learn nothing from the internet bubble?

As debatable as its accuracy may be, it's a compelling tale about how one anonymous college kid's desire to get into one of the centuries-old precursors to fraternities led to him becoming the youngest billionaire in human history much to the chagrin of the old-money jocks who wanted to use him to create the college equivalent of Match.com. The dialogue comes like a Gatling cannon on full rock & roll, and you'll develop a major crush on Rooney Mara despite her limited screen time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype","review":"Despite what you've been told, this film isn't in the same league as films like 'Out of Africa,' 'The English Patient,' or 'Apocalypse Now.' The first scene sets the stage quite well. It reminds me of trying to watch an episode of 'Gilmore Girls'.....non stop, machine gun paced, witty remarks, snarky shots, and clever banter. But, it's just so robotic, there really isn't any human element at all; it's empty. Jesse Eisenberg does a fine Jesse Eisenberg, which is a shorter version of Michael Sera. Timberlake has some appeal early on, but it quickly fades and you question why he continues to be in the story. I did enjoy the portrayal of the Winklevoss twins and their little buddy; they were a bright spot in the movie. Overall all I don't think this film posseses any depth or substance, in acting or cinematography. It's a flash bang grenade of Gen Y pop culture and superficiality that I didn't find very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is well-written, fairly engrossing, and mean","review":"Between David Fincher directing and Aaron Sorkin writing, I figured this movie would have to be brilliant.

He may be the youngest billionaire in the world ... but the film gives a revealing look at what it cost him to get there. Also, Zuckerberg may be a programming genius, but he's no businessman ... and he is a bonehead in social situations. The movie's tagline, \\"You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies,\\" is right on target.

Aside from decent acting, I saw no reason to see this film or why the gaudy reviews stamped on it's dvd cover were even written. The founder of Facebook was smart and wealthy enough to get into Harvard, so he was hardly a hard-luck case, he ripped off a couple of already existing social networks, stole ideas and money from \\"friends\\" of his and somehow I'm supposed to be impressed that he's the youngest billionaire in history?

It is very difficult to watch a dark and murky film. One young man left theatre because of it's poor visibility. The audio was terrible. Much of the dialogue was drowned out by the background noise in film, whether it was music or other people talking and difficult to follow due to lack of clarity in sound. Person who came with me fell asleep from boredom.Basically all I got from it was there once was a group of well educated young men, for the most part, enrolled in a prestigious college who were immature, arrogant, self centered, pretentious and emotionally dysfunctional. Some of them made a lot of money, as have other corporate self serving human beings like the men from Enron. The President of the College at the time was portrayed as arrogant, distant, pretentious and self serving as well.Cannot recommend this film, not worth the $. Wait for cable if you must see it. Perhaps the book would be better. May look into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent, don't buy","review":"I did not like this movie. It is about a bunch of college students who created a social network while in college. The guy who actually created Facebook took the idea from other guys and made it better and made it his own. The other guys sued him. Because Facebook was worth a fortune, he pays 65 million to the guys to shut them up. And of course, you know the rest. Facebook is worth billions. The guy in the movie who created Facebook was a little smart a.. I hope the real man is a much better person. A lot of the movie is filmed in the deposition room (if that is what you call it), their dorm rooms, and partying with some wild girls.

Watching drunk college students typing frantically on keyboards may be your idea of a dramatic narrative - if it is this is for you. Curiously, the film looks and feels just like Zodiac - a crime film about a serial murderer. The scenes are drenched in somber, mysterious shadows as though vampires are afoot. The pasty faced fools who have somehow become the hero ideals of our generation are seen leaping about with Oriental 'hos of one type or another, while \\"the adults\\" all appear bored out of their mind. Most strange of all is the music, which is often so loud (obviously to make up for the lack of drama) that is actually drowns out the dialogue!

The name \\"Gnosticism\\" in this book covers many different phenomena.Not mentioned, Gnos is the greek word for knowledge, which in my opinion, resembles the tree of knowledge. The message of gnosticism in this book is ,in my opinion, \\"A neo-pagan effort to distract society away from the true God, and focus on polytheism and its discontents\\". Since the book openly denies or rejects the hypostatic union(trinity), gnosticism and its forms are sins of religion and truth. To the extent that the author is ignorant about the true instruction of faith, (given by Jesus Christ), or presenting its teaching falsely, the author, and neo-gnostic fallowers must be said to conceal rather than reveal the true nature of God and religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Text Book EVER!","review":"I'm a student at Georgia Tech, and for some reason the professors there think that they know how to write textbooks.

The book is full of errors, and the homework problems are poorly designed as most of the times you have to consult third party sources to solve them (my entire class agrees). Gary May, if you're reading this (and I hope you are), I want to thank you for writing the most disgusting textbook I've ever read. You clearly know what you are talking about, but you clearly don't know how to talk about it or how to teach it. I honestly don't understand how you expect students to learn from this garbage.

There is hardly anything that you cannot learn or cannot learn better from other process textbooks than from this one. And this book is pricy, a common for all Sze's books.I think Sze abused his reputation a bit in recent years by coauthoring and publishing a few textbooks. Those books are only of mid-quality and bear very little \\"Sze's style,\\" which makes me wonder how much time did Sze actually spend in authoring those books.

Ruth was SO DUMB AND PASSIVE. Her husband was SUCH A MOMMY'S BOY. The in-laws were SO CHEERILY MANIPULATIVE. Everyone was a stock character, except for the baby, perhaps, but how much character development can there be in a newborn baby?

There is a reason no one has done a review on this album - because it is not worth listening to. From the opening measures, the tone produced from this cd is bright enough to light a dark room. It has a \\"sizzle\\" quality that lends itself to abrassive fortissimo and takes away from all the lush sweeping qualities of the Strauss tone poems. There is pretty much one color to this entire CD, and that is bright neon yellow. The Bavarian symphony does a fine job of playing these technically difficult piece, but there is a sporatic rushed quality that should be replaced with a warm energetic quality. Some of the balance is really off too. Soloists can appear far in the distance and there is not much lower depth to the sound.

This has been a pleassant distraction from the kids' food issues. We have one daughter who hates mushrooms, but because she was having so much fun with the game, she never realized she was eating it! I would highly reccommend this product for any family looking to change up the dinnertime experience!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly helpful","review":"When I first bought this book, I was buying it for the irony. A book on strangulation by a guy named \\"Lung\\"? But also, I was buying it for the pointers too, admittedly. I've been a practicioner of the modern strangulation arts and they just don't quite seem to cut it. I mean, either the person always ends up not entirely dead or mostly dead or not dead at all. So when I bought Dr. Lung's book, expecting something of a parody and found it to actually be a really helpful book, I was pleasantly surprised. Who knew that these ancient primitives could have such successful techniques? I owe my entire career to this one book. If you're looking to be an assassin who prefers not to use guns, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and to the point","review":"This book is broken in to mainly two sections, history and practice. The history section is a very good read. I had no idea how influential Asian-Indian combat tactics were. The practice section is full of information you probably shouldn't know. After reading this it is almost painful to watch movies where anyone gets taken out by a sentry. The book is rather short and can most likely be read in under a few hours. There are positively brutal diagrams and some information on the human anatomy I'm less comfortable for knowing. This is truly a no BS history and lesson on how to attack the neck of another human being, and also some information on stalking. It's definitely a permanent addition to my 'WTF' collection of coffee table books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat emptor...","review":"I guess I'm partially at fault, but I was mislead by the title. I bought the book and was disappointed.I expected this book to consist mainly of ancient art depicting strangulation. Boy, was I let down.I've got many pieces of artwork (pen & ink, charcoal etchings, woodcarvings, photos...)displaying someone either being strangled or celebrating after a strangulation. This book, had it lived up to my expectations, would have been a solid companion to my authentic faux-Bayeux tapestry depicting \\"drawing and quartering.\\"My opinion: Not nearly enough ancient art. Too many words explaining obvious tactics/demonstrations. As if no one knows how to strangle someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading As Always","review":"I find this, as with all of Dr. HaHa Lung's books, very entertaining, enjoyable and satisfying. Alot of useful info with the right amount of history an \\"why come\\" in it. All I can say to any potential readers is this, read the history, don't skip it. It helps with the understanding of the rest of the book and it reads like a good story. Oh, and Dr HaHa Lung's Assassin and Theater of Hell are also really good. He kicks a$$."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REALLY GREAT PAIR OF KITCHEN SHEARS","review":"We have had this pair of Shun kitchen shears for eight months now and they have never failed to operate as advertised.

Could do without the screwdriver bit and the bottle opener; perhaps it was intended to be a Survival Tool. Anyway - buy'em and cut away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Shears","review":"These shears are great for all kinds of things around the house besides just in the kitchen.

When they arrived and he opened them we were extreamly disappointed to find out that they were not Shun. They are Kershaw shears being advertised as Shun. After contacting the seller I was informed that Kershaw makes Shun and therefor they were considered to be Shun. That is a bunch of bunk! Shun does have there very own kitchen shears, that does have the Shun emblem. Why these shears are on the first page of options and the actual Shun shears are on page four I have yet to figure out. So if you want Shun don't be fooled! Keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but NOT Shun","review":"These are nice shears. Kershaw makes Shun and other brands, and they make a good product.

It misses the mark, though, in terms of plot, belivability of characters, and general writing. There is no real climax, and instead of tying disparate story lines together as Clancy does, \\"Cold War\\" just seems to have several threads going on for the heck of it (to fill space?). I kept reading in the hopes things would resolve, but they never did.As another reviewer suggested, this is the first in this series that I've read, and perhaps these are continuing characters and story lines which work better in that context. Personally, I don't think I will take the time to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the best sleep aid ever!","review":"No need 4 sleeping pills, this book will get u sound asleep real fast! I got this book because of the BIG bold Tom Clancy's Name on the cover and wasted my $. I thought this book was like \\"Rainbox Six\\" but not even close! The book is pure filling; if you filter out the actual story u probably get half a book at best! Whoever wrote the review from the Washington post is definitely sharing the profits because it has virtually no action at all, it's more of a drama/ detective book than anything else! If you're looking for an action book, look elsewhere! Highlights of why I hate it, 2 many angles @ the same time, 2 much runaround, virtually no action, extra long descriptive narrative & 2 much irrelevant character backgrounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Bad]","review":"What a total disappointment. The descriptive narratives where too long and in some cases totally irrelevant. Awful terminology used to describe the operation of snowmobiles (snow bikes?). Also technical misses that aren't ever found in Clancy books. I would suggest better quality control if his name is going to be on the cover. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?!","review":"This is the first book in the series that I have read, and all I can imagine is that 1) the others are better, and 2) this book was tying up loose ends from previous books. What did a professional art forger and \\"new\\" picassos have to do with the events at the South Pole? I sure don't know. Waste of time and money--buy it and read it if you have too much of both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Clancy standard","review":"The plot was lost in the excessive descriptive narratives. It was not up to the standard of Clancy's books nor even the standard of the others in the Power Plays series. However, the description of activities in Antarctica was interesting in that it was reminiscent of the time I spent there in the late 80s. The chronicles of Uplink International have been interesting up to now. Better luck with the next book in the series....I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"A great Rx for insomnia. The only reason I finished reading the book was that I was hopeful it would get better - wrong. As a Tom Clancy fan, I find it difficult to believe that he would be involved in such work. Is he only lending his name to sell the book, or did he actively participate in its creation? I would like to think he only loaned his name since this would be the lesser of two evils. This writing reminds of the quality found in the first papers submitted in a creative writing class - high school, not college. Too bad there isn't a \\"satisfaction guaranteed or your money back.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"COLD WAR","review":"Obviously not one of Clancy's best. Preisler is not a Clancy.

Other than that it's excellent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful remix of Silence","review":"I, being a fan of both Delerium and Sarah, had to get this CD and was not disapointed. The Sanctuary Remix by Fade is almost as cool as the Rabbit in the Moon remix of Sarah's 'Possesion'. The forth track Duende, is good dance music, but bears little resemblence to the original song. You will still need to get the Delerium - Karma version of Silence as the 'album version' on this CD is about 2 minutes shorter. Recommend this CD if you like Techno-Dance/Rave music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novel","review":"I must say that I had enjoyed the novel.

I haven't seen another to compare to the realistic images and fantastic full color in this one. People ask me if it is a film of real fish all the time (it is not a film!). It is gorgeous and each fish has its own style. There are bunches of beautiful fish, realistic backgrounds and tank styles to choose from. I let mine run at random, so it is always different but it can be set to use only certain fish, bacgrounds and etc. It also has a carousel program, allowing you to have different screensavers at random. Just check the different ones you want to run in setup. The kids love it too!

Frontman Paul Dempsey is spellbinding on disk and live. In many ways those overseas have the luck of experiencing SFK as a largely \\"unknown\\" band where you can stand a foot from stage and look into the band's eyes (memories of my first SFK gig) to the sold out venues like festival hall (memories of my last SFK gig). However, there is always the solace of Paul's solo gigs. And as always I have travelled off onto my own tangent.SFK is an experience which I am yet to find a comparison. The songs are beautifully crafted and powerful with an intelligent songwriting style which is hard to find in the mass of popular culture. So enjoy my northern neighbours"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome aussie talent","review":"This is such a good CD, i listened to it non-stop when it was first released in Australia.

The legend tour (replacing world tour) is much tougher, so you can't just run straight through. Also, there's tour diffficulty, which doesn't allow you to add spin from rough and hazards, and removes all caddy tips. But, for those long seemingly unmakable putts we have tiger vision, the ultimate tool for making putts, but you only get so many a round. On tour winning tournaments is still fairly easy, but not quite such a cake walk, some tournaments take 40 or 50 under. Also, there are more sponserships available, and items you own in '04 will be transferred to '05 for free, giving you a nice head start. The $45 price tag is well worth all the fun and challenge that comes out of this game. I'd be content and be able to play tiger woods 2005 for a long time, even if it were the only game that I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY NO IN REVERIE B-SIDES??","review":"Sure this cd is a good nestalgic item for your Saves The Day collection, but you would figure that it being called \\"Early Recordings and B-sides\\", would mean that it would contain all the b-sides available, right?

If anything, I dont think that the 5 acoustic songs off of the Leaving EP, should have been on this cd.

In general, for me, the movie is about the fact that the love of parent and child is the same no matter the socioeconomic status of the people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neanderthal like","review":"If you want a birds eye view of the behavior of the cave dwellers then this is your movieAlcohol ravaged disgusting group of savages reminds me of the reality shows of present day TVThe lowest common denominator story reminds us that love is alive even in the pits"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"It was a wonderful film, very entertaining, it kept me guessing with anticipation with every turn, it was a tear jerker but well worth watching.I will be talking about it for days to come and recommending it to everyone to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beasts","review":"I really like the movie.

Tells a story of how no matter what our life circumstances, family, and our roots are often the most important thing. Great scenery and color.

It showed a world that I do not live in, yet I know it exist. It brought out the truth in the phrase, \\"It takes a villiage\\" to raise any child, and be a part of any community.

I was led to believe by its accolades that I wasembarking on at least a standard that has been previously established by all pastnominees to Best Motion Picture (other than \\"Chariots of Fire\\"). I think Hollywood blew it.They took a film that is good and tried to raise it up to greatness. It's a shame that theyhad to overstate this film in such a grandiose way. I think it diminshed the obvious qualityand wonder it did have to the point of ridiculousness. Come on Hollywood!, the days ofcute and talented being masqueraded as dramatic fare is over, or should be.Mediocrity exists and can also be made by praising something to HIGH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Poor","review":"A little sweet 5 year old, running around in underwear is how this opens, and does not get any better. The little child has very few speaking parts, so that when the film gets to the point where her father dies, it almost seemed like child abuse -- like gratuitous tragedy somehow. As an African American woman, I was excited about seeing a film with a character that looked like me when I was little. But was I ever disappointed. And why was it necessary for hush-puppy's father to curse God's name time and time again, albeit, under his breath?

I was bored from the beginning and I'm fighting to keep from turning it off because I really hope it improves. It seems to be a conscious effort to hit on every stereotype possible for this group of people. I read several reviews from people saying they liked the way 'their' people were represented and I'm a little confused by that as they are represented as dirty, poorly educated, bitter toward the rest of society, angry, violent, drunks who are too stubborn to provide quality care for their children even when it's available. Most of the movie is the young actress running around in the swamp or being hit and yelled at by her father. I live in New Orleans and have done work in rural areas. I would definitely not say this represents the people I've meet.Someone needs to break it to the little girl that the scientists of the future will not care."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best part of the movie is the Title page.","review":"The people in the movie had food to eat, lived in beautiful land and help came when they needed it.Yet the father chose to be drunk with his friends and ignored his daughter until the end of his life. The filth was self-created. The misery self-imposed. Thousands of people in the world are poor yet they are nor drunk neither filthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic & Depressing","review":"I bought and watched this movie because of the favorable reviews.

I'm sure there is an anti-progress social message there that the pointy-headed critics would like. Parts of it tried to tug at heartstrings.

The amount of subtle environmentalist nonsense was overwhelming. I'm not stupid, I know propaganda when I see it. The movie just had no point. It was basically poverty porn, like Winter's Bone.

Quvenzhane Wallis finds the heart and soul of Hushpuppy and brings a heroic character alive in the body of a six year-old unnurtured girl. The people of The Bathtub are fiercely independent, yet scarily vulnerable to the harsh conditions which they accept as the price of their freedom. Hushpuppy's ability to conquer fear and loneliness and love her world is a testament to the triumph of the human spirit in adverse conditions.

I was a bit skeptical about the story but execution is completely flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film!","review":"This is quirky, poignant with a bit of apocalyptic sci-fi thrown in. Quvenzhané Wallis will win over your heart. Its not a movie for the feint of heart, with some difficult-to-watch scenes. And yet, you will leave this film with a feeling of triumph and the richer for the viewing.I did have some issues getting it to play about 15 minutes in.

But....all of this talk about this amazing cinematic piece of work and it being Oscar-worthy? Really? From what I saw, I'm sorry; I didn't get it.

He had her living in an uninhabitable trailer by herself for much of the movie and just flat abandoned her for over a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment!","review":"This film was full of profanity, disgusting images, and rambling dialogue. I found it absolutely ridiculous and I have no idea why it is being considered for an academy award. The little girl in the movie is very cute, but has almost no live dialogue. A girls voice (possibly hers) \\"read\\" her thoughts for most of the film. Her abusive father is a nightmare. Although the situation was horrific, you are thrown into the \\"bathtub\\" without any real explanation of what this is or where you are, making it difficult to feel empathy for the truly tragic characters.

The non-actor cast was totally remarkable, especially Quvenzhane Wallis who was only 5 1/2, 6 years old when the movie was filmed.

Along with all the other boozin' white trash characters in this over hyped film. This is the kind of film that BELONGS at The Sundance Film Festival. It appeals to THOSE kind of people.

I replayed that at least 10 times on TIVO and couldn't figure it out. So if that was the key to the whole thing, it went right by me.If the point of the movie was to show the absolute squalor that some people have to endure in this supposedly greatest country in the world ... or if it was to show how some children adapt to it ... then this movie did a wonderful job.

Just disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could see it...","review":"This rating is for Amazon Digital, not the movie. I rented this video only to find that I am unable to view it on my iPad or Roku box, even after I added it to my library and watch list. It's is the second time I've rented a movie that is not made available for me to see immediately. The time it takes to contact someone about this issue, takes entirely too much time. I think I'm going end up staying in the dark ages and forget steaming videos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"totally disappointed","review":"I watched this movie because it's an award winning movie and it has a lot of endorsements. Boy was I disappointed! It was completely a waste of time to sit through this movie. Pointless. Disjointed. I have no idea what message this movie is trying to convey. There is no plot, no story line to follow. However, I really enjoyed the little girl's performance, and that's probably why I made it to the end. I will not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to view","review":"Hard to tell you what I actually thought of the film since the streaming was so bad. It started and reloaded numerous times, scenes were repeated, parts had sound but no picture and we never got to see the end because it was so broken up visually that we stopped the film. I have never had this much trouble with a streamed movie. AND, we were charged for the HD version even though we received an alert that said our connection was too slow for HD!! It was a wasted $4.98.The movie may have been good, had I been able to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a camcorder, have a few drinks to keep it shaky, and a pouty faced 5 year old","review":"Disjointed narrative, very limited emotion range expressed on both of the main characters--not surprisingfor first timers, but Oscar nominations? Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent and Pretentious","review":"Do not believe the critical raves and award nominations. This thing starts out somewhat intriguing and gets progressively absurd. The 6 year old lead actress is not to blame. I give it 5 eye rolls,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold my interest","review":"I was really looking forward to this movie and I appreciate the high acting quality (the little girl is awesome!) but I just didn't hold my interest. I could only get through part of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"I expected a lot more from this, given all the media hype. Confusing and not enjoyable to watch. Maybe just not my style."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't know what this movie is about.","review":"Tried to watch but turned it off after about 45 minutes because there was no plot and, honestly, quite boring. Just not my type of movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Very moving picture. Watched with my 8 year old son. As a native Louisiana African-American now residing elsewhere, it was important I shared the experience with my young son who, unfortunately, does not yet have the strong ties and memories of my native culture. The metaphors and symbolism are often hard to cleary rasp, for me as well as my son, but it was a rewarding experience try and sort them out together. The performance by the first-time male lead actor is beyond oscar worthy and is light-years ahead of Danial D. Lewis' \\"Lincoln\\". A classic is born."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Movie","review":"I thought it was a nice movie. The line between fantasy and reality got a bit blurry, so it was hard to make sense of at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New 'True Grit'","review":"Lead girl is genuinely mesmerizing, as is also father, though WAY more painful to witness. In its stark, humane tale of survival the film manages to fold in many layers, while providing a glimpse 'below the levee' of a world few of us have likely seen. Well worth a look!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Great a Story but Nice Visuals","review":"This really isn't a very good story. It has wonderful visuals, but the story is disjointed and somewhat flat. Also, the cinematography gets annoying with all the handheld, jerky camera moves.I did love the setting.
