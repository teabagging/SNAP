Thank goodness I checked this one out of the library. That would have been a waste of some good cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is unreadable. The prose is lumpy. The story doesn't flow. The mixture of angels and vampires doesn't work. The ending is just another Sylvester Stallone chase-and-shoot scene. And, worst of all, after 400 pages you get virtually no new clues about the big mysteries of the book (what happened to Paladin, what is the silence in heaven)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, poorly written","review":"The ideas behind this story are great (fallen angels, angelic creation of vampires, redemption) and the parts of the story that deal with them are engrossing. But the story line is too convuluted and I kept losing interest. The ending was open ended (and such an obvious ploy to get you to buy the next book) and I felt cheated when I finished it. I won't buy the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better movie, maybe","review":"Ms. Rice was never one of my favorite writers, but there is no comparison of her books to this one. I usually think that a book suffers by becoming a movie, but this would not -- I too kept thinking that it would make a better movie than novel due to Mr. Lord-Wolff's extensive reliance on plot and things visual. But the book has no sense of humor or irony about it at all, and has no ending. Open -ended non-endings work well in fiction that relies more on character development, but in a story like this, where plot is the entire impetus of the book, unresolved questions and ending in the middle of things don't succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch. Yikes. Run for your life.","review":"What starts out as a very interesting premise devolves quickly into a battle between (almost) good and (almost) evil, though it doesn't even quite succeed at even that. \\"The Silence In Heaven\\" begins with a number of angels being purged from heaven and forced to be earthbound. Then it tells us that it was these angels who \\"created\\" vampires with their celestial blood. Can you see what's coming? Yes, the angels must battle the vampires for control of the world or mankind or something. And there might be a love story (almost) involved, but since angels have no reproductive organs, it's more of a frottage* story, I would imagine. Anyway, if you're looking for a summer read that doesn't involve a brain or any common sense, then by all means read this book.*The act of rubbing against the body of another person, as in a crowd, to attain sexual gratification."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, dull and wrongheaded execution.","review":"Just a few comments: The author failed to make his characters compelling or believable, even in a fantasy setting such as the one featured in this novel. Meaningless, overly cute dialoge abounds. Ridiculous vampires, one of which, as written, is so astonishingly boorish that finishing the novel might be something of a chore (the other two vampires are merely boring), take up too much of the novel's time. Quizzically, the author tries to force a comparison between the two male vampires and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.I do not understand the jacket comments praising this novel. Most claim that Lord-Wolff has done the miraculous in reinventing angels, much like Anne Rice did for vampires. But there are only four angels in the book, one of which isn't seen after the first chapter. Seriously, if one third of all the angels in heaven fell to earth, as the novel implies, one would think the writer would present a few more of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't fall for the fake rebate","review":"I purchased 2 Z-3 systems in December of 2004.

For their sound quality and depth, they could cost well over $70. They have great deep bass, precise highs, and a full sound. They are only lacking some depth in the midtones, but with tweaking they become great. The volume nob is exellent, its simple yet brillant. The only thing this is lacking is a bass volume knob instead of the one on the subwoofer. These speakers look as great as they sound, and are simply the best you can buy for the money.sound- 8.7/10 value-11/10 bass-9/10 style-10/10 setup-10/10 overall- 9.4/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you ever wanted to know and more","review":"I am a huge fan of DK reference books and this book did not disappoint - beautifully set out, utterly readable and throughly researched.

Its actually an older work not intended for the very short introduction series. Its a brief but fairly in depth study of Hume's work with an initial chapter on his life tagged on at the start. It requires at least a basic familiarity with Hume and the reader would almost certainly benefit from having read the Enquiries or even an alternative introduction before engaging with this. Presenting Ayers' book in this way is disingenuous and does both him and the reader a disservice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not as an introduction","review":"I agree with the reviewers who found this book unhelpful for readers unfamiliar with Hume's philosophy. It really fails as an introduction, for the plain reason that it doesn't even attempt to be one. Ayer wrote it in 1979 as a series of lectures on topics in Hume's philosophy, lectures originally addressed at a public already familiar with the basics. I certainly agree that introductions should also make us think, but not before providing the knowledge that would make such thinking possible.In short, I think this is a good book if taken on its own terms, and it is not Ayer's fault that the publisher decided to misrepresent it now as an introduction to Hume's thought. I am giving it two stars not because it is not a good book, but because it is not good as an introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cake Pans","review":"Many chefs recommend brushed aluminum cake pans because they produce the most consistent cakes.

But you dont have to love football to like this book. In this book you read about how Jon Gruden, one of my favorite coaches works his way up his ladder of success. This book can teach you a lot about work ethic, motivation and self desire. He also talks about how he made it as far as he is right now because he had a great learning ability, wouldnt give up on any of his dreams and kept at what he wanted to do, be a profesional football coach.

Instead, it looks like he spent a couple of days answering questions from a hack ghostwriter. There is very little detail and most of the important events in his career are glossed over.

His book, however, is rather dissapointing. Not because he's a bad guy - quite the opposite. He is so reserved in his criticism that the whole book comes off like some sort of \\"Wonderful Life.\\" For example, when talking about Ricky Watters (a player who was obviously a major pain in the a**), he says merely \\"For whatever reason, Ricky Watters never really seemed to warm up to me.\\" And his dodging around Al Davis is even worse - his summary of why he left the Raiders is simply \\"My agent, Bob LaMonte, told me that negotiations for a contract extension were going nowhere.\\" That's it???Great guy, great coach, but a dissapointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you love football","review":"This was gift for my husband and he loves it.

On the other hand, I was 13 when I read that. While the story moves along quickly enough, that's what one would expect as there isn't much story there. In fact, the book has little urgency to it, as most of the characters are \\"ghosts\\" from parallel dimensions.

I love the stories about Mimi, I'll just put that out there. The one thing I'll say about this DVD is that it does have two stories featuring Jetta heavily, who, if you've seen any of the other Clifford stories you'll know, is just unsufferably obnoxious.

Readers are asked to believe that detective hero Devlin would accompany his paramour to Cuba, placing her, his friend, and himself in mortal danger - in order to seek out the dismembered corpse of his lover's aunt and give the body a \\"proper burial.\\" Poor character definition, poor plot, and a lot of mumbo-jumbo history of Cuban voodoo. Writers get a tax exemption for travel, which is why we see a lot of novels set in foreign locales. Most of them work as tax exemptions and most of them don't as novels. This is a prime example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voodoo, Cuba and a bunch of uninteresting characters","review":"I did NOT finish this book, the first by William Heffernan that I have read. I found this book like another reviewer stated to be more of a travelogue of Cuba and history of voodoo than a good read. We are supposed to be intriqued as to the wherabouts of the body of the Red Angel and have empathy for a niece who has never met her. And Paul Devlin is a detective I could not grow to like.I found the book not only uninteresting but confusing with the introduction of mafia connections, voodoo priests, and obnoxious New York cops. At page 162 after falling asleep on this mess, I decided to call it quits. Quantam Physics would be a more interesting read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most dreadfully researched pieces of trash I've s","review":"This man obviously hasn't a clue as to the ancient practices of the Celts, now does he know how to go about researching them.

That is called something else. Since you all have access to the internet why don't you look it up? Just a thought. Then at least you won't make ignorant suggestions. Now about the book. Halloween may be an old Pagan tradition but I would also like to say that Pagans don't worship the Satan either. In Pagan religions the devil doesn't exist. Satan was invented by Christianity. Basically then the book is about the evils of Halloween a harmless Pagan festival for the dead given a bad reputation by Christians who were the ones to invent the devil in the first place. I have a plea to all of you out there. Unless you know something about something don't write a book about it. Let your kids celebrate Halloween after all it is a harmless piece of fun. Kids have no idea what the signifigance is anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter nonsense","review":"Poorly researched, badly organized and written, illustrated with movie stills and lifted illustrations, there isn't a single page in this absurdity that's not full of factual errors.

It's sad that they did no actual research whatsoever. It appears that \\"witchcraft\\" young adult horror fiction was used as fact (I recognize at least one section as coming pretty much verbatim from a kids' horror book I read a long time ago). Paganism was around long before the creation of \\"Satan\\". Paganism and Satanism could not possibly be more different.

It saddens me to see people that still want to burn the witches because of ego driven rumors. The dark ages are over, or are they? I find the ignorance of these writing more disturbing than any devil. If truth be known, Cristian holidays are actually based on the old pegan calender. Halloween is no differant than Christmas, Easter or Valentine's Day. All of these times of celebration have been batardized by the white world in order to make long held festivals their own. Just because Halloween has pagen roots does not mean your children are going to start worshiping the devil. The author does nothing more than try to revive (and caitalize) fears based on ignorance. Lets get beyond the Salem witch trials and enter the twentieth century."},{"rating":"1","title":"geez! the devil is not trying to start an uprising!","review":"It's halloween. based on ancient Pagan holidays, it is harmless.

Exodus 22:18 says Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.\\"That just about says it all, I think. So much for Christianity being a religion of \\"love.\\" The whole book stinks, and anyone who reads it and can take it at face value, just isn't very intelligent. Anyone who agrees with the author that witches should die, would show that intolerance is alive and well in this century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another author trudges through the mud of ignorance","review":"Others have said it, but I have to add my voice to the cries of anger: This book obviousely has no bounds in objective research and is based soley on the views and opinions of the author.

I started this read expecting to like the book, but in the end it was not so. Mr. Matlock is a ardent material realist who believes our ancestors misunderstood a rock (natural element) to be God!!! Mr. Matlock is completely out of touch with modern science, specifically quantum physics. Quantum physics is in agreement with monistic idealism, the exact opposite of material realism.

If you're an IT professional, then you'll learn nothing new here. If you aren't, then this book won't be particularly useful. What's especially disappointing is the fact that he's using the 9/11 disaster to sell what is essentially a work of common knowledge. On the plus side, he's at least refrained from the wild speculation that made up much of Time Bomb 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"In his last book, TimeBomb 2000, Ed Yourdon stated that the Y2K phenomenon would be more pervasive and serious than anything we've experienced in modern history. Having missed the boat on that one, he now offers us a hastily-written compilation of glossed over tips and information about IT security in general. Much of it has nothing at all to do with 9/11, which is understandable since it has happened so recently. The book is okay in and of itself, but the title is clearly misleading and there's really nothing new offered here that hasn't already been available in dozens of other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Info","review":"The previous person who posted a review of this book is a troll that has chosen to follow Ed around and slander him.

If you aren't planning how to prevent and/or deal with such risks, you are putting your business at risk.Should others buy this book? It's easy enough to read that everyone could learn something from it.

Indeed, Yourdon himself was quoted as saying that the likelihood that the various Y2K \\"trigger dates\\" would pass without incident was equal to that of pigs learning to fly.Thankfully, Byte Wars avoids such ridiculous predictions and hysteria, but instead offers the reader no new insights into information technology and little to nothing relating to 9/11. Yourdon is a true Master of the Obvious in this book, which apparently capitalizes on the 9/11 tragedy without actually addressing it. If you're looking for real insight into the effects of 9/11 on the IT industry, I would wait a few more months for a more relevant work.

Though disagreement remains to this day as to the number of Black Southerners who served and whether their military contributions were significant, their seemingly paradoxical stories make for singularly compelling reading. Black Southerners in Confederate Armies draws information from reliable sources ranging from newspaper articles to veterans' accounts to miscellaneous surviving documentation to present its true stories of these unusual African-Americans with a scholarly attention to detail. Some reproductions of historic documents illustrate the pages of this welcome addition to library and personal Civil War history and reference shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good coverage of a forgotten subject","review":"Nothing is so upsetting to a liberal as the idea that Blacks willingly supported the Confederacy. It assails their preconceived notions about slavery and their assumptions about how Blacks should think and act. They simply cannot accept the idea that some slaves and many freemen willingly supported the CSA and many served in its' armies. The fallback position is that they were not soldiers as they lacked weapons being only cooks, teamsters or body servants. The same group will accord soldier status to a man who drove the Red Ball in WWII but not a teamster driving a wagon for the AoNV.This book takes a very close look at Black Confederates, proves that they do exist, and shows how much information was never recorded. The sad part of their story is that it is untold.

Perhaps most outstanding aspect of Gahlinger's book is his thorough, no-nonsense instructions for detecting a drug overdose and seeking efficient, timely medical care for the victim- knowledge that could, one day, be the deciding factor between the death or recovery of a friend or loved one.

Salvatore leads you to believe that that the pirate group is potentially very dangerous but when the fighting actually occurs, Drizzt & company mop up the floor with them.I truly loved the first two series featuring Drizzt and company (have read them about five times) but lately things have just been too easy with no real challenges. Salvatore is definitlely capable of much better story telling than this. I will continue to read but I hope things improve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Paced Action","review":"I started reading the Drizzt Saga when my friend loaned me a book for my plane flight and I have bough every single one because I like them so much, but my favorite by far is the Sea Of Swords. I think this has the most action since the war in Mithril Hall against the Drow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best at all.","review":"There is no depth. You can't even compare this to the Silent Blade or Servant of the Shard. Both are amazing Books. He just seems to be running through the motions on this \\"one more drizzt book\\". It was a fast read and had some good parts, but without characters like Jaraxle and Enterti the book has no real villian to test the hero's strengths. One thing i am glad about is there is no more Dark elves. I was going crazy reading about Loth and all the countless dark elves. Just for that I will give it two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character Development Makes This Book","review":"There have been readers who say that this book doesn't have depth of his previous works, but I disagree. Mr. Salvatore adds so much depth to the Companions in this novel. Previous storylines have been directed by the evil forces around the five of the characters, but Sea of Swords is moved along by the inner forces among them. Emotion and responsibilty more than anything else drives each characters movements. The reader is given insight to the innerworkings of the characters and, as always, Salvatore relates each chapter to real life lessons learned.That being said, this book is not lacking in action or adventure in any way, and the fight scenes are still top-notch.Bottom line: Great book worthy of the series. I look forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves you wanting more","review":"Since Starless Night, I've been extremely intreged with Drizzt and Catti-bries relationship. Sea of swords developes it more than the others but still leaves you confused, with what's really going on. I just hope R.A. Salvatore explains it all soon or makes something out of their relationship, before I pull my hair out. All in All it's a Must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Drizzt's beginning in the underdark was really good . . . this one was not. Drizzt and Co never come up against anything that gives them trouble. They aren't meeting challenges that CHALLENGE them. For the last few books, it's been the same old plot: Enemy shows up that hates Drizzt, Drizzt believes it's all his fault, other try to convince him differently, lo and behold it IS all his fault, they butcher the enemies easily. This one did have a few good parts where Drizzt messed up and almost paid too much for it, but for the most part Salvator's writing is getting old and trite. This books falls far short of exciting reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action-packed! and great characters too!","review":"R.A. Salvatore is my favorite author and his latest book is one of his best! \\"Sea of Swords\\" has the fast-paced action and excellent plot development that has exemplified all of Salvatore's books, but what really makes this book stand out is his continued development of his signature characters, the Companions of the Hall. While I enjoyed \\"Spine of the World\\" and \\"Servant of the Shard\\", I missed Catti-brie and Bruenor and Drizzt and Regis. \\"Sea of Swords\\" brings all the companions back together again. I really enjoyed some of the new twists on the continuing story of Drizzt's life. Wulfgar's ongoing struggle for redemption is easy to empathize with, and I loved the return of the comic relief given by Bruenor and Regis. I can hardly wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good-bye, This Universe","review":"The plot/goal was not enough, Drizzt's intro's to every sectionare dull any more, I did not like the elf he introduced in this story, he should not have returned Wulfgar as the story is going,there is too much sexual innuendo( the first books hardly had any), I don't like the direction or lack of it in which the story is going, the heroes have done everything, and the character developement seems to be making them all the same character. These books aren't any fun any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"sooo disappointed","review":"This book had to be one of the most disappointing I've read. After reading Servant of the Shard (and enjoying it immensely), I expected more challenging things for this group of heroes. But this seems to be almost a segway book, builds a few characters that need no building, they have a fairly run of the mill adventure and a slight subplot. On a sidenote...I don't really like how Drizzt and Cattibrie are coming together, kind of seems like a half backstab thing, reminds me of that movie Pearl Harbor (Wulfgar is thought to get killed, Cattibrie falls for Drizzt, Wulfgar comes back etc).. only twist is how Wulfgar found someone else in previous books, but it still [stinks] in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"It really would have been better had this novel not been written at all and we could strike it from the Drizzt series. The plot of the story is completely contrite and childish and you get more of the same old predictable Drizzt as we've had since The Silent Blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh","review":"Not one of Salvatore's better novels. It's the final book for the Paths of Darkness series, and it ends nice predictable fashion. I enjoyed reading Servent of the Shard and Spine of the World, after finishing those books and then continuing with Sea of Swords, the series seems to end with a little thump instead of a bang. Pick it up if you're interested in following Drizzt and friends, but if you're looking for an interesting Salvatore book this isn't the one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best but still good.","review":"Compared to most authors novels this was an excalent book, but i thought that it was really a sad portrayel of such an excalent author. he really slacked on this novel, but i was still a really good read. i was alittle dissapointed with the antagonist and the end, and i thought it was better when the group wasnt together, and i wish that they hadn't found each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disapointment","review":"First of all, I am a Dutch reader.

The characters are flat, Wulfgar is at his annoying best, the story is two or maybe one-dimensional and I think Savatore made this story up while eating turkey at Thanksgivingday at his parents (boring) place.I rated this book two stars but I'm thinking it even deserves those two stars.Roger van den Heuvel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drizzt Series","review":"My friend forced me to read this series by R A Salvatore.

Although the storyline was not at it's best, and it would have been better to see more better evil enemies than Pirates it can still keep you up all night turning the pages.

Additionally, this one does not hold weight near as well as my Manfrotto 026; it sags with a 580ex and an umbrella if you lean it more than 45 degrees.There's absolutely no point in buying these when you can get a name brand metal adapter for a few bucks more (at the moment the 026 is $5 more).

I'm also not crazy about having an aluminum cold shoe and while I have not had problems with it, it scars me to no end that I'll short out my flash somehow. Also the coldshoe has a little screw that you tighen. I would have much rather had a standard cold shoe like the ones that come with the flash so I could use the flash's own tightening knob but I guess this gets the job done.If you're reading this chances are you're on a budget so go ahead and get it.

I have one from Impact and two from Westcott that are a bit heavier, but actually still hold an umbrella after a bit of shooting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"It is dangerous to use this shoe mount clamp.First, my flash felt twice even though I tightened the screw.Second, the screw that comes with it had gotten loose and fallen several times, until it finally got lost. Then, I bought a replacement screw. Unfortunately, it cannot hold the flash tight enough either.Third, wrapping up the shoe mount and the flash with masking tape should not be an option. I tried this method and found it time consuming. Plus, it beats the purpose of using a reliable product.I rarely write reviews, but due the bad experience with this product, I promised to myself to say something about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and plastic. Mine Broke.","review":"This umbrella bracket has an issue with where the umbrella hole is drilled: the hole is so close to the hinge joint that there is practically no material connecting the joint to the top piece. My light stand fell over once and the bracket snapped in two. Even some of the cheaper brackets with different designs may be more sturdy than this one.This works, but if you want something that will last go for an aluminum bracket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good, does what its supposed to.","review":"Great product, does what its designed to do. I use it with a heavier/larger vivitar flash, wireless trigger combo, and umbrella, and everything works great together when attached to a backlight stand.The one little flaw is the screw that holds the flash in place could be a little more heavy duty. It seems that if I were to put to much force into tightening it, it would strip the threads pretty easily. My flashs have a lock switch on them anyways, so I don't use the screw on the clamp that often, but thought it would be a good idea to mention it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Threads Strip Easily","review":"First, let me say this: I know how to use an umbrella shoe mount, so I am confident that the issue that I have is not of my own doing. I purchased two of these units for use with small umbrella in front of Canon 580EX Speedlites. After only minimal use, the threads have stripped on BOTH clamps, and not due to over-tightening. If that were the case, the umbrella shafts would show damage, but they don't. Very simply, this is a cheaply made product with very fragile plastic threads. Both units have been rendered useless for their intended purpose.

This book is a sweeping saga. I felt like I was actually there in that time period. I actually cried, laughed and talked out loud while reading. Anyway, I won't tell too much. But this book is good.

A shining example: a chapter set in 1918 Europe has characters mentioning repairing jeeps and the Red Ball Express.

In fact, I bought the book twice. I read a review of it when it was published in 1998. It got press because the author, Guy Johnson, is Maya Angelou's son. As a first novel, it had nothing else to recommend it. About four years later I picked up another copy because it looked interesting as I was going through an airport for an international flight. After reading the first chapter I thought that it sounded familiar. Of course, if you are a Clancy aficionado you know this feeling well!

Anway, these are MUCH brighter than my old lamps, and they cast a swath of bright light forward and peripherally. I'm not expecting 10 years out of these, but do hope I can get at least a couple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good replacements","review":"I love Amazon's Parts Finder. It made it simple to find these bulbs for my pickup truck.Since I only had one bulb out, I only replaced that one bulb. This gave me a chance to see how this bulb compares to the OEM. I expected something really impressive, but they're both the same. I guess that's OK, but I'm still a little disappointed. I really wanted the right side of the road to look dazzling compared to the left side. Oh well.The light fit perfectly and works fine. The replacement was simple enough. If you have any troubles, there are plenty of Youtube videos that show how to remove the old bulb.So this replacement bulb is fine. It's not awesome in any way, but it put me back on the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Short Lifespan :-(","review":"I tried these and were impressed with their bright white light output, but was extremely disappointed with the lifespan. I didn't make it a year with the first set, tried again, and one bulb didn't make it eight months. Living in a small town where overzealous cops pull you over for having lights out, I went back to Xtra-Vision bulbs that last much longer. If you look on the back of the box it clearly indicates that the more expensive brighter bulbs last half as long as some the less bright ones. It is hard to believe they cannot make bright white bulbs that last longer. Hopefully LED headlights will have the right performance and price soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"the quality is not as it descibes in review chart in back of package","review":"I thought when I buy this Bulb then I have the brightest lightbut it is notthe quality & performance rating as it describes in the back of package is different than what I have now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible! Don't waste your money!","review":"I bought these cause I was tired of my dim old headlights. The brightness on these was excellent... but only for 6 months. They both died and within a week of each other. I went to parts store to complain, but apparently they only have a 3 month warranty. Convenient. The guy behind the counter said that his brother had the same problem... maybe has something do do with them burning so hot. I don't know about that, but I bought the cheap ones and they work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"From the reviews I expected a substantial improvement, but I can't tell the difference. And the \\"longer life\\" in the description is a lie, it says right on the box they won't last as long as normal bulbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in performance","review":"The headlights wash out in close proximity to the front of the car. Very difficult to see when driving in traffic, much worse when driving in traffic and raining -- very dim side illumination. When you're on a very dark road -- one without street lights and without traffic (i.e., country back road) -- the lights perform well and you can see in the distance. Otherwise, for city driving, I would not recommend. I drive a 2004 Chevy Cavalier. Took lights to my dealer to have them installed, so I know the beams were adjusted properly. Will return original headlights to my car as they provided much better illumination in all driving conditions. Too bad I can't return these for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed","review":"These are not any brighter than the 9 year old bulbs they replaced. Save your money, put in the stock replacements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Advertisement - read the fine print.","review":"After installing, I was reading the packaging more closely and saw that they compare brightness between used & worn out standard bulbs versus brand new Silverstar Bulbs.And, they are much lower life bulbs (which actually was disclosed in the literature).I'm not impressed by the Apples to Oranges comparison!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"I am most satified with the outcome of this product as it has significantly improved visibilty with my night time driving as I have a 10 year old car with original parts and with age the headlight lens have turned hazy and instead of replacing the entire fixture I decided to have the headlight bulbs replaced with Sylvania Silver Star Ultra High Performance Halogen the improvement is definitely noticeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"They pretty much work...","review":"...as advertised. I'm over 65 and my night vision isn't what it used to be. I replaced the stock bulbs in my '03 Mustang Mach 1 a couple of months ago. The first time I drove at night, I could see a definite difference; my lights lit up the road more brightly, both farther ahead and to the sides. These lamps made a positive difference - not dramatic, but definite. Some people say that your headlights get dimmer as they age, but I don't believe the whole difference was due to aging of the old stock lamps - at least not entirely. To be honest, I had my doubts about the value of these lamps, but I'm glad I sprung for them now."},{"rating":"2","title":"good lights","review":"They are a little hard to install, but guess that depends on the kind of car you have. They should be changed at the same time, one of my lights is now a little brighter then the other. It gives good front and side light coverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved night vision when driving","review":"As I have gotten older, my night vision has slightly diminished. With the Sylvania SilverStar Ultra, I can really tell the difference between the old headlamps and the new. Now I feel much more comfortable when driving at night. A good product worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product but not as far beam as expected.","review":"When i saw these headlights on TV i decided to give them a try. The night that i got them i went for a night drive they were good but the problem is there only 30% brighter and were just awful in the rain. I have since switched to an HID kit and wow the kit is alot brighter whider and farther than the silverstaars imo. If you really want brighter whiter light then buy an HID kit it may be expensive but in the long run it lasts longer and is brighter and whiter. In other words get an HID kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so bright.","review":"Could hardly tell the difference between these and the stock headlights on my 1997 f 250. Not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad in rain","review":"Yes, they are whiter, but they are terrible in the rain. For some reason they just totally wash out. It's so bad you can't see the sides of the road. I had the next Silverstar version beneath these and while they are less white, the side-lighting and rain lighting is much better (plus cheaper). If you live in southwest USA, these will be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bright, but burn out quickly","review":"I have tried two pairs of these lights with my 2003 Tacoma. The lights are noticeably brighter than the stock bulbs they replaced. The problem is that they burn out quickly. As little as one month to as long as six months in my experience. In contrast my stock bulbs have lasted for several years. I am now back to stock light bulbs. If you buy these carry a spare bulb and be ready for frequent replacements. The money you will spend over a couple years would be much better spent upgrading to a HID lighting system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headlight bulb","review":"They do everything they claim to do.

Cheaper than buying new headlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product and Even Greater PRICE!","review":"I have a lincoln town car and bought this pair of headlights to replace some two years old \\"cool blue\\" ones also from sylvania.

I was pretty happy with it until I read that the Sylvania Silverstar was the brightest and whitest of any halogen available in the market. After installing it, it was defintely no brighter nor whiter than the Philips. And Philips is way much cheaper too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!!","review":"I bought these not even a year ago and one of them have already gone out. They honestly didn't even make a difference compared to the factory bulbs that were already installed.

So, after reading the reviews here, I bought the SilverStars. My main concern was the life span so I kept the receipt. But after installing, I really saw only a very minor improvement in brightness. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better!","review":"I purchased a set of these bulbs for a Mustang. They perform very well. I can see much better driving at night. They are expensive in comparison to other brands, but in My opinion? Well worth it. They cost Me a lot less than If I hit a deer I didn't see. I figure, Even if I have to replace them every year. It's worth it to Me. They cost less that a tank of gas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This does not attach well to my Graco stroller.

He's so prolific it's scary. His Eternal Champion saga has to be one of the most intricately linked sagas in modern literature. That said, let me say that anybody can jump into Kane of Old Mars with minimal difficulty. The book is complete in and of itself, so don't let the Volume 9 on the cover dissuade you. I'm not going to give any plot details away but I'll say this: If you like the Mars stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs, you're gonna love this. Fun stuff, maybe not Shakespeare, but fun Heroic Fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Mount! Please Update Photo Image","review":"I ordered this flash as a replacement. I had the same Sunpack Auto Thyristor 355 AF flash for years, but cracked part of the mount. I received the flash today, but I received a flash with a Hot Shoe Mount.

As my personal Final Exam, I was able to author a movie in which I repurposed a prior Word-based multi-document Software Lifecycle Quality Assurance methodology, a complex subject.

I went through it and found many scholarships that would apply to myself, and was very excited. However, when I went to the actual webpage, I found that all the scholarships listed were old and outdated or no longer actively given out to students. In my opinion, a waste of money. I did my own internet searches and found many active, applicable scholarships instead of using this listing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Book!","review":"Though geared for classroom use, it still could be adapted for the homeschool environment.It starts with 2 sample daily schedules that you could use as a guide.Then it actually gives you a calendar for the whole year, unlike most books that don't give a schedule for summer. Each week in the month is assigned a theme with suggested letters and numbers to cover. Then each week is further divided into days that are assigned activities you could stretch further by using the sample daily schedule (given in the beginning of the book). To top it all, it gives reproducibles and suggestions when to use these reproducible crafts during the week. It also specifies their page numbers. If you are a non-proffessional like me, these book will work like a charm!

He's not a terrible comedian, but he makes a better actor/singer. That, and the HAIR! My God, I couldn't quit looking at his crazy hairdo long enough to listen to what he was talking about. When doing stand-up, it is necessary to work harder on what you say than how you look. Izzard pulled it off because he was more animated than his outfit and makeup. Plus, Izzard was more well spoken. I'm not trying to put Russell down or say that Eddie Izzard is the best comedian to ever grace the stage; just that Mr. Brand might want to work on his material a bit more and tone down the rock star image when doing a stand-up comedy show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alice Cooper meets a Cockney Chimney Sweep","review":"The desperation that people go through to be famous. Russell Brand's stupid costume, hair and bad makeup render him an uncomfortable eye sore but contribute nothing to his utter lack of talent and humor. He's loud, rude, pushy and hyper but funny? Nope.He is also extremely difficult to understand. His accent - whatever it is - is grating on the ears. He's just a creep. Not different and exciting, just creepy and UNFUNNY.

Their positioning makes certain connections neater and more practical than those on the back of the CPU or those in my attached small hub.

While I can not recommend this cable at the moment, I can highly recommend HDE for their customer service.

With my stock VGA cable I received with my now 10 year old monitor, both of these applications worked flawlessly.I wrote to customer service and they sent another cable, which was reportedly tested before shipping. The same problems occurred. It would cost more to return the cables than the actual purchase price. Don't waste your money. In this case, you truly get what you pay for.

But I know it's not the adapter itself because it works fine with my old cable. The cable is fairly thick and has only one ferrite bead (as opposed to the two shown in the picture and implied by the description). I don't think the lack of a 2nd ferrite bead is really an issue though.Basically, might work when not using an adapter of any kind. But I got blurry text like a few of the other reviewers.

Connecting my laptop to a new Vizio TV using my old three-foot cable worked great., The native resolution of my tv was recognized and I received 1920 X 1080. With this cable, my laptop was not able to recognize the TV/monitor and thus it only used a portion of the screen and was poor quality. I was not able to get the 1400X 900 that some others received but was limited to 800X 600 (or something close if that number doesn't make sense?) I spent a long time fiddling trying to make the cable work but no luck. Once I plugged in the old cable back came the high resolution. I do appreciate the low price and thus the low risk of taking a chance that it might work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cable cheap price.","review":"Timely delivery, good quality monitor cable.

Although this material can apply to personal use, it is geared more towards system administrators and networked environments.The structure of the book is very well laid out, giving you the ability to jump from product to product or area of interest (such as AIM, eDonkey, or IRC as a whole). This approach makes it easy to locate the information you are looking for quickly, making it an excellent reference. The author has done a great job in being realistic is the approach to these systems. Rather than totally restricting their use, this book helps you to live with these systems, recognizing that they are often used or required for businesses.If you are running a network, you almost definitely have this type of traffic on it.

It proved to be quite interesting and very revealing. The Richard Lester interview pieces may drag in some parts (being unaware of Mr. Lester's own filmography, this may seem destined), yet the two directors do contemplate a variety of subjects outside of filmmaking (the purpose of man, religion, and many other topics). The journal entries are hilarious bits and pieces of the Writer's Deliema/Writer's Block. Soderbergh constantly engages and his bizarre sense of humor peppers the book (all of the footnotes, for instance).All in all, fascinating read, and it even turned me on to the films of Lester (bought \\"The Knack\\" the day after reading it).Bravo, Steve."},{"rating":"2","title":"putting choice in the health equation","review":"This is a refreshing book which brings health choices back to the individual rather than promoting one magic cure for everyone. It has very helpful discussions about the history of medicine and will as well as intriguing insights into the health choices of the famous people described in each chapter. Dr. Reynolds gives many inspiring stories of his patients who made choices for health as well as provides a wealth of information about research on many health problems. The book has a wonderful rhythm, especially when read aloud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulkier than expected","review":"First, the pros: The quality of this \\"card\\" is good. The material and stitching are heavy duty, and the springy frame indeed springs. I haven't had the Lastolite long enough to test, but it looks like both the gray and white faces can be cleaned of eventual miscellaneous spots well enough.The cons: For being basically a glorified windshield screen, this is expensive. I bought this small size specifically for the anticipated relative compactness when folded up. In that, I am disappointed. The Ezybalance itself folds into a pancake about 5\\" in diameter, and 1.5\\" thick. When put into the included zippered pouch, which is unnecessarily bulky, the stowed away size is about 7\\" dia x 2\\" thick. That, when trying to pack compactly, is huge. Huge enough that the thing probably won't get packed, no matter how well it works, when space is tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not look like the photo on the Lastolite site.","review":"I received the Lastolite today and was I disappointed. It does not look like the authentic lastolite Ezybalance card. It has White trimming 1/2 wide going all the way around the gray and white area with in the black outer ring reducing the size of the gray and white area not to mention the a patent tag is on the same side of the gray area which is also annoying and interfering. I have to say this has to be a knock off. I am not sure what other customers have received but this one is not what I see in the photo here or on the lastolite site. I am contemplating sending it back The only reason I would not is because of the low cost. I would not recommend purchasing this item from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use to set custom white balance","review":"It's very easy to use this. In my Canon Rebel, I just take a photo of my subject with this card and then set the custom WB using this photo and it automatically corrects the white balance.

All of the photos of this product that I could find before buying it showed the gray side only so I was caught by surprise when the white side didn't have cross-hairs on it. I shoot macro in a tent/dome sometimes and when setting my custom white balance it's nice for the camera to have something to focus on when the white card fills the frame.

I thought getting new technology would improve on my 30+ years old Panasonic night reception of an admitedly weak station. I received this model in the afternoon and immediately tuned it to my station: Nothing! In day time! The old radio was receiving just fine. The only way to get the station was to move the Sony to the middle of the bedroom AND rotate it to the perfect angle; couple of degrees off and the signal was lost.I contacted Dependable Resource (bought there via Amazon) and they deserve 5 stars for the total refund including shipping both ways.It would have been just what I was looking for: a simple, good quality radio. Next door station NPR was coming in perfectly. Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, nice sound ...","review":"This radio looks good. The simple three knobs and sleek black box are well designed. I like the acrylic block on top that the clock shines through.When you can tune in a strong station the sound quality is smooth and full.Of course you realize that with one speaker it is monaural but that's OK. I bought this radio in hopes of listening to baseball games. I can pick up the AM station that carries the game clearly enough to be listenable, but I could get almost no FM stations without an external antenna. The ICF-M1000 has an external 75-ohm coaxial antenna connection.I wish that it had some sort of alarm function and I can't believe Sony didn't at least include an FM antenna wire in the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply beautiful.........but no reception","review":"We bought the Sony radio to listen to a specific PBS station serving Miami to Palm Beach and we're right in th middle in Ft.Lauderdale.Well all we picked up was static.So I attached a simple 75 ohm line antenna and still no reception.Then I bought an RCA twin arm antenna and lifted the radio as high as i could stretch the electric cord.The result is we get perfect reception,clear as a bell all the time.GREAT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Beware","review":"Beware of items that do not come from Amazon.

It has a tone control, and while you can change from treble to bass, there doesn't seem to be any midrange that is clear to hear.Also, in hooking up my tape deck, the sound on \\"aux in\\" was not up to par.If you are looking for a nice, basic table radio that has straight-forward controls, I recommend the Tivoli instead.Sony could have done a better job with this one; I gave it to my nephew, who didn't care about the mid-range."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure","review":"Judging from the price drop this little piece of retro from Sony will soon disappear and that is a shame.It's a radio.

Sure you can plug your mp3 player into it via the headphone connection but there is no dock, no external screen, and not even a place to rest your player.It has three beautiful knobs that turn like diamonds on glass. Tuning, Volume, and Bass/Treble. And two buttons Power, and Band or Line selector.It is simplicity. It is elegance. It is a fine radio.

I wanted to get her a radio that wouldn't take up too much counter space, really high quality, and, most importantly, simple to use. This radio had all of those qualities and she loves it. The few stations she listens to come in crystal clear, she can turn the volume up without any hint of distortion, and there aren't a plethora of knobs and buttons.

I got so sick of his quivering voice singing about his paper thin suburban problems that I sold it back after one listen. I'm not one who believes that grown men can't cry, but if that's all they do, then I just can't take it.

There are only about 3 songs on here that I enjoy listening to, the others feel like a chore. The voice wavering is a nice gimick, but a little irritating at times. The song structures and progressions are pretty lame, too, and in my opinion, that's more important than the lyrics.

However, there is something that bugs me just a little bit in this cd. He seems to be having a real struggle finding God in his life. I just don't see the reason why he had to write about it, although Conor Oberst is already a very emotionally stripped person. This is great modern folk, and should not be passed up by anyone. However, if you taken offense to some individualistic thoughts on Religion, I suggest you read lyrics before you ultimately decide to buy this, because this could be offensive to some. Also, the songs just aren't as good, and they repeat themselves often. The songs last waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to long. Like the Energeizer Bunny, they just keep going and going and going and going and going and going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh you are the roots that sleep beneath my heroin addiction","review":"This record is probably the most innovative record to come out of 2004.

This album is no exception, has great lyrics, it's orininal sounding, as a listener you are happily surprised where he goes lyrically and musically, if you want a pretty voice - go listen to the Back Street Boys, the way he puts songs together is special. If you are a true student of the great songwriters, like Lyle Lovett, Townes, Dylan, Springsteen, REM then this guy is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"insipid, pretentious,wimpy,boring","review":"What is wrong with the indie/alt community these days? They praise these terrible, insipid bands that can't write strong well crafted songs. Bright Eyes is everything wrong with not only indie music but just rock music in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Precocious Nonsense","review":"I foolishly believed all the 5 star reviews and was quite intrigued by the first track - 'Big Picture'. It starts off with ambient car travel noises then fades into a minimalistic song consisting of just primitive guitar and distraught vocals. The packaging of the album is also novel but it belies the quality of the rest of the album. It is in fact rough as guts but not in an appealing way. The manic vocals become very annoying within the first 15 minutes and there is no compensating quality or novelty in the song structures - the words may be interesting but require to much effort to follow. I have a 'two song' rule ie. if I can't find two songs on a CD that I can readily listen to, then I sell the CD. I will be selling this 'Bright Eyes' CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"An aquired taste - to be kind","review":"Bought 2 Bright Eyes releases based on an an intriguing NPR piece - what did I hear?These discs sound rather like open mike night at the laundromat interrupted occasionally by bad poetry slam session recorded out back in the garage.I tried.

This album is kind of indulgent and incomplete. Honestly, it's an isnult to the fans. Oberst went from a pretty cool musician to a mass-pleasing emo whiner. Fevers and Mirrors is a masterpeice, no doubt. This album is descent but very jumbled. You will buy it and force yourself to like it more than you reall do, then it will probably stay on the shelf for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This was the first album I ever listened to from Bright Eyes. I was browsing a record store one day in 2003 when the name of the band caught by eye and I decided to give them a try. This was probably the best decision I have ever made in my life... as it is now 2012 and Bright Eyes has been my favorite band for the past 9 years. This album is brilliantly written. I don't think anyone can convey a story though a song as well as Conor Oberst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Eyes review","review":"A teriffic, thinking person's album. Nothing ground breaking musically and not a cd one can pop in for a simple Saturday afternoon drive to the store; this is a inspiring and fascinating listen. The lyrics are well thought out and poetic. I got the feeling I was in a small bar listening to an undiscovered poet performing his heart out with a small band."},{"rating":"2","title":"bob dylan meets 2004","review":"This is music and lyrics that meld the best of what's gone before with the future. Brilliance shines through in the catchiest song on the album being a 3/4 time waltz lamenting the pop album.This is one hell of a desert island disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conor Oberst, genius at work.","review":"This Bright Eyes album is wonderful from start to finish. It's definitely a concept album; it needs to be listened through all the way. The songs are full of emotional singing and turns of phrase. Conor Oberst is extraordinarily poetic and an amazing guitarist."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Insert witty title here*","review":"OKay here is the high and low of it. This isn't \\"EMO\\" as some people call it, but it does fall into the \\"emotional rock\\" section. His (Connors) music is really touching, and I could listen to this CD over and over. Track 7, I don't know when but a day is gonna come\\", reminds me a little bit of Jim Morrison's poetry, and it is one of the best tracks on the CD. \\"Lover I Don't Have To Love\\" and \\"Bowl of Oranges\\" are great too. His music isn't that sad, as I have heard people say before, but rather, emotional. Bright Eyes rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull eyes.","review":"This poppy, folky hodge podge of instrumentation and styles should be oddly cool, yet is just plain boring. Whiny, lazy vocals can't hide a dull voice which is what CONOR ORBST has. He writes good lyrics, and has no problem emoting, it's his songwriting that needs help. Long, quiet tunes make this a moody CD that has very few bright moments and on most tracks ORBST sounds like he's about to burst into tears, yet you don't feel at all sorry for him. He doesn't sound tortured, he sounds like a suburban shoegazer with a lot of equipment at his disposal. Mixed with a plethora of different bells and whistles (all kinds of horns and such), this is a big production that can't hide the fact that it's actually an egomaniacal collection of single feelings with a large back up band. Bo-ring."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is ridiculous.","review":"Bright Eyes is a great band regardless of what people might say on this board. There are very few posts that actually discuss anything about the band. I see either \\"Bright Eyes is too good for this world!!,\\" or \\"He's too whiny and you're all posers.\\" Shut the f up. Conor Oberst is great because he explores various routes of guitar, orchestra, and vocals; while at the same, he conveys his message of the urbanization and capitalist-takover that is creeping its way into his hometown of Omaha."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Think This is To Think","review":"What is this, these layers of guitars and cellos and drums? What makes me feel like this? Conan Oberst has brought something to the world the world is not ready for. We hide uselessly in its shadow and the more we try to understand its extremely relevent lyrics the farther we get from enilightment. If you are buddist and you beileve in karma, then you should know that Bright Eyes would never go to hell. Even if he thrashed buildings, murdered people, or destroyed everything that has been done to make this world right. This poetry is a masterpiece not deserved by the world in its current state. please buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrissey lives on!","review":"If you're over 24, don't bother. Really.

The sweet honesty of this kids words, the strange innocence with which he writes. It gives me chills, man, it gives me chills. I write music and constantly find myself beating myself up over the inability to write lyrics of this caliber. The imagery is amazing. The scenes are scenes from our own lives that this artist illustrates perfectly. Love, honesty, insecurity. . . it's all here. Some of the music is so wonderfully tragic that I just want to bury my head in my pillow and bawl - and then I will hear one of his ever-present witty observations and it brings the smile back. I love this album. I love this band. God, I can't believe I missed the Houston show. I am soooo disappointed.(no - I'm not suicidal. . . lol)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruudy Record gives me hope of Stardom.","review":"Man, this record got great reviews from all of the heavies. I bought it without even checking out the sound bites. I could make a better record in my basement. The artist has talent and potential to make good music, but his attempt at being dark and creative impedes the listenability (is that a word?) of this disc.At one point someone screws up during the recording of a song.

It is great to see that there finally is a contender for that dubious throne. Bright Eye's \\"Lifted\\" is breathing the same rare air as the aforementioned \\"Replica\\" as the one that critics love, trendy wannabees rave about, and only those who do not let their opinions be swayed by others have the guts to admit the truth - that it is a total trainwreck.Interesting, but kind of in the same way as smelling a bad odor.

Much to my surprise, when I played this cd I was greeted with the whiniest, worst sounding, pretentious garbage I have heard in my life. I mean wow. I can listen to \\"bowl of oranges\\"...but it's still a little tough. Whoever compared him to Springsteen or Dylan really should just quit their job and go live in the woods because you're a moron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!","review":"What an overrated piece of junk. Just because the kid touches on big subjects at such a young age doesn't make this album any more listenable. With his affected accent, Oberst is trying to be Nebraska's answer to protest-era Billy Bragg and the Blokes. He misses by a long shot. If I wanted dissonance in my music, I'd pick up the latest by Sleater-Kinney.Hard to believe this made it on so many critic's \\"best of\\" lists. It must have been a worse year for new music than I originally thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thats a long title","review":"That probably means its good, right? I hate anybody that listens to Bright Eyes, seriously. BOB DYLAN AND TOM WAITS? WHOEVER MADE THESE COMPARISONS NEEDS A REALITY CHECK."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the whole, I was disappointed","review":"I bought this record after hearing no music from Conor Oberst, and nothing about him except a comparison to Bob Dylan. In my opinion the comparison is inappropriate. Like Oberst, Dylan was a loquacious and sometimes vague lyricist, but Dylan also had an ear for a hook that Oberst does not seem to have. While the backing band is obviously capable, the music, like the lyrics, rambles. Without the clear and repetitive phrasing that typically ties a song together, many of the tracks on this record seem to go everywhere and nowhere at once; and rather than a Dylanesque genius, Oberst comes across as a ranting adolescent who doesn't know when to shut up. Oberst clearly has a way for words, but he has many things to learn about songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Looking For... I guess","review":"After reading such great reviews on this categorized \\"emo\\" band here on Amazon.com, I thought I'd dive in and buy some of this guy's music. I was visiting a friend in Norfolk and found this album along with the collection of songs from 1995-1997. I bought both and popped them into the CD player in the car immediately after the purchase. I was soured pretty much right away. Not giving up easily, I tried a listen on my 3 hour drive home. I couldn't help but feel annoyed with this purchase--I usually have good luck with random dives, but this time I wasn't so lucky. There were a few places in \\"Lifted...\\" where I heard a bit of Robert Smith in the vocals, but that was it as far as saving grace. Perhaps this is a hit with a younger crowd, I don't know, but it's not at all what I as a poet lover thought it would be. Perhaps I'd buy a book of his poetry, but never his music again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beside two songs, absolutely terrible.","review":"I can't understand why anyone would hold Connor Oberst to such an idol status.

Could Kasher be any more blatent with his whining and wallowing? When have we not heard this before, and done 100% better? If you are going to make this kind of music could you at least TRY and give it a creative twist? This must be why the average age in line waiting to see a Bright Eyes concert is 13. Poor little lads and lassies, they know not what they pay money to see and hear. Nice try Kasher, but I'm on to you and your \\"trying oh so hard to be sincere\\".

His voice and phrasing didn't impress me much the first few times I heard his music. Listening more intently, I was astonished at his lyrics, especially \\"Waste of Paint.\\" Then the other tunes made sense and delivered an amazingly complex worldview that I continue to appreciate. Then I heard \\"When the president talks to God\\" and this guy really nails it. I'm a fan. I'm not nearly going to say he's a Dylan or anything, but his talent is appropriate for our times, and his music, in a very current way, makes a strong statement. He's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give It a Couple of Chances","review":"First of all, I would like to clear this up, Bright Eyes (Conor O'berst) fancies himself as a folk singer and NOT emo in any way. Now that that's said and done I would like to say thatI am now a huge fan of Bright Eyes, but I didnt start out that way. This was the first album of his that I bought and at first I was VERY dissappointed, in fact I hated it. My biggest mistake was not at first paying as much attention to the lyrics. They truly are good, but I couldn't compare them to Dylan because they aren't anything alike. Just take my word THEY ARE GOOD. His singing is an issue though, I admit at times it's nearly unbearable, but it's got a lot of heart and conviction so its alright in my eyes. He helps prove that singing isn't always the most important thing to song, neither is guitar riffs. If you want that this isnt the album, but if you want heartfelt and deep lyrics it won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so......... wow","review":"This is one of the greatest things you will ever hear. It is raw, yes. The singing sucks, yes. The guitar playing is simple, yes.But some of the greatest songwriting of our time. Conor is a genuis the way he uses words to express sadness and happiness. The songs range from just Conor and his guitar to some songs featring an entire orchestra. You are lifted, feeling depressed and yet totally happy. Track 12 sucks, but the rest of the album is a wonderful statement: a man whose life is consumed by love and hate. It might be ruff on the edges, but there is something woderful and truly deep in here."},{"rating":"2","title":"the one cd I would bring to a lonely island","review":"This album definitly pin points the change of music as we know it. At 22 Conor Oberst must be aware that he is a genius. This album seems to be his way of saying,\\"Im ready to take the throne and open everyones eyes to an new way.\\" This is the number one album of 2002.

First of all the whole CD has no tune to it whatsoever, it has like 2 good songs on it, and the quality on most of the tracks are so bad that there is no point to even listening to the full song.

Her subjects are uniformly propserous, well-educated, self-aware, and articulate. It reads like an expanded article from the Washington Post, and since the author is a Post writer there, no wonder. Lawyers and doctors are her featured subjects. Some of the books and studies she cites may be worth pursing, but it is hard to tell.

See what I mean?)I would not recommend this book for content or style."},{"rating":"1","title":"A writer out of his area of expertise","review":"Attempting to capitilize on the success of The Myth of the Great War this volume is truly not worth the read. Mosier has no conception of operational realities on the battlefield. He doesn't understand tactics either. On top of this he doesn't know much about military equipment. This leaves him with no platform of knowledge to stand on and write a book about how the tactical applications of military equipment affected operational realities in World War Two.Don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fallacious tripe!","review":"Hilariously bad revisionist history. I can't decide whether the author took this wholly unsupported contrarian view of armored warfare to garner personal attention, or as a support for his Montgomery nutswinging.I received this book as a gift, and laughs aside, still feel as though I paid too much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It gets a single star because one can't give it zero.","review":"I am grateful to Mr. Michael Licari, who provided a fine review in enough detail that I don't need to waste more time with this book to write one of my own. To my mind, this book illustrates the all too common use of a provocative title and uneven research to sell a book. When one can claim Suvorov (Rezun) as a pivotal source one needs to revaluate their acceptance criteria.In short, it is a poorly reasoned screed that is authoritatively written so that one can be mislead into believing that the author knows what he is talking about. While there are a few worthy points in the book they aren't worth the sorting reqired to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Revisionist Author Myth","review":"This book ranks at the top of my list for books that never should have been written. It is painfully clear that Mosier is no historian. No military commander in history would reject executing an overwhelming assault if it were in his capability. Mosier states over and over that leaders on both sides failed to learn their lessons. Wars and even battles are evolutionary in nature and no one knows exactly how they will turn out. Using the author's logic, Mike Tyson's success in the boxing ring was not because he was more skilled or more powerful but because he had a political advantage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tragedy the likes only an English professor could conjure","review":"Words simply cant describe my utter contempt for the lack of authoritative research the author displays in this pedantic effort. I will not repeat the previous maligns of this novel only to say that any student of WWII armored warfare will cringe at the numerous inaccuracies, pufferies, and fallacies throughout this tragedy of errors. The \\"author\\" even opines that the Panther tank first saw service in 1944? This glaring mistake typifies the entire work. The Blitzkrieg Myth is a dumbed down effort targeted for those readers who know even less than the author.

The woman was scary, the filming was amateur, the whole thing was tacky. I mean, I was expecting a little tacky because it is burlesque but this was way beyond over the top. I was expecting a breakdown of burlesque moves and then a routine using those moves to give me a workout. Instead there were tips on how to do bumps and grinds, how to stand etc but never did I see an actual routine. HORRIBLEThe ONLY reason that this got a second star is because of the woman with the tassle twirling. I found it informative, fun and I am ready to run out and find some tassles to give this a try.The other bonuses were a waste of my time and worse than tacky. DO NOT GET THIS DVD.

The production value was homemade and it was not a workout, it seems as if the word \\"workout\\" was added to the packaging afterwards as well as repackaging the cover....the instructor is over-the-top and I found a bit tacky. Back the workout, there are too many interuptions to consider it a workout, but I tried even doing the moves by themselves and repeating them and still found them to be instructional, but not a workout that would have any exercise benefits: cardio, core, flexibility or otherwise. She certainly does not discuss the muscles you are using or should be focusing on. Burlesque seems to be a rare topic,and this was the only one I could find, but I am sure there will be more dvds soon, I just ordered Carmen Electra's new Bedroom & Cardio Burlesque by Dolfina and I will let you know how those are when I receive them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Ok...First of all, this is not a workout by any means!She teaches you some moves at a very low pace, very uninspiring, terrible quality of the video, it'sworse than homemade.

Nice little single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Voice and Good Looking!!!","review":"When I first listened to this cd I was in a way disappointed, partly because I was comparing him to Josh Groban which is my \\"main man\\"!!! I have always loved the romantic songs in a different language and any cd that is like that I buy. I grew up listening to opera and I come from an Italian heritage, But I do enjoy this cd I think he could have picked some better songs to go with his style and voice capacity.

I will buy his next one defineatly!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE VOICE...INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL!","review":"I am simply floored by the beautiful tone of this guy's voice. Why he's not a bigger star here in the U.S. is beyond me. He blows Josh Groban(Josh who?), out of the water! Not only is he a great talent, but he's also got a strong musical education/foundation behind him too. And on top of it, he's got movie star looks to boot. (You know, I'm beginning to hate this Mario guy!). But seriously, there is not a bad song on this set. I love them all, especially \\"Buongiorno Principessa\\" and the Greek song \\"Lunna Rossa\\", which has me dancing like an drunken idiot whenever I play it! If you don't get up and dance to this song, then you're heartless. I was dancing around the place like I was freekin' Zorba!I hope this guy really blows up big in AMerica. Josh Groban needs some real competition from a guy who knows his stuff.Just BUY this CD..buy 2 or 3..this guy can SING his ass off!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravissimo","review":"I really really like this guy. Personally, Josh Groban is definately my favorite, but Mr. Frangoulis has definately got it going on. If you like Josh, you'll very likely enjoy Mario. His voice has, for me at least, a more matured sound and it seems like a good mix between Andrea Bocelli and Groban. All in all, he's super talented and it's a CD worth buying because all the tracks are good. Don't look for a lot of English though because that's not his style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Spectacular! This one also I can't stop listening!

He is no where even close to opera. He is nowhere even close to Bocelli, Watson, or Amante. All of whom can carry their voices at least 1/2 way through an opera house. Frangoulis's voice wouldn't even carry the front row. Ladies, keep the moist spots down to a quiver. Concentrate on the lack of substance in his voice. Nothing is there. He does not connect. Like not a Bocelli, Watson or even Michael Amante does. There's a reason he is not a star in the U.S. It's called lack of talent. Get over it ladies.

Frangoulis has a gorgeous, velvety smooth voice, although his delivery is at times over-the-top, it is less so than the others of this genre. The orchestral, beat driven music is fun and exciting. The entire album more original and creative than his competitors(not to say there is anything wrong with Groban or the likes). Simply put, this album is better than the others-well worth a listen and a purchase. But a pure piece of creative art it is not. A beautiful voice-fun arrangements, and he is likely to improve with future releases-though he may be forced to choose a genre. Lets hope he releases both a pop album and an opera album-It works well for Sarah Brightman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Wonderful","review":"I wouldn't be able to express the way this guy makes me feel, great voice, sweet, tender, strong, brilliant, pasionate.

I highly recommend this CD. He's a new talent to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY SOOTHING AND HIGHLY ELECTRIFYING DVD/CD","review":"This man is indeed a great performer. Talking about Great Perfomances, the Sometimes I Dream Concert is one great performance by a young man that could hypnotize and stir the inner soul of an audience. I am deeply moved by all of the songs in the CD/DVD, my favorites are Vincero Perdero, and the most emotionally charged song of Sometimes I Dream (E Lucevan Le Stelle)pop version. All the songs were delivered with such passion and feeling that you are totally drawn to the performer, mesmerized and wished that the song would never end. I know that's how I feel everytime I listen and watch him sing. I bought his other CD's too -Acropolis Concert and Fengari Erotevmeno because I cannot get enough of him. I never tire listening to him. Trust me, he is superbly fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific to the end!","review":"I ordered it blind not having heard him cause of a review and I was very pleasantly surprised and happy to find it was beautiful from beginning to end. He has a beautiful voice, easy to listen to, and I'm anxiously looking forward to more from him. I am a huge fan of Andrea Bocelli, and I enjoy Mario's album just as much as Andrea's.

His music, filled with passion, takes you half-way around the world to the sounds of the Mediterranean. Whether he's singing in perfect Greek, Italian, French, or English, Mario's voice fills you with excitement, happiness, and peace at the same time. The DVD of \\"Sometimes I Dream\\" is just as remarkable as the CD, with the added bonus of seeing Mario perform his music live. . .breathtaking!!!

Honestly, save your $15 and don't get dragged into the hype of it being a \\"Linkin Park\\" spin-off of sorts. There are a few decent songs with great beats but overall, the lyrics are stupid, uninspiring, and lame. You can't even compare this with Eminem because Eminem murders Fort Minor. Fort Minor will fade quicker than a stinging, red handprint on my ass. Again, this is not Linkin Park in any sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy's an Eminem wannabe!!!","review":"Linkin Park is one of the worst bands ever, and Mike Shinoda was a terrible rapper. So when they disbanded a couple of years ago, everyone else faded into oblivion, while Mike decided to make his own hip-hop project, which is, of course, Fort Minor.Alright, enough introductions. Why is this guy an Eminem wannabe, you may ask? Well, I just got home from sax lessons, and I heard \\"Remember the Name\\" and I was satisfied. That song is basically Mike's version of Eminem's \\"Lose Yourself\\", with the Yamaha keyboard beat, similar lyrics, and in the end, just sucking. As for the rest of the album, \\"Where'd You Go\\" is awful and the rest of the album just isn't any better.For a good 2005 release, check out Opeth's \\"Ghost Reveries\\". For good rap, check out A Tribe Called Quest, Public Enemy, NWA, PRE-DEATH Tupac, Run-DMC, heck, Outkast is better than this, at least they have talent.I hope Mike Shinoda returns to McDonalds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst CD in Music History","review":"This is by far the worst album I have heard in my life.

Obvious, they've never hear of any of Mike's other collabrations or you'll know that its a bunch of BS.In the group Mike, shows exactly why in Linkin Park, the guy is respected as their main music score writer. This album is another split-off of LP's usual stuff, so some who were looking of a 'different' sound sorry, you wont get it here. But though who are looking for a filler till the boys get back into the studios, this album will not disappoint.

Tracks like \\"Remember the Name\\", \\"Petrified\\", and \\"In Stereo\\" are perfect for blasting at a party or from a car, and most tracks will leave you stunned. Petrified, even! \\"Kenji\\" deserves special note. The track is about the Japanese internment camps of WWII, more specifically, the experieces of Mike's own family in said camps. Around here, it's gotten everybody from little elementary kids who like the beats, to the grandparents of those children ((and mine too)) into it.

It's really easy to listen to unlike most of the stuff out there that gets really old.Stand out tracks: Kenji (this is honesty and truth), High Road, Where'd you go, Feel like home, Cigarettes and Red to Black.I'm also loving the bonus tracks!

There are some truly bizarre musical/rap interludes - imagine Backstreet Boys but 1000 times worse. There was a lot of hopelessness in it as well.

Fortunately, I started out with this volume and read Sanctuary. If you want to get into Faulkner this is an excellent place to start. It is a great story, shocking though it may be, and gives a good idea of what's to come if you want to delve deeper into WF. Next I read Light in August which may be one of his best. Faulkner is a genius at creating characters and then going into the details of their psyche. Every now and then he gets a little over-indulgent in his wordsmithing but always seems to bring it back home before going too far afield.Faulkner is the green tea of literature. He's a great story teller but still a bit of an aquired taste. Once you get into his work, though, you'll definitely want more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Drunk Mellifluous","review":"Faulkner has a savage and beautiful voice, if you can call it his voice: it's like some linguistic force comes from nowhere and overwhelms his stories and takes them to places that the novel-form never went before. His writing is wildly modern yet full of ancient, mythic resonances - the Bible, the Greeks - which creates a very large sense of time and history in his work. Events traumatize, ripple across history. At his best (As I Lay Dying, The Sound and the Fury, Absalom! Absalom!), Faulkner is difficult but fascinating, worth our patient reading efforts. He invents new ways of writing for a modernizing world that needs some way to keep contact with the past and the dead, and this is both taxing and exhilarating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best from one of the South's best writers ...","review":"Faulkner is, without a doubt, one of the South's best writers, and re-reading this collection of novels after many years affirms that belief for me.

Also, the generic didn't fit well into the camera case; I had to shave off some of the plastic on the sides, and it was still hard to get in and out. This one not only works fine, but fits properly.

I saw this book at the bookstore while looking for a law school guidebook for my pre-law niece and was immediately intrigued. I bought it, read the whole thing in a week, and have to say that it earns my seal of approval (then I passed it along to my niece). Everything Greene says in this book is 100% on target. I think the fact that this book is written by a recent law graduate makes it the most valuable. All the info is fresh and up-to-date, and it's written in a way that current law students will really identify with. I appreciated how Greene honestly and candidly discussed topics such as finding summer jobs and doing extracurriculars (like the law review), and went into detail about the pros and cons of each. I'd recommend this book to any law student who comes into my office--in fact, I already have several times this week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating outline of topics, but where's the detail?","review":"It's almost as if Rebecca Greene JD, the author, doesn't want to give away HER special secret knowledge about law school, but, honey, isn't that what the Dummies people were paying you for?For example, she provides an example of a 1st-year law school exam question, but no example of what an answer would look like. She discusses preparing outlines and provides 1 example but doesn't explain why the outline includes the materials it does. She mentions the super-condensed outline, like the \\"revision\\" that British students are so famous for, but no example of what this might look like.Buy this book if you want a tantalizing peak at some of the things you'll experience in law school, but there must be better guides that will actually tell you how to succeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic overview of law school","review":"I wasn't impressed by this book at all.

He is not very gentle, and I needed something fairly sturdy, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money, so this seemed to be the perfect option.So far, it has worked out okay. There is one piece of plastic at the mounting point that has cracked, but that hasn't been too much of an issue (and for the price, we weren't expecting it to last forever). All of the pivot points have held up and have been sturdy. And we like the height extension.

After reading reviews on the Tiffen I realized I made a mistake when reading in depth. I found some great resources who put several filters to the test. For the Money, the Hoya was by far the best. I have used it for about 8000 shots with my Rebel T2i on a Tamron 18-270 3.5-6.3 and haven't had any issue's what-so-ever.

I have it attached to a Sigma 18-150 lens and it holds the lens cap just as well as the lens does. Matte black finish is very nice, brand labeling in white faces down when it is screwed in place.Optical quality is excellent. Hard to believe how clear the filter is to visible light. It removes UV haze as advertised and is definitely a better alternative to a NC filter (for my purposes anyway).Other reviews about it smudging easily aren't kidding. This thing smudges from anything. I used a 'dirty' microfiber and it smudged. Cleaned the cloth and tried again with some lens cleaner and the smudges went away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoya Digital Filter","review":"It seems like a good overall filter so far, however, it does attract alot of dust.

It claims that this filter minimizes such effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoya 72mm Pro1 Digital Multi-coated UV filer","review":"I ordered this filter to use on a Nikon 28-200mm zoom lens.

It's one of those books that you can't put down because you keep wanting to see what is going to happen next.

I know that when I read it I felt like I was there with Virgina Reed and the rest of the Donner Party. I believe that even if you aren't that interested in pioneers and such you will enjoy this book. However I will have to admit it was depressing in parts and it is definetly not an uplifting book. How ever it also will make you admire the strenght the Donner Party had to get throught there hardships and struggles they had to endure.

Who else is writing prose like this? Who else is this funny? It's deep, subversive, blasphemous humor. This book, like his column, is theoretically about the media business, but it's really about the sanctimony of American culture. Wolff rips it apart. He says what every person knows, but is too well-mannered, or repressed to say.

BUT, the costume turned out to be a big disappointment. The quality of the material is poor and bad stitching. The material feels like it is going to be torn anytime when the child moves about.

The costume itself is very good quality; the holster, belt and whistle are not, but our boys don't use them, so it doesn't matter to us. My only complaint is that the buttons are clamped on (metal fasteners) instead of sewn on. One button came off within the first day or so, and another shortly after. We used J B Weld to put them back on, but I would prefer buttons that are sewn on. The directions say to iron over the patches to make them more secure, but I sewed the patches on.

Albert Fish's story is resplendent with myths and speculation, but this book takes you through from beginning to end setting straight the facts. One example is the story that Albert Fish damaged the electric chair somehow during his execution due to the needles he had been shoving inside himself for years. Not so.I really like the way Harold Schechter goes about writing these books. He doesn't try to over-dramatize the content, but the impact of what is happening comes across anyway. 5 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"As frightening as it can get","review":"Deranged is both extraordinary and disgusting at the same time. Extraordinary because no one I've ever read about before, not even in fiction books, are as deranged as Albert Fish in Harold Schetcher's book. If you have any interest of serial killers at all, I recomend you to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What, exactly, was Albert Fish?","review":"If everything in Schechter's book can be taken at face value, Albert Fish was not just a serial child murderer, but exhibited every known sex perversion and a few unique to himself. However, I have deep reservations about just how crazy Fish was. Essentially everything about Fish's psychological quirks comes from one source, the notorious Dr. Frederick Wertham. Wertham was a gullible, naive pseudoscientist whose absurd antics in the early 50s are well-known. Since Fish rarely told the truth about anything, and virtually nothing can be reliably documented about him beyond a few anecdotes from family members, and since his only chance of saving his life was an insanity plea, I am extremely unconvinced that Fish was quite as incomparably weird as he made out. Apart from that this is one of Schechter's usual good jobs of research. His real \\"find\\" was the lawyer who defended Fish, who provided a large amount of detailed, \\"inside\\" info about Fish's trial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but did anyone proofread the thing?","review":"I found this book really interesting and enjoyed reading it. Now I don't know about the actual paper copy of the book, but the Kindle version is RIDDLED with misspellings, missing and/or just plain WRONG puncuation, and sometimes even entirely wrong words. I do not think it was the author's fault, but the publisher needs to fire their proofreader (if they even have one)! Ever heard of spellcheck? I found all the mistakes annoying and distracting but I did enjoy the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harold Schechter does it again!","review":"An excellent book! I love this author and his books on true crime in the 1920's. He gives you the feel for the era past and all the facts (well researched)on the background of Abert Fish, the crime, the court, other crimes commited, the articles in the newspapers at the time, the sentencing and a good follow-up.It's a book that flowes easily and is a good read. This book along with all of his other book is not one to resell - it's a keeper. I'm into true crime, the mafia, gangster books, along with history books and I'm reading all the time. I do not give out 5 stars very easily, so it must be a good book. You've done it again Harold. Keep writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"deranged but good..","review":"I read this book while I was travelling around my country (Iceland) and I just gotta say that I highly recommend this book cause it's so realistic, it's like you feel you're back in those days..... it takes you as close as possible to the crime scene(s).... be sure to get a copy if you like reading a \\"shocking true story\\" but for those who are on the \\"fragile\\" notes... take one step at a time cause it contains lots of \\"evilness\\" from Mr.Fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am glad to see I am not alone.

Should have put it down in the first few pages. It NEVER got any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well researched","review":"I found this book to be filled with details, some times too many details. It is very obvious that the author researched this book. I was shocked to see pictures of the elderly man who did all these terrible things. It just goes to show you that sometimes a kindly old man is not anything more than a sick, perverted evil person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre subject matter, tedious reading","review":"Deranged is Harold Schecter's true crime history of the fascinating, horrifying life of Albert Fish. The reader must be prepared for graphic detail, which is often scatological and consistently perverse and disturbing. On the surface, Schecter falls short of creating a suspenseful nonfiction novel. His arbitrary historical anchors and tedious inclusion of irrelevant details detract from the coherence of the story. Even so, the extremity and depravity of Fish's behavior create an original, unforgettable glimpse into the workings of a criminal sexual psychopath. I recommend this book to true crime buffs who have not yet heard much about the case of Albert Fish because there are no other books on this subject that I have yet located."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking!!","review":"As I read this book, I would often put it down in disgust and fright, and ponder how a madman such as Albert Fish could commit the crimes he did. But 5 seconds later I was reading again, to see what would happen. This book is a must for true crime afficianados and proves there never was any \\"good old days\\" when you could walk the street without fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"If you want to learn some technique, this book lacks details and is not useful.

I think its a good product idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice option","review":"I read the reviews carefully before picking out a case for my Zire 22. I like the feel of these in my hand. I have had no problem with it picking up lint as other people suggested. Maybe part of growing older and not having children's snacks in my purse is a good thing. I do wish that a color choice was available and I didn't need two cases unless they don't wear well. I'll know that later and then have to use a blue case. I don't like blue that well. I know that is picky but color matters and if I had to buy two of these things I would like to choose the color. This is a good case and I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This is a great product. It protects my palm and I don't have to deal with flipping a case open every time I use it. It is not bulky at all. My daughter has dropped it a few times with the case on and nothing happened to it.

The soft case slips on pretty easily and allows access to all of the buttons and ports- including the reset button on the back. The texture will keep the device securely in a pocket, but allows me to pull it out firly easily. It also stays in place pretty well on a desk while I use it. There is also a little cushioning in case I drop my Z22 or have it banging against my knee in a cargo pocket. The main downside I see is that it muffles the speaker more than I would like. Sometimes I end up missing my reminders because of that. I also can't figure out why it came in a package of 2 and has so many screen protectors in the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good investment","review":"This case is a good investment if you use your palm pilot regularly. It keeps it from getting funky!"},{"rating":"2","title":"flexi-case","review":"I like the flexi-case for the palm z22. It helps me to hold on to it and is soft to the touch. I put one of the screen protectors on but took it off because it seemed to be in the way. The stylus does not damage the screen anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok for now","review":"I got the flexi case because there wasn't anything else available for the Z22. I'm not unhappy with the case. Of all the pda cases I've had, I think this one is probably to most protective against all the little bumps pda's have to endure. BUT, I'd prefer a case that covers the screen and doesn't pick up all the lint it comes in contact with (and seemingly all the lint within a quarter-mile radius!) and isn't hard to put in pockets in bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"serves its purpose in protecting the Z22. also, the sillicon material provides great traction on smooth surfaces....just gets a little dusty...otherwise great value for something not fancy and practical"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it intends to do.","review":"I bought this set as a first case for an intended Palm Z22, as yet to arrive. My ultimate intent was (still is) to shop for a harder flip-top case that will provide more protection over the long haul, but this soft plastic case is fine for now. Since the Z22 doesn't have docking or memory-stick insert features, I don't need a lot of high-end features, and I will never be wearing it on a belt. As is, the entire package fits neatly into niches within any number of hand- or tote-bags. As I think it it, the slight friction of the silicon is a bonus as the handheld isn't likely to slip out of said niches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product overall","review":"I love the z22 for its small size and light weight. I love the flexi case because it doesn't add bulk, but does provide some protection for the pda. It doesn't restrict functionality, and you never have to flip a cover to get at your data.One complaint: the silicone material is non-slip. This could be good if you're worried about the pda sliding off of a surface. However, this is not so good when trying to get it in/out of your pocket all day. It's not a major annoyance, but I do wish the material slid a little better. Also, it picks up pocket lint.Overall, it's a good deal, if you're looking for a slim case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive","review":"$9 shipping for a $12 item seems a bit excessive for something that only weighs a few ounces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute little cases","review":"I received these cases today and love them! They add very little bulk to my Z22, and still protect it. They fit like a glove and it's a great deal at $15 for two cases and 4 screen protectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice case without the bulk.","review":"I just got my Z22 and wanted something that would protect it and look cute without being too bulky and taking away from the little handheld's great design. These cases are it! They fit like a glove and protect wonderfully without taking away from the functionality and design at all. I thought after buying these that I might regret it and want a leather case, but really, who needs a leather case when you can have a skin-tight protective covering that allows you to use your device at any time? These do the job and you don't have anything to flip open, unbutton, unzip, etc.Overall, these are very practical, don't add bulk, and have a nice look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute and fits like a glove","review":"Pros:Very cute, comes with screen protectors, and keeps the palm from slipping out of your hands/off surfaces (especially if you're super clumsy like myself). I also like that it's semi-transparent because than you can place a magazine picture (or in my case--a fortune from a fortune cookie) in the back to cover up the serial number sticker and such. It's a great way to personalize your palm!Cons:None so far. Yes, it might tare if you slide it on and off so often--so don't waste your precious time in the morning changing between blue and white palm covers. And true it tends to gather lint--but it rubs right off too. I swear, it's self-cleaning or something because one hour it's there, and a few hours later, it's clean again.One word of caution for men: it's makes your palm look very \\"cute\\". Girls? You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent album.","review":"I was very pleasantly surprised by how good this album is. Mr. White has created a very melodic and and deeply moving compilation of songs. He cannot be Accused of hiding his emotions. His voice can only be described as angelic. His guitar playing is nothing short of 'groovy'. If I had a CD player, I'd buy a copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best indy artist NYC has to offer.","review":"White has outdone himself again with this one -- the music on this album is personal not whiney, powerful not overpowering. Ward White is probably the best independent-label artist New York City has produced in years, and for anybody who wishes to discover his work this album is definitely the place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it all day!","review":"What a great album! Ward really hits exactly what I'm thinking in a lot of places, from the brooding \\"I can't dance\\" to the Rockin' relationship-busting \\"Baby.\\" I find a lot of his lyrics entering into my daily speech -- 'You missed the point again, I can't believe I'm really that unclear.' Excellent stuff. Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ward White is All Right","review":"This album is as deep and hot as the Grand Canyon (without the cactus). It'll move you like a supercharged diesel Greyhound bus. WW is no Tommy One-hit. He'll survive forever, like Elvis or Ringo. Hats off to this one-of-a-kind poet, philosopher, singer and dancer. He's done it again. Oyez Oyez."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Response to T.A. (I had to delete my first review to write this one)","review":"Wow, I think some people are out there to criticize other reviewers rather than the artist. Just because I don't particularly enjoy Amanda's music does not mean I am an incompetent trumpeter who is blabbering about nonsense (I have been playing for 7 years).I will admit that when I first wrote the review I had less experience to listening to many diverse styles of music and thus my review showed some bias. However, Amanda still does not compare to the trumpet greats such as Maurice André, Wynton Marsalis, Rafael Mendez, and certainly not Sergei Nakariakov. Her technique is brilliant, her tone is full; yet, she is lacking the effortless musicality that is inherent in these masters of the trumpet. I am in no way saying that I play better than her but what T.A. said \\"I think he can play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\" shows how shallow and bitter she is to other critcism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing....","review":"I would not recommend this CD, period. I found it to be very disappointing. The level of performance is well below what I expected, especially considering the high price for this recording. There are far too many great trumpet recordings available for you to buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, See the Restored Metropolis Instead","review":"I can't think of any reason, other than specialized scholarship, why anyone would ever watch the unrestored version of Metropolis, ever. The restored version (with the original soundtrack) is superior in every way to the butchered cut that circulated for decades after the film was originally released.And you do want to see Metropolis and Things to Come. They are both brilliant works of great artistic and historical value.Even if you are dirt poor, borrow superior copies from your local library rather than buy this disk. The only person I can think of who ought to buy this disk is an elementary or high school history teacher who wants to have a copy of Things to Come on hand, so students can better understand what people feared and hoped for in the years leading up to the Second World War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put it stinks","review":"I have red this book and to put it simply it stunk. with out going into any detale, it was already said. I have been a outlanders fan from the begining, and a deathlands fan since the 3rd book. I no longer read Deathlands because of shody authors, and this will be my last book in the outlander series that is not written by Mark Ellis. Simply said if Mark Ellis didn't write it don't read it.

We took a container to her allergy doctor and she okayed them for us. Tonight we tried them and lo and behold, she loved them. She ate the whole bowl, a first in her recent history. It's a pity that Gerber makes most of her products with carrots and sweet potatoes. We would have a greater choice if they didn't. However, we are willing to try more new foods in the near future. By the way, we microwaved the bowl but it did not become too runny like other reviewers said. It was the perfect texture and softness. I would even say it tasted better than Kraft's version. We all are very satisfied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite meal!","review":"My 3 yr old son LOVES these. He asks for them all the time and they are very easy especially in a pinch (30 seconds!). I take them with us when we travel incase he decides he is on a hunger strike (he never refuses these) or when we will be out and about and can't get to a restaurant. I just zap it before we go and pack it up. It can't be put in the frige and reheated even though the package says so. It turns to liquid. I don't think it tastes like much, but he sure does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value but","review":"I purchased this tripod because I wanted something lightweight for travel that would work with my Canon Rebel Digital SLR, and my Canon G2. It seems to have many of the features I was looking for at a price I was wanting to pay. I had a great deal of trouble opening the quick release lever for the first time. I had to losen the screw, and spray a bit of WD40 on the lever's spring. In the process I made a few scratches on the plate. Once I was able to open the lever, everything seemed to work smoothly.One feature I would have liked to see on it is a level."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"It feels a little \\"wiggly\\" at first but I trust it now.

Those who have suffered through the seediest hotel accomodations of Southeast Asia will admire Tim's descriptive vocabulary and tact. Never forgetting his special comrades, Dana Stone and Sean Flynn, Tim Page lays out some detail of his investigations in Cambodia which did not fit into his outstanding documentary film on the incident \\"Danger On the Edge of Town\\". While the American government talked about \\"highest national priority\\" from Washington DC, Tim was in the field in Cambodia and Vietnam taking concrete action. Page's work on the memorial for correspondents lost in Indochina and his book \\"Requiem\\" are outstanding contributions to be added to this book and the earlier \\"Page After Page\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much words without use","review":"I got extremely tired of this book after just a few pages. Why are 15 sentences needed to describe how to turn on the tap water? Why use 500 words to say that someone was poor. Also, I got extremely tired of the description of how the fantastic he was to for a short time have to live almost like poor people. The contempt for the people living together with their chickens and cows were palpable.In the end I only had to read a few sentences for every page, the rest was just overuse of ink. The chronology was in shambles, no real structure used when trying to describe historical events. And just the idea to meat the vietnamese General Giap, one of the greatest characters, while stoned got me really pissed off.Think of this book as a \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\", but less well written, placed in Vietnam on how the author and his buddies got stoned all the time and had vietnamese running around buying opium from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"The original extended version of 'Fascination' is truly awesome, and the entries from Thomas Dolby, Talking Heads, Spandau, Ultravox and Culture Club are more than worthy. The Duran Duran mix, while good, has been available on disc for many years in many places. Billy Idol's 'Flesh For Fantasy' is even more widely accessible. The 1993 mix of a great Heaven 17 song is simply awful. Blondie's 'Atomic' from 1994 raises the question-- why didn't the people behind this disc put in a little more effort? The remix edit of the wonderful Simple Minds track 'Waterfront' is nothing short of an insult. The 2001 version of 'Kids In America' has been included as an exhibit of the failure of imagination that plagues today's remixers (it couldn't be there for reasons of quality because it has none). Why not dig deeper and get out some of the good stuff released AT THE TIME? It wouldn't have been too much of a chore, and it would've lived up to the title of the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon messed up","review":"Amazon describes this movie with the words: \\"A wild weekend is in store for three high school seniors who visit a local college campus as prospective freshmen.\\"This movie isn't about that at all!

If you're fond of the music of Caesar Franck, Max Bruch or Coleridge-Taylor, you'll find Dyson's symphony an understated treasure. Victorian era symphonic music reflects, especially among British composers, a long choral tradition stretching back to the oratorios of Handel. The Symphonies of Sir Arthur Sullivan, William Wallace, Charles V. Stanford, and Edward German have that rich \\"Cathedral organ\\" sound. Dyson follows the same tradition with a less \\"heavy-handed\\" approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, Adorable, and utterly useless","review":"I bought two of these with the idea that redundency in emergency supplies was prudent. I have flash lights and a battery lantern so these two little items seemed a cheap back up if the batteries fail. They do not put off enough light to read braille by!

After I wrote a poor review they contacted me to make it right and sent me another cable, but the second cable was just as cheap as the first!

Why is the main character who uses cell phones and high tech computers for information developing film in a dark room - especially when photos for clues are needed fast? How can the bookstore owner possibly be making enough money to support this store in such an obviously expensive location? Most importantly, the clues and mystery plot don't hang together.Actually, the acting is fair, but Clarence Williams is just bizarre in it. What is that staring thing he does? Really the material is so absurd it's a wonder they could find any minor stars to act in this drivel. The plot might have made sense in the 1950s, but having it set in today, is weird.Skip it and watch a Miss Marple. Or if you are looking for contemporary - try Rosemary and Thyme or even any episode of Murder She Wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable mystery","review":"I enjoyed the setting and the acting in this mystery. I'd like to know, though, why the man who is the bookstore owner's assistant works in a bookstore when he is so highly qualified that he can call up the Canadian PM for information.

This disc collects his big hits for Columbia Records, including his biggest hit, \\"Charlie's Shoes,\\" from 1961 and followups such as \\"Cross The Brazos At Waco,\\" which was a western-themed tune, ala Marty Robbins. Walker was a poppy crooner very much in the Marty Robbins style; fans of rough-edged honkytonk will only find a few tunes here to get their toes a-tapping, although countrypolitan aficianados and Walker's oldtime fans will be cheered to see this classic material back in print again.

The advice rings bells for anyone going through changes. Anyone alive in the society of modern transience will find useful suggestions in thoughts like: Do not immediately go into the room of someone who has just moved away. Do not expect a returnee to behave like a resident. Appropriate activities for stress given by the authors include lists for the left- and right-brained, and how to discover your category. Left brainers, for example, should take a watch apart.

With minimal night-time driving and no daytime running lights feature to my vehicle, those headlight bulbs have gone out on me by December 2008 (total of less than 12 months of life-expectancy). In my opinion not very worth it considering its price, even though they are brighter than regular 9006 headlight bulbs.

Many people say they don't last more than a year, but they have a one year warranty on the for a reason. Otherwise, it is stated in the back as well. It takes less than 5 minutes to change these bulbs and that includes washing my hands afterwards. Even if there wasn't a year warranty on these, I would still buy them becuase they do make a huge difference compared to the long lasting headlights. I would rather be able to see further down the road and spend a little more than cheapskate out $20 for some cheaper bulbs. Can't put a price on visibility while driving. I put up a picture of the difference the lightbulb makes in real life. I'd say it is a lot brighter but not so much wider than before. Maybe around 40-50 % brighter and 10% wider visibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really likes","review":"Got these for the spouse's truck. He's very happy with them.

There is a reason that drivers are only supposed to use their high-beam lights where it is very dark and there are no oncoming drivers: super-bright headlights are a DRIVING HAZARD! They blind oncoming drivers temporarily. In city environments, where streets are well lit and one is not likely to hit a deer, there is really no cause to use super-bright headlights. But if you really can't see without super-bright headlights, why not just use the high beams your car came with and dim them when someone else is on the road?

They usually get dimmer and encourage replacement before they fry. These Silverstar Ultra bulbs both burned out at one year and a few days.

The brightness I am used to with SS Ultra is just not in comparison to that of SS HP and it gave me a serious-headache driving and had to switch to high-beam frequently. I decided to get SS Ultra even though its lifetime is less because the brightness just doesn't drive you crazy.

How can this be a fair comparison? I thought U.S. laws were supposed to protect consumers from this type of deception.I have to 2005 Corolla CEs. When comparing these bulbs to the standard, I would say they about 20% brighter, 10-15% more reach, and 15% wider. Definitely not what they claim.

The first didn't even last a month(!), the second lasted less than three months.

The power connector (at the base of the player) got stuck with the player because of over heating (I had connected it for exactly about half an hour to charge it). I could not detach the cable from the player. When I finally did - the whole circuitry ripped off from the player and I could not power it anymore. I had the 90-day warranty that comes with the player. When contacted the customer service - they were rude to the core and said I had inflicted physical damage and they are going to charge me - $ 130 ( I bought it for $160) to repair it.I vow I will never ever buy anything from Creative because of the cheap parts and the rude customer service with lying warranties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative to overpriced I-Pod","review":"Not intending to say anything negative about the I-Pod, because most people I know have them, but the price tagged turned me away from what is definitely the trendy brand for MP3 players.I am incredibly pleased by the Zen Sleek Photo. I import my cd's at 192 kbps and have only used half the space, but if you need more space there are probably better players out there. I'm really happy with the OS and nothing has given me any problems so far.I picked this over the M Vision and other video players, mostly because it looked like their battery lives were suspect and it seems like there isn't much video content available for Creative players yet, not compared to the I-Pod.Overall, the Zen Sleek Photo was well worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had a bad experience with this product..","review":"I ordered it through Electronica Direct. (big mistake)I recieved it, and had a glance at the directions, hooked it up to start charging (it says to charge for 2 hours and then start using). After a couple hours I hold the power button so it will turn on and, nothing. It never turned on, it never did anything. I charged for two more hours, still nothing. This was a huge waste of time. I'm waiting to see if they refund original shipping, and then I will add a positive note about Electronica Direct. I can handle paying to ship the item back at my own expense, but it's hard to swallow that they would send me a broken device and make me pay for all of the shipping.Also this thing is pretty heavy and big. It also says in the instructions that you shouldn't work out or jog with it, because this product can't handle the shocks it will cause. pretty lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Zen Sleek Photo 20GB","review":"It's a pretty good product, and the price was much better than other mp3 players I've seen. Slightly tempermental, but still a good buy and a good product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing value","review":"Sure, you can spend 500$ and get an ipod with a million gigabytes of storage that plays movies and does the dishes for you, but why the hell would you do that? This is a simple, no nonsense MP3 player, with the standard interface and options. It can also view photos, apparently, but why would anyone bother to do that? I wanted something that plays mp3s with enough space to hold all my music, and this fits the bill. Maybe 20gigs isn't enough for you if you're the kind of turd who downloads 50 different live versions of every song a band has ever played, but who cares what you think if you're like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Alternative to the I-Pod","review":"If you don't want to bow down to the restrictions of I-Tunes, then this is the MP3 player for you. Creative includes a small program that easily allows you to add new songs to your Zen or modify playlists. You can even synchronize with Windows Media Player. My only complaints are that you can't swap battery packs like the Zen Micro Photo and that the battery life is less than advertised. The Zen Sleek Photo advertises 19 hours of battery life while i've only observed around 10 hours. Final Verdict = This is an excellent product that i would recommend to anyone. -SDG"},{"rating":"2","title":"for a 20GB player this is the best...","review":"For the money this is one great MP3 player, you get a lot of features i.e. FM Tuner, Photos, ability to change the themes for your color screen (which makes this a better value and not to mention just as attractive or more so than ipod). I found a silicone skin on the street here in NYC and so mine is staying in pretty good shape. I did drop it on the cement/sand street in West Africa (turned out ok, never had any damage other than a few scratches) and OH I forgot, the charger is dual voltage which is sweet if you travel all you need is the adapter. I have only had this freeze a handful of times on me but I just pushed the reset button on the bottom and it took a few minutes to re-build the library.

They made a wise move. The day-to-day usage of this mp3 player is fine, it's easy to find songs, and pretty easy to play them. However, sorting the music you put on it is impssible.

I admit that the characters are nothing like \\"typical\\" romance novel characters, but that's what makes the novel. A duke of that time is not going to stand for anything less than total servitude from a lesser, much less a mistress. Both main characters are flawed, and both characters develop. I think that the characters act in a way that is true to their time period, which is more than can be said of most historical romances.I wouldn't approach the book if you're looking for a typical \\"hero/heroine\\" set up. You will not find it here. Domenico broods and is cruel. Felicia spends most of the book trying to figure herself out and keep track of the political intrigue. The book isn't really romantic, but the characters and their relationships both seem very real to the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book is intense and leaves the reader gripped to the book.I read this book when it first came out, and still read it veryoften.

The heroine went from a believable character to, within a page or two, a wooden predictable, forgettable bore. I found myself thinking this book is so tedious. I hated the first person account. I did not know the hero at all except by her perception. He was horrible through a good bit of the book. It all seemed convoluted. Nothing compared to the angst, etc... of Stormfire. Now I am not a huge fan of Stormfire, but it has this one beat hands down. I only read this book b/c of the recommendations on the romance blogs. This was veeeerrrry disappointing. Do not waste any money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed.","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I paid quite a bit of money to be able to read this book, and I wish I hadn't. I was expecting a machaivalian hero, but Domineco was just plain evil with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. He was a rapist, a brutal murderer and a spoiled, cold brat.The book was told in first person from the heroine's perspective and because of that all we could do was be victimized by the \\"hero\\" and muddle about in the dark looking for the \\"romance\\" in this romance novel. It was a gruesome book that made my skin crawl. Only the last five pages were what you would expect from a romance novel.I can take a difficult read, I don't need flowers and hearts to be satisfied by a romance novel, but this book was just not good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I can't even finish this book. It's like reading a history book about the typical and mundane happenings in a medieval court.The romance scenes aren't very descriptive. The characters don't have much personality. The Duke is a spoiled prick, described as some kind of glittery haired bisexual fairy prince who gets everything he wants and who everyone desires. His self-assured attitude is more repulsive than charming.I had higher hopes for Felicia, I mean she was basically drugged at his whim and brought to his court to be a sex slave, and it seems like she was resigned to let things happen to her with that lukewarm fighting spirit.Perhaps if I chose to read more it would have gotten better, but the slow-paced development was irritating and the writing didn't hook me in. This book was recommended to me after reading Stormfire by Christine Monson, which I loved. I was hoping for something dark, passionate, and emotionally gripping like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont read this book","review":"I have never hated a book so bad as i hate this book.Everything about this book is bad SO DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT READ IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark Romance","review":"This book is intense. I read it years ago and at least once a year I have to re-read it. An amazing work of fiction. It grabs your attention and creates characters so real you think about them days, weeks, months, later. I wish it was easier to find a copy of this out-of-print title so more could enjoy the mesmirizing romance created by this gifted author. Set in Rennaisance Italy in the 1600's, it is the story of a Duke and his mistress. The dialogue is quick and subtle. The plot is moved along quickly with action and intrigue. It is on my list of the top ten books I have had the privelege to read, and I have read many. I think the book was a bit ahead of its time when first printed in 1978. Now it would not so much shock people as intrigue them."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent guide","review":"Susan has created a beautifully presented and organized guide to ethical wills.

And that was before I even opened the book! The pages aren't numbered but it appears to have about 25 pages in it. Taking the price into consideration that comes to almost $1 a page. Additionally, inside there are many blank areas to write your ideas on so ultimately I was spending $19.95 for a note pad. Too bad. Everyone else seemed to love the ideas the author presented.

Unfortunately, as seems to have been the case for others before me, my enjoyment was short lived.One night as I was getting ready for bed I took it off and put it on my dresser. About 10 minutes later, I heard a loud pop that sounded like a light bulb burning out. I got out of bed and went over to see what had happened, and was shocked to see that a large round disc had spontaneously blown out of the center of the crystal. I contacted Skagen, and while they initially denied that there was a problem with a faulty design, they quickly agreed to exchange it for a different model.I only hope that the problem with the crystal is limited to this particular model, and not to all Skagen watches.I don't think that Amazon should be selling this particular watch, and plan to contact them about this directly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked crystal problem","review":"I'm sorry to have to report the same broken crystal.

I loved it, very slim and light, althought the dial was larger than I expected. Today I wore the watch to work, parked my car, got out and started to walk to work, and suddenly the whole middle of the crystal fell out. It left a perfect circle on whats left of the crystal, pretty cool. Luckily there was no kids around to step on the shards. Can you imagine if this happened around children and you didn't notice? And to top it all off, the crystal is not covered by the warrenty, the cost to replace it is $25 and $8.95 shipping and handling. $34 to fix a watch I just paid $87 for. Rip off!!!! Do not buy, dangerous product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The same excellent quality as other Skagen watches I've owned.","review":"This is the second Skagen watch I've owned.

Right when we received, the strap springbar was coming out of one of the holes because it had not been properly installed. It was a very difficult task to put it in correctly, since the whole watch was made out of titanium. A few months later a large, round part of the crystal simply broke away from the watch without any shock or impact to it. I had actually read bad reviews about the crystal problem before purchasing the watch, but ignored them, since it was such a good looking watch. Don't make the same mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"And so I thought that those chrystal problems wouldn't affect me... This watch was kept with silken gloves, and suddenly part of the chrystal just dropped on the floor. No hits, no pressure - simply defective product.

The watch has never been dropped or bumped, and was worn about a dozen times. The clerk refunded my money but did not believe that I hadn't bumped it. After reading these posts, I see that this is an extremely common occurrence! Don't buy Skagen!

Despite the glowing reports about how wonderful the motor was and how great the ice-cream turned out, the motor stalled after just 10 minutes. On the second batch, it also stalled after just 10 minutes. Both times I had to dump out both the mix and salt/ice mixture.

There are no buttons on this machine. You plug the motor into the outlet and it starts...when it stops or nearly stops your ice-cream in done. It's that simple. Can't expect anything more for $29.99 including free shipping. This machine is not \\"cheap quality\\" as some have stated and only overly delicate people find it \\"really loud\\". It's not any louder then an average clothes dryer in use. And for those complaining about the short power cord...buy a $3.00 extension at your hardware store.

Would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"god deal and good ice cream","review":"We looked at quite a few different makers and finally decided on this one. It does what it says! Generous size gives plenty of ice cream. It is a bit noisy but in the end, they all make noise. Easy to clean and use. Still trying to find a good place to store it (a 4 qt maker isn't small). I would also recommend Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream book as well as The Complete Idiots Guide to Homemade Ice Cream. Both have lots of good recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Cream Maker makes a fine bowl of goodness.","review":"The machine worked as advertised. We made perfect soft serve ice cream and it was 100F outside. It sure did the trick. Make sure you follow the recipe to the letter. Too much or not enough of an ingredient will prevent your ice cream from freezing. The machine will seem to run forever! But if you use the right stuff you will indeed enjoy one of the finer things in life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamilton Beach Automatic Ice Cream Maker","review":"This is a cool addition to my kitchen. I love ice cream and I had been wanting to get an ice cream maker for a while and after reading the reviews on this one, I decided to give it a try. The first night that I got it I made mint chocolate chip ice cream which was very good. I used the recipe that comes with it and I will try cookie dough next. It does make some noise, like others have said, but its not too loud or too long. Overall, a great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price, good product.","review":"This makes good ice cream, I was a novice, had never made ice cream, but wanted ice cream without all the \\"extra\\" shelf life ingredients or preservatives.

The instruction book seemed over complicated (but you really do need to read it) and I wasn't exactly impressed with the recipes. Only after adjusting the ratios a bit have I got it where I like it. Now I just go with 9 cups half and half, 3 cups sugar, some vanilla and a pinch of salt, tastes great. One final note is that every batch so far has been much closer to the 40 minute end of the 20-40 minute range the manual states."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmm....ice cream!!!","review":"i needed good, homemade, ice cream STAT! i live in kuwait and couldn't find an ice cream maker anywhere! buying pre-made ice cream here is hit or miss since it gets frozen/refrozen so many times it tastes horrible. i've never had an issue with hamilton beach products and you can't beat the price! yes, it's loud but that's the case with most ice cream makers; i just put a rolled up towel around the top like my grandma used to do and it cuts down on the noise. the instruction manual doubles as a recipe book and i have made the old fashioned vanilla ice cream (from a custard) and it was so yummy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dinky ice cream maker","review":"guess I got what I paid for. entire apparatus is pretty dinky, lightweight, thin. the 1 gal aluminum freezer can had a dimple in the top rim - never could figure if it was supposed to be bent like that or was simply damaged at the factory; I was afraid that salt would leak into the bent rim, but it didn't. The cheesy operator manual didn't say anything about it. It took 45 minutes to make ice cream with this rig, and that was barely frozen. spend a few more bucks and get a better quality ice cream maker with a better insulated ice bucket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"Not really wanting to spend much time here, but I purchased this machine a few weeks ago. I have used it three times so far and it has worked great. Clean up is easy, it's noisy, but not overly loud. I would recommend this to anyone. My drummer bought one a week ago for his girlfriend and they love it too.

I followed the instructions and the ice cream came out great. It did take longer than the instructions stated (about twice as long) but that may have been because of the high temperature.My father had a Hamilton Beach ice cream maker years ago and this is similar although it is much lighter in weight.

For me a whole gallon doesn't go fast enough to keep the icecream fresh.It works great and easy to clean. I believe it's the best 4 quart for the money and I researched them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product, piece of garbage","review":"Yes, the price is comparatively cheap -- but the low price is reflected in the low quality materials and workmanship in the product. After a number of uses, I found one day that it had completely stripped the chintzy aluminum fittings, rendering the machine worthless. But even worse, the metal filings from the stripped parts dropped down inside the canister around the stirring blade, completely ruining a full batch of ice cream! NOT HAPPY."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll give it a Thumbs Up!","review":"I will make this short and sweet (no pun intended). The ice cream maker was extremely easy to operate and the end result was awesome. The only negative remark I can make is that it is supposed to shut off by itself after 30 min or so and after 45 min it was still going strong. I finally stopped it myself by unplugging it and checked it to find that the ice cream was indeed done. I don't know why it didn't quit churning like it was supposed to... Bottom line is that for the price, I thought it did a great job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"puff","review":"The excitement is high. the machine arrived.

My only concern is that the motor is a little loud. At first I put the unit together without reading the directions and I found it was tricky to hook up the blade properly into the motor unit. Then after I read the directions, I found a tip which makes everything easier now. The canister is large enough to make more than a quart of ice cream. The mixing blade is more solid than other models that I have inspected at the store.

First batch of ice cream, I shut down the operation when the motor began to lug, as instructed in the manuel, and discovered a 1-inch rime of frozen ice cream with a totally liquid center. The paddle had not remained firm while the can turned--it had not 'churned' the mixture. Two things resulted: eventually the paddle froze to the sides of the tin and the motor slowed, and the pressure stripped the insert where the paddle fits into the motor. End of ice cream maker. I reblended the ice cream and rechurned it in the 30-year-old maker. Turned out great. Cost of returns being what they are, I'm going to get a good deal more satisfaction taking this dandy new HB Ice Cream Maker to the alley and beating it to death with my ice hammer.

I bought one due to childhood nostalgia. Luckily, I found out I can also make great ice cream with it. The recipies make great ice cream in about a hour.

Its perfect blend of drama, mystery, suspense, and comedy really beckons the viewer to laugh and be on the edge of your seat at the same time! It is the story of the Great Bernzini, a free-lance tabloid photographer who intentionally tries to get involved with every crime ring or criminal in the city to get the perfect photograph.

From a \\"New Yorker\\" writer, however, I'd expect more tightly-written, lively prose -- this book was poorly edited (I'd stumble over at least one disjointed, multi-comma'd phrase each page when reading aloud), and worse, condescending to readers of any age. Think plot summaries every few pages and constant check-ins in question form (\\"What would Oliver do now?\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnifique!","review":"As delicious as a fresh pain au chocolat and cafe au lait! I quite enjoyed Mr. Gopnik's first book, as well as his work in The New Yorker. I was sucked right in to this book and finished it in several big gulps. I can see where some reviewers weren't completely enchanted, as I sometimes had the sense that this story was written to help his son through some difficult concepts at school. But I didn't find this distracting and it fit the hero's character. His friend from America is a bit broadly drawn, but again that helps the contrast between France and America with the hero as a bridge between societies, just as he bridges worlds through windows and mirrors. I'm a bit beyond the age group recommended for this book and my sons are still too little, but I think the book would be good for the kind of kids who like Narnia, Harry Potter, and Edward Eager.Happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"riveting","review":"My daughter, age 11, devoured this book.

This was a really good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Kid's Fantasy","review":"\\"The King in the Window\\" is an excellent young adult fantasy novel. It describes France well, and gives a sprinkling of French words. It has a likeable protagonist, Oliver, who is not brave or clever but who must learn to be a king. The plot, involving history, literature, modern technology, glass, mirrors, window-wraiths, and Alice in Wonderland is quite original. The themes of finding strength and bravery are traditional but timeless. I did not find it to be particularly exciting--there was no sense of danger, and nothing bad happened. Still, it kept me turning the pages, eager to see what would happen next. The characters were also sometimes annoying. But overall, a good read. It would be best for a middle-school age audience, for which it would have the most novelty. It is long for readers younger than that. A fantasy-loving adult could enjoy \\"The King in the Window\\" as a diversion, but it would not have much impact on them as a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book","review":"I did not enjoy The King in the Window. I wanted to because I went to Paris once and liked it and because I do like fantasy books, but the truth is, I could barely finish the book. The writer should have spent more time making his characters more believable and less time showing off all his knowledge. No character was believable at all! I know this was supposed to be a fantasy book, but nothing at all felt real to me. This isn't really a book for kids. It's more like what an adult THINKS a book for kids should be![...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Illustrations, Comprehensive book","review":"This is a fine book, giving detailed, colourful charts, pictures and diagrams to supplement the information given. This book covers every aspect of the game, its history, and playing in singles, doubles, or mixed, and how to apply strategy and shots to each one. This is more of a book for those new to badminton. The more seasoned players will find this book a little boring, which is why I give this only 4 stars. Otherwise, it's much better than other Badminton books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batter up!","review":"I used this sports ball pan set to make a baseball birthday cake for my nephew.

Also, it does take longer to cook than 2 round pans would. I used a yellow cake mix and reduced the oil as directed on the pan instructions and the cake turned out fine and stayed together.

The directions say 325 degrees, 30-40 min, depending on your recipe. My recipe called for exactly that. So I set the timer for 35 minutes. Over an hour later, the inside of the cake is not done, but the outer part of the cake is overdone. I'm still in the process of baking and am so frustrated, I had to write a review right now. Perhaps after it cooks and is decorated, I'll feel better, but be prepared for the frustration of baking your cake to doneness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I was dissapointed when I recieved this Wilton Sports Ball Pan.

I doubt it'll change how the pan performs though.I haven't found a need to use both halves, but the pan has been useful in shaping cakes made to look like a turtle, a large igloo, Tiffany lamp shade, and UFO cake.Just like the mini ball pan, you have to generously grease this otherwise sticking will be a huge problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"wilton sports ball set","review":"this is a great addition to my pan collection I am going to use it to make a pregnant belly cake for a baby shower it is going to be fun"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"I'm sure this product would be great if you are doing golf balls or something but the size of this pan is way to small for a normal sports ball.

More Toontown and Frontierland scenery2. More lands to build your rides on3. Bigger spaces to build your ridesand 4. Some way to build a pond so you wouldn't have to put boats on dry land.What I DO like about it is:1. You can ride your ride or other rides2. Great sound effects3. Great graphics4. It's addictive!!I also liked the \\"Flying\\" coaster, which makes it look like you are soaring through the air without any supports.

I have been very careful with it, and even have the stainless steel protective grid on the bottom, so I don't understand why this is happening. Since it is an undermount sink, I feel that I am stuck with it forever because my new granite countertop was installed using the Elkay sink's template. I am really worried about what the sink will be like at the end of a few years.This should never be happening with any sink, let alone such an expensive one. I bought it to replace a stainless steel sink that was at least 35 years old, and that one was in great shape (no rust stains ever) and I never even used a protective grid of any kind with the old one. I will never buy anything made by Elkay again, and hope to spare others from having the same problems.Disgusted....."},{"rating":"2","title":"lightning fast delivery","review":"I confess that it's difficult to rate a sink.

However three out of the four soloists are a bit light in vocal weight for my taste. That is why I don't give it five stars. Jennifer Larmore is the exception, because she has a Mozart voice. The alto soloist is really a soprano in terms of what Mozart asks her to do. This piece is some of Mozart's best work, and it gets good recognition from Herreweghe. Herreweghe is such a great conductor. Listen to the bowing in the strings and the diction from the chorus. He also gets a variety of vocal colors out of the chorus. Only the great choral conductors can inspire the chorus to make such haunting sounds. In my opinion Herreweghe is even better with early music such as Bach, Josquin, Monteverdi and Lully to name a few. This is still a great performance because it represents what people heard during Mozart's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weight Belt","review":"Great product, been looking for awhile for a belt and defanitly best bang for your buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waay Too Easy","review":"I was a little disappointed.

The reason is simple. Computer science deals mostly with discrete items. Whereas most of physics uses continuum methods. But Hartmann points out in his book that there are indeed several classes of algorithms from computing that might be of utility to some physicists.Percolation problems for example, are covered in a chapter. He shows how well known ideas from graph theory, like shortest path algorithms, can carry over usefully to attack thresholding in percolation clusters.One chapter, on Monte Carlo methods, should already be familiar to some physicists. Ideas like simulated annealing came from physics. Plus, the Metropolis-Monte Carlo method was thought up by the well known Los Alamos physicist Nick Metropolis.Hartmann does a commendable job in educating physicists about such ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia C.

Wrede books but this one was very boring and lacked a good story line dont get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unimpressive effort","review":"I was not at all impressed by this book-- its overly complex plot and dull cardboard characters are hardly improved by the author's heavy reliance on the Regency romances of Georgette Heyer, from which Wrede appears to have borrowed both characters and language (I found one sentence that appears to have been lifted virtually without change from Heyer's \\"Cotillion.\\") The book reads as if it were assembled from a kit. I would not recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another absolutely smashing book from Wrede.","review":"From the first page to the last I was wrapped up in this marvelous and hilarious adventure involving a street thief who gets caught up with a common magician who isn't quite who he seems. Kim (the street thief) armed with some wonderfully awful slang (oy, that's thieves cant) her sharp wit and wisdom of the streets stumbles into Mairelon and the complex plot involving stolen magical items, a band of rich young fops playing at being druids, a social-climber, shots in the dark and a healthy dose of the farcical. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested (or not) in fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"madcap adventure","review":"It was no Enchanted Forest Chronicles, but it was a fun story, nonetheless. 17-year-old Kim, a girl disguised as a boy, is a thief in Regency England, until she gets caught burgling an actual magician's wagon. But instead of being arrested or turned into a frog, Mairelon the Magician invites her to become his apprentice.What follows is a madcap adventure, reminiscent of, say, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, with several different parties, each with their own motivation, racing to be the first to collect the Saltash Platter and put together an entire set of magical artifacts. It's heavily flavored with 1800s English street cant, but it's easy enough to figure out once you've been reading for a while.I've put the sequel on my list. Maybe I'll be able to talk my youngest into trying these, now that he's suddenly rediscovered reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I received this as a birthday gift.

Of course, if you want a more profound, detailed, technical if you will, discussion you can read one of the several books by the same author on this or related subject.Or, other authors on this same matter. I enjoyed very much the previous to the last part: The Phenomenon of Coherence where Dr. Laszlo discusses the Coherence in Consciousness with such a simple approach that it made the complex subject a very understandable one. He also refers his discussion to several well known resources on the subject. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to introduce him/herself into the realm of universal consciousness phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a collection of experiences from different people.

This first third of the book establishes some of sciences greatest puzzles. This was an OK summary. The rest of the book deals in vagary. The author introduces the idea of the zero point field as the answer to everything. He talks of the idea of an evolving universe without any substantive link to the zero point field. He purports that the thought energy in our brain disturbs the zero point field and that this distubance can be decoded by others (eg. telepathy). None of this is proved in anyway nor backed up with any thing other than conjecture. The author wallows in half explained ideas and jargon. This was an awful read and I definately do not recommend it. The zero point field may indeed explain alot of the unexplained in physics, but you definately won't gain an understanding of that from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate answer to the eternal questions","review":"Through an artfully constructed blend of science and common sense, Ervin Laszlo has given us a convincing reason to believe in the existence of what he calls the Akashic Field, or A-Field.

I bought this DVD because it had 5 segments that can be strung together. I've completed the first 2 segments and I'm watching the third. I LOVE IT! Segment 2 was challenging and faster paced. I was sweating and had to take a few breaks. Segment 3 has some more of my favorite moves, along with some new challenging ones. Great way to amp up your yoga!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Rodney's Best","review":"I was pretty excited when I purchased this DVD, and too think that I have 5 workouts in one.

If you are looking to simply relax and lightly stretch your body then get it, but if you are looking for something more challenging even if it only means getting a good stretch, then this is NOT the right DVD for you. Don't waste your money. If I were in my seventies I would probably like it, but I have ways to go to reach that age; therefore, I gave it to my mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case broke the CD","review":"The first time I used the CD, it was difficult to remove the disk from the case. Somehow I managed without cracking the disk. The yoga workout was great and I eagerly looked forward to working out with Rodney again. On my second try, I wasn't so lucky. The disk cracked and no longer plays in my CD player or computer. So while the content might be stellar, your use of it may be short-lived due to the overly tight center button that holds the disk in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for beginner","review":"I Love Rodney but this DVD is too easy.

This book focuses on the business aspect of 18 men who made their living trapping. This book glosses over any of the adventure, craft and technique and goes into specifics of the business transactions between the leaders and teams of the expeditions and the financieers. Kit Carson, Jim Bridger, Manuel Lisa, and other well known names are examined in these sketches of the mountain man's struggles for the elusive profits of the trapping business. I think if you're looking for an adventure book, pass this one by, but if you are a business major looking for some historical perspectives on the trapping and exploration ventures of the early and mid 1800s, then you might like this sometimes dry but factual account of the Mountain Men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Business majors - read","review":"I really wanted to read a book about the adventures of these men, not a historical account of their business accounts; building locations, business partners, legal aspects, holdings, etc. I'm not sure who would read this book, since it's very chopped up due to the autor's attempt to be precise in his accounts of the fur busineess. Reads like a chemistry book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll laugh so hard you'll pee your pants!!!","review":"I watched this movie on beta max when it first came out and recently saw it again.

The whole movie is a laugh out loud riot. They don't make them like this anymore. Full of great comedic actors from 1979. Rare appearances from Ruth Gordon, Vincent Price, and many others add to the fun. Cloris Leachman has her funniest role since Young Frankenstein. Like the other reviews, I too am suprised this classic comedy has never been released on DVD. This has caused the few VHS copies left to become quite expensive, and that's if you can even find it avaliable on VHS. It can only be purchased used right now. I highly recommend the movie, but you'll need some luck finding a copy of it anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!!!!!","review":"I saw this movie, when it first came out with my mum, and thought that I would die laughing. Since then, there have been many comedies made, but none really have topped this one so far. It has become not only a family (the entire family I may add) but a huge private joke with some of the one liners that have slipped in this movie. Guaranteed to make you laugh so hard you cannot breathe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold Your nose, folks","review":"PEE-YOOOO! This fim is NOT funny AT ALL (well, maybe the scene with Richard Mulligan disguised as a mummy will make you chuckle a little). These are some of the most unappealing, unlikeable characters under the sun (Richard Masur's charachter in particular is not to be watched before eating). About the only thing remotely appealing about this movie is the theme song by the late great Scat Man Crothers over the end titles. Other than than that, this malodorous bomb will stink up your VCR!

Excellent family film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistakes","review":"Similar to the 4th edition, the Coverage of the theoretical background of topics is good. However,mistakes in example problems make it hard to follow, especially for undergraduate students. Also, section properties used in some problem solutions are not all updated to the 13th Edition of AISC manual. The book needs to be reviewed thoroughly with additional numerical examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many errors","review":"Like another reviewer said, this book has a lot of errors. I have been using the 4th edition paperback in class for about 2 months now and my class has found more than a few errors. It seems like everytime the professor assigns some problems out of the book, he has to change one or more because they are wrong. Very frustrating. Additionally, the problems in this book are designed for the old A36 steel. Otherwise, this book seems to cover a lot of material and is pretty easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best General Steel Structural Design Book Available","review":"Given the available books on the market for general steel structural design in the U.S., this is by far the best. The breadth of topics covered is abundant without any sacrifice in depth of full backround and commentary, which is sorely missing from other books of this kind. The layout and presentation of information is very clear and readable.Although a new edition covering changes in the industry since the last publication would be greatly appreciated, the book taken for when it was published is still very applicable for use now (despite reviews to the contrary given below).

Obviosly the new edition is LRFD and not ASD but I am extremely disappointed in the number of errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"Never in my life have I read a novel issued by a major publisher that was so amatuerishly written. While Mr. Crabbe may be accurate in his historical details, he is apparently incapable of writing a sentence that avoids cliche, redundancy or a gut-busting violation of elementary rules of grammar. Here's one early example that sent me running to the hills:\\"Sitting motionless in the cold March moonlight, three gulls sat perched on a cable of the bridge.\\"In one sentence Mr. Crabbe manges to inform us not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES that the gulls are, indeed, sitting.Trust me, it's all downhill from there. My only solace in this unfortunate purchase is that I was able to return it for a full refund. I bear Mr. Crabbe no ill will for the time I wasted reading the first chapters. But to his editors at St. Martin's Press, I say this: shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crabbe is no Carr","review":"I chose to read this book because it was favorably compared to Caleb Carr's 'The Alienist', a book which I loved. I would like to prevent any other readers from making the same mistake.Crabbe sure knows a lot of information about the Brooklyn Bridge, but his delivery needed some more editing and polish. I found his attempt to write accents, and what he must suppose was southern use of language, was laughable. It was also frustrating to read several pages of irrelevant story, for no better reasons than to impart more statistics and facts about the bridge itself.Please do not read this book because of the comparisons to Caleb Carr. Read this book because you think the plot sounds interesting, or you like the cover art or anything other than the comparisons to 'The Alienist.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page Turner","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Crabbe's debut novel, Suspension. The novel succeeds on every level - the plot, characterization, imagery,and historical detail are all intelligently executed in a book that is hard to put down. The action sequences are literally pulse pounding. Even weeks after completing the novel I find myself thinking about the book, its characters, the bridge and the historical time period; Mr. Crabbe will literally take you back in time and out of yourself on a wonderful story-telling journey. I wholeheartedly recommend Suspension and have already made the decision to purchase the author's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting History with a Twist","review":"I cannot even express to everyone how much I enjoyed this book. The author mixes up an exciting adventure story with actual facts about the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. The story alone has you so captivated and at the same time it gives you a great idea of how NYC was back in the late 1800's. I can't wait for him to write another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid First Novel","review":"Crabbe's first novel is a very nice piece of historical fiction. It can be compared favorably to Caleb Carr's Alienist and The Angel of Darkness.

One can tell that this was a labor of love for Crabbe."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting plot, but not well written","review":"Sorry, I thought this was a very interesting topic, but poor writing in need of editing doesn't excuse the hurdle of making good historical fiction.

The book provides a fascinating, human look at the diverse people who populated the emerging City at the time.Richard Crabbe is deft with history, social perspective, emotional exchange, human frailty, terroristic motive, engineering and intrigue.

I could never make my stuffed cherry tomatoes stay in place and they are so hard to cut straight at the bottom. I got the great idea to cut a hole in the center of a \\"coin shaped\\" piece of cucumber and place the tomato in the hole. It stays upright! The book it more a work of art than anything else.

Due to where the camera sits there is not enough room for the user to adjust the width or the binoculars. Either you will end up looking through the right scope or the left but never through both.

Having the name Meade attached is a draw, but I expect this is one more item in their new line of made-in-China products (the telescope is ok, but scrap the tripod!). Maybe ok for a toy for your 10-year-old, but if it costs more than [$$$], you're better off with a JamCam."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip","review":"My kid got this for me last week.It's a toy.When my wife told me how much it cost I flipped.I told my kid I loved it ,didn't want to make her feel bad.Good company,this one stinks"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Meade Capture View just doesn't work","review":"I bought the capture view very recently. I can't get my computer to recognize the camera. I have an extremely high speed/high end new Dell computer. I use my Dell all the time to download and edit photos from my digital cameras with no problems at all. I'm also pretty computer literate. The Meade Capture View would not work out of the box. I went online, but no info there helped my situation. I attempted multiple fixes, including driver updates, reinstallations, and every combination you can imagine. I have called Meade over and over, but get no answer! The Capture View requires more effort than its worth. I imagine I purchased an inoperative camera or have a bad cable. However, I can't solve the issue because I can't get through to Meade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meade capture view scopecam The worst","review":"This camera crashed my computer 4 times and the one time I did get it to work the pictures were blurred,unfocused and dark.

I would NOT recomend this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun as a toy, but not for serious photographs","review":"Considering that 8x22 binoculars cost $20-$30 you are paying $70 for a digital camera. That's about what you get. A good deal of light is required and the 640x480 is not enough resolution for serious pictures.

Without this bottom support, the stomach straps will create a lot of pressure on the dog's stomach should you and your dog want to do a tug-a-war for deciding who's the boss in deciding which direction to go.

I'll be trying to get a replacement from Amazon. PQI, Sandisk, Leaxar or Kingston cards are apparently recommended by Minox.Also, uploading 33 images to my computer completely exhausted the 4 AA batteries, and I didn't receive a plug-in-the-wall adapter from Amazon.

For years this book has had a cult following among music fans who love to ridicule the type of anti-music preaching that fills this tome. The horrendous spelling and punctuation makes the book look like a semiliterate Internet post, and the factual misstatements don't exactly help matters.

With songs like \\"After All That Happened\\" and \\"Sing a Little, Oh Birds\\" you can see the pain experienced in the region. As always, Khalife handles such painful matters in a delicate manner and elevates all those around him. His settings of the poetry of Mahmoud Darwish and others is masterful.

This is a beautifully printed book with lots in it for anyone who loves watercolors. You can develop your own technique by studying the masters; this is a time-honored tradition (you can still see people today in the Louvre, copying the works of the masters as an art exercise.)This is one of my favorite watercolor books. It's enjoyable just to read and look at the way the author tries to replicate an artist's method of painting, and the examples give you ideas of subjects you can try yourself (for example, a cherry tree by a barn, your kids at the beach, your garden.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bag for a quick trip","review":"Nothing fancy, but it's a good size for a weekend trip.

Going into just enough detail as not to lose the reader in innumerable facts, the book gives accurate acocounts of his life and killings,with pop culture reference to spice things up.

I personally only read true crime books because for myself I try to understand how people become killers, its my finding that 98% of serial killers, mass murderers etc are the way they are because of over possessive mothers and weak fathers, if they even had a father at all.

And it does so from widely varying points of view: that of a shattered and vanquished nation, of a prosperous occupying force working towards putting the pieces back together, and of a generation whose lives are still deeply affected by the history of their parents.

The story of hardship, and perserverence to making a better life is well told by the author, and it is not lost on the reader that it is coming from personal knowledge and experience rather than just the imagination.

Although some would argue that the vocals detract from the instrumentals, which would appear to be a rather persistent argument amongst listeners of jazz; however, I suspect that Mr. Albright and his producers have in this project found the balance between the two such that the entire collection is appealing and worthy of anyone's smooth jazz collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Better & Better","review":"I have already reviewed a couple of Gerald's previous projects with the overriding sentiment being that Gerald fares much better as a premiere session man rather than the centerpiece. Yet since I made that observation about 3 years ago, his solo projects have been consistently solid. Before, I could not imagine sitting through an entire Gerald Albright set simply because he tended to pale in comparison to the David Koz's, George Howards, Dee Browns, or even Kim Waters for that matter.But lately, Gerald has produced some quality projects, showcasing inventine sax work in some sparkling arrangements. This project is no exception and is actually the best work he has submitted in a while.Gerald shines with his spot-on choral sax arrangements and his band is top-notch. If you are a smooth jazz sax man/woman, this project will not disappoint.Nice, inventive work!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems great, as good as any I've used","review":"I am using this in a 10mp Pentax camera and it is working perfectly.

There is plenty of room to work inside. I am not impressed with the mounting system for the hard drives however. They mount on rubber gromments on slide in trays. In practice this is a noisy mounting method since the trays are not well secured and vibrate. Otherwise this is a very quiet case. The USB and firewiere cables have exactly the same connector on the end and are not labelled as to which is which. Plugging them into the wrong connector on the motherboard can cause damage. The power on LED cable is a 2 pin connector and my motherboard requires a 3 pin connector. The temperature display is worthless since there is no way to mount the sensors anywhere that would be useful.

But before my interest in the story could deepen, the next scene would shift to a different character's point of view. Also, it was hard to keep track of who was who.

But I get them home to my quiet house and lo and behold the subwoofer constantly hums. I'm not an audiophile and therefore not overly particular about sound... other than this annoying hum from the subwoofer. Since these are set up in my home office where I spend a lot of time reading, I find this humming far too distracting. Although the price is good, I'd prefer to pay a little more just to omit the subwoofer's constant hum.I'm returning these speakers today and will shop around for another set."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - SUBWOOFER HUM","review":"I have a MSEE (Master's in Electrical Eng) - this sound system is flawed from the ground up - there is a substantial 60 Hz hum that will not go away no matter what volume level or wiring configuration you use.

You will be amazed."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Mid range response at all","review":"I'm no audiophile, but I expected more from Altec Lansing. My biggest compaint is that there is no midrange. None. I'm really not that picky, but it's just not there at all. There's the loud sub that does tend towards boomy and there's the tinny sats. Piano, guitar, vocals; anything that require midrange response is left out. No amout of tweaking with the bass and treble will fix this mix.If you intend to listen to music at all through these speakers then I'd say look elsewhere. You can do better for less money that this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intolerable humming from sub","review":"First off, let me say that I NEVER write reviews for anything I buy, but feel compelled to write one for this product to warn others. I've purchased Altec Lansing speakers before and have even recommended them to friends and never have I heard or had any problems. That is, until I bought these. DO NOT listen to the other reviewers who had nothing but great things to say about these speakers...they must be working for Altec Lansing or something. Many people here have reported a loud hum emitted by the sub and it is 100% true. The hum is always there and even gets worse if you accidentally move the sub. Then you get a loud popping sound which is not only extremely annoying but also unacceptable. You have been fore-warned. If you really feel the need to own this sleek looking set of speakers and don't mind a constant humming/occasional popping noises, go for it. Otherwise save yourself the shipping costs and buy something with better reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Sound-But Product Failure","review":"In exactly 12.5 months (just out of warranty)the system began to fail. I use it with an IBM Thinkpad and I have an earlier Altec Lansing ACS 340 which continues to work fine. I called Altec's tech support 1-800-258-3288 and was told that even though the system was out of warranty they would fix it. All I had to do was wait for a call from their tech people to check it out. Call never came. Called back and was told to connect the system to an MP3 player. Did that. System wouldn't work on either of two think pads or an IPOD. The ACS 340 however would work. Two months later I am still getting the run around. Maybe my situation is an exception--but I won't buy another Altec Lansing speaker system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with repair","review":"I read through some of the reviews - the speakers do emit a hum. However, I was ok with it. But one day I tripped over wire plugged into the back of the woofer and the cable plug broke off in the receptor. I tried to scrap it out but could not. I found to my dismay that the woofer is built in such a way that it cannot be repaired. I brought it back to Best Buy to see if they could scrap out the remains of the cable plug in the receptor but they could not. The back of the woofer says that the unit can not be serviced. It should not be too hard to build a woofer so that it is relatively modular. I gave it a star since it is decent for its price, but I can't use it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price, good size, good sound","review":"These speakers were free as part of a package for purchasing Office 2007 at a big-box retailer, but even at retail, the price is good for what you get. Set-up is very simple, and the subwoofer takes up very little space. I use them when I want to hear decent sound for music from my laptop, and they're great for this purpose. Since I use the laptop in my living room, I wanted speakers that wouldn't take up a lot of room, and these are relatively unobtrusive. The sound is not what you get from very expensive speakers, because they are not expensive. I did find that I had to reduce the bass a lot to get more balanced sound, and the midrange isn't great, but overall, the sound is very good. There is a hum when you are not playing anything through the speakers, but that's easily taken care of by just turning them off when you aren't using them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"These are the worst speakers I have ever bought.

I'm sure there are better choices at this price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"recently dusted this set off and it is still nice...","review":"This Altec system replaced an older Altec which I used for a year, then it failed.It was a shame as it was a great sounding set of speakers. These did suffer from\\"mid-drop\\" but it can be mitigated with EQ. Also, I'm using the set in my bathroom to have a system to listen to whiledressing, bathing, etc. I placed the satellites high on a porous wicker shelf and the mids are there, now!Not bad for a six-year old set is what I say. You can get better but I didn't pay too much years agoand since they aren't this years model they would go for nothing used. They are pretty, too!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very bad design. They sound terrible even for $75, that I paid.","review":"First of all, I want to say that I have been having these speakers for more than a year in past.First, it's the most ridiculous design I have ever seen. Didn't notice that when I was buying unfortunately.Cons:1) Mid-range speakers are pointed downwards (???). Question: W T F ? Of course you can expect lose of mid range frequencies because of that.2) you might think because these speakers have 2 tweeters each, the high freq would be nice.. no way, they managed to fail even here.3) Subwoofer is simply terrible, the worst I have ever experienced actually.These speakers' \\"red\\" price should be $30. IMHO.Now I am a happy owner ofKlipsch RB-61 II Speakers, of course this is a different price range. But just wanted to suggest for those who can afford. These are the best speakers I have had so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"stale","review":"i love the design, but like other reviewers have stated... there is hardly ANY mid range coming out of these things.. way too much low end (i have my eq lows scooped out and the bass dial on the speaker all the way to the bottom and there is still too much bass coming from the sub) the lack of mids result in just a stale, dry sound that eq'ing just dosnt help.. im probably going to get a new pair of speakers.."},{"rating":"2","title":"VS41212.1 Speaker System","review":"These speakers far and away outperform the dell system that came w/ the computer, better bass, more volume. The controls for bass, treble, volume and on/off are easily in reach on the front of one of the speakers. The other system had the on/off switch behind the separate sub base woofer which meant reaching down and behind every time to switch on or off the speakers.

Now I'm no sound engineer or anything remotely close to that but I can tell when something sounds good and when it sounds bad. I am more than pleased with my purchase of this set. I tried it on my iPod Shuffle, iPod video, PSP, LCD TV, and PC and it sounds outstanding in each and every device. My family was listening to it and when I asked them how much they thought I paid for them they all guessed $200-$300. I have no regrets here. I'm using them on practically every device and am pleased with the sound. I highly recommend them, and to the person that said the sub makes a buzzing noise when off, I have yet to experience that problem. Great product, great price, worthy purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Hummmmmm","review":"returned mine after less than 24 hours because of the incredibly annoying and loud hum that comes out of the subwoofer just because it's plugged into the wall (the owner's manual says this is normal because the alternating current in your home is set at 60). a friend of mine (who's an electrical engineering major) told me that almost everybody's electricity in their home is 60, so there is nothing you can do to fix the problem... what a shame, because they sounded great while playing songs, but when not in use, the noise was unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!

There were also no instructions. I called the 1-800 customer service several times staying on hold 15+ minutes each time. I gave up that approach in frustration and sent an e-mail. My e-mail was answered in two days. Subsequent e-mail exchanges took 2-4 days for Cymax to respond. After 3 weeks I decided to repair the broken pieces myself and assemble the cart. It takes two people to assemble. Once assembled it looks great and is a wonderful addition to the kitchen. I did receive replacement shelves shipped from Thailand. It took over a month to receive them.The bottom line. Like others have reported, my cart arrived without assembly instructions and with damaged parts. The telephone customer service does not answer in a reasonable time. The e-mail customer service is slow but effective. The cart looks good, is solid, and functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"Despite what other reviewers have said, this is not the most quality wood out there. It tends to break easily, especially certain pieces. It's not exactly the easiest piece of furniture to put together either. It's ok, but a little overpriced for the quality.Update: Winsome contacted me and I feel that the issue has been fully resolved. I feel that they did the right thing. Based on this I would recommend Winsome in the future, just make sure it's being shipped directly from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful experience- Don't buy from Winsome Wood","review":"Don't buy this island! The wood is high quality, but the quality control is AWFUL. Parts kept arriving broken and needed to be replaced, no less than three times. Finally when we thought we had all the pieces unbroken, we put it together only to discover that a piece we thought was fine was actually cut too small! So, after a month of dealing with Winsome Wood and their \\"fax only\\" part replacement process, I gave up. I am now the owner of a lovely kitchen island with a missing back. So it's against the wall. I AM furious, but I have a one year old and I simply don't have the time to be on hold forever with this company, find and fax more paperwork, or take apart the table to insert the missing piece.It's a shame, because if people at Winsome Wood would simply pay attention to their jobs (quality control and packaging), it would be a great quality table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this island","review":"Terrific quality, surprised how sturdy it is for the price. Just a bit of a pain to put together, some parts need to be forced just a tad. Just move slow and follow the directions. Definitely much better than we anticipated."},{"rating":"2","title":"needs better directions!!!","review":"This is a great little cart. It fits perfectly in my new kitchen. However, the directions are somewhat lacking. My husband and I have put together alot of stuff thankfully, but a few things to keep in mind. When you first start, make sure the little drawer stop faces the front. We didn't and had to add one later. Also, even though there are letters on the directions, there are none on the parts. Just take it slow and you shold be good to go. Make sure you put the two casters with breaks diagonal from each other so you can lock the cart in place. Overall, I would recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality & Amazingly Low Price","review":"We were amazed to get such a quality product - all real, solid wood (except the panels, which would be too heavy that way) - for a much lower price than other carts we saw that were made of white-painted particleboard. My engineer husband, who assembled the piece, was very impressed at the thoughtful engineering of the product. One instruction was misleading, and some steps required a second pair of hands, but otherwise no problem with assembly. We'll definitely check this manufacturer first next time we need a piece of furniture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some pieces arrived damaged","review":"The cart itself is quite sturdy but there were several dings in the wood and a crack in the bottom piece of the drawer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Neat","review":"Item was not too bad. Based on reviews I read I half expected the unit to have some wrong parts or be all busted up. Neither happened. The assembly was easy but you do need a second set of hands to hold stuff. There were some off colored wood putty and a few rough cuts that were not visible when assembled. Some of the wood plugs covering the screws did not hold well as they were too small for the holes. Overall it appears to be strong and for the price I think it was not too bad. I give it 4 stars because of the wood putty and rough areas which I mentioned were not visible in the final build and some of the wood plugs being loose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for what I needed, but...","review":"So I ordered this item and it arrived intact and as promised. It was simple to build taking about a half an hour while watching TV. I had a little help from my wife when needed. The only small issues I had assembling the item were directly related to ignoring the instructions.The problem came when I visited my local Fred Myer store and found the same item for $45 less than I paid here.None the less, the item does exactly what I need; it is a perfect home for my 100 year old watch maker's lathe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CART","review":"This cart was not too hard to assemble if you lay out all the pieces in order first before attempting to assemble.The end result was VERY NICE. I did have an issue as others did with some pieces breaking off in shipping.... but those were parts that didn't matter too much and we were able to glue those pieces back in place.I bought this item because I have a small kitchen and needed more counter space. The folding leaves work fantastically for this!I am just so happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool speaker system, with good sound","review":"This is a pretty impressing set of speakers. Mainly because of their versitility, but the sound quality is hardly compromised. Because of the amazingly ingenious silver dongle switch that sits on your desktop, you don't have to touch the actual speakers for power and volume functions, which can be difficult and certainly inconvenient in some setups. Even if you don't have them in any particular position, though, they sound great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Support?","review":"The speakers worked great for maybe 2 weeks.

Its amazing to think at 19 Britney has collected such depth and wealth of understanding of life and living. Only britney would attempt to write an autobiography at 19. What a great idea! I was stunned to read Britney had a close relationship with her mother, wow. And her life at the Mickey Mouse club was truly unique and worthy of study. Still I wish i could have heard mention of her breast surgery and how she felt appearing as a sex object at the illegal age of 17, but i really dont think she realizes what she represents or what people are making her into."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best autobiography books ever written!","review":"Britney Spears' Heart to Heart really allowes you to get a private and exclusive inside look at Britney's rise to super stardom. You'll know everything from sneaking out to a boy's house with girlfriends to Britney's aunt bragging about her niece. Lynne Spears also contributes some heartwarming poems. Her rise to stardom has not been easy. It was lucky she grew up in Kentwood with all those friendly neighbors to help the Spears family out whenever they needed it. That reminds me of Gilmore Girls with it's fictional Stars Hollow. Anyway, you should read it. It's a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rate it 0 stars if possible...","review":"What can I say? Britney has honestly showed no class, especially in recent events such as walking out on her own concert, then flipping the fans off. Now I see that this has been published.

Though this book does give some good insight into Britney the woman, I would have liked more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about cheesy","review":"I thought it might be fun to read a book about Britney, but this was terrible. They should have taken more time writing in stead of squeazing that in between performances. Basically the most of the book is sickeningly sappy. To give them credit it isn't too conceited and Lynne seems to have some good advice, but overall its pretty much common sense. She should have waited another year or two before releasing it. It would have been good if there were a tiny bit more depth than this. I advise you stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"in one word: absence","review":"this book can be summed up in one word: absence. it's absence of style, absence of content and absence of relevance. moreover, it's just one more way for britney to cash in and one more way for her fans to flush their money down the toilet. seriously, i've never read such superfluous trash before. so what, brit likes her mom--really, who cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The real story of Britney","review":"A year ago, I thought Britney Spears was just another boring singer, hidden by make-up.Now, I know how wrong i was.

Back in the days of MS-DOS and Windows 3.1, the Dummies series was innovative and really good. I guess the marketers decided to branch out and attempt to apply the same model to hundreds of other fields. The Dummies schtick is nothing but a comedy overlay to an existing academic model that is confusing to start with.Latin For Dummies fails because they take the same ponderous academic teaching model and spin it with silly and trite text. They don't even try to get away from the grammarian's non-intuitive inside language of dative, declension, genitive, infinitive, conjugation, etc. Words that also must be mastered in order to slog through the same tired obfuscated academic approach to Latin that made our grandparents hate Latin when they were kids.The For Dummies series fails in the same way with Calculus but, that's for another review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift : )","review":"I purchased this item as a christmas gift for a friend who mentioned that she wished she would have learned this in college.

The peasants do harrass you if you do not seem self confident enough - this is the same anywhere in world. This is the same even in America, go to New York and wonder around showing that you are lost and you will get harrassed. I think Pat traveled with uneducated religious fundamentalists, because at least I have had more problems when wearing conservative dress than when wearing shorts and t-shirts like most educated women in Turkey do. All one needs is self confidence to not be harrassed.

Though there is a slight paranormal flavor, the book works best as a straight mystery, one involving many different people and their actions. Mr. Rickman takes these strands and weaves them together beautifully to the final outcome. The main character, the Rev. Merrily Watkins is still charming but slightly anxious in her role as Diocesan Exorcist, and the scenes involving church politics are spot on.

There is just something so utterly lifelike about it, despite the supernatural elements that flit in and out of the plots. Although, this is one of the series' least supernatural so far. All of the regular characters make appearances here which is always a relief - and the plot that starts out so simply quickly becomes more complex with plenty of strings to be tied together by the conclusion.This edition also includes some photographs of the area, which only roots the series even more firmly in reality.

There are, however, some handy solutions for many of the puzzle-type activities in the back of the book. The coloring pages are too small for most children to enjoy. Also, most of the activities seem to be more appropriate for older children who can read and write.

Had to pick this up when I saw it at the Vicksburg battlefield visitor center. It is a blow-by-blow account of the campaign and is a bit slow to read because of some of the detail. The prelude has some interesting insight into why Sherman may have acted as he did during the campaign but the book as a whole lacks much in depth analysis. If you want to read about the army's march across Mississippi and associated destruction I would recommend this. If you are looking for more analysis this may not be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I had this car 35 years ago !","review":"I agree with the other reviews regarding the limited number of episodes, but rather than give us 16 episodes on the last disk, they decided to stretch it out a fifth and last year. They should have reduced the price. The die-cast Mach V was a nice touch and I do wish I had it when I was a kid and the show was on TV, and I could really enjoy it. But to another reviewer's point, the back wheels do not move as easily because it is a pull-back car....you pull back on the car, the wheels wind up, and then you let go...the car moves on its own.I also am giving the DVD 4 stars due to the limited number of episodes, but like all Speed Racer episodes, the content rates 5 stars.Go Speed Racer, Go !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The real speed racer.","review":"The other day I walked past my tv and saw my 7 year old son watching The new speed racer.

I bought a few of the DVD's and he viewed them. He loved the show and can't get enough. No fancy computer generated graphics just simple plain animation.

Gilbert, however, fails to focus on the numerous other victims, such as Poles and Soviet POWs. In other words, he does not attempt to analyze the Holocaust from every angle.

For Both Student or Professional","review":"It was because of Ann Kullberg's book \\"Colored Pencil Portraits STEP BY STEP\\" that I am using colored pencils as my medium today. Her new book \\"Capturing Soft Realism\\" is one of the best books and a must have. I highly recommend it for reading and/or studying the art of using colored pencils. If you're a student or a practicing, professional artist, you will find this book a valuable asset to your art career or hobby. As a fellow artist, I have found that creating colored pencil artworks is very time consuming. By applying Ann Kullberg's techniques, I have found time saving steps and key ideas that not only saved me time and money but made my artworks much more enjoyable and \\"FUN\\" to create.

Anns' online magazine, \\"From My Perspective\\" will pull everything that you need to know about cp drawing together along with giving advice on problems you may encounter while painting with cp's and what to do about them. Soft Realism is a one of kind book. You can purchase a companion CD that makes you feel as if you are getting private lessons from the author. I would reccomend this book to everyone and anyone who feels that they need directions that are easy to follow or if you just need a little fine tuning of your skills.

When I first held it in my hands after receiving it, I still remember how surprised I was at its light weight. Since then, I've used it on several occasions and it has worked flawlessly.Recently, I bought a digital SLR and this tripod is a perfect match for it too. I use it more often now and even after five years of rough use, it still rocks! I'm very impressed with its build quality and I'd highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for money","review":"Reasonably light and compact, extends fairly tall. Stable enough for indoor still photography. Pan/tilt motion is jerky and imprecise, but that's an acceptable tradeoff for the price. I'll upgrade to something better later, and then this tripod will enjoy its retirement holding Speedlites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate, not great even for a cheap tripod","review":"The elevation control (the tilting controlled by the large twist handle, not the thing which raises or lowers the center column) is a little shaky - when you tighten the control to lock elevation in place it will always be off from where you aimed.Also, I wouldn't count on the levels for any serious work/projects. I've used this tripod for panoramas, but in order to get usable level shots I need to eyeball the center column and pan head for square a couple dozen times, adjust the legs accordingly.That's perfectly reasonable for a cheap (under $30) tripod.What's not reasonable is that after a dozen or so uses one of the leg latches broke and now I can't extend the middle section of the tripod. I expect better than that even for a toy tripod like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke again","review":"First one that I owned broke after 3 uses. The second one I got broke after 10 uses. Legs are very flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price","review":"This tripod is about as good as it gets for $30. The construction and rubber spike feet feel sturdy, and the levels and spare quick release plate are a nice bonus. Since the head is plastic, panning is jerky and terrible, of course, but if you just need to set up your camera in one position and shoot, this gets the job done. I shoot with a ~4 lb setup and it's rock solid. I wouldn't expect the same with a big telephoto lens.Size-wise it's average. I can carry it in a backpack, although a few inches stick out the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid tripod, good value for money.

If you're tall, note that the max height is around five feet.It's fairly light and compact, sets up quickly, and has nice grippy feet with retractable spikes. It's rock-solid with my entry-level DSLR and medium-weight lenses, although I don't know how giant zoom lenses would fare. Panning & tilting is decent.In short, this is a fantastic tripod for non-professional use, especially at the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tripod I've Owned So Far","review":"I'll start by saying that I've burned through seven other tripods. Cheap plastic parts and bolts that would strip while holding my bulky equipment have become the bane of my existence.Recently, I purchased a new Canon and had little left in the budget for a high-end tripod. Fortunately, the Sunpak has been a tank since I took it out of the box. The pod is lightweight and easy to carry, but very sturdy and quick to set up. The mounting plates (yes, two plates) packaged along with the tripod fit all of my gear and easy to use.I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great tripod in a salary-man's price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the modest price!","review":"It is not a professional grade tripod, but an excellent one for general use. It is well made and a very light weight for easy transport. The leg adjustment is simple and very easy. The end of the legs have a choice of either a steel point or a rubber damping endpin. Also, the quick release feature is very well designed. This is an excellent choice and the low price is astounding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Fragile","review":"I just opened the box and one of the center supports is not holding to the leg properly. There are really two bubbles for leveling including one on each of the shoes. There are a full array of adjustments and all other parts seem to be solid. Be careful of the center support and the tripod should do very well for an amature like me. I couldn't find a better one for less than twice the price. I expect to get several years of use from it with my Nikon D50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very heavy and the head is not leveled","review":"I am not a pro and wanted it for day to day shooting. However, this was not upto the quality that I expected. It is much heavier than I thought and more over the head is not leveled, so when ever I click pics using the tripod they are tilted to one direction.. which is annoying. I have to keep extra space just to ensure I will be able to correct the tilt later.Also, the swing movement is not smooth and has a jerky feeling. Please put some more money to buy a better, lighter product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets The Job Done","review":"The only reason I am a lithe hard on this tripod is that I had a Canon one very similar in size and build and all the parts on the Canon one just seem smoother and sturdier. However, having said that, this tripod has thus far worked as it should. The huge plus about this is that if you lose the mount you can locate replacement ones. Canon was so difficult and so annoying that I refused to look any longer and just got this tripod, which comes with two mounts and is almost as much as any possible replacement mount solution for Canon.For sheer workability, it definitely works well, but the plastic pieces seem a little iffy and the clamps are so-so. However, none have broken or malfunctioned to stop use, but I worry that will be the downfall of the tripod. For the price, it is a great fix though and I wouldn't mind having to buy one every 1-3 years or until I can afford a really nice one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I went into the purchase knowing \\"caveat emptor\\" and \\"you get what you pay for\\". I've been extremely satisfied with this product.The locking tabs on the legs are sturdy and I don't fear them slipping. In fact, all of the securing tension mechanisms work very well.My only gripe is the camera quick-release isn't so quick. It takes some force to open and close the locking mechanism.It's not a lightweight tripod, but again... it's inexpensive.That all said, my only worries are:The handle and gears of the telescoping column are plastic and I worry about breaking it. Make SURE you're released the tension on the column before trying to lift or close it!Despite a heavy carrying weight, it is on the light side when planted (legs aren't far enough apart, IMO) and there is no hook to hang a weight on.For an introductory-mid level tripod, this is a bargain. I look forward to using it for 2-3 years at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for the money","review":"Just got this not too long ago and I have to say that I am quite impressed. It feels sturdy, isn't super heavy and I feel comfortable sticking my Rebel on it. I wouldn't recommend it to use for shooting video as it doesn't pan super smoothly.

Then, the same night, the pan handle fell out completely, unable to be screwed back in. These are cheaply made products.

But then, in recent weeks, we've noticed performance issues (for example, copying files between workstations and server suddenly was taking so much longer). After many hours of troubleshooting we found that one of the ports on the SD2008 v2.1 was the culprit. While the switch light indicated 1000mb connectivity, the switch was only getting speeds of 10mb on this particular port. We switched the port and it resolved the problem.

The D-Link doesn't have a fan, so it is completely silent. How can one company make a product that requires 2 fans and another company make the same thing that doesn't require any fans?Also according to other posts there are several \\"versions\\" of the same model product.

The unit I received worked for about a month or so now without a problem until now. It has started sounding like the other one. What piece of junk fans did they put in these things?

The only cons of the S80 is the size and weight, it's bigger and more expensive than the 550. The S80 is more techy but if you are not a pro like me, the 8 Mega Pixels are not worsted if you are not going to do major crops or large-prints.

I thought 8 Megapixels with S80 was good, but I was not really sure if I needed it. I really liked the compact nature of the SD series , the startup time and the shooting speed. But, I wanted something better than the point and shoot camera. I was really worried about the flash capability of compact cameras. With S80 I could reuse my battery back. Even though I could not use my Compact flash memory, but I think SD memory is really nice with S80. And I really liked the shooting modes the S series provided and decided to buy S80.

By using manual exposure, and manual focus, I was able to get some nice images with this filter, but that is often inconvenient. The ring on this filter is quite thick, so vignetting is likely with wider angle lenses. A filter at this price range is not going to be multi-coated, so in-lens reflections can occur when shooting towards the sun.I later purchased the Hoya 55mm DMC PRO1 Digital Circular Polarizer.

Tippett takes us from birth till death in a symphony quite like a tone poem. The work has an encapulated symphonic form much like the Sibelius 7th. This is also a product of his 'late style' which was a combination of his thorny style with his lyric style, which are both in evidence. Exemplary performance and sound. The Corelli Fantasia was once controversial, but no more. It is an extremely pleasant piece with the rhtymic buoyancy and glowing harmonies we associate with Tippett.

Not to mention the production sounds like a keyboard bought at Toys R Us and took 5 minutes to make, and most of them sound the same. Betcha Can't Do It Like Me got heavy rotation here in the ATL and that beat sounds almost identical to Laffy Taffy.

From the orange sepia filter that has been put on everything to hide bad sets and art direction to the laughable dialog that would have a porn film director hang his head in shame, one wonders what Anthony Quinn was doing in this vanity project. My guess is that he was so old and sick that he was happy to take any work especially if it paid well. I also imagine that this man Shokof was wealthy enough to offer him a hefty fee. There is a weird homoerotic threrad in the film which if the director was honest enough could have evolved into a Derek Jarman, Kenneth Anger type thing but the film is so pretentious that any redeeming feature is deeply buried.

The code errors sometimes reference an obsolete code and sometimes reference inapplicable sections of the code.

I liked Guido, though. You never doubted his feelings for Amber and even when he tried to be cruel, he would soften.The ending was so abrupt, that I wish the author had cut out 10 pages from the hideous almost wedding scene, that dragged on half the book, and put those 10 pages to a satisfying resolution.

There have also been reports that Conley confessed on his deathbed to committing the murder alone. In all honesty, Frank never really had a chance. He lived in a place where if you were of a different race or religion, and remotely linked to the murder of a sweet, innocent Christian white girl, you were as good as hanged.

In today's system (much has changed since 2004), the latter is more often the case.There: I just saved you 180 pages and $13."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent gifted resource!","review":"This is much-needed addition to the information available on gifted young people and how we can assist them in maximizing their potential. All too often, it's assumed that bright children will be fine on their own. However, without appropriate nurturing and opportunties, their talents and abilities will often fall by the wayside. This book, and the companion website www.GeniusDenied.com, provide information to empower parents, educators, and other citizens to make a positive difference on behalf of our nation's brightest young people. The stories of young people in this book are compelling, and the points made by experts who work with the population are sound. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth it","review":"My husband and I found the endless little stories about gifted children tiresome. Yes, yes, we KNOW there are gifted kids out there! We both ended up skimming the stories to get to any real informational meat, and even then, the book fell WAY short of our expectations. So sorry we paid full price for the book. Never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me wanting more","review":"I should have read the subtitle closer - *HOW* to stop wasting our brightest young minds. If there was any indication of *WHY* to stop wasting bright minds, I slept right through it.

The accompanying resources at their website [...] and careful endnotes are very helpful to anybody looking for more help concerning a specific topic.This is a great guide for newcomers to the field of gifted educations--teachers, parents, administrators, policy makers, or anybody remotely interested in the field. The only regret that most readers will have is that the book is not longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT JUST GENIUS - any gifted child","review":"This book really opened my eyes to the lack of resources and education for gifted children. It made me aware of the shortfalls in my own very expensive private education. It isn't just a problem with the private schools, it is a problem with all schools. Children are children, no matter what level of mental, emotional or physical capacity. Everyone deserves af fair deal. Gifted children should not be \\"enriched\\" and be made to sit in a corner while doing their \\"own thing\\". PARENTS: READ THIS BOOK AND BECOME MORE PROACTIVE IN YOUR CHILD'S EDUCATIONAL FUTURE. They need you and America needs them! A wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An invaluable resource","review":"Genius Denied is an exceptional resource for educators, administrators, professionals, and parents of gifted and talented students. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in making a positive difference in the lives of gifted youth. It not only addresses the challenges that the gifted population faces in our education system today, but it also gives practical suggestions as to what one can do to effect change in gifted and talented education across the nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkably disappointing","review":"I'm a bit flabbergasted that this book received such good reviews. I purchased it on the assumption that it would offer some suggestions for helping my child navigate through the public school system. It offered almost nothing in this regard, despite the claim on the cover that the book contains \\"What you can do for your gifted child.\\"So it offers little concrete information. What does it offer? In my opinion, it offers a single argument: A mind is a terrible thing to waste. If you aren't already convinced that this is a true statement, go ahead and buy this book and read it over and over and over in dozens of little anecdotes about gifted children who are \\"denied.\\"I was surprized at how little this book had to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought this for my 10yr. old daughter...","review":"I was disappointed in the quality - seems cheap. Akward angle on the top, and not very powerful. Shaving with the foil side barely cuts, other side just o.k."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading description","review":"I ordered this item and was very disappointed. The description lead me to believe it came with the leaf stem handle, but it did not. Plastic lid. Very SMALL pot. NOT worth the money. Sent it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing","review":"The most confusing book i had ever tried to read. The characters and storyline changes with every turn of the page. It is hard to follow, and I've found myself going back several pages to remember the story of one or another of the characters. The only intriguing part was the ideas of the future and its enviroment.But its not worth the effort you put in just trying to read this damn thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start- but worth it!","review":"It doesn't pick up as fast as some of the other Greg Bear books that I have read, but in the end it really doesn't matter. I think that someone should turn this into a movie. If you can just be patient and make it to the third wave, you will not be able to put it down, guaranteed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and disappointing","review":"This is the first book I've stopped reading in a long time. The characters aren't interesting, and the plot simply isn't engaging. His style is self-important and turgid. Most annoying to me was the silly development of psychological sciences. Bear usually develops computer and physical sciences in a manner that is consistent with current-day knowledge, but he fails to do this with his depiction of psychology. I wouldn't have minded as much if the book was better in other areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid, trite, and meandering ... but grammar's OK","review":"It's not that I don't like nanopunk or cyberpunk. It just happens that I really despised this book and all the vapid {nano,cyber}punk that it stands for. Although such things hardly ever bother me, I was even offended by its complete lack of moral center. Or rather, a pervasive indifference to just about everything. At least with John Varley or Tanith Lee you get the impression that sex is fun. Here, on the other hand, everything is misery, trifle, and tedium. Please, make it stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting vision with cardboard characters","review":"I have always liked Bear, so was very disappointed with this novel. The premise is interesting, the sci-fi vision is intriguing, but the characters were not developed. I just did not care about them or their individual stories. This book felt like a collage of snapshots, not a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"No rant for Slant","review":"I did not enjoy this book. My recommendation to you would be not to waste your time with it. There isn't much of a plot. There are too many characters with no substance to them. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Finally, at the end there is the assault on Omphalos but it wasn't enough to suit me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing--an effort to read","review":"Reading \\"Slant\\" is like one of those nightmares where you're struggling to run but your legs don't seem to work. The book is terribly confusing. Right from the first page, I had the uncanny feeling that the book was missing the first several chapters. There were so many fictional words like \\"yox\\" and \\"nanotech\\" and \\"INDAs\\" that I quickly got lost just trying to figure out what the hell was going on. Worse, Bear divides the book into five or six parallel plots involving completely unrelated characters. Although he manages to weave the plots together at the end, his effort is too little, too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know how some books are great and engaging right away?","review":"This is not one of those books. I bought the electronic edition of it... - and was sorely dissapointed. I've made it through about the 1st third of the book and now I've given up. The plot is as loose as overcooked spaghetti, the constant references to fake texts pompous and self-important, and the characters are stiff and wooden. Furthermore, the history and technological particulars of this future world are not at all made clear to you in any semblance of good science fiction exposition. I'm really dissapointed because I kept hearing such good stuff about Greg Bear, but frankly I'm quite underwhelmed. I was so dissapointed that I wanted to write a bad review of the book over at Peanut Press - but they don't have a customer review section, so I came here to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Literary train Wreck","review":"Throughout the beginning of the book, I though the million different plots would eventually run together and be understandable. Wrong. I kept tellin myself \\"it's slow to start, it will get good around page 100\\" then it was 200, then 300, then the book was over.Not that all the plots were bad, I like the sentient computer and people sleeping their way to a better tomorrow, but some plots I didn't quite catch on. I even wondered why the techno-whore plot was included. I think it's part of the whole disturbing \\"aren't i naughty?\\" trend in modern SF, but that's a different rant.there were, however some good things about this book (hence 2 stars). the reactionary state of Green Idaho was an excellent concept and was underdeveloped. Also, the computer (whose name escapes me) had so much potential too, you could write a whole book on those things alone.In short, not too impressive. there's about five or six books trapped in here that keep bumping into each other and falling over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slant takes a different direction than Bear's other books.","review":"Having read Eon and Eternity, I was struck by Greg Bear's emphasis on sex in Slant. He uses this most intimate human act to show what the possibilites and disasters might result in the combination of sex and technology of the future. I found this to be a more personal book in that it dealt with the human psyche, rather than trips to uncharted space. The potentials of the human mind is itself an uncharted space.I picked this book out a few other of Bear's books that were on the store's shelf. It has his usual talent for detail and great storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, and riveting.","review":"This is a wonderful sequel to Queen of Angels. It is much better, and a great read. The book is suspenseful and entertaining. You have no idea how the plot will unfold until it does, and when it does it will blow you away. The cutting-edge technology Bear dreams up is by far the best in this, his latest, book. I spend long minutes pondering the reality-based technology he talks about, and all that stuff in the Omphalos with the nano...well, WOW! I love all books Greg Bear, and I especially loved this one. Thanks Mr. Bear for yet another terrific read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of Greg Bear's best works","review":"This book is so prescient it's scary. Greg is dead on in many techno-prophecies, particularly in how technology may change and challenge humans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid, contrived, almost unreadable","review":"Lost opportunities, that's what I say about this work by Greg, who used to be my favourite author. I used to buy his works on strength that HE wrote it - but I was disappointed this time. Greg has come down a long way since his own nadir of accomplishment in Eon/Eternity days. A sad waste of money and time. The premise is OK, but the story poorly developed, the characterization cardboard and unbelieveable, the plotting almost non-existent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting ideas, boringly presented","review":"I've read and enjoyed a lot of Greg Bear's work, but this book was a disappointment. The second chapter was a pointless, wandering, stream-of-consciousness exercise that I barely got through. I was tempted to throw the book away without reading any more. The rest of the book was slightly better, but the author appeared to be so tired and unexcited while he was writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"/","review":"Excellent piece of work here. Easy to follow, a much improved writing style from \\"Queen of Angels\\", but should definately be read after QOA, if only to prepare the reader for the world according to Greg. I've noticed that Greg uses sub-themes in his books which seem to be more thought provoking than the actual main storyline, sexuality in Slant, and self-awareness in QOA. All very nicely done, with short extracts from imaginary books of the future. Makes me actually want to read \\"The Kiss of X, Alive Contains a Lie\\". The storyline with \\"Jill' the thinker is superb and Roddy's menacing superiority is frightening. The manner in which Greg deals with sexuality appears to be as thoroughly researched as the sci-fi stuff, quite excellent and refreshing. Only thing I didn't like about this book was the rather limp ending. Hence: 4/5. I've you read Slant and QOA, then I recommend Moving Mars next. Decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read Blood Music, this book will suck.","review":"Bear's Blood Music was an awesome story, so I had some pretty high expectations for this novel. What a disappointment. The only thing that was halfway interesting were the little net-media blurbs interspersed throughout the book. There is very little to do with nanotech, as the back of the book somewhat misleads you to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond awful","review":"This book was more like some teenagers perverted dream than an interesting story. Far too many different character plot lines at the start, and none of those characters are really that interesting. Futuristic porn stars and 50 year old guys with mind reading abilities who can magically get younger women to sleep with them seems more of a self indulgent fantasy on the authors part than an integral part of the story. If I wanted porn I'd check my spam folder in email."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near-Future SciFi Holds Up Pretty Well 10 Years Later","review":"SLANT(1997) is a Near Future SciFi Techno Adventure. Set in the year 2052, and involving nanotechnology, AI, and medical technoadvances, it holds up pretty well ten years after it was published.In 1997, a leading edge computer was a 200Mhz Pentium running Windows 95, and the Internet was generally accessed via 56Kbps dialup modems using Explorer 3.0. While we have come a long way since then, the bottom line is that 1997 computer tech is really not that much different than today's, as far as being compared to the computer Artificial Intelligence that is described in the book.In SLANT, the Military is using Natural Gas Powered Hummvees by 2020 (could still happen, I suppose), but a \\"Separatist Movement\\" achieving a semi-independent Northern Idaho by the 2020's seems a bit unlikely... and the ramafications of 9/11/01 were of course hard to predict... but, thankfully, we are spared any Impending Human-Caused Global Warming Catastrophes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sold Mine.

Unfortunately Connavar, the main character and hero, is horribly one dimensional. He is a fierce warrior, and that is about it. The only character I came to like, Banounin, died as he was becoming important to the growth of Connavar as a leader. Connavar ends all conflict through threats or killing, he seems to have no thought other than anger, and vengeance. Think William Wallace of Scotland without an education. I am planning on reading the entire series for the sake of it, but if you are looking for a deeper story and characters you may want to look elsewhere. All in all the story is very good for what it is, a warrior epic, and a loosely based history."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the concept, but the book still stunk","review":"I like the concept of having someone right a book that modeled the expansion and rise of Rome, it's blatant that the author did so. Even though I liked the concept the book was still bad. I think that if a differnt author had wrote this then it would have been good.

No big deal, the key still worked. Until... last week, the lock somehow jammed, and I was unable to unlock the Wrap from my steering wheel. I struggled with it for quite some time and even called the 1-800 number on the key. Of course, no one answered. I left a message in a panic, and, of course, no one returned my call. The only way to remove the Wrap was to cut it open and dismantle the lock. The bf brought out his drill and chipped away at the metal and plastic. About an hour later, with a mess of metal and plastic shavings blanketing the car's interior, we removed the Wrap. Overall, a horrible experience. I would never recommend the Wrap to anyone and am searching for a new security device.

Just stopping for gas could result in a car jack or other adventure. At both stops, I fitted the Wrap and locked the doors. It performed exactly as advertised, with the alarm lights flashing. Just the slight movement in washing the windshield caused the alarm to sound. The Wrap was an exact fit on my steering wheel with no slippage possible. No one could possibly drive my car with the thing on. I felt most secure on this trip and would recommend the Wrap to anyone with a need for serious protection.

To be sure,most of these groups were known only in their respective areas-but that doesn't matter one bit.

So when it was set to be re-published in the U.S., I wanted to see what all the talk was about. Now after reading up to this volume (and two or three volumes ahead of this one), most of the enclosed stories in this volume start to bring in a major plotline which I'm sure will last throughout the run of the series. For the beginners to the series, it's best to start back at the first volume to see how it all starts. But for those of us who have been reading the series up to this volume, this is where the payoff for the series starts.

I wasn't aware that he has a son with Down's Syndrome, and it was very interesting the way Darryl relates the experience of watching his son struggle to conquer skills we-all take for granted to not tolerating players who aren't using their God-given talents to the best of their ability. The emphasis on strong work-ethic is very refreshing in this era of convenience where somehow we have come away from giving all we have to everything we attempt and instead settle for taking the easy way out. There are powerful lessons in this story that non-hockey players can apply to their personal lives and use to steer their attitudes and intentions regarding whatever they are doing in a more positive and productive manner.

However, the adapter used to install the temperature sensor means it measures somewhere between the coolant temperature and the block temperature. And there is no temperature calibration on the gage. So, for the hot summer days and traveling in the Sierra Nevada mountains some more information is in order. In spite of the nice running gear we like to keep the look of a classic 1949 so the small gage under the black dash is a good match. Also we want to keep the installed sensor to work with the dash gage so this inline radiator hose temperature sensor adapter does the trick.

The premise of the book is interesting and could have made for a powerful story if it did not seem like this book was written with Thesaurus in hand. Additionally, I think Burkett was trying to find the most bizarre sentence construction possible with every line he wrote. Granted, the chapters written from the greer's point-of-view should contain an alien element to their thinking, but not to the point of taking away from reader's enjoyment.

That bit is now jammed in the unit with no way to remove it and my Critter is essentially destroyed. I would suggest that unless there is a reason, the original rod be left in place and just the tip--probably all that is really needed--be replaced.

Even after reading some of the reviews I was still looking forward to it. But after maybe 10 chapters I was bummed. And hurt. And angry. Why would anyone take a masterpiece of science fiction and turn it into a piece of trash.

It has nothing to do with the first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even if you want to like it, you won't","review":"As many other reviewers have said, this book doesn't seem to have actually been written by Clarke - if it had, it wouldn't be the steaming pile of poo that it is. Rendezvous with Rama was good if not great - but everything that made it thought-provoking has been abandoned in this sequel. I kept reading thinking that somehow it had to get better, because it couldn't get much worse.

Clarcke and this is my reason for giving this warning.This book is not Arthur C.Clarke, it is Gentry Lee and the publishers taking advantage of his name to get an utterly inferior line of books marketed.The plot in the trilogy is slow and tedious. It takes a determined effort to work through the three big volumes.I only finished the job in the hope, that somewhere the genius of Clarcke would break through, but it never happened.I am sorry, the rating forces me to give one star - I would have preferred a system, where I could give no stars at all.The final conclusion (which I shall not disclose) is both unrealistic and ridiculous, something which would never be the case in a true Clarcke book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Clarke","review":"As a reader has already so eloquently put it 'Gentry Lee sours Clarke'. I couldn't agree more. Admittedly, the original book had characters that were none too interesting, but I would much rather have an exciting story that moves along at a reasonable pace than read some character development for page after page. The rama series steadily declined after the original book, something which may or may not have been due to Gentry Lee's involvement, who can say. All I know is that by the time I got to the last book in the series (Rama Revealed) I was lucky to finish it.

The focus of the story was where it should have been-- on the mysterious, awe-inspiring space craft code-named Rama.

I'm embarrassed to see Mr. Clarke's name associated with these so-called sequels. They reflect nothing of the science fiction wonder and imagination seen in Rendezvous with Rama and most of his other stories. Rama II & III are completely polluted with political, sociological & religious nonsense and modern emotionalism. Not worth reading. Certainly not worth adding to a fine collection of Clarke books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci Fi embarrassment","review":"Reading this novel made me feel embarrassed -- it felt like Rama II was written by a high school freshman, so obviously wanting to sound mature and sophisticated.

It was so good that I literally trawled the second hand stores in a bid to get my hands on the sequel.To put it bluntly, this book was a big disappointment for me.The biggest problem I had was that the atmosphere was completely different to the first one. I kept asking myself why it was part of the Rama series since it deals mostly with the soft issues of the scientists (ambition, religion, relationships, conflict ...) rather than the hard science[fiction] that I thoroughly enjoyed from the first book.I give this book one star because I would not recommend it to a friend. I would not recomment it to anyone interested in getting into science fiction and I would not recommend it as a showcase for the author's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read book 1, but not the rest","review":"I loved \\"Rendezvous with Rama,\\" and as a child, I'd spend time thinking about what it would be like to get left behind.

I'll tell you, poor writing and no structure. The whole story seems to be made up as it goes along. There are so many chapters in this book you dont even need to read. I never thought Id come across a poor Clarke novel but Im sure it's not all on his shoulders. There are some pretty interesting things in this book but none of it makes for a better overall book.

Characterisation is also a lot stronger in this although the first fifth of the book is laden with slightly unnecessary \\"preparatory background.\\"At the end, you'll find yourself wanting to know more, there are many unanswered questions. This isn't a bad thing, the 2 sequels expand on the concept but the sense of wonder still remains.Essential reading if you've ever seen or read \\"2001 a Space Odyssey.\\" This series is probably better.

I have to admit that it is still a decent book. (I couldn't have written it). It seems that Clarke spends more time nowadays trying to paint a picture of the future that is perfectly politically correct and devoid of any particular prevalent religion. That is fine, but I think he spends too much time on that and not on telling a good story. He will write 50 great pages on Raman exploration and then 50 on a particular characters personal life, complete with memories of their childhood and their philosophy.

The Ramans completely ignored our explorers, considering them merely trash to be swept away by their bots. The central sea was mysterious and fascinating when frozen, it was mysterious and fascinating when the lights came on and the sea began to melt, the unexplored metal buildings were fascinating, the bots were fascinating. The exploration of Rama was stark, quiet, and beautiful.Now, take these wonderful things, remove them from the story, add some obnoxious characters whom you will hate, study every aspect of the obnoxious characters in painful detail, and call it a sequel.The contrast between this and the original leaves me at a loss for words.

Many scenarios are not plausible and read like a mystery novel. The cavalier manner in which the journey is planned and executed is unreal.

The expedition looks like a wild-west excursion, the doctor having to rely on memory for doing healthchecks, the lack of a chain of command, decision that would definitely have been taken on ground being taken in space etc. ...

I wanted to keep reading to see if the plot was getting somewehere. It didn't and was I relieved when I finished it.This is not typical A.C. Clark. The story rambled on and on, with excessive detail of the interior of the Rama ship. There were too many characters to hate and too many meaningless deaths. I think contrived is the word I would use to best describe the main and sub-plots. Was it truly necessary to make the media representative so vulgar and unscrupulous? I think not.When I started to read the story I was sure that it was going to answer some of the imponderable questions left by the first book. It didn't, and by the end it simply left more questions (do I see a Rama III in the offing?).I suggest a sad pass on this tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly as bad as the reviews.","review":"Unfortunately I couldn't resist and picked the book up despite what I read in the reviews.What an epic piece of trash. I can't fathom how the author(s) could have taken such a fertile backdrop of genuinely good (great!) science fiction and decided to tell a completely unbelievable story about a dysfunctional group of prepubescently shallow characters who have somehow been chosen to take part in the most important mission undertaken by humanity in decades. It is the worst concoction of cheap conspiracy theory with reality television personalities.The majority of reviews already posted regarding the book are spot on and I feel that there isn't much I can add.So I will say only this: This ruined the amazing original for me.

A very good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"is it really by Clarke?","review":"I read the first chapter of Rama II, and it became immediately obvious to me that Clarke didn't write it. Instead of introducing any science-fiction ideas, it is a propaganda piece about the author's views on economics (government spending will ruin the economy) and abortion (it's good for holding down the population of minority groups). It sounded like something by an Ayn Rand disciple, which Clarke definitely isn't. Either Clarke did not write the novel, or he cared so little about the book that he delegated the crucial first chapter to his collaborator. Either way I decided it wasn't worthwhile reading the rest.This is the first time I've felt justified writing a review on the basis of one chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly engaging--can't put it down","review":"The first Rama book (Rendezvous with Rama) only left me hungry for more about this wonderfully orginal and engaging story.

The first thing I noticed was that Gentry Lee writes and elaborates a lot more than Arthur C. Clark. Also, he spends way too long on trying to develop stupid, simpleminded characters while barely spending any time on the PLOT. Unfortunately, I read onward. Some of the book was interesting, but no thought was given to the facts that perspective changed and so did the view of Rama. The plot goes more and more downhill, and the end parts were really stupid. Although this book stunk, I won't spoil the end.

Lots of personal melodrama amongst the characters that is totally out of place in Sir Artuhr's classic work. I loved Rama, hated Rama II. Recycled it a quarter of the way through. I will not be continuing with the Rama series. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"A soap opera in outer space!","review":"It's sad to see how the marvellous story started by Clarke's \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" gets spoiled by the most unbelievable characters and their long-winded personal histories totally irrelevant to the plot. And anyway, as another reviewer has sensibly asked, who on earth chose such a crew of lunatics for such an important mission? Most of the happenings inside Rama II are totally unrealistic.Rama II is hard to read through and rarely gets down to the point, namely, the Raman spaceship and its inhabitants. Be prepared to skip pages, especially those about Nicole's preposterous dreams.If I made it until the end it's because, after Clarke's Rendezvous, I can't get off the Raman story any more and I want to know how the story goes on and ends.

Gentry Lee should stick to administration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rama 2 is garbage","review":"This book is *not* written by Arthur C Clarke, it was written by Gentry Lee alone. The promotion of the book as an ACC book is highly misleading.Gentry Lee belongs on the slushpile. His writing is full of magic and fantasy rather than science fiction. This book contains lengthy, irrelevant asides. The SF component is trivial; the book is basically a large character study.It is astonishing how bad this book is by comparison to the excellent, simple narrative \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mistake...","review":"It's tough to accuse Mr. Clarke of characterization. Despite his huge cannon, even works like 2001 and 2010 render characters on the whole rather flat.But this isn't a criticism. Clarke is about imagination, and science applied to futuristic vision. And, along with Asimov, at this he is a master.So, Rendezvous with Rama, is a work of pure imagination. A 'what if'. Hard science re-engineered to an alien world. Rama II on the other hand is a different beast.Who told Gentry Lee that importing stock cardboard characters, tired cliche plot elements and possibly the worst dialogue ever committed to paper would improve upon the Rama experiance? I think we should be told.I approach the rest of the series with a certain sense of dread."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Classic to Crap","review":"\\"Rendezvous With Rama,\\" the first novel in this series, is one of the all-time classics of science fiction, brilliantly capturing the exhilaration of discovery. \\"Rama II\\" rivals \\"Exorcist II: The Heretic\\" as perhaps the worst sequel ever. It is a bloated windbag of a book that manages to be both pretentious and trivial.Clarke, who was about as religious as Madalyn O'Hair, somehow let himself be talked into attaching his name to this preachy soap opera, whose climactic sequence features an outer-space baptism. Think of an especially long and tedious episode of \\"Melrose Place\\" with Jerry Falwell as a guest star and you'll have a pretty good idea of this travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad and boring.","review":"This book is a mess. If you read RAMA you should avoid this book. Gentry Lee has the skill of a third rate romance writer. He plops in all the drama of a TV soap opera with abandon. How much did Arthur Clarke had to do with this? Who can say but not much since all that made RAMA such a good and interesting book is gone. Silly one dimensional people populate the book and keep doing cringe worthy things thorough. They would seem to be more at home on a NBC movie of the week then in a book like this. I was disappointed that someone could take a simple and classic book like RAMA and mess it up so badly. A shame really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequels never were a good idea...","review":"... especially in this case. Rendevous With Rama was a breathless 1 day read, full of tension and amazement. It leaves you desprately trying to picture the thing in your mind. Rama II is simply drivel. Clarke tries to give us lots of stuff about his \\"characters\\" but writes like a schoolboy. Who cares about the characters? You won't, that's for sure. Then there are the tedious, naive descriptions of the earth's history since the first Rama.... skip past them. In fact skip the whole book.

He should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Lee, no Clarke","review":"This book and the sequels were clearly written by Lee. And it shows. The character development is too long and completely unnecessary in many instances. The villains are transparent. I was dissapointed that Clarke decided to sell out on his his brilliant RWR. It could have been so much more than this transgalactic soap opera. Do something else with your time, this book and the ones following this are not worth of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rama Two?? more like Rama Poo!!!","review":"I picked this up because I like Clarke and the original Rama book. Lee just changes most everything and writes like a woman's romance author. One of the protagonists is a woman and way too much time is spent discussing her relationships, feelings and bad sex. I thought Lee WAS a woman until I looked up he/she and found it was an old dude writing in a woman's style. That is just plain creepy!! I guess Clarke just took the money to use his name on the cover and never wrote any of it. Nice sell out Clarke.Don't waste your time on any of his garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"And it gets worse...","review":"This book illustrates that old writer's adage \\"Never write a book with a JPL engineer\\". Just as Asimov's writing went downhill before he kicked off, Clarke's writing also suffers. Gentry Lee's contributions (whatever exactly they were and, no, I dont care) make a book that was probably destined to be weak a whole lot worse. I re-read this book and Rama III recently thinking they couldn't possibly be as bad as they seemed the first time around. I was wrong. Sadly, Rama II deserves its single star rating and each succeeding book in the series falls off by a half star or more. Do yourself a favor and re-read \\"The City and the Stars\\" or his short stories from the 50's instead. (And don't get me started on the non-Asimov \\"Foundation\\" knockoffs!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, since I really enjoyed part one, but I wish I had read the reviews before I started reading it. This is nothing like the first book and does nothing to expand on the first book.Quite a bit of the book was spent on the characters having flashbacks. If the past lives of the characters were that interesting, then why didn't the authors make a book about that and title it appropriately, instead of selling me this book, misleading me into thinking it was to be about Rama? I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to believe it would be good...","review":"After I finished reading Rendezvous, I couldn't wait to pick up Rama II and dig in. Of course, after I saw all the negative reviews on Amazon, I thought twice. But then I went to B&N; and read through the intro by Clarke, and he spoke of his initial hesitance to work with another writer. But over the course of the intro, Clarke himself convinced me that I should be excited to read what he and Lee had in store in Rama II.About half-way through the 3rd chapter, \\"Crew Conference\\", I had to stop.Where Rendezvous was filled with intrigue, and slowly unraveling mysteries, Rama II was filled with inane dialog and supremely annoying characters. I just found everything immediately unrealistic and boring. Drama is much better served by inference and subtlety. Not brash, in your face, High School Jocks jockeying for position 'round the hallway locker.Listen to all the other one stars.

To my dismay, the book was more like a soap opera between the human crew, with Rama taking a distant second in importance.In fact, it takes 1/3rd of the book before they even get on the ship, with almost nothing to show for it. Even after that, there are many boring conversations (almost unrelated to Rama) that that wash out the few islands of interesting reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap opera pettiness, with a science fiction backdrop","review":"Giving a 1 star review might seem extreme, but this book deserves it. I think I was on page 120 when I threw this book across the room in frustration, as they had not even left planet earth yet in the midst of a soap opera drama. This book is NOT Rama, not in anyway shape or form. The first 120 pages are an exercise in pettiness between competing people to get on the ship to meet Rama. Essentially its Beverly Hills 90210 triteness, with a science fiction backdrop. I could go on and on, but there is limited time to read all the great books out there and this one has taken up too much of my time already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonshingly Bad","review":"It's been at least ten years since I read a book by skipping a couple of pages, reading a few lines, skipping a few more pages, reading some lines, and so on.

While similar in structure to \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\", \\"Rama II\\" is more humane to its characters, involving us more in the lives of our explorers. The slight changes in the Rama ship create a palpable sense of terror, building steadily to a climax in true cliffhanger style. I had a hard time putting this one down, tearing through the pages with sweaty hands and a pounding heart. One of the most frightening stories I've read in recent years, this one kept me up at night with its vivid depictions of alien imagery.

It really is a shame because the music is beautiful - light, yet substantial, and perfect for those times when one tires of loud and sometimes bombastic music by more well-known composers.

After the smoke cleared, there was nothing for me to hold on to besides a lot of mumbo jumbo and factual sleight of hand. When a man claims to have been miraculously healed of cancer, he should be able to document his claim with hard facts, including x-rays, medical tests, medical testimonials by qualified professionals familiar with the case and the like. Instead, these authors say only that they don't know if Targ's original diagnosis, later not confirmed, was accurate. They brush by the main point but can't avoid its impact for rational people. It is not a great jumping off point for a book that has such pretentions of spirituality, but sadly misses the mark in that ambition as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"This book is a big disappointment. It's a rehash of psychic research that has been discussed before by better writers. The rub is that these two writers throw in claims about spirituality and healing. Targ claims he was miraculously cured of cancer, but dodges the question of whether he was sick or just misdiagnosed. That offends those of us who have the disease and are dealing with it, not exploiting it. Misdiagnosis is a common problem and \\"miracle cures\\" are often the result of proper re-testing. I want proof of miraculous healing, not a silly claim that a little jogging and a little prayer equals a miracle. The authors imply that only those who are not spiritual get sick and die. Katra says she's a healer, but her not very original new age ideas amount to trite advice to think positive. How spiritual is it to exploit sick people by holding out false hope and claims of miracles to sell a book? Look for God and truth elsewhere. One star because there is no lower rating.Andrea Hope"},{"rating":"1","title":"right guy, wrong interpretation","review":"The authors are correct in pointing out that many sick people sought outJoel Goldsmith in his day and indeed were healed, though he'd be the first to admit that \\"God is only the healer\\" however,I must in good conscience caution readers not to assign much weight to the authors' interpretation of the great man's words, for they would need be a great deal nearer to Goldsmith's spiritual level to even begin to understand him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant and Dramatic","review":"Chadwick's 3rd Symphony is certainly an earful. It features vigorous harmonies and subtle orchestration, and doesn't contain a dull minute. The program notes suggest that Chadwick might have influenced Dvorak, and indeed there are moments in the orchestration that suggest the New World Symphony. Jarvi's performance is hearty and beautifully detailed, a truly fine job for a symphony that no longer has a performance tradition. There is an appealing warmth to the whole conception. When we turn to the Barber, though, Jarvi and the DSO turn in performances that are positively electric. None of the drama inherent in this music is slighted. These may be the best Barber performances I have heard since the famous Thomas Schippers/New York Philharmonic LP from the '60's. Add to that excellent sound, and you have a very winning CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"good, but there are alternatives","review":"PROS-great to start as finger foods (easier than cheerios to pick up and eat)-dissolves quickly (less of a choking hazard)-baby loves them!CONS-stains! As the baby drools on his hands or loses a half-eaten puff, it leaves a bright orange stain on clothing, rugs, etc. Not easy to get out, and a lot of the other flavors are more neutral colored and do not stain as much as the sweet potato. The last thing I want to do is have to wash his highchair cover and straps, rugs, clothes, etc because of bright orange stains all around.-cheaper versions available (ie, at Target they have their own brands)-does have sugar (I wish they can make a low or non-sugar version, because I'm pretty sure the baby will still eat them. Why add unnecessary sugar into everything?)I started with the Gerber sweet potato, but I'll be sticking to the Target blueberry (because it's cheaper and doesn't stain)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk food for babies","review":"I gave these to my daughter all the time, so bought a box for my son now that he is of an age to enjoy them. Somehow I ended up looking at the ingredients list. It is completely impossible to differentiate this from just about any junk food product on the market.Sugar, check.A whole bunch of things on the ingredients list which are actually sugar but have a different name to hide how much sugar is in it(e.g. apple juice concentrate), check.Processed grains with names which sound like they are whole grains(e.g. wheat starch, rice flour), check.Chemicals with unpronounceable names(e.g. zinc sulfate, mixed tocopherols, dicalcium sulfate), check.A couple vitamins added to hide the fact that this is mostly sugar and refined grains and pretend that it is healthy (e.g. pyridioxine hydrochloride, thiamin hydrochloride), check.If you don't have time to cut up fruit or vegetables, just buy cheerios. They are no more healthy but at least they are cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my baby's favorite","review":"i should have tried this flavor before buying bulk here. my daughter loves puffs in general and she really liked the sweet potato ones we got before this one. but the apple cinnamon flavor is a little too 'artificial' and strong. instead of grabbing them by the handful, she doesn't seem too interested to eat these.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stain clothing","review":"This is a good idea, and they dissolve quickly for babies new to food. But if a partially slobbered on one falls out of the baby's mouth and onto clothing it leaves a stain that proves impossible to remove.

When I went to clean off the tray the puffs came off but everywhere there was a wet puff I now have an orange stain.

The links between strategy and valuation are very week exposed via a few kindergarten charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, but \\"not for beginners\\".","review":"I want to say something about this book that the other reviewers didn't see. The point is that this book is a \\"tecnical\\" book and should not be considered as Carl Sagan's books an \\"easy reading of something difficult for the common people\\". This means that if you want to buy this book just to take a look of what valuation is, you are waisting your time and money: you shoul go firt to the university and study a little before you do this. So, considering only the purpose of this book I can say that it's contents are excellent, and the only drawback is that it is absolutely theoretical. It should have contained more excersises. But that's it...........excellent.!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complements a Trio of Corporate Finance Books","review":"Best read after completing both \\"Shareholder Value Added\\" by Rappoport and \\"Quest for Value\\" by Stewart, this book does an excellent job of not only patching up conceptual holes the two previous works left with their competing terminology and viewpoint, but as acting as a keystone that combined the two to make a macro picture of valuation more complete. I have not read Damodran (sp?), I am leery after reading that reported typo's make interpretation difficult, however, I feel this book delves much in the way of detail. Textually it is sometimes challenging to follow along, but arguments are supported by ledgers with the changes and suggesstions bolded. The financial valuation is a god send... Looking forward to the excel model, I just wish/hope it had a financial template included..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too focused on the DCF-Method","review":"According to the title and previous reviews, I expected a comprehensive guide featuring a critical overview on the current methods of valuation, the differences between them and, finally, a conclusion which method to use under which circumstances. However, the authors promote the DCF-method as the single approach, using their presentation and sales skills to badmouth anything else. If you want a book on DCF, this may be your choice, but don't expect a comprehensive guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing spectacular","review":"Unfortunately, for all the name brand that this book conveys, I think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part. There are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as McKinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind. The subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session. No actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, I would be astounded. Save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation. By the way, those giving 5 stars either can't read English very well or are shills for McKinsey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good as a basic introduction to the subject","review":"The book focuses on the DCF method only. Additionally, it is not very clear introducing the concepts.

Otherwise readers without a solid foundation on finance will not appreciate why the WACC method is the most accepted by large corporations, or the special methology developed in the book is so superior to the calculation of low level financial ratios.

I am currently pursuing my MBA and am not foreign to hard to read books. But more often than not I have been pleasantly surprised by how well books are written on topics like corporate finance and accounting. This book went straight to bottom of the heap on my shelf.

I'm painting kitchen cabinets that are removed from the wall with it. I've never used a paint sprayer before and I couldn't be happier with the results after just a little messing around with it. Keep it level, thin your paint, protect yourself with a respirator, and you will be very happy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it weren't for spitting globs of paint...","review":"Sorry to be the wet blanket reviewer, but my Critter always spits at least one glob of paint (or stain or whatever) on the finished surface (usually more). Cleaning it doesn't help solve the problem. Thinning the paint doesn't solve it. You get excited during the painting because it looks like it's working, and then BLOP, it shoots a couple of big droplets of paint into the center of the work, so large that they won't flow out. I find it unuseable for anything that requires an even finish. It's moderately OK for stain, which spreads out and soaks in, but forget painting, unless you want it to look globby. I also own a real paint gun by Binks and there is just no comparison whatsoever in quality of finish. I wanted easy cleanup so badly that I purchased a product that doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, eazy to use, and cheap... who could ask for anything more?","review":"This thing is so simple it's basically just an air gun spraying over a venturi tube attached to a mason jar. Nothing fancy or complex but WOW it works perfectly! I've used it to paint doors, fan blades, trim, etc. It spays latex with no issues just make sure you thin it out using Floetrol and water. Clean up is very simple. I forgot to clean it out once and all the paint had dried, well I spent about 10 min at the sink with a scrub pad and a paper clip and a few other tools and it came out looking like new. For the best results I use quite a few light coats and sand with 320 grit between each, then use 400 grit on the final coat and clear coat over that. Everything looks flawless, clean, and no brush marks, drips, or imperfections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I hadn't wasted so much money on spray paint!","review":"I used this gun for the first time today, and I am VERY HAPPY! I wish it hadn't taken me so long to try it out. You get much better control than spray paint, and the finish is excellent. The thin coats dry so quickly you can go back and recoat almost immediately. I had to dilute my latex paint in order to get it to spray at all--I probably used 1 2/3 cups paint and 1/3 cup water. But I sprayed 2+ coats of paint on a worn out buffet, and still have about 2/3 cups of paint mixture left in the jar! I can't believe how little it used. Looking forward to using it for many more applications! (Starting with polyacrylic tomorrow!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clog in the Feed Tube","review":"I tried out this Critter Spray Gun today using Benjamin Moore latex paint. It worked fairly well for about 20 minutes, then it clogged up and would not shoot paint. I cleared out the feed tube and tried again. Only got about 5 minutes on the second attempt before it clogged up again.It would be pretty neat little spray gun if it would operate clog-free. When it did work, it laid out a pretty smooth surface. It may be that this paint is not adaptable to spray guns. I plan to consult my paint dealer to see if there is some additive I can use or if there is some other trick that will let me make the thing work.If I can't shoot latex paint, I guess I'll just keep it on hand in case some other spray job pops up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critter Sprayer","review":"Excellent sprayer works great, applies nice light even spray on your project that your finishing and does not waste material spray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this little sprayer","review":"I purchased this little sprayer to replace a heavier duty sprayer I was using.

I would recommend it to anyone who needs to paint small to medium jobs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price","review":"I was looking for something that would easily apply latex paints and came across this sprayer. I remember having a badger sprayer as a kid that worked really well on models, and this looked like a sprayer that worked the same way - only bigger. The nicest thing is that you can use regular mason jars - and have several paints ready for spraying. Clean up is also very simple. I really like how this operates - it beats the heck out of my Wagner airless! The only reason for four stars is that they need to include more gaskets or offer a package of more here at amazon. You can only clean the first one you get so many times.You still need to thin the paint just a bit before spraying, but I'd do that with the Wagner anyways.I recommend this to anyone that is a DIY that doesn't want to spend a ton on a paint sprayer.

You can certainly try to immediate it, but its like comparing Leather to Pleather. I see Mario multi talented in his huge glossary of fancy words that describe history and perhaps description of foods in a high ranking cooking university.

About half the pages have detached and I'm a few chapters away from having to pull the whole thing apart and put it in a three-ring binder.

I got the impression that the author was fascinated by all his research, but had a hard time culling detail to make a good book. The information about the bureaucratic delays within the US government, for example, were interesting, but did not warrent anything like the amount of tedious detail they received. I found myself constantly comparing the book to Lansing's Endurance (about the Shacketon expedition on the other pole), which was, in contrast, suspenseful, thrilling, and had a mesmerizing protagonist. On the other hand, characters in GOCSabine do turn up in other stories of the period, such as Issac's Storm, so you can see what happened to them.

A well presented depiction of the story of 25 men sent upon an ill conceived U.S. Army exploratory Arctic adventure in the 1880's and left to starve and freeze to death. The author presents a well researched depiction of abandoned men at the bottom of their lives. Although seven were rescued and six lived on to tell their tale, this author has relied heavily upon the original journals and diaries of most of the soldiers as well as the proceedings that transpired as a contemporary inquest and investgation of this debacle. This book is a worthy read which will compliment a broader understanding of the history of arctic exploration."},{"rating":"2","title":"A harrowing true story","review":"Bureaucratic ineptitude plays a large role in the disaster that befell the Greely expedition, which at the time was America's most sucessful polar venture. That any of the expedition, let alone their leader, survived is nothing short of miraculous. Guttridge's compelling, page turing narrative presents a fascinating story that has been often overlooked. Most interesting is Greely himself, whose long and dedicated government career was blemished only, if at all, by the disaster that befell his expedition.

I have two and had 4 nestfuls this year. It was the first year I put it out in Texas.Second day the bluebirds were checking one out. They started building their nest the next day. The side folds up so that you can see through the plexiglass at the baby birds without disturbing them (too much). The mother bird will flee when you open side, but will return. Only inconvenience is cleaning it as all pieces have to come off to clean and remove nest. I used a predator guard on the pole, but never saw any predators around the box. Place near a smalltree. I wouldn't use anyother brand for a working birdhouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well as a Bridge Camera Bag","review":"Although it is designed as a camcorder bag, this works very well as a bag for my bridge camera, a Panasonic FZ200. The camera takes up about 2/3 of the interior space, the remaining space can hold a teleconverter lens or anything else like it. The pockets provide more than enough space to carry the charger and extra batteries, memory cards, and a cleaning kit.

The actual silicone of this pan has a more crude finish and different heft. That would be alright, but the part that has me worried is the smell. It's a plastic, chemical smell that my other silicone products do not have. Since you bake on high heat with it, the smell makes me question if chemicals will be breaking down or off-gassing into my food. Ingesting toxins is something I'd rather avoid, so it's going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"We don't like it","review":"After reviewing a few different silicone muffin pans, I settled on this one for my wife. It was the non-stickability that I was going for. The long and short of it is this thing is no more nonstick than a cactus. I don't know who is giving it positive reviews.I cooked muffins this morning. Banana nut with chocolate chips. I did some in the old metal pan with nonstick spray and some in the silicone pan without spray. I even allowed the muffins in the silicone pan to cool to room temp before trying to take them out. I did use a thin knife to slice around the outside because there was NO WAY they were coming out. I guess if you use a spray in it, then it would probably be nonstick, but doesn't that defeat the point of silicone?Also annoying: It is floppy to the point that you MUST use 2 hands to put in and take out unless you have it sitting on something rigid like a cookie sheet, but I guess that's the nature of silicone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than specified but good quality","review":"Ordered this item on December 8th and recieved on December 14th with super-saver shipping.

An incredible track is Reach--the firecracker mix. Far out! The second CD is not as strong as the first but still good: it is more trance oriented. One track that annoys the heck out of me is the first one by Bedrock--it has an arpeggiation that just doesn't fit--sounds like a Reason Matrix preset. Could we be any more original?

As someone who collects/uses and researches from published football histories I have found the A-Z series invaluable. Harrison is a respected football journalist and author in the UK, and the book does cover great parts of NUFC's history, albeit in small chunks as opposed to lengthy paragraphs or full chapters. If one uses the book as it is meant then a massive amount of historical data can be gleaned from this and all the Mainstream A-Z volumes.As for there being few photographs, well, there was sufficient for this reader. After all, its a book of facts, not a photograph album. A worthwhile and thoroughly readable book, highly recommended by the British Football Press and football historians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin on Content","review":"This book is part of a series written by the author regarding various EPL teams, and it's highly superficial. Because the typical discussion for an entry is not thorough, it really provides little insight into the history of Newcastle United. There are very few photographs. Finally, the book was issued in the mid-nineties, and it provides little of relevance to the current club, e.g., you won't find anything in the book about Alan Shearer.All in all, this book was disappointing and, in my view, not worth the premium one pays in the United States for this British issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costs too much","review":"This ladder costs way too much.It appears to be identical to the old KRAUSE MultiMatic which went for half that price.

Like many books in education, this one has its own measure of empty jargon. Feathers informs the reader that reading is a \\"constructive\\" process. \\"Constructive\\" is important: true believers in the faiths of conceptualism and constructivism know that this is the only path to educational progress, even though it does not improve test scores or student understanding.

The items then did not slosh around in the large roller bag and were easy to find, when \\"living out of the suitcase\\".On the ship, we did not have drawer space as such, but had shelves in or near the closet. These cubes are PERFECT for a shelf-storage situation. Nothing falls out or gets lost.If I have any gripe with the cubes, it is that the zippers can be a little hard and sometimes stick.

Having read widely on the topic, I am convinced that many well-written, logical, thought-provoking materials are available for those interested in pursuing romance creatively -- without dating. Unfortunately, this book is not one of them. Not only was it boring and insipid, but frequently, the authors contradicted themselves and made radical claims that they could not reinforce with any solid evidence. If I had not already believed that alternatives to dating were the way to go, this book would have driven me as far as possible from the \\"not dating\\" route. Probably most disappointing to me was the lack of any quality to the writing style; someone with Michael Phillips' experience should have produced a far better product. If you are interested in alternatives to dating, check out books by Elisabeth Elliott, Joshua Harris, or Eric & Leslie Ludy -- all of which are far superior to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative ....","review":"Though this is a book for young children, at the age of 30, I found, after seeing the movie, it helped me to understand the characters, planets, weaponry, and so much more.

On this disc he combines brilliantly with the great David Zinman and the Tonhalle Orchestra of Zurich to produce the most uplifting versions of Beethoven's 3rd and 4th Piano Concertos to which these ears have ever been treated! Orchestra and soloist compliment each other in a way that defies description.Arte Nova is to be wildly complimented on this terrific production.The recording sound couldn't be better.

These had apparently broken off earlier while I was cutting some quarter round. The next thing I knew the teeth were all breaking off or bending. It was like the metal was suddenly failing!! I can only imagine that the alloy they used to make my first saw was very different from this one. At this price and with only casual use and I can't recommend this saw anymore. I bought it in November of 2010 and have kept it hanging in its plastic case when not in use.

There is no depth to the book, nothing really personal. The book is not inspiring, nor is it particularly informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy on personality, light on facts","review":"While an entertaining read, the author injects too much venom to make this a balanced story. The author repeatedly attaches motives, emotions, etc to Jobs without attribution as if he divined Jobs inner spirit. The book also seriously understates Jobs business accomplishments in terms of the growth of Apple Computers, the success of NeXT (let's remember that Jobs NeXT for $400M), and the amazing success of Pixar. Only at the end of the book, does Young casually mention that Jobs sunk $50-$60M of his personal money in Pixar before it became a success.The author's basic premise is that Jobs is a con (hence the title), and that his success was stolen from Woz, Lasseter, and the brilliant engineers at NeXT. The problem is that facts don't support his hatchet-job approach.If you are looking for an amateurish psychoanalysis of Steve Jobs, then this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Plagiarism of Earlier Books","review":"Save your money.

He's also an egomaniac and a control freak. But no one can honestly argue with either his impact on both the computer and animation industries, or his success. A real biography of Jobs, one that provides insight instead of breathless titillation, still needs to be written.Any success for this book is Jobs' self-inflicted wound. Without his much-publicized efforts to suppress the book, this clinker would already be in the remainder bins.

Instead he is apt to report the story in much the same way the national enquirer might have done it \\"Apple employee aghast!

The book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and, if you look at the chapter notes, this appears to be how it was researched.There are little irritants, such as referring to Steve Jobs as \\"Steve\\" as if he's a close friend, but the big problem is that it recounts a number of interesting incidents in Steve Jobs' career while missing the main story. And what a fantastic story that is. I hope that someone has written a decent account of Steve Jobs' life because I would like to read it.One thing is certain: \\"iCon\\" sure ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"This book is just a waste of paper. Half of it was lifted from other authors writing. It's very poorly written and is a lame attempt to cashin in on the iPod and Apples success by slamming Steve Jobs. Trees died for this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"iCon disingenuous","review":"I, too, had deep interest in this book and the blow up about it being pulled from shelves only added to the excitement. Surely the book must contain some radical exposé... something exceptionally juicy, right?But the most remarkable--and disappointing--revelation is how much material seems to be a mere retooling of other already published \\"radical\\" works. In fact, at times it's like reading right out of The Second Coming of Steve Jobs. Times, setups, scenes, and even dialogue. Uncanny?At least with other revealing works such as Second Coming, Apple Confidential, and Revolution in the Valley, the material is presented in good faith and proper sources are respected and at the least acknowledged. Seems ironic that iCon's dubious title can also apply to the presentation of the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre, inaccurate","review":"This is a decent read; uninspired, but you will get some info out of it. What I found disappointing was the book is full of technical errors about Apple computers, computers in general, Steve Jobs, and the motion picture industry. Seeing the authors make amateurish mistakes like confusing hard drives and floppy drives, mixing up the models of Apple's computer lines, misrepresenting the complexities of computer animation, and missing or misquoting some of Job's best-publicized and most important pronouncements doesn't really inspire confidence in the rest of the material. It's as if you were reading a biography of Henry Ford, and it opened with, \\"Henry Ford invented the model T and it was only available in white.\\" Even if the rest was OK you'd probably proceed with caution. A big Apple and Pixar fan, I did like the somewhat cynical take on Jobs, which I think is justified. If you can get it used, go for it, but it's not worth the cover price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biography ala Magazine Articles","review":"This book is unlike ordinary biography type of book. But a light reading, quotes many of Jobs' Keynotes, not many analytical, and yet a delightful reading during a relaxing time. Also lots of tabloid kind of life story (which might be too private) of Steve Jobs, that can be offending to Steve. I.e. Steve's body odor due to his believe that he is a vegetarian so he might not have to take a shower, Steve's releasing stress method by flushing a toilet with his foot inside, his objection to Lisa his daughter in the earlier period of his life, etc.If you want to seek strategic business information on how Steve turned aound the company (as the subtitle of the book might suggest), then this is not the right book for you. But for me, this book is informative enough for a light night time reading.The one thing that I dislike about the book is the unavailability of documentary photos of the revolutionary products (only Apple II and some PR photos of Steve)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not worth buying","review":"I would recommend not buying this book.

I bought it but i would say to you, don't. Unless you want to read a lot about Disney and Michael Eisner. That's right in a book about Apple and Jobs you would expect some storyline with Disney but the author let's his thought process veer so far off track I lost interest. Where is the more fleshe dout revelations about the dsign team at Apple or the hardware people who turned around Apple. Save your money and buy Andy Herzfeld's book -its great and real!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, weak presentation","review":"iCon dutifully recounts the various events in Jobs' life, but it somehow doesn't capture the essence of the man. The reader comes away without much sense of his personality. As anybody who has ever worked with him can attest, he has personality in spades, both for good and for bad. I remember him showing up in a business magazine's poll of the 10 worst bosses in the US. Meanwhile many have been seduced by his charm and vision. He is a rich and complex personality with patches of great light and dark, but the book presents more of an average gray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nurscameron","review":"It's hard for me to sit through an entire movie, however, Consignment the movie had me glued to the tube!

It kept track of all my appointments, my contacts, and any notes I ever needed. I always carried it in my back pocket, and it held up very well. I loved the desktop software that came with it. I'd check my e-mail, update my desktop calendar, and hotsync my Palm.When my computer died I purchased the latest and greatest desktop, only to discover that Palm won't release any drivers for a 64-bit operating system. Now, this is a useless brick to me. I'll avoid purchasing another Palm product in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Z22 Is Junk","review":"I purchased the Z22 to store some account numbers/data, etc. I have maybe used it 6 times for brief periods. It will not turn on unless I fully charge it and then it works for maybe 10 minutes. The reset button does not work. It does not hold a charge. I purposely made a paper/pencil copy of the data stored in the Z22 given its unreliability. This machine is worthless.

The battery finally quit after a little over two years of use.After checking out the Palm help forum and discovering that the Z22 is only expected to last 1-3 years I guess I should consider myself lucky.Apparently it's more expensive to repair a unit than buy a new one. Very frustrating considering I had gotten to the point where I would use it every Day. I would not recommend buying this unless you don't mind shelling out 99.00 every two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned mine...","review":"After reading the reviews I decided to purchase the Palm Z22. I had had the Palm V which I loved. When I got the Z22, I did like the size and weight, but I couldn't get it to synch. I kept getting error messages. So, I returned it.

This new Z22 hot synced with my Windows XP and Apple Powerbook at home, but it won't hot sync with my Windows 2000 computer at work.

By the second day, the screen would not respond to the stylus. There I was--stranded without my schedule and address book. The most frustrating part was trying to get help from Palm. It took 4 phone calls which involved rudeness, disconnection, incorrect transfers, and incorrect information to finally be granted the privilege to return the item at my expense. Who knows if I'll ever see it again. I am soured not just on the product but on the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased the Z22 about a year ago after my Tungsten expired. I loved the Tungsten but decided to go with the Z22 in order to save a few dollars. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this decision. Reliability is a major concern; the unit periodically stopped working properly. The screen would go blank for a few days and resetting the unit would not remedy the problem. Eventually, the problem would fix itself. Also, the touch screen failed to properly work. Finally, after less than a year, it stopped holding a charge. I just purchased a Tungsten E2 and could not be happier. Upgrade and go for the E2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wary of battery drain","review":"The Z22 has no way of disabling the automatic wakeup for calendar alarms. This may cause you to lose battery power much faster than you might expect. Especially if you do not constantly use the device for a few days and then expect to look up an address or phone number (think vacation).If you have appointments, the Z22 will turn on automatically to give you an alarm, and then repeat the process a number of times for each appointment even if you have the alarm sound turned off. This will drain your battery quickly when you think you have not been using the PDA. You can lower the time period before the automatic shutdown and reduce the number of alarm repeats, but you cannot make the display stay off and preserve your battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for something better!","review":"I got the Palm Z22 as a gift.

I updated to the Z22 because I need something to help keep me organized, with my kids schedules and my own I am always busy.This thing is perfect. I've never managed to drain the battery fully, even though I carry it with me every single day. The alarms keep me on schedule, and the contacts list is fantastic for always having that phone number I need handy.I don't need it to play music, surf the net, or make phone calls... I just need something small and easy to use to keep track of my crazy hectic schedule and this is the perfect tool for that. Its also nice to add on games (many available for free) so I can hand it to the kids when we are stuck in a waiting room, keeps them busy and me happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does What I Need It To Do","review":"I wanted a SIMPLE organizer to replace my antiquated Visor.

It is very small and lightweight so easy to keep in a scrub pocket. It has just enough memory to have 3 of the most needed references with you without being heavy, big, or again expensive.One other bonus this cheap model has over the bigger better phone type and wifi ones is that you can use it in the cardic units and ER without having to worry about it disrupting the machines or the nurses or instructor yelling at you for having a phone on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product","review":"I too was disappointed in the product. I have had the unit for 10 months and it just went blank. Will not respond to anything. Before that it would always freeze up and I too had problems with it not recognizing the stylis. I only contacted the on-line support. Their support was excellent but they suggested I contact the technical support by calling. I didn't call because my unit is out of warranty and it would cost me to repair it. I figured for the price I could by a new one. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately this product didn't last","review":"Just like the review posted on February 22nd, I got my Z22 as a Christmas present from my family.

I returned it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited PDA","review":"No matter how many times I go through the process defined by Palm Support, I cannot hot sync more than once without again deleting and reinstalling the program. It is definitely not compatible with Windows XP Pro; hot sync does work more often with XP Home. There is no support at all on the website for the Z22; in fact it is not even identified in their listing. Additionally, in sunlight, nothing on the screen is easily visible. I had another Palm (M505) with huge problems, but eventually Palm support had the courtesy to call me and send me a disk to manage these problems. Not so with the Z22!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life","review":"This was a great PDA for 9 months until it crashed.

The migration from my old data base to the Z22 went smoothly. but, the vista \\"patch\\" by second party software seems lame. I could never get it to download.

Plus the ability to download more software when the need arises, such as foreign language dictionary for travel. Only detraction so far - when the power runs out it runs out IMMEDIATELY. No warning. Easy to remedy with a charging session and refresh hot sync, but I have started to charge it every couple of weeks to avoid surprise shutdowns. My daughter in college also has this device and is very happy with it. She also formerly used the Handspring Visor.

I don't know how I got along without it. There is a place for everything so you never have to worry about missing a birthday, appointment, or losing a address or phone number. I never thought of myself as a busy person being a stay at home mom, until I started plugging in all the appointments for my kids, scrapbook meetings to attend, volunteer opportunities and birthday cards to make and mail. My life it crazy! But the Palm Z22 gave order to chaos. I would recommend purchasing the SplashShopper and SplashMoney software also. (through www.palm.com). The shopper makes the largest shopping trips a breeze and Splashmoney keeps your spending in check. The Palm Z22 was very easy to start using, and the battery life is excellent. This is a great starter pilot and it is priced right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price!","review":"The screen is smaller than the Zire 71, this was replacing.

It would not draw letters or numbers as instructed with a stylus and though it speaks of a keyboard i could find none either on the device itself or its technical manual. Its technical manual has no information only advertising. When attempting to sync with my Mac it erases all addresses and appointments. In other words it fails in every way possible.

You're better off getting a used Tungsten for $50 than drop $100 on this. The screen quality reminds me of their first color screen 10 years ago. The stylus is impossible to remove if you don't have nails or a coin handy. The plastic seems chinsy and easily breakable.

I am not that kind of person. To be honest; I think screen is too little for over 40+ years old people; difficult to get used to writing symbols even with the keypad on the touch-screen.

The Graffiti2 stylus writing system is superior to the old Graffiti. The battery in the Z22 lasts several times longer than the old one did. Plus the Z22 is about 1/2 the size of the old one. It's a superior product in just about every way. There are a couple of \\"I wish it did's\\". I wish the \\"to do\\" function was more flexible.

Palm Tech Svc was unable to fix the problem & I figured I had just received a defective one. I bought a new one. Well, guess what - 6 months later, same thing happened. I began asking around & heard that this problem seemed to be coming up a lot on this model. I called Palm to request a credit on it towards the purchase of the E2 & the best they would do is give me $40 off. This might not have been bad except that I had spent $200 for 2 defective Palms within the past year & I was willing to spend more to buy the higher end model & continue to be a customer in spite of my frustration. Not fair dealing in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for a while....","review":"My Z22 worked great for about 8 months of very, very light use. Then the screen developed problems.

Customer service (via phone) advises I can return it for repairs for $70 (I didn't pay but about 85 for it to begin with!).Were I to do it again, I would pass on any kind of Palm - due to the extremely short warranty period (90 days) and the very poor customer service (both email and by phone).

We're well into 2008 folks, catch up!!!I'm also roundly annoyed that Palm tells me how to organize my information - none of the categories in the address book can be longer than 15 characters and there may be no more than 15 categories. SORRY people, but the idea, I thought, was to allow me to organize my life MY way, not yours, and I have 31 categories - MY choice and if Outlook can handle it, Palm should, too.This is no better than the Palm it is replacing - which is only being replaced because it cannot accept the newest software.Ick."},{"rating":"1","title":"It won't start after 3 months from purchase","review":"Palm terribly disappointed me.

That's why I found the Palm Z22 to be so appealing. It's a basic PDA that should have replaced the paper organizers I've found to be such a hassle to keep updated (when your handwriting is as bad as mine, being able to enter information electronically is a true blessing). And replace them it did - for exactly 28 days. On the 29th day I pressed the power button and was greeted with a black screen. Completely dead.

The ability to store photos was the deal maker for me, a grandmother who wants lots of pictures of the grand-kids with me. I love the small size, it is easier to carry and fits many phone cases.

It has less command buttons on the front and I miss them. It has a \\"cheap\\" feel to it. The screen is significantly smaller, so small that I had to enhance the font in order to see it. It has very little memory available after initial set up. But worse of all, in less than one week, the Z22 has needed to be reset 4 times because of freezing up! This is a surprisingly poor product from the otherwise superior Palm family of products.

I was assured it would but to download from site rather than the cd. Well, many hours and even more frustrations later, we got it to work (although not all features ever totally worked.) But then it started experiencing power-on failures. If you like dealing with hard resets and rentering all your information again, this is the unit for you!! Except, now it won't come on at all. Palm offers no help and in looking at some of the handheld message boards it's clear that ours are a common and unresolvable problems. That alone is reason not to buy a z22.

Its the size of a deck of cards and it being so small is great and it has a lot of memory. Right now I have twenty-one ebooks and a dictionary and I still have plenty of memory left. I can change the font size for the ebooks so I can read it at my preference. Its colored screen too and I can save pictures on it from my computer. It doesnt have a mp3 player which is ok and I knew that when I baught it. I researched a lot for handhelds and this one seemed to fit the best and I use a lot of the programs on it that I didnt think I would use like the splash shopper and the exspense program. The reason why I only gave it four stars was because if I dont use my palm for a day or two the screen freezes and I have to push the reset button on the back.

I have never been organized, but after losing my phone and all my numbers 3 times I decided I should try it.I love my Palm. I enter everything in on the computer, then it yells at me when I'm late/forgetful/lost. I program in addresses, directions, mailbox combinations, homework assignments, and all of a sudden I have them when I want them. It also offers very cute colors for its background, and allows me to make shopping lists on the go when I remember things.I do have to say, I don't use the photo feature at all, and the game offered on this one is ...well not too fun. It does make me want to learn how to program for the Palm OS so I can make less terrible games. Basically I have yet to use 3rd party apps, and stick only with the basics on mine.But overall, the Palm Z22 is great. I love it, it helps me be (and look) responsible, and I get a lot less lost all of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"My only complaint is that I had to call customer service to figure out how to hotsynch with Outlook 2007.

Sunday morning I had it on and the screen turned black and the Palm never woke up again. It was very sad.

It is easy to use, the battery life is great and the size is small enough to not be a burden, while big enough to read the display.That said, I have found the support from Palm to be lacking. Aside from the live chat support who, while they couldn't solve the issue I had with syncing (more to come), were very helpful. Phone support, on the other hand, was rude and one service person intentionally disconnected me.If you have Windows Vista or intend to sync to Outlook 2007, plan on purchasing third-party software. Why a third party can figure out how to do what Palm can't is beyond me. But the software and updates provided by Palm aren't sufficient to allow users to sync with their Outlook calendars.Love the device, but I don't know that I will go with Palm again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"After several years of Palm usage, and needing a new one due to screen wear,(I work in a dirty outdoor environment) I too was lured by the price of the Z22.

After 2 1 hour sessions with phone support (unsuccessful) I decided to claim warranty service.(Palm needs to up the English language standards for their support personel. Half my time on the phone was asking the person to repeat what was said) I have a need for daily use of my PDA and was shocked by the new Palm plan. I have to pay $39.95 to do what's called an advance exchange, so I won't be without a PDA. Some years back, this was free if in fact the existing unit was bad!! At any rate, I initiated the advance exchange 3 days ago and today there's no record in their tracking system that it's being taken care of.

Tried several resets. It would not sync with the software that loaded on a computer. The price may have been lower, but the product was not what it should have been.

It took me two minutes to figure out that with or without the cover on, on low, medium or high, the ALARM ON THIS THING IS NEARLY INAUDIBLE. I am dissapointed - what a stupid design flaw. Or maybe the speaker on this one is broken. I don't dare send it to Palm for repairs if it is (if you don't knw why, read others experiences below).

The processor is made by a korean company called Samsung and it's very slow; for example, I synched in about 500 contacts and to find my best friend's address takes about 5 seconds. Ridiculous. The battery life is also short, although, to Palm's credit, this one uses so-called NonVolatile memory so it won't die if you completely run down the battery. The screen is very coarse and grainy and dark.

The colorful cover and illustrations on first glance enticed my 2 and 4 year olds. Upon reading the story at home, however, we found that this book was very violent - it highly suggests that Goldilocks is killed and baked in a pie and then served to the wolf's unwitting party guests. I, as an adult, found the story disturbing. If my children had fully understood the book's implications, they would have had nightmares.Maybe if your children are older, you will find this book less objectionable.

However, their height is not adjustable. This is ok for front speakers, but you want rear surround speakers to be a bit above you. So they really don't work. You would mount rear speakers above you on the wall, but don't buy these for rear speakers. Also, Wharfedale appears to have difficulties getting their screws set up appropriately since it was a serious pain to get on of the stands attached to the base."},{"rating":"1","title":"To good to be true","review":"This item is what it states.

I know this because it has the second greatest number of pages dog-eared over so I can find them again.Why do I like it? OK, it is because when I read most modern stuff, or watch modern films for that matter, I wonder what planet they are living on. It is seldom anything I recognise. When I read Bukowski, either the poems or the short stories or the novels, I recognise the real world. It is just so damn refreshing to see that there is someone being published that is not totally disconnected with reality- at least working class reality.Will you like this book? Well, skip to page 282 and read \\"the masses.\\" If you don't like it, then you ain't going to like the rest....There is another reason that I like this book. It emphacises that the old horseplayer beat the odds and actually made it into his seventies.

Corey is able to blend a lot of different types of blues together with some other genres of music. There's some reggae touches on a few songs; some \\"world music\\" touches thrown in some others. This makes the disc nice and varied and not-repetitive.The songs themselves are mostly very good and very catchy (but not catchy in a corny, lame sort of way). You may find yourself singing the chorus/humming the melody while you're sitting at your desk.There's a couple songs I wasn't too crazy about - but they were just decent - nothing on here is bad.So, overall, it's a very good cd. I found mine used and it was well worth that price. Daily Bread is a good cd in a time when music, in general, is lacking in talent.

I recently switched from mainly diapers and pullups once in a while to using pullups regularly. only to end up with the realization that she'd gotten a rash from these particular pullups. I believe this is brought on due to the lack of air flow and the fact that toddlers tend to hold in their urine longer which makes it more concentrated when they pee (concentration = Harmful) and so it irritates the skin the liner holds it on to the skin, she's not at the point where she regularly warns anyone to the fact that she's gone to the bathroom. While the concept is nice I'd say these are good for every once in a while use but definitely not 24 hour use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"I think pull ups and easy ups are just a marketing ploy by the diaper companies to get our kids wearing diapers longer. They allow parents to feel like we are doing something to potty train without really doing anything. We bought these with the wetness liner to train our daughter. Didn't work. At just past 2 she was smart enough to know that it was just another diaper. Toddlers are smarter than we give them credit for. We used the whole box and then I switched her to real underwear. She had accidents for about a week and then realized that she had to get to the potty or get soaked. That was the end of potty training. The reason I gave this product 2 stars is because I do like them for car trips and a few other instances where getting to the potty quickly is going to be a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"I bought this for myself (I'm 30) and I love it.

While he wrote only one book and is unsuccessful, she married a very successful author and is enjoying her life with her husband and children. The action in the film is sparse, but very telling. The acting is perfect. The film excells in the poetry of its language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry at its best","review":"I loved it!From the beginning through to the end I couldn't take my eyes and ears off. Right from the beginning I was drawn into this little masterpiece of poetry.

It is a study of age and change and loss; the man in particular has never recovered from the the breakup of this relationship. Poignant though it is, the man is so determinedly narcissistic that he corrodes any sympathy the viewer might otherwise have developed. Except for the luminous Emma, there's no reason to watch--poor Alan Rickman gets to do noting but look semi-conscious for an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Café Depresso!","review":"I love both Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, whose performances in this film are superb, but, quite frankly, the \\"Song of Lunch\\" gave me a nasty case of indigestion!There is nothing worse than dining at a restaurant and being anywhere near a man and woman in the midst of a tiff, especially when he is embarrassing her by drinking too much wine. Precisely because Thompson and Rickman are so skilled at their art, I felt as if I had been thrust into the midst of these ex-lovers' problems (mostly his, actually; she had the good sense to leave him long ago for another man whom she married happily). I wanted to pay the bill and leave--or turn off the telly--especially when he began guzzling that second bottle of wine.Although I was initially willing to accept the literary device of poetry, which Rickman delivers peerlessly in voice-over, after a while, it seemed merely pretentious and self-indulgent.I recommend \\"The Song of Lunch\\" only with a strong antacid chaser!"},{"rating":"1","title":"music for idiots","review":"Sure this has got a beat, the same beat of all gangsta rap.

Here, Shaun and the rest of his flock have amusing adventures across their farm (and beyond). The sheep dog helps, and the farmer remains oddly oblivious - something sure to appeal to kids who like the idea of outsmarting the grownups.This DVD is intended for a young audience. Plots are simple, characters are clear and enjoyable, and real aggression is conspicuous by its absence. Also, the opening menu has an interesting feature: it doesn't require a click to go ahead, ideal for kids who haven't mastered the remote.

I won't spoil it for those of you who will read the book. But what I want to know about a book before reading it is this: Is it good, is it clean, will I enjoy it?

Did the Catholicism of Luther's day teach the equivalent of the Judaism of Paul's day? Butz argues that early Protestant reformers did indeed misunderstand the Judaism of the time of Jesus. So Butz argues that to truly understand the Judaism of the time of Jesus is to understand the way it was understood by James, the brother of Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mac's Review","review":"I've been aware and interested in the scholarship surrounding Yeshua/Jesus and early christianity for several decades, but wasn't up on his brother, James.

Everything from Sabbaths (Saturday) To the seven Holy Days. Nor did they believe the soul of a person goes to Heaven or Hell, nether a trinity. Anyways this book among others shows much proof that the early Christians were indeed Judaism, and nothing more. They accept the Messiah for the most part as the King and high priest.

He discusses the paramount importance of James the brother of Jesus. He clearly views Paul as at odds with the early Church before 63 CE (AD). Most of the core of Eisenman's \\"James...\\" is in this book, but with < 20% the number of pages. The last chapter falters a bit with romantic dreams.

It's something done a lot in Japanese manga, I forgot the name, but it's equivalent to using the same actor in different fictions, like Harrison Ford going from Han Solo to Indiana Jones. The pink haired gun bunny is the central character, a backup thug is now a tech guy, a crime boss is now the head of the agency... Oh, and even minor characters have their parts. One girl who showed up for what, 3 seconds?, as a sicko's rape victim in \\"Kite\\" is now the 'shy girl learning to be tough' growth story sidekick.And, yeah, it's a \\"TV Series\\" to get some bucks.

I recommend the FTGU because it is what the Royal Canadian Air Cadets train from during ground school."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"this is the typical teenage love story with a twist, it turn out that she actually gets what she asked for and it crashes and burns. well it was intirely too predictable for my liking. by reading the back cover you could basically know all you need to know. it did suck you in, but i dont know it just wastnt juicy enough with not enough unexpected surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thwonk","review":"I really liked this book. It was a good topic for a teenage girl. Even the book did not have a realistic plot every teenager at one time or another has wanted a little being whether it be a cupid or a genie to make there wishes come true. This book also goes to show you that no matter how bad you want love if you force yourself into it the results may not always be picture perfect. Because when a cupid pops into her life she has to make choices about her future but does not listen to what the cupid has to say. When she makes her wish not all the she wants happens. She thinks she has just gotten a dream date with the most popular guy in school but little does she know what a disaster the next few months will be. After things get out of hand she isnt really sure what she wants to do. All she knows she wants is the little cupid back. Will the cupid come back? Will her life take a turn for the better? Will her wish be undone? You have to read it to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thwonk","review":"This is a very cute book. I recommend it for anyone who has had that one crush who you think doesn't even know you exist. That's how it is for A.J. Now don't we wish we all had a little cupid of our own. The thing I didn't like about this book was how AJ found love then turned on it. This book takes a lot of time and understanding to read, I suggest if you don't like to read and just decided to read this book because it was the only one left on the shelf, find something new because this book may not be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Irritating","review":"I read Hope Was Here (also by Joan Bauer) and thought it was a well written, sweet book. This wasn't the case with Thwonk. The character, A.J was irritating and got on my nerves from the start. The way she was willing to sacrifice anything to get Peter was pathetic. I read on though, trying to find anything good about this book. I didn't.A.J being a photographer seemed like a filler to add more depth to the character, like something she tacked on to make her seem \\"smart\\" and not just some lovesick, foolish girl. Once again it didn't work. There was no character depth and it had a sappy, predictable ending. I'd like to see what had happened if she was stuck with him, not the supposed \\"new life\\" she has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wishes can help and hurt!","review":"Thwonk by Joan Bauer is a good book for teens who enjoy reading about fantasies in romances. A. J. is a teen photographer who has enough talent to get into top art schools, but she is also interested in Peter Terris, a popular high school guy. She stumbles upon a cupid named Johnathan. He helps her through obstacles and gives her one wish. She wishes that Peter would fall in love with her. Johnathan gives her the wish and now Peter is obsessed with her. A. J. is about ready to give up her wish and now Johnathan is gone. She does not know what to do. Joan Bauer is a writer who understands what teens go through. I give this book five stars because I could connect with the character, A. J., and the situations that she goes through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I liked Joan Bauer's other books (Squashed and Best Foot Forward), but Thwonk was no where near as funny or organized as her other novels. The main character, \\"AJ McCreary\\" was incredibly useless and annoying. All she does throughout the book is complain about how horrible her life is, and she always ignores other people's advice when they try to help her. At the end of the book, AJ doesn't change. The more I read the more annoyed I became. Overall, Thwonk is not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOARDING SCHOOL","review":"As a daughter of one who attended this very school prior to the author, it brings to light how schooling still affects how my father deals with situations (he is now in his 80s).As an educator, this chapter of Indian Schools is not taught as part of history class -- not for the children or at the university for upcoming teachers. It should be mandatory reading for anyone searching for historical educational processes/pedagogy.J.Montour, educator"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old, Same Old","review":"I've read all of CQY's vampire stories and this is the last one for me. I loved the first few books, enjoyed the middle few, got heartily sick of the last 2 and this one I didn't even finish. Don't need to; I know how it ends. She is following the same basic formula for every book and while it was a good formula, it's time for a change! Hate to echo what's already been said here, but I'm sick of the same types of characters, the same dialog (SG and Roger seem to have the same bantering conversation in every book!), the same plot. CQY is a good writer and should not be wasting her time with this stuff. She should use her talents to explore new territory and techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"So that's what happens","review":"At last I know what happens to a mosquito that bites the Count. I thought it just went on and on doing the same thing forever, but became harder to swat, being stronger and faster.Seriously, I'm under the spell again of Ms. Yarbro's words and character. The only problem I have is that just about everyone in the religious life is in it for greed or power, and more time is spent on one-upmanship by formality or insinuation than true piety. No one becomes a bishop or a simple nun for love of goodness. The only goodness usually found in the novels are that of the Saint himself who always gets victimized himself for showing humanity. Thanking a slave for service was the height of suspicious behavior. Could everyone have been that bad?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review Redux","review":"Another repeat since the original appears to have gotten lost. Rakoczy de Sanctus Germanius finds himself in Charlemagne's Gaul (800 C.E.. As always he finds himself suspected by the ambitious of both the Church and the Court. As always, Chelsea Quinn Yarboro's scholarship is impeccable and her style is eminently readable. A wonderful alternative to Laurel Hamilton's vampire/other novels. This can be read by all generations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story, different time period.","review":"I used to love Yarbro's St. Germain books. I devoured the first 8 or so. But after a while, I got tired of the perpetually persecuted vampire, who gets himself involved with a damsel in distress while fighting religious authority amid political upheaval.Although I tend to agree with what seems to be Yarbro's negative opinion of religion, this particular book -- in which stigmata is presented as a real phenomenon, without explanation -- was the final straw. It baffles me how one can condemn religion while at the same time showcasing one of its biggest frauds as being a real occurrence.As much as I love the historical detail she puts into her work, I wish Yarbro would write St. Germain in the present day. But then, her formula (see above) wouldn't work quite so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windowbox azalea baskets","review":"I ordered two azalea baskets as gifts. They arrived withoug gift cards, and were DEAD within two days. The instructions stated they could be plantedoutdoors, but they were completely brown and dried up.

Never again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intro Book For C++ and early game concepts","review":"Simply put, a very good intro to C++. I had some programmming experience with Basic, C#, and javaScript a long time ago and the 'beginner' in the title caught my eye. I was terrfied of pointers and such but this book guides you through step by step. Not super easy but still workable. The term \\"Gaming\\" is a little misleading if you immediately think 3D graphics but the text concepts are all applicable. Only one problem I encountered was the need to use cin.get()and cin.ignore() in order for some programs to work properly when writing a console application. Can't wait for an advanced book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good logic for entry level C++","review":"Book has some neat programming logic for coders starting out in C++. Demonstrates some console based AI like guess a number, boolean logic, game loops, the switch, pointers. Last two chapters introduce OOD. I liked it, fun , keeps your interest. Would buy the next book in series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice beginning, but terrible end","review":"The book is ok, but has many shortcomings. Chapters 5, 9 and 10 do not have enough examples. Chapter 9 and 10 are the worst, you might as well rip these chapters out of the book. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent C++ Intro Book","review":"I've been a programmer (vb, asp, perl) for years and have always wanted to get into the higher leveled language of C++ but could never find a book that I enjoyed that could teach me the basics. This book was my savior and the perfect intro to C++, better than any other book I've been able to find.The title is misleading because it's gaming aspect is just for reference. Each program is given a background in a game environment just so the problem at hand makes sense.This book teaches good practice, preplanning and it's code examples and explanations are excellent and thorough without getting too involved in everything. Read a chapter, go back and do the examples and it all starts to make sense, I'd recommend this book as a great starting point to anyone that wants to learn C++."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent beginner's book","review":"This book does an excellent job of teaching the basic and not-so-basic fundamentals of C++ in a game programming context (which makes all the difference). The lessons are clear and well organized and the author explains concepts extremely well IMO. There are numerous examples in the book that illustrate the concepts perfectly, and larger programs that tie everything together. This book is intended for those with no programming skills but if you know the basics and are a little rusty, this book's perspective could be very beneficial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction to C++","review":"This is a reasonable introduction to C++ and lays a lot of ground work for moving into more complicated aspects of game programming. What it doesn't do is teach you anything about displaying graphics: all of the programing is text only DOS-type games. You will need to learn win32 API or some other image display stuff before writhing even simple graphic programs.That said, I found the game-oriented presentation to be helpful. It makes the various functions a lot easier to understand when they are presented in a familiar context (gaming), with practical uses. A failing of many other programming books is that they take a rather abstract approach, leaving you unsure what you would ever use something for."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is for the total Noobs out there.","review":"If you have a tiny bit of programming experience, this book I would not recommend. Having a year of C++ under my belt, I didn't learn anything new (technical or logical thinking). But for the total clueless person who is interested in game programming, this could be a nice way to ease in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh...Not so good","review":"The book is pretty crappy...its written is a very confusing manner and the code doesn't even work half the time...its completly unacceptable to have a PROGRAMMING BOOK with code thats flawed in such a huge manner, this is completly insane, it will teach you somethings...if you tweak all the code and get it to work,The simple fact is that you can get this information in an easier to read and free formate online, just google C++ tutorials, search Digg, search anything the info in this book is \\"Eh\\" at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginning C++ Programming -- With game examples","review":"As mentioned earlier, this book is more like an introduction to c++ than it is an introduction to game programmnig for people already knowing c++.I was so very very disapointed, when I got this book.I had the same interpretation of the title as Aaron F. Young (earlier review).If you consider bying this book be careful to read other reviews, so you know that what you get is a book on c++ with game examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet To Come...","review":"While I am happy to see a release of 'new' Robyn material available in the U.S., this EP can only be a predecessor to a hopefully planned full album (Which will include the Kleerup produced \\"With Every Heartbeat\\") or rerelease of 2005's ROBYN.

(2 Stars)","review":"Bottom line: There is no such thing as a Best of Snoop Dogg CD when tracks like Gin & Juice, Murder Was the Case, and Who Am I? (to name only a few) are OMITTED. The previous two reviews for this so-called greatest hits CD are on-point; try to imagine a Nas greatest hits CD without any Illmatic tracks. Try to imagine there being a Wu-Tang Clan greatest hits CD without any tracks from Enter The Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers. Now, try and explain why there IS actually a Best of Snoop Dogg CD with no tracks from Doggystyle, or even Tha Doggfather.Sure, there are some decent tracks here, but not including any tracks from the Death Row era is inexcusable. This compilation is an insult to Snoop's oldest fans and should never have seen the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"somebody was lazy with this one","review":"obviously this is just a collection put together quickly. think of all the best of snoop albums death row already put out.

Who does Snoop think he is fooling? Any mediocre fan (such as myself) can flip this CD around and realize that there's not ONE of his hits on here. This is like a B-Sides album. Just because rappers conveniantly recycle old rhymes as titles for less popular songs (\\"Still A G Thang,\\" \\"Gin and Juice 2,\\" What's My Name\\") doesn't mean they can fool the public. I mean none of these songs were slammin' on the radio and they aren't the \\"best\\" of anyone's work, not even the guest rappers. What a joke.

I have seen bad stuff in my life, but this tops the cake. They left out bunch of songs that were on \\"The Chronic\\", \\"Doggystyles\\" and even \\"R&G: Rhythm and Gangsta\\". Those songs definitely would have made this greatest album sell better. Don't get me wrong, the songs that are on this album are good, but these songs were not the reason that got him started and famous.

The plot is better than the usual martial arts movie, and this movie tries hard to be more than a kick-flick (the recovering alcoholic subplot comes to mind) but the overall story was not compelling.This movie is worth renting for Rothrock's martial arts skills, but it is not worth owning unless you can find it in the bargain bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Item Does NOT Last!","review":"This is NOT a 'heavy duty' product.

The author introduces so many different characters and side stories that it is not only hard to follow and maintain interest, but also very, very boring through many sequences. I almost stopped reading it before finishing the book several times, but decided to skim through it for the better parts and for the ending. BTW, the ending was pretty droll and predictable.

I saw them at Walgreens just yesterday with a different brand. It's junk. Pure junk. I picked one up at Hastings a few months ago. The software didn't work and the manufacturer does not have a website at all. I found an older version of the software on driverguide.com and was able to get that to work. However, within a few days, the camera ceased to operate.Just to quantify this review, I should mention that I've been using computers my whole life and have made it my career for the past 10 years. I know my way around software and operating systems. The software that comes with these cameras is garbage.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly what you'd expect--Absolutely awful.","review":"Sub-par, even taking in the fact that it's a fifteen-dollar VGA camera. The only feature that worked with any regularity was the webcam, as the custom (and difficult to install) software for the camera installs it as a regular Windows capture device, and uses a proprietary program to extract pictures taken. The modes were confusing, the pictures were always dark, and you never truly know if you've taken a picture (it beeps either way). I thought I'd use it to take pictures for Craigslist listings (and for those you don't need high quality), but the pictures weren't good enough for even that. As for the fact that it's a semi-useful webcam--well, better webcams can be had for the same price. Not recommended for anyone. Note: Very difficult to find the driver for Windows Vista, and camera software mostly does NOT work, even with the driver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.

There is much about humanity in the pages of this august work, but to grasp it all, I fear one would have to read it twice, no, three times and then again. Still, not to have read it at least once would be to miss one of the greatest works of fiction, of morality, of insanity, of death and life and none of it diminished by time, none of it constrained by time. The actual moment in history for the story is of no real consequence, no imperative; it is but a backdrop. Read this book if you can, if you have the time, and if you do not have the time, make it! You will learn how to love, how to fear, how to be courageous, how to die, but of greatest importance, you will learn how to live! Rock on LT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a good translation","review":"I have tried reading \\"War and peace\\" three times in my life and have failed to get past the first two hundred pages each time. The reason, I believe, is that there is not a single inspired translation available in English. I have tried the three main translations and they all are wooden affairs. Episodes that should be moving are pedestrian. The opening soiree should be full of sly description that borders on the contemptuous and humorous. Instead, I never was able to forget that I was reading to what amounted to no more than a servicable translation lacking in vitality."},{"rating":"1","title":"War and Peace is boring","review":"I was forced to read this book for a World History class in order to write a thesis. The book contains over 1000 characters and no real main characters, which is quite confusing. I can't beleive i actually spent thousands of hours reading the thousand-page book with a 200 page epilogue. Tolstoy just wants to write an imaginary history of the years 1805-1820 and express his hatred toward Napeloen since his father fought against him. Actaully, i would give this book a zero because i wasted all my time reading it and still did not get info to write a thesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is exactly what I was hoping it would not be:","review":"Absolutely boring. The characters are pathetic, not unrealistic, mind you , but just weak and puny in the way they think and live. Most of them are of the aristocratic class with large amounts of money, throwing parties and the like to impress one another. I am sure Bret Easton Ellis would have a field day with the social elite that inhabit War and Peace, for they are the most shallow, self-destructive people of that time. I am not one to be concerned with the petty personal lives of others, like the silly little dramas and problems people cause themselves, and that is exactly what Tolstoy's characters do. It all boils down to this: If you like watching people swoon over and fight one another while the more important issues , like defending one's country, are placed as a backdrop for their pathetic lives, than this is the book for you. I gladly threw it away after reading only 500 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL DULL DULL DULL DULL DULL","review":"I subscribed to some of the values in this book (as of three days ago actually).

Tolstoy's characters alas just accept it wih a detestable resignation and comtemptable passivity."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't be intimidated","review":"Don't be frightened off by the sheer heft of master Russian writer Leo Tolstoy's classic novel. Enter its pages to find many delights here. Like all good novelists, Tolstoy was a great psychologist and here are insights aplenty into the human condition. Set against the background of Napoleonic wartime, here is a romantic love story, an action/adventure tale, a probing look into the thought and motives of a vast cast of characters.You probably didn't read this high school or college, as instructors hesitate to assign such a lengthy work. Read it now!You may find Tolstoy's classic to be much more rewarding reading than whatever currently lies on your bedside table."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big book of big ideas","review":"Tolstoy's epic novel is a suprisingly quick 1400 pgs. It takes a bit of determination to get through the first sections of the book, as the number of characters grows faster than many readers can remember. The effort, however, is well rewarded.The book consists of several essential themes interwoven into a single story. It is a heroic epic, a romance, a spiritual quest, and a treatise on history. It succeeds on all accounts, leaving the reader with deep insights into the nature of love and religion, the causes of the Napoleonic wars, and the role of heroes in history.The large time investment in this novel is justified by what the reader takes away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"This is a great book to read.

This is the ultimate question of War and Peace. The growth of the characters is amazing. Totally recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS long, but well worth it.","review":"Being one of the longest books I have ever read, this is also one of the best. Tolstoy's characterization is very good. His usage of alternating chapters of war and peace was very effective in making each seem the polar opposite of the other. Of course, he also ties things together that show how each front affects the other. If you have the time and patience and a love for classical literature, this book is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing can touch it.","review":"War and Peace is the greatest novel of all time, and Tolstoy the greatest author. Period!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An aggravated descent into boredom","review":"Let me start by acknowledging that Leo Tolstoy is often regarded as one of the preeminent authors of all time. Let me follow that with the acknowledgement that many consider \\"War and Peace\\" to be the greatest triumph in human literature.Let me follow that by saying that I don't get it.This book is horribly boring. While other lengthy works, like Les Miserables, excite and build intrigue, War and Peace does nothing of the sort. It ambles on, like a wounded victim hoping to be put out of its misery. After a thousand pages, that is exactly what I did. I threw the book clear across the room in disgust with what was a lethargic, uninteresting, and needlessly convoluted tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"You will need a scorecard to keep track of the characters in this one. There must be hundreds, if not thousands. None of them were interesting enough to bother with and I quit the book after three hundred pages of being bored out of my mind. Every few pages, I had to try to remember which character was which as there were so many and many of them were indistinguishable from each other. Tolstoy writes pretty flat prose. It never soars or goes anywhere. He just describes and reports, as boringly as possible. This type of literature is not going to hold an audience anymore. So many people have the opportunity to live interesting lives nowadays why would they stop to read a novel of this length about a bunch of fictional charaters when they could be spending the time actually LIVING their own lives? It was a real drag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rewarding","review":"I read War and Peace as an experiment to see if I could do it. I also read it over the course of nearly eight months. Being a slow reader is a detriment in some respects, however it usually improves my comprehension. War and Peace was tough to break in terms of keeping characters, family names, and surnames straight, however once that was accomplished, the novel was very understandable. I was rewarded in the reading by an understanding of the setting of Russia, and it's struggle at the hands of Bonaparte. I found this whole aspect and background of the novel intriguing and interesting. The character subplots took a back seat to the setting of the novel in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"War and Peace is a great masterpiece","review":"War and Peace is a beautiful book written about Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Leo Tolstoy's mastery of language is shown as he ties the lives of five Russian families into the history of the war. This book is written in a way that allows the reader to be comfortable.

War and Peace is a must have for the library of any avid reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm","review":"Im 11, thatas probably why i really dont like the book, but my point made is, my mom grounded me and made me read war and peace, and it was the worst punistment i have ever been through, i asked my family to read a page of it, and they all fell asleep, sorry to all the people who like it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfectly isosceles novel","review":"Through Tolstoy's mastery of device, confutation, and liminality, we are graced in this age with easily available wisdom from a great sage of the \\"Pleh\\" era.

A lot of characters. I guess they consider it a \\"classic\\", one of the reasons you're expected to read it. However I must say Dostoyevsky and Dickens are more to my taste and imo more interesting.

I now have to find a better quality product with different measurements, meaning a whole lot of hassle and more money on top of the money I wasted on the PetSafe dog door. This door may be ideal if located in an enclosed area whith very little or no breeze and you have a dog undetermined to break in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"The flap on this pet door lasted exactly one week before it tore off. The plastic flap has small holes across its top, through which metal screws secure it to the metal frame. They do not put grommets around the small holes, so the plastic ripped off within one week. We have two dogs, so we bought the \\"heavy duty\\" model for multiple dogs (it has a metal frame, rather than a plastic frame). Both of our dogs are older, so it's not as though they're particularly hard on the flap. Conveniently, the manufacturer embeds the replacement part number in the plastic flap, so you can easily order another. If you choose to buy this door, you might as well get 51 extra flaps, one for each week of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I bought this door from one of the big box stores because it was the only one I could find and it was priced right. I move a lot so I have a lot of experience with installing dog doors. The installation for this door is \\"Average\\" it's going to take some time but no major design flaws in my book. However, this is a weak door and you get what you pay for. The slightest breeze and the door would open 3-4 inches, letting heat, cold and unwanted critters to come as they please. The magnets are very weak and even if i manually \\"shut\\" the door it would open with the wind or when my dog used it. I think this would be a fine door on a dog house or maybe even for a garage or barn but I would not recommend it for entrance into a home.

The RuffWeather one was plastic, but had two flaps and a nice gasket seal around the edge which allowed to be virtually draft free even with the howling winds we get here in Colorado. The PetSafe brand however has no gasket, and the flap does not fit the hole precisely which allows a lot of draft to flow through. I would not recommend this door to anyone unless it is being used to go from one insulated area of the house to the other.

Cheaply made, flimsy, and not very smooth with rotation. I didn't need super quality for this application, but the rotation would constantly hang up. A turntable that doesn't turn well !!!

Wrong movie and not even a legitimate copy. Close but no cigar."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD awful, movie probably good.","review":"I had the same problem as someone else who said that the disc would skip and pause and play at random, and when trying to access special features it would make a low beeping noise and just shut off.The part of the movie I did see was okay, it's just too bad that it started acting up when it was about to get really good. If the movie alone is available possibly not presented by the Wu-Tang Clan or Ground Zero, I'd give it a go."},{"rating":"1","title":"KILL GROUND ZERO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is for products only!

And when youupload the extras, these squares would appear out of nowhere andthe DVD will stop playing! So word to the wise, don't get theGround Zero version copy, not unless you're one of those peoplewho are easily amused by train wreck products!The movie itself is like Miricle Fighters and Taoism Drunkard!Alot of weird crap with some nifty kung fu and Cantonese humor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"and im being generous with the 2","review":"This movie is horrible, not at all what the box sets it out to be, i was mad as hell when i got done watching this film.

The only isssue I had was the sizing. I normally wear an 8.5 or 9 D width. i ordered the 9 D after measuring my size on the Allen Edmonds size chart. The length seemed to be OK, but the width was too narrow. I should have ordered an E width. I sent them back. Too bad the price has gone up. Amazon you should do exchanges."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshingly tasty treat!!","review":"I was quite impressed by many of the poems.

I was duped to believe that this product would come in a concentrated form. The box only contained 12 bottles of diluted liquid cleaner not fit to be further diluted as the product label instructed. Not worth your hard earned money. I bought this product because Amazon had up to this point sold me quality items, unfortunately this item broke the streak."},{"rating":"1","title":"unconvincing stories","review":"A series of short stories, main character being a feng shui master doing his work around Asia and solving mysteries along the way. But actually it's nothing to do with feng shui at all - it's just the setting of the story that the main character is a feng shui man. Being a HK Chinese, having heard from the media from time to time on feng shui stuff, I don't quite understand the feng shui bit described in the bk. I think the writer just want to baffle Western readers.Plus unconvincing stories (sorry for the spoiler here)-- old man disguised as an old lady but not spotted even being talked to face-to-face? A scam branch being opened (in S'pore!) in the name of a well-est'd bank but the victim knows nothing? A publisher stealing template from a magazine, printing & selling for profits at the magazine's expense? i can't think of anything more unconvincing, really...i was attracted by the title and planned to buy the other works of Vittachi.

I really enjoyed the book. It has the right amount of information about Feng Shui without sounding like a textbook. It has mystery and humor and each story is short enough to read in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact based, unbiased, and informative","review":"This book serves its purpose well. The author presents the history and culture of the Middle East by laying out the facts, and weaving in editorial comments to enhance understanding of the facts. Reading this book will allow anyone to have a basic, but strong understanding of the region. I disagree strongly that this book is biased; quite to the contrary, it is one of the few English language books about the Middle East that presents the facts and the the persepctive of all sides truly evenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Recommendations!","review":"We tried a number of recommended places and all were great. The recommended dishes were also great. A must have if you love to eat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is not Helpful to the Average Tourist","review":"The author seems to know what she is talking about in Rome which is the lagest part of the book. Her recommendations in Florence and Venice seem to be based mostly on hearsay.Consider this: The book is 274 pages long. The glossary of terms and bibliograpy account for 72 pages. The book does review trattorias but it also reviews expensive restaurants, pizzerias,gelaterias, wine bars , shops that sell wine and serve light lunches, and wine shops that offer tastings and canapes. There is a lot of detail im this book, but after reading it I decided it was of little practical use to me since I am an ordinary tourist looking for a good place to eat near the attractions I will be visiting on this my third trip to Rome (second to Florence and Venice). Many of the recommendations are clustered in neighborhoods that are somewhat removed. The book is not going on my trip with me... The purchase price was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I haven't eaten here but...\\"","review":"\\"...I've looked through the window\\" was the first sentence I read when looking though the Florence section. I'm sorry, but looking through the window doesn't exactly qualify one to write a review of their food. I've looked through the windows of loads of restaurants I haven't eaten in - can I publish a book too? All in all this book was a disappointment, at least for the Florence section. I see from other reviews that she is more familiar with Rome, so perhaps this book would be worth buying for that instead. I recommend Sandra Gustafson's \\"Cheap Eats in Italy\\" instead. The title is misleading (although you can eat cheaply if you follow her advice on what to order) and is full of wonderful recommendations from simple tripe stalls to fancy restaurants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among My Favorite Recordings","review":"These are rich, impassioned interpretations.I am very particular about what Ilisten to, and I feel no need to ownany other recordings of these worksbecause of the high quality of these performances.The sound quality is also very good.Buy both volumes like I did !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bunch of Freeware","review":"After playing one of the games for a little while, you get messages constantly popping up saying \\"If you want to continue playing, send money to ...\\".

This should be clearly marked on the packaging and in all descriptions. I was going to say \\"you get what you pay for,\\" but there are some great freeware apps out there for Palm. Search the 'Net!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I was very disappointed in this product! Most were shareware games that you would eventually have to purchase. Of the 100 \\"Great Games\\" I actually used less than a half dozen. Why pay for a procuct like this when you can go to a web site like ZD Net and download them for free. This was a real waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Great Ways to Lose Your Money","review":"For those of you who are old enough, remember the video game Pong? It was much more fun that this CD. If you want good quality games that are ready to go and have minimal aggravation to load, then don't buy this item. The potential 'good' ones on this CD require more money to be coughed up to activate fully. And the games that don't fit this category would'nt keep a 3yr old entertained. There's just something distasteful about charging for a product that instantly will cost you more money just to get it working fully. So don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked that I Passed","review":"After being out of school for 15 years, I had a lot of work to prepare for the FE / EIT exam. I worked nearly every problem in this book over a 5 month period and didn't really have time to look at other books. I passed the Florida exam so it certainly helped.My biggest complaint about this Manual is that it doesn't reference the equations found in the NCEES handbook. As you know, the NCEES handbook is the only reference material allowed during the exam. To solve the problems you have to rely on equations presented at the beginning of the chapter. These equations are not always found in the NCEES so it gets confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very in Depth","review":"Covers more than enough to pass the FE. It's designed more for the general exam. If your looking for a specific afternoon portion look to your college notes. Esp. if you're not a ME or Civil.If you know how to work the problems in this book the FE will be a breeze. Just remember to also familiarize yourself with the FE formula book for quick reference during the exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new edition of a classic FE prep manual","review":"This book is a new edition of a long-running FE preparation manual. It covers all the materials in the FE morning exam, and the questions in the book are very similar to the real FE test. If you feel that your background in the basic math/physics/engineering science areas are getting rusty, then this is the book to go for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great before and after test reference","review":"I found the book to be very complete and helpful. The example and practice problems were more than adequate to prepare me for the exam. Most often, the practice problems were much more difficult than the actual test problems.I studied for three weeks prior to the exam, and I have no doubts that I passed. This book was an invaluable resource during my preparation."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS will help you with your FE exam","review":"When i ordered this product, I only had approximately 2 weeks to study, yes that was a bad choice, I was studying some other things, but felt that I need more depth in a lot of topics on FE Exam. So I ordered this book and crammed this book for 2 weeks. I learned so much from this book in 2 weeks than I ever did when studying for the FE exam for like 3 months. IT really shows great examples and covers almost everything on the FE exam. I would highly suggest this for anyone who wants to have a full depth study guide on the FE exam. You will learn a lot from this book even if you didn't really learn in your class =p!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for preparation","review":"This is a great book for preparing for the General portion of the FE/EIT exam. I highly recommend it. Make sure you give yourself enough time to work through the entire book. It's better to over-prepare for this test, because after all, if you are an engineer, then these are things you should know. An iteration of problem solving and reading with this book, and then a review of the things you don't feel that confident about should be enough to guarantee a passing score. Also, you'll want to download a free version of the NCEES Reference Guide, and solve the problems while using that as your only reference. The ability to easily wade through that reference guide will make everything go much smoother while taking the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I bought this book and used it everyday to study for the FE. I had to break the super large book down into workable sections. I did not pass the exam! Only saw a couple of familiar questions that were similar. I would ask for a refund but since the book is no longer in one piece I'm not sure if a refund is applicable.

The price dropped and I called amazon and the lady say they could do nothing about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good review book","review":"Very comprehensive review manual. Mostly consists of sample problems with solutions. If you have never studied some of the subjects, you will need other reference material than just this manual to understand them. It's a good book, but just don't expect it to be the only reference that you will need to prepare for the FE exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"FE Manual Review","review":"I have gone through about half the book so far in my attemp to study for the FE exam. The book is very good in its layout. It follows the FE guide book pretty well also. The information in most of the chapters is adequate to answer the sample problems. Although there are areas that assume that you know some basic formulas. It is suggested that you get out your college books for reference. Manipulating and transposing of formulas is used on a regular basis also. You will scratch your head wandering where they got the formulas! All in all it is a very good book and should give you the knowledge to pass the exam. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works, i passed after 5 years out of school","review":"It works, i passed after 5 years out of school. Some subjects are reviewed and explained better than others, but i followed the study schedule taking weekends off and I passed.

I've only been out of college for 6 months, but I still found this book to be confusing and unhelpful. Its basically only good for practice problems because the review sections are WORTHLESS.

I haven't tried any other book to compare it to, but there has got to be something better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DC meets D&D","review":"I don't know, maybe Ed Hannigan played a lot of Dungeons & Dragons in his childhood. But League of Justice, one of the Elseworlds line of DC stories, definitely has its root in a host D&D; and early 1980s pulp fantasy novels.Four normal kids -- three upstanding young camp counselors and a ne'er-do-well thief and junkie -- are inexplicably summoned to another world where knights and sorcerers and monsters fight for supremacy. After being rescued in the forest by a Jack o' the Green variation on Green Arrow and his mystical Bird Lady, the four are forced to set out and seek various heroes -- the Batmancer, the Amazon Princess, the Hawk Lord and others -- to fight the evil Sovereign (Superman) in a bid to save the kingdom.Hannigan, working with Dick Giordano, supplies the art, which is good, solid stuff.

But once you hear the Fudge disemboweling Beethoven's \\"Moonlight Sonata\\" you'll be on the floor in stitches.

And \\"The Beat Goes On\\" is downright unlistenable tripe. If you are a Fudge completist (are there any such people?) buy this if you must but do not under any circumstance expect to hear anything remotely good or interesting. This was an insult to the intelligence when it was released and today is downright laughable.

The answer was \\"Phase 2: The Beat Goes On\\" by Vanilla Fudge. It's entry number 7 on the track list above, and I believe the first song on the second side of the album I bought.

It was almost anti-commercial, with nothing on it that could receive air play.

The drummer was good, the lead guitar player was bad.The driving power of the band instruments, especially the lead guitar, was completely washed out. The orchestra added nothing. It is the worst concert DVD I have ever seen. I felt sorry for the people who went to the live concert.

I was riveted to the ingenius plot from the start and could not put his movie down! The writers appear to be of a good calibre for a low budget picture and as a result I was glued to my seat to the very end! A lot of indy DVDs put a nice picture on their covers and claim to have an interesting premise but fail to deliver but this one is the real deal- no smoke and mirrors or bad acting here despite the fact that these actors are relatively unknowns!

Set in the 1960s, this is the story of a young girl, the daughter of a small Ontario town's solitary Chinese family, over the course of a summer.Told through Su-Jen's eyes, the hard life behind the scenes at the Dragon Café unfolds. Su-Jen's elderly father and beautiful young mother are unhappy in their marriage. Su-Jen's mother is miserable in this new small town.Su-Jen is rapidly adapting to life in Canada and goes through all the ups and downs of a typical 1960s childhood. She develops a friendship with Charlotte, a spirited girl who behaves in a way that is older than her years. There is also tragedy, foreshadowed, yet still a shock when it finally occurs.The first and last paragraphs of Midnight at the Dragon Café are poignant and are Su-Jen's reflections on a fate she thinks should have been hers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The discovery of the North Pole, the record set straight.","review":"Wally Herbert has in this compelling and well researched dissertation, taken the claims of Robert E. Peary, and subjected them to a historical and geograhical judgement. It is the opinion of Mr. Herbert, that Peary never reached the pole. I feel that Mr. Herbert came to this conclusion not out of any vindictiveness, but rather to set the historical record straight. The book pays great respect to the bravery, craft and intelligence of Peary. Mr. Herbert is an explorer and expert navigator, and his knowledge of the Polar regions allows him to pass an objective opinion on this matter. The text is concise and also inspiring to a receptive mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Noose\\" is on this author!","review":"Nonsense!

Anyone who can do the math knows that that was a long time ago and I have to admit that Winwood music was stapled in my synapses along with my perhaps less \\"responsible\\" days. Today, I believe that I can judge a suite of music with a bit more context than those younger, headier days. But, to my astonishment, I was \\"blown-away\\" by this resurrection of Winwood artistry. A syncopated blend of his most creative process, injected with blatantly latin/caribbean overtones simply left me breathless.

If you are interested in old price lists, then this is your book. If you want comprehensive advice for caring for, buying and selling vintage clothing, then try another. Particularly unattractive is Mason's tendency to condescend to her reader. Perhaps she is less arrogant when removing stains from other people's clothing. Then again, maybe not. She is tenuous in describing her cleaning techniques; as though she has never tried some of them herself. Save your money.

The main section of this book is a price guide that lists the selling price of vintage clothing. The majority of these price quotes come from Ms. Mason's shop, and are grossly inaccurate of the going rate for these items on the open market. Take for example vintage Emilio Pucci. Ms. Mason offers his clothing on her website for [money]. These are the prices she represents in her book as typical for these items. Go back to her website in several months, and you will find all the same items unsold. If you want an accurate measure of fair market value for vintage items, go to ebay and search completed auctions. You will find that for excellent condition vintage Pucci pieces, the actual market value is between [money], a fraction of what Ms. Mason claims it to be.

Best aspects of Russian music.","review":"I almost invariably avoid Tchaikovsky's musical works, probably based on the hangovers from listening to the highly contrived '1812 Overture' and some, on the other hand, of his dullish instrumental pieces. But, if there is anything the Russians can do right, it's music for drama, especially when it includes choral pieces. And the vocal and choral pieces in this 'minor' work are simply engaging. And, the hefty 80 minute duration is nothing to sneeze at.If, like me, you enjoy out of the way corners of music history, this is a great find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Not Have the Canon Name on the Lens","review":"It works as advertise, but that is about all.

Through this autobiography, I read with great interest as wellas great sadness, over a man and woman who weredeeply in love, but destroyed by Gordon's alcoholism and excessive gambling.

My other sister fell in love with it and got the same one :) I think it's a bit more unique and complex a design than your average Celtic knot ring, and yet isn't too overpoweringly knotted. Just perfect :) Could also be used as an engagement ring, or even a wedding band as well (if you like the Claddagh but want a slightly different alternative to the traditional design).
