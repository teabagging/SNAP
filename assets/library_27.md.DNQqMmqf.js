The user interface is the standard browser set up and works well with Firefox. It set up just fine and has worked well for all the Windows OS systems.

Avoid.","review":"This router works great when it's up - great speed, excellent range on the wireless, and 54 Mbps throughout the entire house.The problem is that it cuts out about every 1-2 hours and after a while it drives you crazy.

Some of its key features are an auto-sensing 10/100 Mbps WAN/LAN connection, true firewall advanced security with SPI (Stateful Packet Inspection) and NAT (Network Address Translation) - a simple, interactive installation, and backwards compatibility with 802.11b for wireless flexibility.

This had worked perfectly through the Linksys. Then, as I worked further with the router, I discovered that the wireless connection is spotty - dropping maybe twice an hour for a few seconds at a time. Again, this seems to be something many compain of.Overall, it seems wonderful, but has ultimately let me down.

I could have purchased a 3com router for approximately the same price, but went to with the WGR614 because of the mail in rebate. After recieving this router I mailed in the rebate. After checking online my rebate was not accepted due to the fact that I did not submit a reciept. I did in fact send in my amazon invoice, but I guess that isn't good enough. I'm not sure what else they could want. If you buy from Amazon just don't expect to get you're rebate.

I DO NOT have to reboot the DSL modem, so I reason the problem is the WGR614.

But then, for no real reason, the router just stopped working. I couldn't get an answer from email or the website, and like other reviewers have mentioned, the tech-support is a joke (30 minute wait, can't understand them because it's outsourced in India, don't solve anything anyway).

I wanted more security. My old SMC Barricade Router only used Wep encryption, but had a solid wireless connection. The Netgear router installs very easily as do most routers now days and the hard wire ports work fine, but the wireless connection would drop every 10 to 15 seconds at only 20 ft away. I tried downloading the latest firmware, but to no avail. Needless to say, the connectivity issue was unacceptable and I gave it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with LinkSys","review":"I chose to buy the NetGear router because it was about $10 cheaper than LinkSys, plus it got a great review from CNET. I was disappointed with the router, though. The connection drops to a really low speed all the time, and the farthest I've ever used it is about 30 feet with two walls of separation.Also, when my friend came over with his laptop, he was unable to even connect to my network because he uses .11b instead of .11g. Be warned, if you plan on using b and g simultaneously, this router is definitely not for you.In conclusion, I would recommend paying more for the brand that more people trust: LinkSys.Happy hunting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"I bought this router and a Netgear PC card, and my first WIFI experience was one of the more frustrating of my life. The router would constantly drop the connection (every two hours or less), and would have to be reset manually (walking down to the router and pulling the power cord...repeat). I spent much time on the Netgear support lines, tried EVERYTHING they said, and the best answer I got was \\"interference.\\" Bull. I bought a Linksys router after giving up on the Netgear, and the Linksys has not required a single reset. The Netgear PC card works great though. I have no idea if I got a damaged router or if they are all terrible, but I wouldn't bother with another Netgear router when the Linksys works so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs a reset every now and then","review":"This router needs to be reset (unplugged then plugged in) almost every other day.

Took a whole lot longer and more effort than alleged, and yes, I read a lot of the reviews here for tips, which saved time, but certainly didn't solve the problem.Now that it's working, it's OK. It needs re-booting way more often than it should, and drops the signal too often, but you probably cannot expect top of the line quality at this price.However, you should be able to expect some level of acceptable support. You will not be getting that with this, or I'd wager, any Netgear product. I'd look elsewhere. I've never used a Linksys product before, but after this experience, they'll be getting a shot at my business, since Netgear will never, ever get another order from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Difficult to Setup and Does Not Work with BellSouth","review":"The person who wrote the most glowing 5 Star review must be a true computer genius, because I am fairly computer literate, and it took me hours and hours to try to set up, and finally had to give up and hire someone to come and set it up for me. Granted, it is true, there appear to be special problems with the Bellsouth Westel Router, so that was part of the problem. But I have had this thing for coming up on a year now, and it frustrates me no less now than it did when we bought it. Constantly losing connection. Currently, although I am happy (sadly enough) to say I can use the internet with this darn thing hooked up, I cannot get it to produce a wireless signal. I would never buy this product again, and may go ahead and bite the bullet and buy a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy but keeps dropping signal","review":"I've put up with this for longer than I should have.

Then I came to find out that they made up some error with the rebate form and I would not be getting my rebate. Their customer service sucks and I will never buy their products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good range, bad firm ware and no updates.","review":"This router is serviceable and has good range but the firmware corrupts the memory. This causes the configuration tables tobecome corrupted beyond the ability of the web interface tocorrect.For example this causes the port forwarding to stop working and the port forward menue to no longer show the configuration. I can not redo the forwarding because the web interface is confused and will not let me delete, edit or add port forward. If I have been unfortunate enough to save my configuration during this corruption then that too is corrupted. If I have a backup that isn't corrupted I can do a hard reset back to factory defaults, via a little button on the back and restore the backup. Most of the time the corruption is in the backup too and I have no choice but to reconfigure the router from scratch. This happens about every month.This router has very bad firmware, and no prospects of improvement. This router has wasted a lot of my time anda little money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't throw your patch cables away...","review":"Seems to be a recurring theme. Utilizing the WGR614 with a wired connection works great. However I got sporadic wireless connections (at best) even when sitting right on top of the antenna.

Spend the extra money and get the linksys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be Simpler!","review":"This product is so simple to install and it works fabulously!

I googled this item and learned it has a history of drops and many sites discussed a fix of zero-ing out a default five-second setting to keep the connection alive. The only problem is,, that setting only works if your ISP requires you to login to your connection. I don't know about other ISPs or countries but in the US, neither Comcast nor AT&T; require you to login to your broadband connection -- it's \\"always on\\" which is one of the benefits of broadband. SO in the Netgear setup, the five-second setting doesn't even appear if you answer that a login is not required.For whatever reason, the Netgear WGR614 would randomly drop the Internet connection.

We buy the same model and expected to be the same but turned to be a wrong decision, the current one (bought at Walmart at 02/2010) is actually a different model: WGR614v9, with only 8MB Ram and 2MB flash Rom, only half of the WGR614v8, and more important no more Qos in router firmware, it is much slower than the WGR614v8, especially under heavy load thus need manual reboot.

Stay away from these POS consumer routers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with freezing.","review":"I put up with this dropping issue for the last 8 months trying everything and anything reading forums and experimenting. The problem was the router locking up, unable to continue internet access to the DSL modem. This occurred A) randomly, B) when I'd open multiple tabs in Safari browser at once. I had confirmed DSL modem was not at fault.My best guess was the router had gotten damaged over time from overheating. Well, my answer to that is - I have a TON of other electronic equipment in my house under identical conditions that are still working fine.My answer was to buy an Apple Airport Extreme, and immediately all the freezing problems went away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was nice while it lasted","review":"I bought and installed version 6 of this device a couple of years ago. On the positive side, it was easy to install and it offered a reasonable set of features, if not everything I wanted. However, in the last two days, it has been going out to lunch for no reason that I can see: while the unit shows activity on its Internet and wireless LEDs, and it continues to show up in a scan for wireless networks, it will not issue DHCP leases on the LAN side, and it will not respond to ICMP pings from either the WAN or the LAN sides. Rebooting the box clears the problem, but this is not an acceptable solution. Since NetGear says my support options all involve me paying money, I expect to buy a new wireless router with a different brand label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stops working for no reason and technical support is HORRIBLE","review":"I get error messages when I try to use this product and Netgear's technical support is located in India, which means I have to repeat my serial number 10 times, only to have them refuse to help me because I bought the product more than 6 months ago.

I would try to access the configuration program on the unit to try and correct the problem, but while it was trying to connect it would refuse to let me. I would have to unplug the WAN port and then the router would allow me to access the config screen. This in turn led me to have to recycle the dsl modem's power.

With both Verizon DSL and Comcast cable modem service, it chokes and drops the connection whenever I try to go to a webpage that has a large number of images.

Which is slightly annoying when alone, but very annoying when others are using the internet and you have to tell them to get off it so you can unplug the router. The one I have also can't be set in the upright position as it then makes a squealing noise every time the lights blink. Not loud, but noticeable. So only purchase if cheap and no other option.

It sits three feet away from me, and chugs away merrily for 23 hours and 50 minutes a day. If I put a hand on it at a random time, it's often very warm or downright hot.Twice a day or so, my internet connection cuts out, and a router restart (unplug and plug it back in) fixes it. Some days this doesn't happen at all, and maybe the average is closer to once a day, but it's definitely the router. I generally notice it's hotter than average the times it goes down. So maybe the problem's related to temperature.. tough to say for sure.Good thing the router was cheap and my work doesn't rely on an uninterrupted connection. I can survive the minor inconveniences of these outages--they rarely interrupt something mission-critical. Annoying, but not enough to get me to dump $70 on a new router yet. I imagine there's a more reliable option out there for the price, but cheap is cheap and I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of connectivity problems: new Linksys router fixed them","review":"We used this router without problems for years. Then, a month ago wireless connections started dropping. It got worse and worse: MacBook, XP, Vista, iPhone, and wireless printer all started having problems. I upgraded firmware, but that didn't fix anything.Last night I went out and bought the latest Linksys WRT54G2 Wireless-G Broadband Router. That fixed everything. In addition, the Linksys router comes with Network Magic software, which sounds hokey, but which does such a great job at organizing and managing the network I can forgive the name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well... for a while","review":"I bought this router and it worked well... for a while. Now it will frequently just stop working. I find that this usually happens when I am not actively using it. I will come home from work and have no internet connection until I unplug the router. Also, it seems to run very hot.Setup is fairly easy and the interface isn't that bad, but having to unplug it every couple of days is highly annoying. I would not suggest buying this router unless you want a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing parts","review":"Bought mine from this website and the software was not included, even though it said it was in the description.

With all the hype about wireless n (which is still a dream) and mimo technology, it's easy to get sucked into buying a router that you really don't need. If all you are using the router for is to share an internet connection, this is the perfect solution. It is very easy to setup and it also looks really nice.There are no internet connections available that transfer faster than 54mbps. These new wireless technologies that promise 256mbps transfer rates are only useful for serious home networking, and in most cases, they don't even do what they promise. Plus, they require expensive add on equipment (new wireless cards, etc.). If you want a great router that lives up to the promises on its box, buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice","review":"got this and it's little companion (WG511) for the laptop.Nice stuff, no problems at all.

The router's been sitting on top of one of the desktops, and just purring along.I can get a couple hundred feet outdoors (very nice if you don't want to be stuck inside on a nice day).If ya wanna do some real roaming, get a model that accepts external input and build yourself one of those \\"coffee can\\" antennas,(do a goggle search for the info) but I digress.

My daughter kept telling me to rent one from Time Warner and I finally did - an it works perfectly. The NetGear was easy to setup but dropped connection frequently and when working was very slow - taking 30 sec. or more to go to another page, wireless or connected. Short videos would frequently stop playing after a few seconds or so and wouldn't go on no matter how long I waited, wireless or connected. Sometimes I couldn't get a connection at all and had to go completely through the setup again and again and again.

Then I upgraded the router's firmware to its latest version; that didn't help either.At first, I thought the issue had to do with my cable company, but after reverting to my original configuration (PC directly connected to the cable modem), the DHCP problems were solved. Checking in Netgear's forums and in some other sites around the Internet, I've found many customers with similar issues.I decided to discontinue using the router, and to purchase a Linksys WRT54G, which has been working flawlessly.Think twice before purchasing this Netgear router... for the same money, you'll be able to find a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working, piece of junk!","review":"At first it worked fine.

There were no replacement netgear routers available at Circuit City, so I exchanged it for a linksys which was functioning fine about 5 minutes after I had it out of the box.

The lights stay on and blink and show as if it is working, but the only way to get it going again is to just reset the thing by pulling the power out and plugging it back in.On another token, I have DSL as cable is not available in my area. It took me HOURS to get this router to work properly in conjunction with my DSL modem. The directions included with the router did not end up working easily, so I had to take several additional steps which I managed to find online using my Mobile Broadband Card as secondary internet connection.All in all I would say this is an awful investment.

Toshiba has basically done nothing although this was purchased through their website.

Unfortunately my WGR614 had a few of the problems that others were encountering.First, using Netgear WG511 pc card and router after the initial setup the connection lasted about 3 days before I had to do my first reboot of the device. Following the next few days the connection wouldn't last from morning to evening without a reboot. Second, after disabling SSID broadcast it would still broadcast the name. Instead of waiting until it disconnects every hour on the hour like others have experienced I decided to return it.

It detected the PPPoE and setup the internet connection within 5 min. The web-wizard is clunky and awkward to use, but I figured it out without using the manual. Security on the wireless side is turned off by default which is a concern but makes sense when you're trying to setup a new device and get connected. LOOKS REALLY COOL TOO!

The PC works great, but the Mac and the router will not communicate properly. I've spent several hours talking with some very nice Indian folks on the phone about this, but each time there was no resolution to the problem. I've given up trying to solve the problem and just plug the Mac directly into my cable modem, then unplug it and plug the router in when I need to use the laptop. Of course, that sort of defeats the purpose of the router!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Dlink router instead","review":"Dont buy this router! We have had this model and it randomly drops its connection. The problem got worse over the last month or so and after looking at my options I decided to get a Dlink DIR 655. The Dlink has received nothing but good reviews and it is much, much faster. Seriously, check out Cnet and Maximum PC for their reviews before you buy. As for the netgear,I liked the look and it was easy to set up, if you only surf the web and have 1 or 2 pc's on at once then maybe this would be an o.K. choice based on the price.

I bought it because I was replacing a Netgear router and I thought I knew what to expect. I was happily proven wrong. This was so easy to set up.

My only complaint with this is on the desktop that this is wired to, everytime I start IE, it pops up needing to enter the administator name and password, but it doesn't ask it for Firefox. I haven't taken the time to trouble shoot it yet or get a hold of Netgear to find out why it does this.Other than this one problem, I have been very happy with this router.

Netgear won't even talk to you without first giving them your credit card number. I was going to put this worthless pile of junk on ebay, but cannot morally sell this thing to somebody. I wouldn't even give it to somebody for free, don't want to loose friends. Its hardly worthy of sharing the trash can with moldy bread. My heart goes out to anybody who bought one of these things.

Unfortunately this was only 1 month. At that point the we couldn't connect to the router via wireless (only by wired connection). Firmware upgrades were a no-go. It took me 8 calls (long distance - there is no 1-800 number) to customer support to talk to a real person and attempt to get an RMA, when they informed me their \\"system was down\\" and they would call me back. Regardless to say, they never did. The \\"email\\" support is a scam. They never responded to my emails either. The router now relegated for use as a network switch in my lab. Don't buy Netgear. Buy the D-Link 624 or similar instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for basic routing","review":"I chose this Netgear product over other brands simply because in the past, Netgear products have always worked flawlessly. Nowadays however, Netgear's routers seem to be degrading in quality and the WGR614 is no exception. I recently purchased a version 5 and while it is good for basic routing, any complex addition to a network will cause this router to malfunction (e.g. adding a network printer).I've talked to tech support over 2 days and the only solution they can give me is that my network printer is at fault however as soon as I tried using a Linksys WRT54G, my network works as expected.If all you need is to route a couple computers together with no extra features, this product should suffice. Otherwise, look elsewhere, especially the Linksys products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable wireless connection","review":"I bought this router because of its ridiculously low price (...) And I too have heard good things about the Netgear brand. The device only took 2 minutes to set up with RCN's cable modem (dynamic ip), and the web config interface is simple. But the wireless connection dies intermittently, sometimes as often as several times a day! I have to go over to the router, unplug it, and plug it back in to reset it. Afterwards it works fine. If you're at home, it's a minor nuisance, but if you're running a server or need to connect to your network when nobody's home to reset the router, DON'T BUY THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Arm Wrestling Contest to Use with Devices/Computers/Printers","review":"I bought this on a whim, since I already had a Netgear 624 that was fine. The 614 would sometimes fail to connect devices/computers/printers, sometimes would show a 'low signal' at the device side, and would seldom recognize my HP wireless printer, so I moved everything back to my Netgear 624 which worked calmly and well. I think the 614 is higher powered in terms of signal, but its software or electronics or both are faulty. I developed a scheme: each day, power down the unit and power it back up, to keep signal strong, etc. My advice is: don't buy the 614, even if they give it away eventually. I don't know which wireless router to suggest since I'm only used the 624 and the 614. BEfore this I was wired with a Linksys that performed fine and stable for years and years.

No more restarting my router every other day to get it to work, and NO MORE NETGEAR FOR ME! There's a reason I guess why their routers are less expensive. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra ten dollars for another brand like Linksys.If you do buy this one note that when I followed the instructions on the included setup CD it didn't work.

Frequently, on both a wired and wireless connection, the connection would drop or slow to unbearable speeds. The wireless range of the WGR614 is only decent, and although it operates under 802.11g, you're better off with a 802.11b router due to this device's dropped connections and frequent losses in speed (Although I would recommend getting another brand of 802.11g router above the 802.11b).

Waited 30 minutes (twice, call was dropped first time), then they said the router was fine, I should pay for Permium service and if in the end it turned out to be hardware they'd refund the payment.So really, the warranty is only 90 days.I'd avoid this (and I guess all other Netgear products with this crazy 90-day-and-then-you-pay warranty scheme.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Netgear makes defective routers","review":"I ordered this router in November 2004. Opened it up and had it set up in 20 minutes. I had my laptop connected to the router wirelessly and my PC desktop connected to it through the ethernet. The setup screen was pretty simple to use. Life was wonderful...3 hours later... my connection started to drop every 5 mins. I have DSL connection but my pages were loading up as if I was using a 28.8k modem. Sometimes none of my web pages were loading at all even when I tried loading the web pages through my PC which was connected to the router directly.Anyways to make a long story short, I read the rest of the reviews on Amazon.com and Eopinions.com and realized that 90% of the users of this product are having the exact same problem with lost connections. I ended up refunding this product. I think it is terrible for Netgear to continue selling this defective product without fixing the connection problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Router broke after 100 days and Cannot be returned","review":"My router worked fine for about 3 months and then it suddenly stopped working.

So, I purchased the WGR614 because of its impressive specs. Setup with my DSL modem was straightforward and everything seemed to work well. After a week or so the router began to drop synch, but (usually) was able to reconnect. Performance continued to degrade, however, and within a few days became only rarely usable. After a week of checking out line quality, computer connections, etc., as well as trying to extract some useful diagnostic information from Netgear's minimal online support site, I decided to try a different wireless DSL router. A Linksys WRT54G immediately established a rock solid connection and has performed flawlessly ever since.Sorry, Netgear, my loss is definitely your loss...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible router, poor technical support, never again!","review":"I've used Netgear products for many years, so when I wanted to upgrade my wireless network, I chose the WGR614.

If I keep it at 802.11b only, it stays for longer, but I didn't need it for 802.11b. How annoying when at the same time, my next door neighbor's Linksys router is sending a nice clear consistent signal. I've tried to work it out with technical support.

Big mistake. Following the instructions exactly as before, the installation failed repeatedly. Phone calls to the ISP and Neatgear finally got everything up and running after a 45 conference call.

And the people with both feet on the ground meander boringly with absolutely nothing to recommend them or getting to know them. Totally forgettable characters. A terrible read leaving one to ponder--page by page--why the author opted for a style meant to confuse. Oh, there may be nicely sequenced words or phrases, but is it \\"stylish\\" to set forth sentences that abruptly jump to various scenes or thoughts on a whim?

Trevor's writing style is also very confusing, resulting in many situation which are not clear including the disappointing ending. Also, what was the purpose of the Thaddeus/ Mrs. Ferry subplot? It wasn't the slightest bit interesting and had absolutely nothing to do with the main story.

If you buy this set, the version of \\"The Great Dictator\\" that you get is the same as one you get by buyingThe Great Dictator (2 Disc Special Edition), so you aren't getting ripped or anything.Four great movies, one great price.

Blue Murder is hokey and dated with a very low budget feel. The dialect/language is hard to understand and the action is mostly non-existent. I understand the dynamic relationship these two men had but I don't care. Neither are very interesting and the show as a whole - which has been resurrected because of the BRILLIANCE of The Shield - is a poor and cheap comparison. I know the creator of The Shield said he got many ideas from Blue Murder but quite frankly he does a much better job with those ideas than the original series. Blue Murder lacks charisma, and interesting characters. One reason I am upset about Blue Murder is that it is VERY expensive to get here in the USA and the show just wasn't up to par compared to normal US television. It is hard to describe the show if you haven't seen it but it's almost has a soap opera or stage play feel to it and it is tediously boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A SHIELD?!","review":"WHAT ARE THEY SAYING!

They come with 8 dvds in this one (40 episodes) and the other is 35 episodes and a movie. I love they released such large collections. The single dvd releases, while helpful if trying to save money, take up lots of space on the bookshelf and are annoying. I paid $250 for both collections and I havent regretted it once.

When it was over, we just looked at each other and talked about how on earth it got past production.

They are now difficult and often expensive to come by: hence this compliation. Its title is taken from amphigorey, or amphigouri, meaning a nonsense verse or composition. E.G.A collection of 15 books with Gorey's incomparable artwork, the individual tomes are delightful, intriguing and disturbing, sometimes simultaneously. This book includes limericks (in English and French) as well as The Gashlycrumb Tinies (A is for Amy who fell down the stairs, et al)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collected surrealist comics","review":"Well, if you don't know who Edward Gorey is... Think surrealist comic book - surrealist like advertising art is surrealist: elegant models dancing with elephants, large everday objects falling on people and dogs doing clever implausible things.The drawings are nicely done pen and ink illustrations. They are atmospheric above all else and have a distinctive flavor. The captions are matched to the drawings and may or may not relate directly to the scene shown. Together they build pretty little plots - surreal and without loose ends. Amphigorey is a bound collection of these short stories by Edward Gorey.I recommend Edward Gorey to all. The drawings are excellent at creating an atmosphere and the stories are clever. (Obviously disregard my recommendation if you don't like surrealism.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wicked good collection to be read over and over","review":"When I first picked up this book, I had no idea what to expect. I was even more bewildered when I opened it up and looked at the drawings. I thought to myself, what in the world is this? Then I started reading.Edward Gorey's work is at times subtle or broad, ironic or slaptstick, and always brilliant. How dare this man call himself a children's book author! His books are for everyone, not just tots. Startlingly funny and morbid, the books in this volume (and his other collections) will make the reader laugh and snicker until they are sick. The dark humor of \\"the Gashlycrumb Tinies\\", the burlesque of \\"the Curious Sofa\\", the absurdity of \\"the Doubtful Guest\\", the dry wit of \\"the Unstrung Harp\\", every story is different. Every story is a gem. Gorey's books are a must-have for absolutely everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is a classic volume of dark humour. But that's not all it is. Edward Gorey has created not just quirky limericks, not just hilarious stories of macabre, and not just pages of delicous nonsense. He has created his own _universe_. The Amphigorey universe is filled with a mood that Gorey has perfected. The dark niceties fit together to create this mood like a puzzle--everything from his Neo-Victorian cross-hatchwork, Edwardian character names, even the font. Amphigorey is an hilarious gothic masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy.","review":"If you're an Edward Gorey fan, this is a good purchase.

They at times cause us to laugh at things that we usually don't laugh at.

Otherwise, however, I wish you good luck finding out who they are, because you are not told in the book.

The older ones are packed up to eight movies per side, shortened in length and apparently digitally compressed to fit, even using dual-layer recording. Better viewing of these movies is available on any of the TV movie channels. Even the newer ones from the 70's and 80's are not good quality.

For analysis of investing history and method, go with Buffettology or Hagstrom."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy this","review":"Although I believe that Warren Buffett is the most interesting investor of our time, those seeking insight into his methods or are well advised to look elsewhere. This book is nothing more than a collection of short anecdotes about specific times in Mr. Buffett's life; the possible implication is that by understanding these stories, you'll understand the man, and perhaps be able to invest like him. If that is what you want, start with The Intelligent Investor, or, if more enterprising, Security Analysis. If you want to understand the man, this may be a good place to start, but I find the author's style made me feel like I was reading newspaper articles, rather than a more fluid prose. I'd be happy to sell you mine if you want it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Berkshire Hathaway a company with perpetual growth model","review":"Mathematically nothing can grow forever but Berkshire at least seems that way. And that is exactly what the Oracle of Omaha has created. A business model that few understand. It took me several years to understand this empire moulded and nurtured by few honest men with Warren Buffett at the helm. This book is part of my library because it gives all the details one would like to know about the company and the man who runs it.

How else can one explain the contruction of the pyramids, Stonehenge, the Lost City of Atlantis that Aristotle talked about or the so-called miracles in the Bible? Bramley does not adequately describe what the aliens are using us slaves for. What are we human beings doing for the aliens? Why are they directing us to total globalism?

The various religious books point out that if the \\"Gods\\" are not obeyed mankind will suffer the consequences of the wrath of the \\"Gods\\" who usually employ secret societies that control the world to do their bidding. These religious books do have spirituallity but ultimately promote totalitarianism under the guise of \\"The kingdom of Heaven\\" where everybody obeys and doesn't question authority.

I did not know going in that this book would focus so much on the history of this last Century, but it opened my eyes to all sorts of possibilities. I had previously read the works of Zecharia Sitchin, and this book very much complements Sitchin's work.

It has broadened my scope of knowledge considerably. I wonder if one of you might comment on my spouse's reaction to the info I relayed to him in this book...he doesn't believe in God - the holy regard. .....(I gave the book 5 stars as I see the author not even going in this direction--but he finds this info)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Food for Consipracy Theorists","review":"I read this book about seven years ago when I had voracious appetite for the works of Joseph Campbell and Carl Sagan.

In fact the book is nothing more than a large canvas on which conspiracy theorists can spread their full course picnic. Bramley certianly writes well and paints and interesting picture of a \\"brotherhood\\". But his is nothing more than rehashed, old and tired conspiracy stuff that quite frankly is boring and stiff in its theme. I think Karl Marx and the class struggles of the 19th century are more accurate decriptions of alien races and subjugated classes, but nothing more than the emperors new clothes dressed up in alien abductions, crop circles and ancient brotherhoods from another world - silly!.

The author's premise is that religion and secret societies were created by aliens (referred to as Custodians) to control and manipulate the human population that they had created. He fails to show exactly what all this manipulation gets for the E.T.s. Because of the poor scholarship regarding Christianity in particular, I am uneasy about what he has to say on everything else, including the UFO sightings. And finding the UFO sightings is like finding needles in a haystack - too few and far between.

Most of what the author dwells uppon has little or nothing to do with extraterrestials.

After reading the other reviews, I was expecting a book along the lines of \\"The Late Great Planet Earth\\" or Erich Von Dannikan's \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" (no plug intended).

It has its share of classical element and drama -- contestants from more than 80 countries matching wits (actually, mathematical problem solving skills) with each other, a long and proud tradition, global standard, and the lovely \\"genius factor\\". Within the competition, the standard of \\"genius\\" is shot through the roof; the hometown math wizard would be as common as the guy next door. In the age where people crave for the over-the-edge competitiveness (cue Spellbound documentary and Word Freak), this is an untap reservoir. Olympiad competitions, especially the Math Olympiad, are the pinnacle of common-knowledge, skill-centered academic competitiveness.Read this if you want to peek into the world of the real math kids, as opposed to those 1000s of kids on the street whose moms brag about being \\"a math whiz\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all art, no mining history here--none, nada, nothing!","review":"As a member of the Board of Directors of the Mining History Association, I purchased this video to learn a little more about mining in ancient Greece.

In order to contain the crisis for the rail company, she has to know the cause of the accident and whether it was an accident.Barbara Saranella's last book was the start of what would have been a wonderful series. The human elements in the story are so well done; Charlotte's OCD, relationship with her mother, possible romance, and handling of the crisis. I learned a lot about trains and was never bored by it. There were a couple, small weaknesses in the plot, but the story definitely held me all the way through. In some ways, I like the character better than Munch and am very sorry we've lost such a talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Having read and enjoyed the Munch Mancini series, I was disappointed by the weakness of this book. I agree with other reviewers that the premise of a PR person with OCD has great possibilities. Surprisingly, though, the writing was in many ways like that of a new author - many awkward bits, where, as a reader, I wanted to edit/rewrite. I'm not sure why this happened with an experienced author unless, maybe, she was ill and wanted to finish quickly. In any event, it is sad to know that she will not be able to continue this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unidentified Hauntings","review":"I did not care for this book. First, the author consistently fails to identify the locations of the alleged haunted sites (no addresses, etc.) and, IN MY OPINION, this is a good indication the stories are fictional.

After he's released, Doc robs a bank and he and Carol go on the run. Everything that can go wrong does, which builds a great deal of anxiety and mistrust between Doc and Carol. The book has some great twists and turns and a fairly surreal ending.A 1972 movie was made from the book starring Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw. That movie is pretty good, but differs vastly from the novel. Specifically, the movie is a love-on-the-run chase movie, while the book is about the mistrust between cons. As such, the book is much more complex and enjoyable. Highly recommended for fans of Jim Thompson and/or crime novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Married Life a la Jim Thompson","review":"I honestly wish some producer or director had the courage to make a true adaptation of this book. This is a caper story, a chase story, and a descent into personal and professional hell. Whereas the films follow this up to a point, they leave out the stunning and shocking denoument.

With each photo is a short (25 - 50 words) synopsis of the photo. This provides the bulk of the book, and is its real strength.The book also includes a brief biography and time line of Riis' life, and an all too brief disucssion of his work as a social reformer. While this is a good summary, I feel it could have gone into more detail regarding the time, the emerging role Riis (and others) played in social reform, and the impact he and other \\"muckrakers\\" had on America.

Even if you turn the volume to its lowest setting the keyboard sound is too loud. Worse, its default setting is 5 (scale from 1 to 10) which is way too loud. Each time your child turns the unit on and starts playing without thinking to turn down the volume first you have to hold your ears. Especially if you smaller children you know they are not going to turn down the volume by themselves.2. The various sounds are quite dissapointing. Of the 100 or so sounds I can only stand the piano sound which sounds ok - not great.3. The unit comes without a power supply so you better buy lots of batteries.I didn't expect much when I bought the unit. It was to be a simple toy for my 2 year old daughter.

Many different sounds and a great value!","review":"I purchased two of these quality keyboards a few years ago from my local 'Uber Mart' for about half of what they cost here (they were on sale). Even at forty or fifty bucks, this keyboard is a very good deal considering the many professional sounds and sound effects it is capable of. My 5 year old is absolutely enthralled by many of these sounds, especially the percussive and organ sound effects (as am I!). It is great to see her putting notes together and learning to play kid's songs for the first time! Great confidence builder for toddlers and kids. The keys are not that small, and can easily accomodate adult fingers as well. Lastly, the batteries last a very long time, providing you shut the unit off after each use. I hope this review helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"great keyboard","review":"I have dropped this keyboard many times and it is still alive. It can let you play 4 notes at a time so you can play cords. This keyboard isn't very loud but it is durable. I recommend this to someone who wants a small keyboard to mess around with. For a keyboard like this it has a great price.Better than children keyboards and is a great gift for beginers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keyboard","review":"I would have like to have known how cheap this was made.It is good for the kids to play with but had I realizedit was chinzy I probably would have saved my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little keyboard!","review":"This is a perfect little keyboard for the sole purpose of learning my individual part in church choir songs and hymns.

We have had this exact same one in the past but his previous one broke after extended use. I would have given this product a full 5 points except for the fact that we have only had it for a few weeks and the last key on the right doesn't work anymore. Other than that it is a great little Piano and my 7 year old loves it. He has special needs and loves music and it makes a great learning tool for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Too Small","review":"I gave this item 4 stars because it lived up to what I ordered it for. The sound is good and it has numerous playing options. However, once I started playing with it, I realized that it was too small for my needs. There are not enough keys, and the keys are very small. I decided I wanted to get into really playing, rather than just playing around, so I borrowed a large keyboard and have been learning on that.While this keyboard would be great for a child to begin learning on, it's not for anyone who wants to seriously learn to play.I do like the fact that it's portable, and I can take it with me if I go out of town to keep in practice, or even if I want to move to another room, but next time I will get a full-size keyboard.I really feel that the keyboard quality is excellent for a small keyboard, it just didn't meet my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful and Useful","review":"Good tone, lightweight, highly portable, and reasonably priced.

The only problem was the microphone. She kept putting it to close to her mouth instead of just speaking into it. The microphone had stopped working by the time the party was over.

It is a good choice and the sound quality is good.Susan (VA)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio SA-75 Starter Musical Keyboard","review":"I bought one online at Walmart for my 5-year old who is just started piano lessons.

It actually is! Louisa Waugh is a modern Margaret Mead, she tries living in this remote mongolian village participating to the life, but without interfering and without judging, and when that happens she underlines and regrets it. Can this book be called a work of modern anthropology? It goes near to it. I would have liked a more detailed description of the population and the ethnic differences between the Kazakhs and the Tuvans, but that would have made this book a textbook of social studies, which it really doesn't want to be. The simplicity and modesty of this unusual life experience is touching. The author talks about herself (very little)and mostly about the other women she meets. The Prize the book won is extremely appropriate because the spirit of the place is really the book's main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"great MONGOLIAN LIFE!","review":"could not put book down... really helped to understand 'the mongolian way'..... a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the ups and downs of a rugged, isolated lifestyle","review":"Author Louisa Waugh moved to a remote village in Mongolia after two years working in the country's capitol: HEARING BIRDS FLY is the first-person account of the year she spent living with the villagers.

MOUTH WITH TEETH AT THE END OF IT?!?","review":"I really did not know what to expect when I bought this book. It was recommended to me by a friend. Laymon's style of writing is very good and it holds your attention. I found the story to be unique but very odd. Hence the title to this review. I can't really imagine any woman enjoying THAT! The ones who mate with them can never go back to human men. ODD! I visualize what I read, so I was most definitely squeezing my butt cheeks together as I read those explicit parts. I am giving it the four star rating because it was a good book and I plan on reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing","review":"I was not a fan of this book. Chapter 1 left me thinking \\"What the eff?\\" and that feeling stayed with me through the whole story. The characters are generally unlikeable and I was questioning was supposed to care about any one when most of the people in this book seemed to have sociopathic tendencies. I have no desire to read anything else in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"This might possibly be the worst book I have ever endured. Laymon's descriptions of the sex/rape scenes are so far beyond \\"sophomoric\\" as to make me think that the writer himself has a very unhealthy view of human sexuality. Every few pages, someone is getting raped by a Beast, or having semi-consensual sex with a Beast, or \\"squirming and groaning\\" with another human being. Awful, just completely horrendous. There are not enough negative adjectives to describe this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good, Long Read","review":"One of the best aspects of The Midnight Hour is that it gets more interesting the farther into it you get.While some horror novels start strong and then quickly become devoid of interesting story, The Midnight Tour does the opposite.The first act is by far the weakest and, despite the fact that the ending unravels a little bit - I won't reveal anything - The Midnight Hour is a surprisingly good read.The one thing that Laymon does with his characters that is annoying is that he over-characterizes them, leaving little to the imagination. While subtlety is not rampant in pop horror, this novel would have benefited from more mystery.I do think it is worth the time to read, however, and I recommend it to anyone whose Stephen King collection is almost worn out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Laymon get any better than this","review":"I have just finished this book after borrowing it from the local library and I have to say that if you love Laymon then this is definately worth trying to find a copy. Combine the Beast House with a Midnight Tour and you have a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"Fairy Tale\\" A True Story","review":"This is a good movie. It has awesome pictures of nature in it and the sound was good. It encourages people to imagine things of beauty and wonder in the people and things which we know for sure are around us. And it encourages us to imagine beauty and wonder in the next life, after we have eaten our last bowl of ice cream and fall down and scrape our knee for the last time here. It also helps us to connect to those who have been through the hardest of times on this earth, who sometimes are catepulted into escaping the pain they have experienced, over into their imagination to a more friendly place. And it encourages seeing above the limitations of some traditions. It is a pleasure to see for both adults and children alike. And the cast were all gentle and kind people.

But these movies are still fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Collection","review":"Like the title implies, this is the ultimate collection for any Die Hard fan. The features on all three of these DVD's are so abundant that it'll take you hours just to see them all. The three movies included are also a perfect way to make a trilogy, changing things around a bit but never going too far away from the formula that made the first one successful. All three of these movies are worth purchasing, and being able to buy them in a pack like this is a great way to save some money.

For $30 you get the three films. You can look at it as only getting half of the old box set, but you are getting it for half the price as well.This is a Die Hard set for people like me who don't care about a million extra features and just want to enjoy the movies at an affordable price. Don't get me wrong, it isn't like I dislike extras, but to be honest I only watch them once or twice, so to me it isn't worth the extra cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"die hard collection","review":"Die hard is a great movie it arrived really fast and i bought it at a great price.Thank You,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong place Right man","review":"Great set collection and all three are a great thing to have.

The problem I have is the packaging. This collection of three Willis' films (6disks) takes up more shelf space than a five film \\"007\\" collection, or the 4 film (9disk) Alien collection. Now these are good/even great action flicks, but they are not 007, who has the swelled head in the production company?Guys, I do buy DVDs because the quality is better, I also buy them because they take up LESS shelf space.

This is typical for studios especialy Fox to do something like this considering the 4th film is around the corner and a much better box set is available, the Die Hard five star ultimate edition. Obviously there will be another box set available once the 4th film is released and ultimatly released again in high definition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"Don't waste your money on this for 2 main reasons:1) There are already better versions of each movie out already (or the already-existing box set). Each of those has 2 discs per movie while this set has only 1. The extra disc on this set is just hype for the new Die Hard 4 movie.2) Do you think the greedy studios WON'T put out a new Box Set with 1,2,3 and 4 when DH4 comes out on DVD? Please...This is nothing more than marketing; another double-dip disgrace (now, a triple) to take our money and spread the word of their new product.PS, I love the Die Hard franchise and can't wait to see the new flic. I just hate the studios and their never ending obsession with ripping us off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be a fool!","review":"Don't be fooled into buying this boxset. It is a big waste of money. It doesn't have all the features of the old 2001 6 disc set. You might as well say it is a barebones edition of the movie instead of the old ultimate edition from 2001 that had two discs per movie. You want to get the real deal then get the ultimate edition on here and go to the used section. There should be some used ultimate edition boxsets on here. Possibly some that someone is selling unopened even. Those are the ones that have all the good stuff. This set is a huge slap in the face to fans like me and probly you that are reading this.

I am a little upset that the newest movie is PG-13, but don't feel it will change the tone of the movie. All in all, factor in the free ticket, and you're looking at saving nearly $20 over the \\"5 Star Collection\\" from Fox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy, this version is crappier.","review":"This boxed set is the product of media hype. This boxed set is the crappier of the two Die Hard box set. This one only has one disc per film, where as the older silver box is a 6 disc set, 2 for each film.

I love all Bruce Willis's movies and they're all the best movies but all Die Hard's throws you back in your seat trying to guess what happens next. By the time you think you have the plot down some other event happens like in Die Hard With a Vengeance when you find out he killed his brother in the first one. The first one is him saving his wife and hostages from a building, the second one he saves her from an airplane with no landing spot, and the third one he saves all of New York City children when he really only discovers the best plot ever created for any movie and then he try's to go back to his marriage. I have nothing bad to say about the movies except they should be making more. Die Hard has the best plot, the best acting so why stop now when they have the \\"Die Hard\\" fans, most there movies on amazon are not in stalk, the new Die Hard - The Ultimate Collection is coming so they better make plenty copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Die Hard DVD well done","review":"I bought this DVD set and am very impressed. The THX, along with the letterbox format, make watching these movies like going back to the show. The picture is great and the sound is loud, making all the explosions better.

Taking place over Thanksgiving weekend 1973 in New Canaan, CT--the town's biblical name is no accident in this tale of a genteel suburban Sodom--sex and substance abuse are the means by which two affluent families try to fill the moral void created by Nixon, free love, and TV. The kids act like adults and the adults act like kids, with neither group finding satisfaction. It is by turns laugh-out-loud funny (a junior high oral report on molecules) and squirm-in-your-seat uncomfortable (men and women face off across a glass coffee table at a key party) with a redemptive ending which through death and tears brings a modicum of meaning back into these otherwise empty lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird Movie","review":"This movie gave me the creeps. It has a very morose and dark atmosphere.Both adults and adolescent kids experiment with dangerous activities such as wife swapping and drug abuse.In one scene this teenage girl nearly drops dead from the affects of sleeping pills so the kid just throws her on the floor. In reality they should have called 911.I thought this movie had some potential and might explore some of those issues in depth and in interesting ways. Rather it is just a creepy movie about people searching for happiness in the wrong places.People need something to believe in in this world in order to be happy. They won't find happiness in extra marital affairs, alcohol, socializing, etc..Jeff Marzano"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD-The Ice Storm","review":"What an odd movie, how could you rate it as one of the top 10 movies for Thanksgiving?

Great film. see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting to know a family next door!","review":"Interesting and engaging would be the two words if you were asked to describe the film in just a second. I believe the film leaves no effort in putting things in the most genuine way possible. The film beautifuly depicts the 70's and its quite believable as you witness the settings, the costumes etc. Reasonable performence from almost everyone in the film, specially Christina Ricci as the curious young girl. She delivers an excellent performence, very genuinely shows a sexual maturity in a young girl. Her friendship with Sandy, her relationship with her father is believable and you can't take your eyes off her. The film will definately grab your attention and you will definately feel you are witnessing a family next door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done Criterion","review":"The transfer is excellent, the extras are incredible, I especially liked the commentary track which made me appreciate this film even more. Well worth buying. Also, this is one of the rare occasions when a film based on a novel is actually better than the novel itself.

Terrible download.It was skipping all over the place. We couldn't even watch 15 minutes of it.A terrible waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing & Pointless","review":"This was one of those movies that was meant to be meaningful but ended up depressing, cynical, and incredibly boring. It wasn't that the acting itself was bad. And it wasn't that I wasn't prepared to like this movie, because I really hoped to enjoy it. It was just another depressing, dysfunctional family movie. Wow...like I need to see another one of those. Besides that it's dull and depressing, it's really very unrealistic. In real life, people smile and laugh. I'm guessing people generally smile at least once a day. And even if there are unhappy, mean, self-absorbed people like that, it's not like that's what life is like. And if life IS like that for you, than you need some serious help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"First before I go off on this movie the acting was quite excellent. 2 questions to ask yourself before buying this. Will there be a plot? Is an ending a good thing to have? Answer number one: This movie had no plot jumping from one thing to the next for no reason. The comic books in the movie have more plot. The only thing that made this movie go along was that the train had a schedule. Please have a sequel to end this movie since there isn't one now. A final question is do we need teenaged nimphomaniacs. NO. My god I might have rated this movie a 3 if it weren't for that. If you don't think those were good answers to those questions well put in the context of a movie and you have Ice Storm"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie but depressing","review":"All the people in it are upper middle class white people. They seem to me to be bored. Their kids seem to want to either lash out (like Christina Ricci character Wendy) or withdrawal like Mikey (Elijah Wood). The adults seemed bored with life and was looking for excitement like \\"key parties\\" (throwing car keys into a fish bowl where women pick them out. A form of \\"Swinging\\").It stuck me as terribly sad. Perhaps our way of life in Western civilization brings about evil. Too comfortable for our own good. Even in the poor parts of our country, we have it good compared to just a couple of hundred years ago. Yet human nature has this inbred part of us that says \\"more\\". Maybe it's our curse as well as our gift.

I think all of the acting is excellent, and that it perfectly portrays the suburban ennui of Connecticut in the 1970s that, albeit in a different form, still exists to this day. My complaint is this: I searched for \\"weather in New Canaan, Connecticut, November 23, 1973\\" in Wolfram Alpha recently (Novemebr 23 being the date of the titular ice storm) and the result I got was -- are you ready for this? -- \\"temperature average: 48 F, conditions: fog, overcast, cloudy, partly cloudy, few clouds, clear.\\" That, my friends, is a far cry from an ice storm. It is sad to see a movie go so far in recreating a historical period -- costumes, Watergate hearings, houses, even waterbeds -- and get this one crucial piece so very wrong. For shame, Rick Moody and Ang Lee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH WATCHING THE ICE STORM!!","review":"Confess it. The odds of you watching this movie before is probably low. And by the majority of that, I bet you haven't heard of this movie either. Do you know why? Because I hadn't till I saw it right on the videotape shelf. It's like a surprise. There are only few movies that made a \\"surprise\\". Such example is The Shawkshank Redemption. You got this movie instinct that you know this one is going to be a good catch. You'll know know what I am talking about if you're an avid movie watcher, like a meterologist on the weather.While watching the movie, you'll appreciate its sense of scripting. I think it's well-scripted. You'll see why the title is appropriate for this movie. I'll close this up short for you.

Except for Elijah Wood","review":"With all of the outstanding actors in this film, I was expecting something quite spectacular... and was sorely disappointed. The characters in this film -- with the exclusion of Elijah Wood's -- are ugly, boring, hurtful, selfish and brooding. Dysfunctional doesn't describe the families in this movie; these people are just plain sick. Archetypes of soulnessness, they spend the entire film invading each other's boundaries and betraying one another. Woods character -- a bright, endearing teen who sees the world through his own literary and artistic lens -- is the only highlight in the entire film, and fans may want to see this movie just for his performance. [Be prepared, though, his character doesn't survive the film.] Everyone else in the movie wasted their talent on decidedly repulsive characterizations.

For example, CD slipcover says Allegro, 1st mvt. from K. 37 lasts 5'20, but the cd on my iTunes reads 5'24.

I actually could have forgiven the perversion of the original story (artistic license being what it is) if the movie was even the least bit watchable. It isn't. Too bad there isn't a No-Star rating.

The epic scope and attention to gritty and compelling detail are still here, left over from Dances With Wolves. But it doesn't rise much above that. The story is interesting but is handled clumsily, and some of the direction is painfully pretentious and silly. The performances aren't entirely lackluster (some of the secondary characters are fairly good, as in Dances With Wolves), but Costner is no more of a treat to watch than usual, still playing the same laid-back, good liberal with his typical hazy disregard of endowing the character he plays with anything other than his own aspiration to appear as a subtle, noble, romantic hero and love interest. There were a couple points where the film was really beginning to pull me in a bit, but this was almost unfailingly ruined by something silly and poorly done. On the whole, it's lukewarm at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen worse","review":"Hey, I've seen worse movies than the Postman...As many of the reviews rightly point out, this movie is quite long. Still it did hold my interest. Also, I found it better than Brin's novel. The chracters were ones I came to care about, and the movie is beautifully filmed. Costner is a fine director and I like to believe he has another Dances with Wolves in him, though this wasn't it. The movie does have a few fine moments, especially the climactic scene between Costner and Will Patton, as an evil general. It's worth a viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is not as bad as I thought","review":"I have seen much worse fimes recently, like shakespeare in love, and that won so many oscars.

It reminds me of the schoolyard bully. And how many other critics follow along because they fear they wont be thought sophisticated if they admit they actually like the movie? This film is a perfect example of that type of thinking.Great movie! Skilled acting, inspiring story, sensitive directing, and beautiful cinematography.

I wonder if that's true."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's GOTTA be an inside joke","review":"Methinks Kevin Costner got too far into Tom Petty's bag of weed on set and went on together to demonstrate total contempt for filmmaking and audience so deep and pervasive that I have to give it an extra star for audacity. There is no other excuse for the mess this movie is. I loved the initial ha-ha...that a self help guru book breeds a group of fascistic barbarians in the post nuke future.

It is STUPID, so UNBELIEVABLY stupid, and just when you think it won't get any MORE stupid, oh it does. It's corny when trying to be sentimental. The dialogue is insanely idiotic when trying to be profound. The plot is horrible, the theme is horrible. And it's just so damn LONG. I think Kevin Costner thinks he's made Braveheart or something.

They're all hollow, quirky, and boring attempts by Costner at being an everyman just trying to fight his way out of some lame situation and happening to come out on top, and with the girl, no less. With other actors, this approach works and the audience can empathize; with Costner, you find yourself anticipating your next bathroom break.Return To Sender."},{"rating":"1","title":"3- Hour Implosion","review":"This film is poorly constructed and conceived. This spells doom for any movie and is much more obvious in a 3-hour \\"epic\\". Costner should never utter another line of Shakespeare in his life. And I never again want to see a mule and a human in a sword fight from MacBeth. The \\"Hero\\" of the film is a pure dweeb. He is cowardly and lacks any kind of conviction whatsoever. Events are also extremely predictable and much of the overarching story line is unexplained. And don't get me started on the cliche's thrown in. It is also unrealistic to me that communities of people will have their hope stirred by a federal beauracracy that is known for being ineffecient and slow.

I won't tell you what happens, but ask yourself, have you ever seen a movie that culminates with a good guy showing mercy to a bad guy, and then the bad guy shows his gratitude by promptly endeavoring to kill the hero? This way the good guy looks really really really good. And the bad guy looks equally bad. Like I said, I don't hate the movie, but this gigantic monument to cliche at the end is the part I remember most clearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Waterworld","review":"Its baffles me that anyone could think this a 3 star movie, but 5 stars? This plays like a hodge-podge assembled from two or three different scripts based on different short stories, with casting giving it a PC spin, probably done to try to deflect the deserved harsh criticism. Of course, the entire story of the savior postman is enough to make most sane people embrace the apocalypse.Perhaps if Tom Petty had starred as the singing postman it might have worked better as an intentionally funny send up of pop culture fashioning new messiahs."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie with a budget ever","review":"I actually liked Waterworld.

I have always taken Amazon reviews with a grain of salt. Now I know how bad things really are. I had to wonder if this movie could really be as bad as the critics said. Given that I like post-apocalyptic movies this was a real contender for an underrated gem. In fact it is even more terrible than I could have imagined. The plot is incoherent and boring. The acting is wooden, but what do you expect the actors to do with such terrible dialog? Even the horses didn't seem into it. By 45 minutes in I was routing for the innocent little children to be trampled by the cavalry. Note that left me with over 2 hours of lusting for bloody vengeance on their smarmy little faces.This movie is right up there with some of the worst films ever made. I'm talking Santa Claus versus the Martians bad. I'm talking Starship Troopers bad, except not in a funny way. Yet there are tons of glowing reviews. What is wrong with you people? This has to be an active scam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe the critics.","review":"This movie only received two stars from the critics, but I give it four. It is a movie of patriotism and perseverance. It's about the loss of America, and the American life. It is about how something we all take for granted today, unite a defeated world, and with hope and pride in who we once were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but fantastic!","review":"While Kevin Costner and the rest of the crew did a remarkable job, it was Olivia Williams who impressed me most. She has the warmest smile; that all american girl look. She was the actor that kept me watching. You want the best to happen for her...and the ending was a pleasant surprise. Great film but block out a chunk of time to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Postman","review":"I LOVE this movie! I am still of the generation that loves real MAIL. As much as I love modern technology and use it, there is still NOTHING as awesome as opening my mailbox and seeing a letter from a close friend or loved one! When the \\"mayor\\" yells out--as he's being shot--with the letter he'd received from his sister via the Postman, \\"Ride, Postman! Do you hear me? Ride!\\"--I cry like a baby with goosebumps all over my body! It's true. We have become so dependent upon emails and text messaging that we have gotten away from the truest, best form of communication: a simple letter. Amazing movie.

I waited for the revelation that was going to make me like the movie, but it never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worse movie Kevin's ever made","review":"If you thought that \\"Waterworld\\" was bad then you should check this out and add it to your list of the \\"stupendously bad movies\\". I formerly worked in the Post office for 13 yrs and I decided to check this out on DVD then on TV--and the result was the same. It was so boring that I found myself dozing off and the idea of postman being the savior of the world, well, it's gotta be a joke particularly for a former employee of it!! The usually reliable Will Patton is so over the top as the villain that he makes Dennis Hopper (Waterworld) look like Laurence Olivier!! Fortunately for Kevin he would redemn himself a few years later with a minor hit: \\"Open Range\\", a classical Western if there ever was one, and with a great Robert Duvall to boot--Kevin even gave him top billing over his name which was fabulous. I say skip this turkey and check out \\"Open Range\\", \\"The Bodyguard\\" or even Costner in a supporting role in \\"The Upside of Anger\\" with Joan Allen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"movie\\" made me sick !!!","review":"Kevin Costner have made a crime against humanity.

With few exceptions I wait in vain. David Brin's book is an excellent work which I remember fondly long after reading it. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't even come close. Kevin Costner's direction and acting is lackluster. The screenplay is miserable. It's a shame, really, since I was looking forward to seeing something from a \\"real\\" science fiction author converted onto the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"With the exception of The Island of Dr. Moreau - this is the worst piece of filth I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as I thought It Was!","review":"This film, although quite dull, is, in fact, a very interesting, although highly unlikely, look at the future. It does sound cornball, but it really isn't. The storyline is great. If more exciting things had happened in the film, then critics and audiences might have agreed with me. Kevin Costner, even though this film was a financial blow, should try to direct another film. The film is good, but not excellent. I recommend it to those who say it is stupid. Usually, second looks turn out to be better for films (Hey, it worked for \\"Vertigo\\"). Grade: B+"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best Worst Movie of All Time","review":"The Postman is a movie so bad that it's good. I spent an entire weekend watching this Costnerian tour de merde, beside myself over how anything this ridiculous could get made. From Costner's opening monologue, talking to his mule, I found myself rewinding the tape, just to verify how ridiculous the script is. After a couple of hours of viewing, and only being about a half an hour into the movie, I decided to watch the whole thing through. About ten times in a row. Some of the classic lines from the movie: You over there --what did you before the war? / Uh, I had a shovel... I dug holes! How did you become the postman? / I could tell you, but I don't know whether you'd laugh or cry. The name of the post-apocalyptic postmaster? Postmaster General Ford Lincoln Mercury. Any viewer with an oddball sense of humor will find this movie more of a comedy than anything else. A classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie Based on an Awesome Book","review":"I was very excited when this movie came out because it is based on a book that I adore. Sadly, the movie rewrote the story in a way that completely lost the heart of the original. That leaves you with a thin plot, unconvincing characters and an unbelievable ending. Do yourself a favor and read the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie","review":"Don't waste your time even considering watching this. Drawn out. Boring. Not worth it. Go watch something else like Dances with Wolves, Waterworld, or JFK if you want to watch a Costner flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dull dull","review":"Watch this if you suffer from insommnia. My postman is more intersting as at least he has something worthwhile to say usually. The acting is poor, the plot and script even worse. Why did they bother. I suspect Costner's ego and bank balance both needed filling. Avoid like \\"Analyze This\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GUY HAS COURAGE AND DETERMINATION","review":"THese are the greatest qualities of Costner. He takes a terrible script, a little ridiculous \\"patriotic\\" history, then says to everybody this is the best history of all times, takes the money needed to produced it, and then keeps thinking the movie is good, when it is only clear garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Costner Has Done It Again","review":"The Postman is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever been subjected to. The story line is absolutely ridiculous. When the movie finally reaches it's climax, you pray it's over, yet the movie still gives you 1 1/2 hours of boredom. The ending was terrible and the movie really didn't give you anyone you could relate to or care for. The only bright spot was the lovable antics of Bill the Mule. Unfortunately, Bill the Mule gets ousted relatively early leaving the rest of the movie in a downward spiral. Forget this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"this movie should have been shorter. it seemed to never end, and the plot seemed quite weak. i'm sure the concept was good initially, but it fell flat! what happened to kevin costner? has he had a good movie since bull durham? i wanted to go postal watching this flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Book","review":"One again the movie makers have taken a wonderful book and carved, maimed it up in the name of Hollywood. Spend your money on the David Brin's book, not this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Postman=Post Mortem","review":"How the [heck] did this film ever make any money? I love Kevin Costner. His roles in Robin Hood and Dances W/ Wolves were humorous only when it was written to be so, rahter than his whole character being a complete joke. The worst part about this piece of scum is that it never ends. My friend and I had to beat the crap out of each other to stay conscious. The villain/general, whatever he is is so scary. This movie would have been more entertaining if you saw all of the characters suffer a painful disease all in one sitting. If I ever see this title on a strangers, or God forbid a friend's DVD rack, I will discreetly place it in the trash and write them a check for their trouble. Not even worth an empty star if it were possible to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon screws customer again","review":"Is there any point in pre-ordering from Amazon? In instances such as with THE POSTMAN, they show the price at $ 17.99 and you make the mistake of ordering it. They then lower the price to $ 14.99 a week later, but still two weeks before the item ships. Do they give you the lower price.....ARE YOU CRAZY? Then one week after it comes out, it is now $ 12.99. Conclusion. For reserving a copy with Amazon, the customer pays more than anyone else. This is done over and over and over by Amazon, or atleast as much as their wallets will allow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time...","review":"I rented this movie this weekend with my wife and a really good friend. By reading the description of the film my wife thought this movie must be nice, so we agreed to give it a try. What a waste of time! First there is too much unecessary violence, second the story line is just stupid and retarded. American Postmans, with guns, are restoring the goverment and saving the world from evil. What a great tale! We basically could not finish the movie... it deserves less then a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever","review":"This is absolutely, beyond a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen. I shook my head in disbelief that they could actually make something so terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Postman","review":"I received this item quickly.

This movie still has no clue. I'm among few that thought \\"Waterworld\\" was a great film. There was no cheerleading, pep talks, and idealism in that one. Today it seems laughable that scavengers would mourn the corrupt US government and find inspiration in postal delivery. The love story doesn't work. The villain doesn't work. Even a child could see the script was far too long. The last scene is beyond silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"...The plot is sound. The acting is good. It has some good action. I loved this movie the first time I saw it. When I had a chance to get it on DVD I jumped at the chance. Costner's character is a classic reluctant hero, dragged into the role because of a lie he concocts to get food and lodging for the night.See it and judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too darn long, and Costner has the charm of a wooden totem p","review":"I saw this movie only when the local video store had run out of copies of the more recent hits that I went in there to rent. Overall, I would say that the plot isn't all that bad, it's just that the theme is basically \\"The Road Warrior\\" set in the Pacific Northwest instead of the sandy desert.There is an incredibly boring and almost unwatchable love scene that eats up about 45 minutes that I'd rather spend watching Barney videos with a bunch of three-year-olds, because after about 5 minutes of that particular scene, we GET THE MESSAGE that Costner's character is falling in love. No need to drag it out further.All in all, without that scene, the movie would have moved a lot quicker and perhaps not garnered the horrible reviews it received."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Kevin Costner apdaption could save his career.","review":"Kevin Costner found the David Brin book and turned into a 3 hour film, And it could had saved his box office career. Costner is a Drifter without a name, An Shelter seeking Con-man of a devastated America, He discovers a Mail Man's uniform and decides to re-store the wrecked country, and Combat General Bethelem and his Hell-born Holonists."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER GREAT BOOK TURNED TO HOLLYWOOD S**T","review":"My friends and I were elated to hear the news : a David Brin book was being made into a movie, and it was the Postman!!! We were so hyped to see the adaptation. We sat in the theater, watching, with a gradual numbness creeping in to our brains, as half an hour into the movie, one of us turned to the other and asked, \\"Have we gotten to the book yet?\\"\\"Nope\\", came the whispered reply.Folks, this movie may seem passably ok to most of you, so I can't totally trash it...but please, even if you don't normally think of yourself as literate, go read the book by David Brin, a gifted author, instead of this 'adaptation' by a director whose better works seem now to have been flukes. You won't regret it. But you may come to hate this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A positive tale of the basic goodness of people.","review":"The Postman was a really wonderful movie. It shows the courage and basic goodness of people if they are given hope of a brighter future. I was a little leery about watching it, not normally liking post-apocalyptic movies, but with Kevin Costner starring I was willing to give it a try. I was so glad I did, because I just loved it. It was a really good story and very well done. And I loved the ending - it does leave you with \\"hope\\". Critics: go join up with Bethlehem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Postman","review":"Was a good movie my husband loves this movie . So I purchased it for him.

Enjoyed all of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies Ever","review":"I felt I deserved a medal after sitting through this horrible movie. Think of every cliche you could ever think of and you could have written this movie yourself. Apparently, a nuclear war has taken place and Americans have taken to living in small communities while one man attempts to terrorize these villages with his band of renegades. But who comes along to save the day? Kevin Costner! We see Kevin bathed in firelight, we see Kevin riding horseback with the sun on his face, we see Kevin, well we just basically see too much of Kevin. He's a rebel you see...he just wants to be left alone but ultimately he has to do the right thing. Oh please! I would not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Post Apocalyptic Boredom","review":"I had to write this review when I saw that there were several people actually rating this film at 5 stars. Seriously you should take your pills and your friends in the white coats will be coming by later on to check on you, until then please refrain from using your PC as we are all in danger of the obliteration of good taste.The Postman is a very boring film with terrible story line. One of the most conspicuous flops of the decade and there is good reason for it. Kevin Costner plays a drifter who tries to unite isolated communities to fight against an oppressor by reviving the long-dormant postal system. In other words this a boring post apocalyptic science fiction story about a man who delivers a bag of post for three hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad ...","review":"I love post apocalypse themes ... this is so bad.

Corny cornball cornation corniness corn.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing worse than the post-apocalypse...","review":"Wow, really consider not watching this movie. I'll watch anything post-apocalypse themed, and the idea here, of rekindling a mail/communication system in a destroyed society, is very interesting... it's just this movie does such a horrible job of it.The upside is very beautiful cinematography of the pacific northwest, and lots of great assemblage of post-apocalyptic cavalry that are worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Underrated Films of All Time","review":"This is one of the most underrated movies of all time. The Postman is not just your average post-apocalyptic scenario. It is a deeply emotional and philosophical film about the power of hope. What I love about this movie is that it shows how something very simple-- mail-- can become a symbol for everything that makes us human and for everything that makes us American. Yes, its a little long, and yes, the ending requires a slight suspension of disbelief. But the movie is good enough that you wont notice the length, and moving enough that disbelief hardly even enters the mind. I love this film, and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you feel about the USPS?","review":"If you get a warm, fuzzy feeling when you here \\"United States Postal Service\\" then you might like this movie.Otherwise, forget it. I don't think I have ever laughed so hard as when the serious music sets in when Kevien Costner sees the USPS badge, as if his soul has been re-awakened.Maybe his next film should be \\"The Librarian\\" who saves the world from evil polluters by collecting fees on overdue books from the bad guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Listen to the Sheep...See this Movie...","review":"This is one of the most wonderful films I've seen in years....keep in mind that this is not a Western! This is a post apocalyptic tale of courage and defiance of tyranny! This movie is unpredictable and well thought out. It is a symbol of how humanity is hanging on by a thread to all it's materialism and selfishness. One wrong choice puts us back a couple of hundred years. It also proves that knowledge and communication are the keys to cultural evolution! In my view this film is by far Kevin Costner's best work. Watch his work without any prerequisite notion enforced by critics or other sheep who bombard your mind with their own subjective opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely post-apocalyptic...","review":"...and yet as bad as the film was, I liked it. No, Costner can't do Shakespeare, not even a little. No, General Bethlehem wasn't an interesting villain. The film dragged, the Postman spent nearly all of it on the run and at the very end magically appeared with an army behind him, and Tom Petty's part was funny (such a stoner) but too short.For me, what worked was the theme of a man who doesn't believe in himself working miracles partly by deception and partly by being misunderstood and idealized. I liked the struggle with which the Postman finally takes on the mantle of responsibility. I liked that the enemy movement was called \\"holnest,\\" a logical outcome of our manic obsession with \\"wholeness.\\" And I liked the gun-wielding girlfriend.Seems like we could all learn from the new \\"Rule One: No More Killing.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"the postman","review":"Good movie.

From that point onward the three heroes (including a woman) are combined into the Cosner character (of course)---because we just can't compete on the screen with him being THE hero. If you loved the book you will hate the movie. If you never readThe Postmanthe book (which is terrific) then you will just find this movie ponderously boring. I wouldn't pay $5 to see it. Buy the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true seat squirmer","review":"Oh, how I kept waiting for something exciting to happen in The Postman. And did I wait a long time or what? 3 hours, and nothing of passive interest occurred. There's almost nothing worth watching in this movie. For one thing, who would let Kevin Costner as lead actor? I don't want to offend the man, but his acting is getting a little weaker as each film of his rolls by. The Postman is easily more dull than his last post-apocalyptic \\"epic\\" Waterworld, though not quite as stupid. Still, The Postman is bland, and too arrogant and cheesy to be entertaining. The action sequences are a little too short to generate any excitement and the dialogue is laughably bad. Stick with Mel Gibson's Mad Max series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"The Postman was way too long, boring, and the plot was quite, well, pathetic. Sorry, this movie sinks as low as a movie can sink. I admire Kevin Costner's performances, but even he couldn't save this snoozer. The Postman is a movie not worth making in the first place. I left the movie theater halfway through the movie and got my money back, and waited for HBO to air it to see the end. I shouldn't have watched the end, you can tell what it is at the halfway mark in the movie. The plot is so incredibly thin that it makes the plot of Bloodsucking Freaks look ingenious, and that's not saying much. If you can't stand boring, plotless movies (who can...) don't see this (this means EVERYONE! DON'T SEE IT!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a complete waste of time.","review":"Midway through this movie, I felt like ejecting it from the VCR and throwing it out the window. I could have saved myself 1 l/2 hours or sheer boredom had I done so. The acting was not believable; the plot was heavy-handed; and the dialogue was worse. The only reason I am giving it one star is that zero is not an option. I used to be a big Kevin Costner fan, but a few more movies like this one and I will not only not go to the theatre to see his movies, but I will not rent them either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"This movie is so poor that the details are not worth going into. If you liked WaterWorld or Starship Troopers, you'll love this one.Unfortunately, this movie is based on a good sci-fi story of the same name by David Brin. I receommend the book, but cannot say this movie is worth watching on any level.For the record, most of the \\"stunning vistas\\" seen in the movie are matte paintings."},{"rating":"1","title":"BURN IT!","review":"The backers of this movie could have put the money they put up for it to better use by burning it all in a fireplace, along with the script. The premise, dialogue, and acting are all less than worthless. This has to be one of Costner's worst films ever, and that is saying alot. Though it is too late to do something else with all that went into making this film, it is not to late to do justice to this film. Every copy of this fim should go on a bonfire.

The large majority of Road Rallies in the US are not of this type and the book does not venture to explain that there are in fact many types of Road Rallies and that it is narrowly focused on a pretty obscure type.

They do not have an open enough curve to fit around the slightly wider than barbell handles on machines, and the hook is too long relative to where it attaches around the wrist.

Taina Elg, of course, both naieve and feminine and at the same time, a match for Kenneth More who, while expressionless at times, nevertheless plays a man of the world who refers to Taina Elg (Miss Fisher), his captive audience via handcuffs, as \\"Fisher\\". And when those stockings are removed in the guest house, it is sexual tension without crudeness at it's best. The picture also captures accurately the country side of England & Scotland as well as steam transport of the time, an innocent society in a world gone by. Made in 1959 and 48 years young. The see-sawing nature of their relationship works powerfully, dislike to respect,neutrality to love, and sets it apart from other productions of The 39 Steps. There is only one 39 Steps for me...... ah yes, Kenneth More and Taina Elg, a couple if ever there was one. Maybe Kenneth More can act after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here are a few of my favorites:","review":"The Lady Higher Up is a conversation between the Statue of Liberty and the goddess of the moon.Sound and Fury is a punny dialogue between an author and his secretary.Tommy's Burglar satirizes love-conquers-all plots such as Girl of the Golden West.A Comedy in Rubber is a commentary on people who come out of their houses to see traffic accidents and other minor events.If you recall the man who prosecuted his parents for raising him wrong, you may agree that \\"The Guilty Party\\" was a presage of that event.The Tail of a Tainted Tenner and The Rubber Plant's Story have unusual narrators."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely album from a real musician","review":"One of my favourites, she has a lovely voice and a real feel for the piano.

There's little in the way of goals, little detail, and long moments of boredom and frustration.The first thing that fools you is the character art on the cover. The actual character sprites in the game look like those plastic toys that come with legos and the rest of the game is equally as unimpressive. I liked the idea of designing a character with stats and such but I never really understood at the end what made every character so special. All I seemed to do was run around and bop monsters.I rarely give bad reviews, but in this case I son't want a consumer to be fooled into thinking they're buying a game on par with a lot of the other anime-esque RPGs out there like Final Fantasy. This is really just a mindless game of 'kill the monster' and 'follow the leader' as you wind your party from encounter to encounter. Unless you can buy this game very cheaply it's really not worth your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is total [garbage]. Go buy Final Fantasy 7/8","review":"Oh how I wish I could curse in this review. It would makeexpressing my feelings so much easier. I will sum them up now. DON'TBUY THIS IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY. After ten minutes with this game you will be ready to scream, vomit, and break the cd into many small little pieces. The graphics are terrible. The story is bland. The battle system [is lacking]. There isn't even good collision detection. Your party will bunch up until it looks like a huge piece of Fruit Stripe gum. My real score is a quarter of a star which they get for including a functional uninstaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Well as for the accents, they are just normal Monaghan accents, you know American accents are sometimes difficult to understand for us. I loved this film. Sometimes you are laughing and then suddenly you feel so bad for laughing. It didn't drag, and I thought all the actors were fabulous. It's disappointing it didn't get the audience recognition it deserved. It didn't even get to the number 1 spot in Ireland because of Titanic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Comedy Chronicles a Boy's Descent into Psychosis","review":"I had no idea what I was getting into when I watched this. Heartbreaking, darkly comic, but undeniably realistic, this film shows a fairly resourceful preteen boy's coping skills cruelly overcome by his family's misery and his best friend's abandonment. Francie's desperate fantasies that his friend Joe still cares about him, and his quickly-masked moments of devastation when those fantasies are crushed, are beautifully acted by young Eamonn Owens (and beautifully directed by Neil Jordan). Although the climax is shocking, the plot points leading up to it require no suspension of disbelief. The humor that pervades both the narration and the young Francie character makes you chuckle even as your heart aches. A unique and brilliantly-done film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Adaptation","review":"Unrelenting. A trip into insanity reminiscent of \\"Heavenly Creatures\\" & \\"The Tin Drum\\" but still very much its own creation. Here, Neil Jordan (who directed \\"The Crying Game\\" & \\"Interview with the Vampire\\") brings Patrick McCabe's novel to film, and does so wonderfully. This is the story of a little boy with a vivid imagination, a strong sense of loyalty and yes...a murderer in the making. (The title of the film should be taken literally) If you have a weak stomach, don't see this film. It is violent and might gross out some people. However, all of these devices are there for a reason and are never gratuituos. The lead performer, one Eamonn Owens, is amazing in the role of Francie Brady. This kid should get a damn Oscar for this! The music selections are awesome, and the cinematography breath taking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are the real sick minds allowed to make movies?","review":"This astonishingly sicko film is all dressed up in an ostentatious veil of socio-political comment in a masterfully deceptive attempt to justify unabashed glorification of violence, delinquincy, and nearly every form of perversity imaginable that the film-makers so enthusiastically endorse. This is a terrible shame, too, because of the spellbinding performance of young Eamonn Owens. I mean, how often do we see a child in a larger-than-life role--and pull it off so remarkably, to boot? Of course, the fact that his performance IS so appealing only adds to the dangerous effect that this latter-day \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" contributes to the increasingly bloodthirsty appetites of today's youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could you repeat that one MORE time, please?","review":"I have a real talent for being able to pick my way through heavily internationally accented English. Visiting from Tokyo or Budapest and really don't speak English at all? No problem. Imagine my surprise when I couldn't understand fully 75% of the dialogue in \\"The Butcher Boy\\". Aside from this, \\"The Butcher Boy\\" is my most excruciating movie experience since Cronenberg's \\"Dead Ringers\\". In both cases, when the lights came up, I said to myself, why did anyone even bother to make this movie. No lesson learned, no entertainment received. Wretched, bombastic waste of time. The critics said they loved this picture. I don't believe a word of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, difficult to watch","review":"Francie Brady is an exuberant, rambunctious gay preteen living in Cold War Ireland, with an abusive father, an insane mother, and neighbors and well-wishers with various nasty hidden motives. His one ray of hope is his boyfriend, Joe Purcell, but then Joe leaves him for another boy (a gift of goldfish becomes the emblem of betrayal), and Francie's descent into madness begins. It's an exuberant descent into madness, too, with violence that always comes as a shock, making the film fascinating but difficult to watch, more important than enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A barf inducer","review":"One of the most horrible films I have ever seen. I didn't expect to be disapointed by such a wonderful director and set of actors; but the story is simply gross.I'm sure the kid actor is very talented but I hated the character he plays. Everyone is repulsive in their own special way.Don't watch this film while eating anything - or if you want to keep your food down in your stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Sound and Fury","review":"This is one of the most incomprehensible, indulgent movies ever made. It is full of sound and fury with endless shouting and swearing in impenetrable Irish brogue. Nobody's actions make any sense. If you like vandalism, perhaps this movie will appeal for its defecation scene.This is a movie for bigots who hate the Irish and want to see every negative stereotype about them on screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Film","review":"This movie actually starts off kind of slow, BUT once it get going it actually get very good.This is a Haunting tale of a young boy names Francis Brady from Ireland. He goes through alot of emotional problems as a young boy and seeks help from the virgin Mary who is played by the gorgeous Sinead O'Connor. Sinead plays this part perfectly, especially with the abuse she experienced in her childhood....Eventhough, this movie is very serious, it has a light hearted feel about it but this doesnt take away from how powerful this film is. This is one movie where you will say \\"Wow\\" at the end. A MUST see film! Oh, the soundtrack is quite good... If you like Sinead O'Connor, she performs \\"The Butcher Boy\\". Nice little tune I'd have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time","review":"I've been waiting for this movie for ages,It's incredible that it took 10 years to finally come to DVD.I loved this movie,if you haven't seen it and like films like Heavenly Creatures you're going to love this.I just hope the DVD edition does justice to the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please release this movie on DVD","review":"I love this movie and think Francie is the coolest character ever.

It didn't happen. I have sat entranced through MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, so I have an open and generous mind for a movie --- but Butcher Boy did not work for me. Some boyhood-surrealist themes work ---- CINEMA PARADISO-- but with those you know you are watching surrealism; Butcher Boy never establishes its genre.I also am uncomfortable with the movie's un-judged acceptance of a boy \\"hero\\" whose response to a father's brutality is to adore the father and glibly rechannel his true feelings into brutally murdering another woman --- hello? I thought we had dealt with this kind of neurotic evasion a long time ago. Nothing I saw in the movie suggests that Neil Jordan is conscious of what he's saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"I may have erred but I left before I got any older","review":"I don't know.

When I returned the item I was only refunded a portion of the cost of the dress and none of the shipping cost. When I complained the vendor stated nothing was wrong with the product and I would not be refunded the full price. I asked if he had even looked at the exposed raw edges of the neckline.

The elastic in the sleeves was so tight that my skinny 5 year old couldn't get her arms in the sleeves. The front of the dress gapes and is extremely low cut. The velcro was missing in the back.

There are typos everywhere and there is no overall theme to tie these random chit-chatty stories together. A few of his stories are funny, but for the most part, this is a total yawn, and the celebrity bits are skimpy and boring. Steven Cojocaru's life, on which this book goes into a fair amount of detail, is also rather uninteresting. I got this for free at the book launch in Beverly Hills or else I never would have bothered. Don't waste your money on this. Check it out from the library or wait for it to come out in paperback. There must be better tell-all glamour-world books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"How did this thing get published? Steven Cojocaru looks like a chicken that has just undergone shock therapy and he's actually mocking other people's fashion sense. When I saw the cover I thought this was satire. Alas, Cojocaru is writing in all seriousness.The book tells the story of how he, a nobody with questionable taste gets to interview celebs and mock them. Steven Cojocaru's life story isn't interesting, his gossip is stale and his observations aren't particularly enlightening. This book will be on the 99 cent rack in 6 months. If you've just got to read it now go to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom from a boor","review":"Steven Cajocaru has no business commenting on the fashion choices of others.

This was the biggest waste of paper ever (and mind you, without the added highlighted quotes taking up most of the page ...) Really no inside scoop on anyone or anything, much less the author himself. A series of \\"aren't I cute\\" quotes that made me feel quite empty at the end.

However, about 85% of this skimpy (165 pages) journal is about his transformation into an 'oddity' rather than the uglier duckling (or as he says on the last pages; from a scale of 1-10 he went from a 1 to a 5). The other 15% is just filler...dropping a celebrity name here and there in bold print, mind you (he must have smartly sensed the average reader would be skimming this dread, and really, there's not much to skim). Literally, that is all there is - until he shares his new-found wisdom on the last page; \\"beauty is only skin deep - it's what's inside that counts\\". Truly profound.How anyone can make experiences on the Red Carpet seem so lifeless and dull is beyond me. On the book jacket, it says that this is Cojocaru's first book. Hopefully, it will be his last."},{"rating":"1","title":"*yawn* And?","review":"Sure, it's funny. Sure, there's a juicy story or two. And? What's the point? This book serves no purpose.

Things like how to find the grain on knits and how to replace a zipper are just two chapters I found helpful. This book is a compilation of articles from Threads magazine, a publication I highly recommend. It was published in the 90's, so some of the chapters are dated, but they don't detract from the usefulness of the book. Most of the information in the book is timeless. Taunton published a number of books that are compilation of Threads articles, but I buy one whenever I see one. I'd recommend this book for any sewer's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Usable with modifications","review":"As was noted in another review, the design of this cable could definitely use some work. The decorative corners on the end of the retractable cord that plugs into the pentagonal plug head get in the way if the place where it goes into your device is wider than the pentagon itself.However, since the projections on the corners are just decorative and not functional, I took a Dremel tool and ground them down at about a 45 degree angle. That solved the problem of connecting one of the mini plugs to my e-reader.If this had come with properly designed plugs I would have given it 5 stars, because it works perfectly and makes a great travel companion because I can use it for multiple devices without carrying multiple cables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revelation","review":"I am using \\"Revelation\\" by C.M.

Although some of the problems are nice, the book itself blows. The topics are not covered in depth at all, kinda reads like an outline of another book rather than an independent textbook. So many topics are missing or the important parts of topics are just ignored (how can you not cover electron spin precession!?!) Well all I gotta say is that I wound up reading Feynman's Lectures On Physics and Eisberg and Resnick instead. Eisberg and Resnick is one of the best books that I seen on an intro to QP(it is very wordy, but you get all the nice detail, be it hard or easy). So I can't say F&T is a good book, but I'll give it 2 stars for the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description is wrong.

The first was such a disappointment, I almost didn't read this book, but I had purchased them at the same time. Sunlight seemed heavily borrowed from Starman (movie and TV series), thus lacking much in the way of originality. Lainey didn't impress me, and, while I did rather like Michah, I couldn't get engaged in the plot (which included a rather bizarre evil scientist, and characters that didn't really 'fit'.) I ended up skipping to the end without feeling I missed much in the middle. Moonlight, on the the other, started off quite well - the birthing of the vampire was novel to me. 2000 years later, however, the contemporary story was rather pedestrian, mared by Andrianne naivete, and Navarre's goodness.

From the title, I expected that the book would be designed for people who are short on time--written concisely and able to be read in short chunks. However, just leafing through the book you can see that there is page after page of solid narrative. There are almost no concrete ideas for what to do with little bits of time one might find.

The powerful and positive impact of reading aloud to children, and continuing to read to children as they age, is discussed throughout this book. Reading aloud is validated as time well-spent in the classroom and at home. The text is written in a personal, enthusiastic, straight-forward style which I found appealing. Reading Magic would be a wonderful book to recommend to parents as it does not contain \\"teacher talk\\". This book is also filled with practical advice to support student reading at home or school, and at varied ages.A very helpful book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very irritating book","review":"I read aloud to my kids all the time. I probably spend 30-60 mins a day on average doing so. I agree that reading aloud to kids is very important. I still cannot recommend this book to anyone. I find it difficult to accept the opinions of someone who bases most of her theory on having taught her ONE child to read. Yes, that's correct, she only had one child and this child learnt to read almost by osmosis. She must have been very lucky and had an awful lot of time on her hands. If you want to read a whole book on how reading enormous amounts to children will seemingly teach them to read without phonics then this is the book for you, and you probably believed it anyway. If you want some practical advice backed up by evidence then I suggest Jim Trelease's book \\"The Read Aloud Handbook\\".

In his 5.5 years, I have barely missed a day reading. Although he loves to be read to, he is really struggling to learn to read on his own. And to imply, that if a parent had just read the right books, with the right tones...then it would be a piece of cake is setting up a lot of parents (myself included) for a lot of frustrationg.Learning to read for most kids is hard.

The DVD contains no extras (although some newer episodes do contain laughable text trivia, ha!) The transfer is mediocre at best, and lastly the packaging is cheap. I recently purchased \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" on DVD, wonderful transfer, wonferful packaging, many extras including a booklet. Is it really too much to ask that the series be treated with a little respect, how about some extras behind the scenes footage? a director or author voice over? maybe an interview with some of the surviving cast?

As I said, I'm a jiu-jitsu brown belt, so it is hard for me to bracket that experience, though; it might be great ground instruction for someone with no ground experience.Besids the techniques, Grover is certain to explain principles and give drills.

At the end of the season, he announced a switch to Yamaha for 2004. Few were expecting him to win from the outset, and expectations for the first race were enormous ... and we get 4 minutes of race coverage! Not just for this race, but pretty much the rest of the season, we get less than 5 minutes per race.On the 2001 DVD, each race was given 8 or 9 or even 13 minutes. The trend has grown worse each year, and the 2004 review hit a real low.

The legendary singer plays a guitar-wielding Confederate spy in this low-budget clunker from B-movie maestro Sam Katzman. Poor Roy looks lost in his only starring role - weighed down by a terrible soundtrack and Katzman's shoddy production values. Originally intended for Elvis Presley (who wisely turned it down), \\"The Fastest Guitar Alive\\" is bad enough to kill any rock icon's film career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roy Orbison's big mistake","review":"The mistake isn't this film, but the decision that led to it.In early 1965, Roy Orbison left Monument Records - where he had his biggest success - for MGM Records, partly so he could try his hand at movies. His recording career promptly skidded downhill (at least in the US), and this silly Western comedy was the only film he completed; he's adequate enough, but when he's not singing he seems bland and colorless.

By the third, the blue plastic \\"Ready\\" indicator had popped out of the socket. The sandwiches took a while to heat, and it really never got hot enough to get the sandwiches crispy.

So, finally, I have gotten around to reading the first couple novels that the series is based on. They have both been quite good, although it is somewhat jarring to see some of the many liberties taken, when going from book to screen. Anyhow, this is another good installment in the series and furthers the exploits of these characters, told from the point of view of the main character, Sookie Stackhouse.

Apparently, the local vampires in Dallas have need of Sookie's special talent to find a kidnapped member of their nest. Finding Farrell becomes more than Sookie bargained for.Though not quite as good as the first novel of the series, this mystery was impossible to put down. The author developed all of the characters quite a bit more and added some new ones that I hope to see in future novels. I read this one from start to finish in a single long sitting.

Sookie was strong and brave in book one, not that she's not in this book, but, if you doing someting bad and you doing it against a vampire, then you deserve death, sorry just my feeling. In book one Sookie meets a vampire, something she's been wanting to do when they(the vampires)began to mainstream. So she meets him, fall into sex, not love, trust me, it's all about the sex and the way he treats her which is excellent for a dead man. I know some men who are breathing and they don't treat you like Wonderful Bill,(that's his name). Well sookie and Bill go off to Dallas for a very interesting adventure. You read the rest.

Sookie: kept on arguing with Bill, breaking up with him and getting back together; every 5 pages she had the best sex of her life, every 4 pages she got beaten up and mentioned how strong she was, I guess to justify more beating; got aroused by at least 4 characters.After reading this book, somehow, I feel that I wont enjoy the show that much anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"no so much","review":"this book was not good compaired to the first book & esp the 4th.. it was boring but i did like her going to dallas, it didn't keep me on my toes like the first book but i kept reading bacause i am a HUGE fan of true blood i wanted to see what was going to happen"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best vampire series yet!","review":"I am a huge romance fan and a huge horror fan.

There's Sookie, a cocktail waitress in a small southern town. Sookie is a southern girl with plenty of small time southern charm. She also has a huge heart which keeps her in trouble, especially since she just happens to be dating a vampire named Bill.

I tend to either like them less (if the novelty has worn off) or more (if the already established characters and setting allow the writer to do so much more). Thankfully, Living Dead in Dallas is the latter. As I have a weakness for episodic television, I love books in a series. The funniest, sweetest and saddest lines in tv and books always come from well-established characters. (spoiler alert) Harris takes the reality of vampires to a new level as they face off against a conservative church who preaches vampire hatred. The storyline is simultaneously a metaphor and a possible reality, and I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"I'm late with my review as I read this book years ago but even now that I have started to reread all books LDID is still one of my all time favourites.

I think it's because I was now familiar with the down home narration of Sookie Stackhouse, and the characters are really beginning to grow in interesting directions, particularly Vampire Eric. Comparisons have been made to Anne Rice for the obvious reason, but the heroine of this series comes across more like a sassy Southern version of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Milhone, than any of the tourtured souls in the Anne Rice world."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 & 5 Stars for these books?

I'm going to give the books time to grow on me only because the show on HBO is great and I can't wait to see what happens. People keep telling me to stick with it because the later books are better reads , and I'm going to try my best, but good gosh the books are not that great.

When I'm done reading the entire series and if I change my mind I will also change my review, but as of right now this series gets a 2 Star from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story continues","review":"I enjoyed this one as much as the first. It might not be a good read-alone, since the relationships might not make as much sense without having read the first one.

There are several events that seem set up for an appearance in a later book and will enjoy reading more then. The idea of bars selling blood (warmed in a microwave?) is getting more normal. <G>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Follow-up","review":"This book was just as good as the first in the series.

Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the first...","review":"Sometimes, after the first book in a series, any series, the quality seems to drop. In a vampire series the standards are very HARD to keep up. In most vampire series the second is always kind of weak when compared to the first or even the third.Not here. Living Dead In Dallas by Charlaine Harris is great. Why? Not only does she draw in new material, new characters, new settings and a couple of plots but she also is daring enough to make her characters feel real, with flaws, merits and desires.Sookie Stackhouse is a real person with real needs and real fears. You can understand what she wants, what she is feeling and what she wants. You can't help but cheer her on and get upset when bad things happen to her.I WILL be buying the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd of the series & just keeps getting better!","review":"Wow!

It is funny and exciting a definite must for vampire lovers. This book is hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Be Better","review":"Part of me really wants to like these novels. They are a refreshing mix of mystery and horror in the vein of the Anita Blake novels (back before Anita became obsessed with nothing but sex, sex, sex). I'm really drawn to the two main characters, Sookie and Bill. In Sookie we have a great heroine who is reluctant to be a heroine. In Bill we have an interesting vampire with a history that dates back to the Civil War. With this novel we finally get to learn a little more about Bill's family -- his human family -- and what happened to their descendants. What really irks me about these novels is the writing. At times it is very immature and annoying. Be that as it may, I've really enjoyed these novels and their Southern setting. If you're looking for a new take on the vampire/mystery genre, check out these novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just terrible","review":"I was able to enjoy the first book in the series because I like he TV series. I slogged through it to see the differences between it and the adaptation. It was a great idea, but a terribly pulpy read. Harris just isn't a good writer, though I will give her credit for coming up with some great scenes, twists, and characters. Remember, creating all those bits don't make a well-written book.Now, to the second book in the series, forget about it. Horrible. Shallow, weak storytelling that is often lazy and certainly wold have been rejected by most canceled soap operas. Avoid at all costs if you enjoy the TV series, as it will only reveal spoilers without revealing anything worth writing about."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this book!","review":"I love the way Charlaine Harris brings Sookie and the other charecters to life.

The plot was interesting and fast-paced, and I enjoyed immersing myself into the world of Sookie Stackhouse.

Luckily neither of those is true and this series is becoming one of my more enjoyable guilty pleasures. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the first!","review":"So now I am beginning to see what some of the fuss is about...I wasn't seeing it in the first book! This book is much better than the first. I think you also have to get use to Harris' writing style.In this book Sookie is more likable, Bill isn't as creepy and Eric is in more of the book which is a plus! Also, Jason (Sookie's brother) isn't a total ass like he was in the first book! There was a lot more action as far as vampires and supernatural beings are concerned and less about the people of Bon Temps. Bill and Sookie's relationship seems to get a little better, but now that Eric is in the picture Bill better get with the program! I really love Eric's character and thought he brought a lot of excitement to the book!I will definately be reading the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sookie rules!","review":"I won't repeat the plot summary of this book. But I think you should know that Sookie Stackhouse is a GREAT character, and the other folk of Bon Temps and Shreveport make the story roll on, too.

Especially Sookie's time in Dallas. That being said I knew there would be some differences but just didn't know how much til I started to read and let me say this is book has to be my favorite so far.I loved the inclusion of other supernaturals in this book but they are more hidden where as the vampires are all about out in the open. I wish they could have incorporated more of the side characters in this book into the series would have made for some interesting TV.And can I say I just love how in the books Eric and Sookie's relationship is blossoming more, If you haven't guessed by now but I am all for Team Eric.

Never really was a fan of AP and hated the fake southern accent of most of the cast. Kudo's to Layfaette, Tara and Eric actors for making this watchable.Thought surely the directors had messed up yet another good author's work but after reading three books, it still has not managed to create any spark of interest.

The first and last portion of the book concern a murder in Bon Temps and the problems caused by a Maenad. Sandwiched in between is Sookie and Bill's visit to Dallas in search of a missing vampire, thought to have been kidnapped by the anti-vampire Fellowship of the Sun. I enjoyed the the Dallas story, but didn't find the other story very interesting; the introduction of the maenad as a plot device being pretty pointless. I also find the Eric/Sookie/Bill love triangle to be a little tiresome. The second season of 'True Blood' is much better, with more Jason (who is my favourite character on the show) and a bigger and much more menacing role for the maenad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living dead in dallas","review":"Five stars!!!!

The body language he uses is different from some of the round pen teachers. More importantly, he combines \\"Obey Me and Love Me\\" in the same sentence. In some ways, he also teaches us to be better people. If you want to be followed, be someone worthy of being followed. Carry yourself like someone worthy of being followed.His model goes back centuries to the training system of the Knights Templar (disregarding any political considerations). Truly a remarkable horseman and a remarkable book, with many, many illustrations.As a person who works with Thoroughbreds, for whom not much is accomplished by \\"making them move\\" because of course that's what they WANT, this book sets forth a possibility that one can lead with dignity and kindness."},{"rating":"2","title":"My guide to the new way to communicate with my horse","review":"I have a so called problem horses.

At no point does Hempfling speak down to the reader - although he states his views, and the reasoning behind them, without any hesitation, and this might offend some readers who lack in open-mindedness and insight.This book is definitely \\"different\\" to the usual run of training books and as such will not appeal to some.

It stopped playing after about an hour.The ON-OFF switch did not function; I thought perhaps the table cloth was obstructing the proper ventilation. I got four bottle caps from old 2 quart bottles and put them under the four feet of the radio. This raised the radio about 1/2 inch above the table cloth. Presto! no more stopping.

Saved money and got an outstanding radio. I am very particular about my music and sound and wanted more than just a clock radio. I was looking for something that would fill the room with sound without breaking the bank on a Bose system. This was definitely the right choice. I love the radio and its very easy to use. The alarm settings are very versatile and having the auxiliary input is nice if I want to hook up an MP3 player to listen to my own stuff. I can tell a notable difference in the HD stations too.CONS: Only downside to this radio is that the LCD screen is a little to bright for my tastes, even on the dimmest setting it seems to light up the entire bedroom at night. Nothing a small piece of window tinting didn't fix though.OVERALL: Great product for those serious about their sound quality, especially if you appreciate waking up to a nice sounding stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! NO SNOOZE BUTTON!","review":"I just purchased this today and returned it today as well. The sound is great and the build quality is excellent. However, I was purchasing it to use primarily as a clock-radio in my bedroom and I discovered that it does NOT have a snooze button! You can only silence the alarm by turning it off. I was shocked... clearly if you've included an alarm then you must expect some people to use it to wake them up! Maybe there are plenty of people who can pop right out of bed without hitting the snooze bar at least once - but I'm not one of them! Too bad....because otherwise, I really liked the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!!!","review":"Even at the price of $100 at the Sony outlet store, I'm returning it tomorrow. First of all, the power block is huge, heavy and emits a slight buzzing sound. Because I purchased it as a clock radio I know this noise would drive me nuts at night. There are many HD stations on the AM and FM band here in the S.F bay area. However, even with the external AM loop antenna attached I was only able to pull in 2-3 and the most powerful, KGO, a talk radio station registered no HD signal at all. Without the antenna, reception was poor at best. Sound quality was ok, but no big deal.

Secondly I tested the demo units at my local Circuit City & Best Buy, and now my personal unit here, all received strong analog FM but only three marginal HD channels. And in all cases, the white FM wire antennas were attached already. I am even trying it w/ the TERK indoor HD Radio antenna - which pulled in an additional ZERO HD channel. Avoid TERK antennas at all cost, tried one 20 years ago which didn't do jack & I got sucked into their scam one more time. If I can edit the star rating for this Sony HD Radio, I'll change it to 2 or 3 stars, but Amazon doesn't allow me to edit that. Only this text...UPDATE: Dec 21st, 2011. As more HD stations become available, this unit is ever more practical and appreciated. Bumped up the stars to 4 now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money","review":"The concept of HD radio seems to be fundamentally flawed in that there are very few radio stations which are available in HD but not on FM.

First there is no snooze button. Second there is only one preset for alarm time. Initially as set up, when the radio awakened me in the morning, the display did not show the current time. Later I found another display option, so this problem is cleared now. Also the buyer should realize that HD (hybrid digital) radio is not a standard yet, although there seem to be several to many in my local area."},{"rating":"1","title":"two fatal flaws","review":"This radio works great under the right circumstances, but has two fatal flaws which have caused me to move it from the living room to the garage. The first is that it has no battery back up. Any electical outage or blip will loose all the stored channels, unless you plug it into a UPS meant to power computers.The second flaw is that it has no switch to turn HD on or off. If you listen to a station in a fringe area, the station will continually go between HD and regular. There is a 3 second time difference so this makes those stations unlistenable. Too bad, otherwise this would have been a great radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a Great Radio","review":"This radio has very good reception on both AM & FM with analogsignals. The HD reception is also very good when using thesupplied antennas. The radio was able to receive a total of 28AM/FM HD stations in the Los Angeles area. It's only negativefeature is that it lacks a station memory which is not lost witha power outage, requiring a new station setup operation each timethis occurs. It does have a short term memory retention of about5-10 minutes which helps for short term power outages. This radiowith its nice appearance, overall design, and price is a great radiofor those desiring a HD radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, love NO commercials and great sound from a small box!","review":"I enjoy HD radio and living in a big city actually helps in that there are many HD broadcasts that you can pick up and the clarity and NO commercials are really nice for many of the stations.

This radio looks good, but looks are decieving. The reception is poor, the poorest I have seen. And I am close to the business. Even local stations that my other HD radios picked up without a hitch, this radio had to struggle. Even fussing with the antenna, this radio could not pick up many non-HD stations. Yes, the AM was disappointing too. Of all the HD Radios I have, this was the only one I decided to return. I am not mean by giving this one star. If the radio does not pick up atations, who cares about any other feature?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"This radio works as advertised. The remote control is a nice feature. The sound quality from the HD AM and FM channels is an obvious improvement over non-HD channels. The tiny speakers do not produce much bass but the quality is adequate for a small radio. Use of an antennae, included, is a must to receive a clear signal.It would be nice if it had a digital out for connection to an external receivers/amplifiers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 'Not Ready For Prime Time' Radio","review":"I bought the Sony HD radio with high hopes. What a disappointment.I thought HD radio meant you either had a signal or you didn't - isn't that digital sound ? Certainly that's what happens with the satellite XM receiver in my car. No so here, marginal signals sound a little like someone is unwrapping thick plastic wrap and the HD fades in and out.Even the conventional signal produces lousy audio.I compared the Sony sound quality with with my least expensive 'high end' radio, a one hundred dollar Tivoil Audio single speaker system. I connected a Terk powered FM antenna to both devices and the Tivoli completely outshone the Sony. The Sony's 'surround sound' feature hardly improves a miserable level of fidelity.Save your money until Sony gets it right or buy one of their boom boxes. You will be much happier. I returned mine yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to set up","review":"This radio is difficult to use. The directions are less than clear about how to inter presets and access features. Be aware that HD radio is very sensitive to antena placement (the signal is only 500 watts). This radio loses FM about twice an hour and has never played AM at all. Do not buy this product expecting plug and play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice sound bad alarm","review":"The radio sounds great. I bought it to replace my bedside alarm clock but it is not good for that. It has no snooze button, it only has one alarm, not good for two people and you would think for the price of this radio that it would have a battery back up in case of powerage outage. If you don't care about the alarm clock it's fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This radio deliver as promised. Easy to use and sounds great. FM HD stations come in crystal clear and are easy to lock in on. Have to note the AM HD stations are a touch harder to lock in altho with the antenna place properly they come in strong and sound so much better than regular AM. Good value for the price.

That station also has HD, which also was receivable. However, I could not even hear KFBK AM(1530 kHz, 50KW), the station I wanted to hear in HD. Other radios here get many stations, including KFBK. The radio did work fine on FM, but that wasn't what I wanted to receive.I called Amazon, they sent me a return label, UPS picked it up, and Amazon issued a refund to my credit card.

It's not rigorous, but citations are given for the curious reader to examine the theoretical foundations of spectral methods."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book to be a major disappointment.","review":"I read \\"The Wall\\" a very long time ago, and recently discovered and read \\"White Lotus\\" and was absolutely bowled over by both. I was thrilled, after two such wonderful books to find \\"Antoinetta\\" and anticipated another masterpiece!Unfortunately, I have to admit that a very rare thing happened for me....I couldn't make myself finish this book. I found the characters flat and unbelievable, the plot ridiculous and the whole thing a total bore! I grant you, this may not be a fair hearing (since I only finished about half the book) but since it isn't a very long novel, I didn't think that even if I had read to the end that there were enough pages left for the author to \\"redeem\\" the first boring half.

KSR's excellent book makes for one of the most riveting reads ever. All the characters seem to be well rounded and the fact that each part of the book views events from a specific characters point of view lends to the feeling that maybe this could be a factual account. The dipping in and out of timeframes is a great way of showing the passing of time and its effects on the characters. This is one of those brilliant books that you just can't put down.

Robinson's mastery of technology speculation is showcased on nearly every page, but he does not fall into the trap of sacrificing character development for plot acceleration. The personalities and conflict among the \\"First One Hundred\\" explorers help draw you in rather than distract you from rendering the stark beauty of a planet you've never seen up close"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree 100% with eheidel's review!","review":"What's sad is that I actually DID try to read this book a second time, over a year after the initial attempt stalled after a couple of hundred pages.

But \\"Green\\" and \\"Blue\\" are next on my list. The author's detailed discription of conditions on Mars, and what we would face if we went there, are as accurate as I can ascertain from my studies in astronomy and physics. This isn't just a science fiction about Mars, but a prediction of how man's behavior will be shaped by the planet's brutal conditions, and how the planet's evolution will, in turn, be shaped by man's competance. A scientific, sociologic, pychological thriller that compels the reader to head for the sequel. By the end of the novel you realize that each color in this series represents a physical evolution of planetary conditions. Red is brought about by nature, and the colors to follow by man's inhabitation. Green and Blue sure don't look like improvements over red."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring, stupid characters","review":"I thought this book was pretty boring. I got to page 132 and gave up. They had traveled to Mars, and yet I still felt like nothing had happened. Just because you try to make a story realistic doesn't mean you should make it boring. And why do sci-fi astronauts never have any self control? They always have to have sex on these long space voyages. None of them have any moral standards. I was hoping they would spring an air leak half way through the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was Robinson's editor?","review":"Frankly, I was surprised by this book. Having read Robinson's other novels, \\"Icehenge,\\" \\"Wild Shore,\\" \\"Gold Coast,\\" and \\"Memory of Whiteness,\\" I expected that this, his first really long book, would have his usual touch for well-drawn, interesting characters. But the crew of explorers/terraform experts in Red Mars was a group of dull, tedious, one-dimensional, people that I wouldn't cross the street to chat with. I'm guessing that Robinson got caught up in the technical details, and lost the characterization skills of his shorter novels. Where was his editor this time, who should have pointed this out to him? I decided to give Green Mars and Blue Mars a pass. Maybe Robinson should get back to the California setting of his earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"store bought science","review":"Not too much happens here, I couldn't finish the book.

This book is not only a science fiction novel, it is also a social, political, cultural and economic commentary on questions, which have and always will confront humanity and provide us with challenges. Robinson's take on the colonization and teraformation (or aeroformation) of Mars, is an epic saga with incredible detail, food for thought and inspiration for the imagination!I highly recommend this book, I have already given it to about 10 different friends of mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING: ok plot, flat characters, lame prose","review":"The story opens strong, but quickly deteriorates into one of those novels that you trudge through just to finish it off. The plot's ok, but I can't believe the reviews I've read here that praise the \\"realistic\\" characters: on the contrary, I found the characters so stereotyped and flat that I found myself rolling my eyes reading about them. And if you enjoy good prose, you'll find this book a bit of a torture to read. Take a pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Award winner?","review":"I found the book extremely slow. I skimmed whole chapters where characters seemed to wander aimlessly describing the landscape. This slowed down the pace of the book and made it unnecessarily long. Robinson is certainly no Muir, I had difficulty picturing the landscapes described. Some of the characters and their interactions are interesting, but just as you get into it, Robinson cuts to describing still more landscapes. Just as you begin to like some of the characters, they get killed off left and right. I'm reading the next book because I already bought it, but if I had read Red Mars first, I wouldn't have bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Books becomes incredibly boring midway. Buy this book if you need an safe alternative to sleeping pills."},{"rating":"1","title":"The reviewers are right. It's the most boring novel ever!","review":"The reviewers are right--the amazon.com reviewers, that is. After reading Gearald Jonas's praise for this book in the NY Times Book Review, I expected great things. This writer has ZERO narrative skills. Save your money. Terrible book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One bonus star for theoretical science...","review":"I read a lot of science fiction, and typically enjoy books that work in good hardcore science, be it real, theoretical, or fantastical. This book manages to come up with a few of each. There is a great deal devoted to the science of terraforming mars into human habitable environment, and the process of human surviving in the harsh enviroment that exists today. Honestly though, Robinson would have done better writing a non-fiction essay on Mars habitation than this poor effort at a fictional story.The characters and plot lines are blurry and disinteresting. Time takes decades long leaps, with little warning and it became confusing and tedious.I had to force myself to finish it, and there is little danger of my reading the next two books in the series, or anything else from Robinson for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read","review":"No other book has ever been written like it. It's in it's own genre, not because of how good it is, but because it is simply unlike everything ever written. It brings more truth to politics than Tom Clancy ever could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melodrama Masquerading as Science Fiction","review":"If you're a new-age flower child that likes saccharine melodrama, you'll love this book. A new genre needs to be developed so that books like this (and the people who love them) do not undermine the credibility of the Hugo and Nebula awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Science- Fiction ever red","review":"It would take to many time to explain all the reasons why i loved this and the two following books. If you like hard sci-fi its a must read book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile, racist and filled with one dimensional characters.","review":"I would give this book no stars if possible (even negative stars would be better.) You don't have to read more than 20 pages of this junk to identify Red Moon as \\"it's-another-politically-correct-piece-of-garbage-agitprop-kind-of-book\\" that infests the retail bookshelves with what passes for \\"literature\\" these days.The author clearly hates whites and arabs, and it would be interesting to know the ethnicity of the author. I think we can guess.Best to spend your hard-earned money on the Classics until the new Dark Age is over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some enjoyable moments. But not quite worth the time spent reading the entire book.","review":"Pros: Robinson creates vivid images of life on Mars. For the most part, the technical aspects added an incredible amount of realism to the story. Which makes for the best kind of science fiction. I especially enjoyed the chapters that made the space elevator come alive in the imagination as we may never get to see it elsewhere.Cons: His explorations into the sociology,sexuality, and psychology of his characters were often boring,always lengthy,and sometimes unexpectedly and disturbingly crass. (i.e. not for the kids to read)If that weren't bad enough,he also attacks Christianity of all types with a sledge hammer. Declaring it repeatedly as an archaic religion for a band of greedy idiots. All other types of faith are regarded as \\"interesting\\" and \\"progressive\\". Robinson could have introduced his ideas into the story without being so heavy handed and long winded. Unfortunately he did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"is okish.... maybe...","review":"well... I read 150 pages. I would normally keep reading on, but... it wasnt good... or bad. And since I have like 30 unread books on my shelf, I decided to skip it. I was just not into it.... here is why.It is SF... barely. It is about a guy, that is very very ambitious.... who plays of stereotypes of different cultures to better himself... on Mars.The author loves to throw in random science sounding stuff... that has no bearing on anything plot wise. Was like, he had this idea about an ambitious guy, but wanted to write in based on mars, so he just added SF stuff to spice it up. I want more SF oriented stuff... but.... I didnt get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding visionary masterpiece","review":"Stan Robinson does an outstanding job of tackling one of the most talked about and inspirational next steps in the human spaceflight program. About the only thing missing is Burt Rutan and his SpaceShipOne.Character development is realistic and very detailed. You feel yourself living the lives of these characters as they embark on an amazing journey that provides discoveries not just about Mars, but about humankind itself.The technical aspects of the book are second to none. In this respect the Mars Trilogy would stand up to the most serious critics. It could be future history itself - it's that good.It is an outstanding book (and Trilogy) and comes with the highest recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sci-fi decends into bad politics","review":"Red Mars started off just dandy, with a variety of characters (a bit too one-dimensional, but hey) struggling with how to best colonize Mars. No one was a 'good' guy or a 'bad' guy - just good hard sci-fi mixed with honest ideological differences.Halfway through the book, however, it all changed. All of a sudden, Trans-national corporations are launching nukes, after buying out the United Nations. Christian fundamentalists try to dominate the colonies. A few hundred scientists on Mars discover wildly optimistic technologies, while the billions of people on Earth decend into chaos, primarily because of those darn evil trans-nationals.What started out as a balanced and interesting book jumped clear off the left end. I'll only read the sequels because I want to read all the Hugo and Nebula award winners - not because I have any hope for the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually tossed it out","review":"While the science discussed in \\"Red Mars\\" is interesting in and of itself, the author goes on and on about it instead of sprinkling it throughout the text. The result reads something more like a non-fiction description of how to get to Mars, settle there, design machinery for it, etc., but doesn't present a compelling story. A compelling story is set up in Part I (Festival Night), which is all of 23 pages, but then Part II (The Voyage Out) rears its ugly, boring head.Part II introduces various characters on their way to Mars and not one of them seems especially intelligent nor highly regarded by his or her peers. One guy, a Russian, goes around spouting philosophy and calling people names like \\"idiot.\\" In fact, he would have fit right in with those immature misfits relighting the sun in the movie \\"Sunshine.\\" After about 80 pages of \\"going nowhere,\\" I opted to pass on this version of Mars. I'll also be giving the Green and Blue versions a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring","review":"Probably the most boring scifi book. A lot of politics, very dull and boring descriptions about Mars ecology. Many text books are more interesting reading than this book.The plot is boring. Characters are dull, annoying, and uninteresting. There is no great character development here folks. Did I mention that the book is extremely boring. Don't waste your time with it unless you are stuck in an airport with nothing else to read, actually just go to sleep, and have some rest instead of reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Mars","review":"This is an excellent science fiction book that can really inspire people to become more interested in science."},{"rating":"2","title":"You should see my copy of this book.","review":"It is rarely that I almost destroy a book, but I just couldn't put this book down. Where I went it went, and the cover is almost unrecognizable. I loved every second of reading this book. My favorite parts are dog-eared. The minute I finished this incredible book I ran out and bought the sequel. It looks promising too. One downside to this book: you are almost lost to the world when you are involved in it!I am planning to be an astronaut. It was wonderful that the birth years of all the characters are close to mine. I can identify with them. This along with the wonderful way science is involved with the plot makes this story a timeless classic"},{"rating":"1","title":"Details, details","review":"If you are looking for an action packed thriller, look somewhere else. In the first 25 pages a main character is killed -- BUT then the next 250 pages trace -- in laborious, almost mind-numbing detail -- the preparations for the Mars trek, the flight itself, the setting-up of the base, opening containers of supplies and descriptions of what was in them, the step-by-step construction of buildings, the Martian landscapes, etc. This is interspersed with lectures on psychology, politics, philosophy, and various other topics. Then in the last 200 pages the population builds up on Mars, a war occurs destroying everything, and the scenes are all described in long, extreme detail. If you are a geologist, or are trying to paint scenes of Mars and need detailed descriptions, then this book's for you. If you want a fast-paced (or even medium-paced) story, you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Politics in a science fiction story","review":"A well-written and interesting book, Red Mars is not just a science fiction story, but a look at the future based on what was known at the time. The real story is not the colonization of Mars, but of the politics that surround it. The most interesting part of writing is the telling of the tale from the perspectives of the different characters. A good read, part sci-fi, part mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn, boring.","review":"When I read a book, there should be characters that I can relate to and care about. The immaturity of the characters gave the book an 8th grade/soap-opera feel. There should be a plot that excites. Not with this book. It started out good with a murder and landing but it quickly descended into scientific minutae. I'm not that interested in Mars dust or lunar cycles. I gave up and didn't finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wasn't for me.","review":"I guess that this book was not for me. I download books if they seem interesting and get good reviews. Well at least it was free because I thought it was incredibly boring. Hopefully future readers will enjoy it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I only bought the first book.........","review":"I'll make this as short as possible...........like I wish the book would have been. This read was easily twice as long as it needed to be. I got halfway through, and quit. It was so boring. I wanted, (as always), a good story, not a tedious dialog that goes on and on about every little detail involved in colonizing a planet. I can't believe this author is receiving accolades for this work. He can, in no way, be compared to any of the greats in the sci-fi field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn! Mars seems to be a straight world.","review":"Oh my, the characters are straigt. Being described during the first pages of the book, they don't stop to act in predictable pathways... if they act at all. Quite a lot of the pages are filled with boring details of technology and science. Of course technology and science are not boring, but this is supposed to be fiction, right? The action of the protagonists is being reduced to some kind of micropolitics. There don't seem to be feelings involved. Then suddenly the characters are old and so what!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Mars: Not great for an award winner!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. For an award winning book, I expected it to be tremendous. It was very slow reading and very light on real science fiction. I think it would be better for someone who liked soap operas and science fiction. Someone would really have to work on me to get me to try the sequels. I will grant that there was a tremendous amount of character development, but that isn't tops on my list for a sci-fi boo"},{"rating":"1","title":"A cliched, unscientific and boring tale of colonization.","review":"I had high hopes for this one, but they came crashing down soon after I began to read it. I did persevere and finish it, but regretted it. The characters (and it tries very hard to be a character study kind of novel) are one-dimensional and unbelievable (and I mean that in the worst way). The \\"science\\" is laughable and its perpetuation of national and religious stereotypes is inexcusable in a genre based on progressive thinking"},{"rating":"1","title":"A World-Conquering set of ideas peopled by dysfunctionals.","review":"When I pick up a Nebula award winning book I do not expect to find page after page of single dimensioned dysfunctional characters. Stanley started with a terrific set of technical ideas to portray the colonization of this red planet. Had he spent as much time with more rounded characters this would've been a terrific read. As it was, I became so bored with the characters and the repetitive landscape descriptions (ad nauseum), that I just skimmed the final 100 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled BORING Mars","review":"This book has been a huge disappointment. I keep reading it hoping a real story will develop. Yes, the science of terraforming Mars is intriguing, but all too simplistic in Robinson's account. The characters are paper thin and for the most part ANNOYING. The only real character is conveniently disposed of just as an actual plot was developing. The only reason I will finish this is is out of a hope that Frank, Maya, Hiroko and the rest of the annoying lot will somehow meet a cruel and painful death at the hands of Ray Bradbury and Edgar Rice Burroughs at the end. If you want a classic about Mars, go read Bradbury's \\"Martian Chronicles.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading!","review":"Should be read by all policy makers, economists, sociologists, psychologists, and futurists. To read this book is to understand why Arthur C. Clarke made the recommendation he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but characters are terrible and ruin it","review":"I just finished reading Red Mars and was so disappointed. This book had so much potential going into it, but in short the characters suck. The main characters in Red Mars are all part of the first 100 people to colonize Mars. You don't get to meet all 100 of them (thank god), but out of the ones you do meet there is not one of them that is likeable. This lack of any characters to get attached to or even like a little makes reading Red Mars a painful experience. There are some good ideas about Mars, the technology to live there, and ways to terraform it all presented from characters that are just not enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and yet two dimensional","review":"I read the first two books of this series when they first came out. A friend's five minute summary saved me the agony of reading the final instalment. Here are the basic problems: first, Robinson appears desperate to throw in speculative detail about the geology of Mars, which may be accurate or not but has no bearing on the story (such as it is). Second, the characters are two dimensional despite getting a huff amount of development time. Finally and worst, it's just not that interesting a story.It seems to me that some reviewers mistake sheer unreadability for worthiness. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"the theme of Terraforming Mars deserves a better author","review":"I ordered all three of these books,thinking they would be a treat. Alas, I fell asleep over Red Mars, but I finished that one, just because I hoped it would get better. But Green and Blue MArs were to much to endure, boring characters going through improbable adventures and getting immortal in the process; that is if they were not killed in the full scale war between the settlers of Mars and the bad guys from Earth that they author envisaged. Really, it was totally uninspired and to boring to endure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was incredibly boring","review":"I love science fiction and I was excited they offered a few different books for free for the Kindle. I was interested in finding some new authors to read...I will not be reading this one again.I didn't finish the entire book which is rare for me. I'm an avid reader and I can read quickly- this book was like quicksand. The deeper I got into the book the more I wanted out. I couldn't finish the book b/c it was so freaking boring. I've read a lot of science fiction and am tolerant of very descriptive passages but I kept on thinking this would of been better as a movie rather than a book and that is a first for me. The author gets so completely weighed down in his descriptions- images would of sufficed! Wtf...where was the editor on this one? I really dislike rating a book poorly b/c I realize that enjoying a book is largely subjective but I could not stand this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the raves","review":"Full disclosure: I haven't read the whole thing. I read about 450 pages before I decided I couldn't take it anymore. The endless landscape descriptions were extremely tedious. The ham fisted criticisms of capitalism got old fast. I found almost all the characters extremely obnoxious, and I couldn't have cared less what happened to them. Skip this one. the mystery about Hiroko was sort of interesting, hence the extra star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are the Robinson Reviewers in the Same Fan Club?","review":"At its best, this series is tedious and unimaginative. There are no cutting-edge ideas, the writing is pedestrian, and the characters are right out of a made-for-TV movie.After reading the many glowing reviews about this series, one has to wonder whether the publisher is on propoganda blitz or something. Many of the reviews appear to have been submitted by the same people multiple times, apparently in an effort to stuff the ballot box.The long and the short of it is that Robinson is just not a very imaginative or interesting science fiction writer. He's sort of like the sci-fi equivalent of day-time TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mars Series not Sci-Fi but earth politics on another planet","review":"It should be crime to label this series as Sci-Fi. It is a never ending story of earth-like politics on another planet. I bought the entire series expecting a story about the terra forming of Mars and ended up struggling through three books worth of tedious, difficult to read and sickening politics. Compared to something like Dune, if one would like to draw some comparison to a 'political space saga', this is poorly written and terribly boring. If you're willing to pay for the shipping fees from South Africa, you can have them for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Being intrigued by human exploration of Mars and coupled with the fact that this book was a Nebula Award winner, I eagerly purchased \\"Red Mars\\" and the other two books in the series. Big mistake! Halfway through the book and bored to tears, I quit reading it - something I NEVER do. In fact, this book was so bad that I decided instead to paint my house.If you are looking for a good hard sci-fi book on Mars, try Ben Bova's \\"Mars.\\" In the meantime, I will be trading in my Robinson books for some improvement reading - maybe a Mack Bolan book....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left wing propaganda","review":"The author spends 100's of pages trying to hide his left wing views, then half way through the second book in the trilogy he cuts loose with outright socialism and takes several nasty hacks at anyone who believes in freedom. His version of socialism of the future is so sponge brained I had to put the book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Similar to those made-for-TV movies on the Sci-Fi channel. Not very imaginative and at times, actually boring. Try the Hyperion series instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walking through five miles of swamp has to be more fun.","review":"It was all I could do to muster the enthusiasm to read while engaged with this novel. Why? Very Technical. So much so it got into the way of the story. Disguised propaganda encased in a story? Yes. The idea of the story cloaked in this book kept me reading. If you must have the experience of pain reading this book, but do not want to read it, cut off a toe with a razor. You may feel the same after is all over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booorrinnnnngg!!","review":"I had heard so much about the trilogy, with so many Hugos and Nebulas and whatnot, and being a major SF fan, I bought all three books before taking #1 for a test drive.

Every one is annoying, and the only partially interesting one croaks at the end of the first book. sigh... When I lost book #2 in a taxi with only 100 pages til the end, I didn't even bother to replace it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars is kind of generous. Might should give it 1 1/2","review":"Don't believe the high praise many give this book. The characters are all unappealing and impossible to connect too, the events are frequently unrealistic, and the book drags terribly at times. It certainly isn't all bad. Sometimes it seems as if it's about to get positively interesting but it always manages to get back off track. The idea: the first colonist on Mars deal with idealogical conflicts about how to treat this new frontier could have made a compelling book. But in this case, it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Times and I am Out","review":"Bought the trilogy a number of years ago. Started to read it twice, the second getting 160 pages in. When I saw it on Kindle, decided to give it a determined go. If you are into watching grass grow, then this book is for you. There are a large number of so so reviews recently which I would guess are people who picked this up via Kindle for free. Pages upon pages of scientific detail and meanderings. Made it nearly half way this time, but when I found myself simply turning pages looking for the end to the current dissertation, I asked myself why was I trying to keep on going. The characters simply get overwhelmed bythe scientific discourse. I mean, what is the point in reading a book where you are turning pages to avoid reading. This is not to say that this book might appeal to those who are interested in what it might take to colonize Mars, but for me, I would rather read NASA articles."},{"rating":"2","title":"the book was so intresting i fesned it in tow monthes","review":"i relly like the book becoues the chareters are will develup. i alsow think that the caharethers were so clowes to the rell thing i thoth i was reading the diery of someone on bord the ship at the time. i relly like the plot. i think the plot was relly good to. exsete it got boring sometimes. uthere then that it was ok. i relly recomend this book for a sinesnfechoun lover. i relly dont that any other tip of reader will ingow the book as much"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well done but not for me","review":"Red Mars is a little more hard sci-fi than I prefer.

Too many geographical details- the characters were unsympathetic and the story line lacked creativity. I guess I should have read one of the other colored Mars first. However, I thank Robinson from sparing me from the desire to read any more of them- my time on Earth is limited. If I were you, your time on Mars should be limited, too. This was also the last science fiction genre that I read- it made me realize that it's not for me, and for that, I also thank the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic.","review":"I wanted to stop reading this book after I had read about 20 pages, but forced myself to read about 300 pages more of it, until I decided it really wasn't going anywhere. The writing is really dry and boring, the descriptions of martian terrain are very repetitive and needlessly detailed, the characters one dimensional. What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. One of the best books I've ever read.","review":"I don't know if I can say much more than that. I started the book expecting a GOOD read (from the reviews posted in the book), but I got much more than that; I got a SIMPLY AWESOME read that far exceeded my expectations. Kim Stanley Robinson's attention to detail and his extensive scientific research demonstrated in the book is truly great. Each one of his characters are superb and seem real (And that is a great feat considering the massive amount of characters in the story). I won't go on any further, as I could ramble on all day about his insightful issues discussed (such as female inferiority in Arab culture, and Atheism vs. Christianity), and other aspects of the book. I recommend this book to anyone, not just sci-fi fans. Trust me, you won't regret taking the time to read Red Mars. It's well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Idealistic scientists settle Mars and make it like Earth.","review":"Red Mars is very strong on the inevitable political tensions that would occur in a colonization. The tension between the enviros and \\"terraformers\\" is quite vivid and the characters well drawn. I don't read much sci fi, but I'm encouraged to move to the next book in this trilogy. I'm recommending Red Mars to friends as a fascinating story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative, origional thinking, some what abstract.","review":"Nice reading.

Simply because Kim Stanley Robinson has given us a major insight on how the human condition as well geographic change can affect us as human beings.I marvel at how the author can take such an international cast and weave a story of love, hatred, isolation and geographic differences in such a way that is seems the author was there for the whole trip.I am definately looking forward to completing the other two books in the series. I will then of course expect to add my voice to those as well.Scott Olson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and pointless","review":"I am a die-hard science fiction fan and this trilogy is what I usually like -- plausible science, fully developed characters. However, the pace is not just slow, it barely moves at all, and the plot gets lost along the way. This is the third time I have tried to read it, and I still couldn't finish -- too boring. There are long, long monologs on the science, and tensions in relationships that keep you hoping for some fireworks that in many cases never materialize.These are the most boring personalities that I have seen in fiction in a long time. The story never really engages you. Spend your time reading something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long hard journey that's up and down, up and down, full of craters","review":"The only reason that I did not enjoy this long read was: it's focus on the hardcore Sci-Fi reader. I'm not saying it's a bad book, just not for me. The author crams so much geology,theology, psychiatry,topography and much more in the book that it all becomes overwhelming. He seems to remind us throughout the entire read(which I couldn't wait to end)about the same terrain over and over, the color of the sky and the types of volcanoes,mountains,craters,cracks and more craters with the same explanation. To hardcore for me. A true fan of any book about the colonization of Mars, you will love it. I couldn't wait to leave the planet.For better books based on Mars, I would suggest Robert Heinlein's \\"Red Planet\\"(see my review) or Ray Bradbury's \\"The Martian Chronicles\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did it get an award??","review":"That this novel got a Nebula Award doesn't say much for the quality of either the books in 1993 or the jury. This book was long and tedious. I kept anticipating that it would get more into the characters, who were very convoluted and confused, or into the technology and difficulties of colonizing Mars. I will not continue with the trilogy; it seems the next two are even longer and more tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising...if it wasn't for the politics","review":"A very promising premise falls flat on its face, due to too much emphasis on the phsycology of the main characters. We see very little of the scientific and engineering problems associated with colonising a new planet. Instead, we are treated to pages full of personal vendettas, political infighting and finnaly ( of all things!) civil war. Sadly, this book has alot in it about politics, and very little about the colonisation of a new world. A shame really, considering the immense knowledge the author has on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed the attention to detail but fell asleep from the action & the plot","review":"I'll make this short and to the point. I can appreciate the author's attention to the scientific and political details, however, the action and plot was a snoozer. I only read the first book of the series and do not plan on purchasing or reading any of the remaining volumes. I felt the author spent way too much time and pages giving environmental descriptions and character development and too few pages to plot and action. I found the reading laborious and dull. In addition, if I really wanted to know all of the scientific names of every crater, canyon and mountain on Mars, I would have taken Astronomy in college."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming from the perspective of a 6th grader...","review":"Well, my entire class was assigned to read this book, and I wouldn't say we hated it... but it was pretty bad.

I would suggest reading it if you are older than a junior in high school..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and tedious","review":"With this novel, Kim Stanely Robinson starts the award winning Mars trilogy.

But, it was bit of a relief to get to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull! Dull! Dull!","review":"I purchased this book because it won a Nebula award.With all due respect to Mr. Robinson, this book is dull. It is a mindnumbingly dull read because of the endless exposition. It just goes on and on and on and it takes forever for anything to happen.You'll either love this book or hate it. I didn't like it and I opted not to read the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like reading a boring textbook! Hideous Read!","review":"I love to read fun and enjoyable science fiction books. The ones I have enjoyed most are Star Wars series and the \\"Area 51\\" series by Robert Doherty. The reason I mention this is to give you a perspective of the types of books I like to read.I honestly tried to get through the first 50 pages three different times. This book sounded so interesting and it was such a painful disappointment.If you like fun and enjoyable reading, don't waste your time. This is the worst book I have read in the last 5 years. I highly recommend reading the first chapter in a book store first. I am not very good at describing a writers style, but I can assure you that you will have a strong opinion after the first chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book is a great work. Robinson is a master of weaving together near-science fact and political intrigue, all within a sweeping narrative.The characters in the book are interesting to say the least, with each refusing to be one-dimensional. Robinson's story seems to be quite feasible, in that I never found myself saying \\"No way\\" while reading the book. This book sparked an interest in me in planetary exploration like no other book has done before. I find myself visiting the NASA Mars exploration website often as a result of reading this novel.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientific Poetry","review":"Red Mars is like nothing I have read. It's a story of the first hundred people to colonize Mars. The plot is a bit predictable, but interesting nonetheless, and a sort of mystery develops early on in the book. Set in a world described in excruciating detail, I was awed by how scientifically accurate this book was, making it very believable. I'm normally not a fan of political struggles, but Kim Stanley Robinson has made the political struggles of the Red Planet worth reading about, and very intriguing. I would not call this a traditional sf work.

It drags in parts, but you can tell that the author has really researched the topic. Also, I found it interesting that someone has actually considered the politics and economics of going to Mars -- this is something we will need to think about if we are going to send a mission to Mars some day -- are we going to destroy the environment of Mars like we've destroyed the environment of Earth?I'd recommend it if you are a science fiction fan, but if you don't usually read science fiction you might find it uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning read!","review":"Robinson's complex character development is wonderful. Going way beyond the usual, characters (and Mars itself) grow and regress in unexpected ways. I fell in love with those individuals - they were so alive and humanly ornery! He skillfully creates a society that is plausible and inspiring. Psychology interweaves with geology, botany, philosophy, politics... and the scenery is breathtaking. You will be heading to the store for volumes 2 and 3 before you even finish Red Mars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at times, but too slow and unbelievable.","review":"This series had great potential, but had two major flaws; long rambling descriptions of terrain, and unrealistic expectations of science and people.

It's so boring that I was tediously trying to read through the second 100 pages, and stopped all together midway in the book. I think a good word to describe the book would be tedium. Robinson also gets too melodramatic with the characters. I can't stand any of them. This book is HIGHLY overrated and the only sci-fi book I couldn't finish, as much as I tried over half a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Mars = Huge disappointment!","review":"After all the wonderful reviews and a Nebula Award given to Red Mars I expected a lot. I fail to see the appeal of this novel. Robinson has little talent for character development leading to unbelieveable and boring characters. Out of 572 pages I would be surprised if the you could amass 25 pages of dialogue. How can you develop characters without having them interact with one another. The book is one long boring narative with spurts of minute scientific detail that add nothing to the story. I felt that Robinson was only trying to impress me with his research and depth of the scientific knowledge rather than tell me a story. Red Mars has the dubious honor of being the first science fiction novel that bore me to death. Want a good read about Mars? Read Ben Bova's \\"Mars\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Wayyyy too much technical detail, cardboard-ish characters and no obvious plot. I get that this is part 1 of a trilogy - all the mo0re reason that it should get you hooked. Nope. Just phenomenally boring boring boring details. Never seems to get to the point.

I particularily love the saucy groove of 'PEANUT BUTTER & JELLY' that brings Timbaland and Missy to mind. Vocally, Christina sounds excellent.

She can carry a note on the slower songs like \\"Highway\\", \\"Someday One Day\\" & \\"I'm Sorry\\". Christina kept guest appearances to a minimum which proves that she does not need help expressing her true talent.

She wanted to leave the aesthetic of Wagner, his methods and post-romantics as far behind as she could.

It gave us wrong directions in Woodland, CA but we were able to find the hotel we were looking for with the street address. It will not give us our home location from our address. When using intersections to make a routing, it will only let you use one intersection. It makes you choose one of four options when making a routing when you may want to use a combination of options.

Worst of all it tells me to make a right in front on my home to get on the high way - My home is the last home on a dead end street!!! It did take me to a location 200 miles away fine EXCEPT my computer mapping program took me there -using microsoft map program - in 172 miles and 30 min faster! Called Magellan to find out a few things and got the wrong infromation.

When I want to go somewhere by address, I can not type some specific address since it only takes up to 5000. But the address is like 7500.

Also, perhaps all GPS systems are like this, but it sometimes \\"gets confused\\" in urban areas and does not always give directions that someone who is familiar with the area would take. For example, I was driving locally and was pretty sure of the fastest route but wanted to double check. The GPS system gave me a route that would have taken me twice as long had I followed it.

I picked shortest route, surprised that it could find where I was at about 5,000 feet in elevation. It gave me an alternate route. It was a washboard dirt road, but I got home well before the rest of the crowd. It's been very accurate and my technophobe wife feels comfortable using it.

For the educator preparing to develop an IT curriculum the articles and comparisons of the various model curricula provide an excellent starting point.

Jean Claude plays a really different character than what we're used to here and makes an absolute pro job of it. The film itself is very competent and several levels above what we've come to expect from straight to DVD fare. The action is good and the story is really sharp and well written.

In my opinion, as far as the Turtles phenomenon goes, this is where the Turtles \\"jumped the shark\\". Seriously, that was enough for me after that because it was impossible to respect them after they went that cheap.I won't deny it, this is a great movie for kids.

Despite these minor flaws, TMNT 2 still ranks up with the first movie for the most part. I watched the making of \\"secret of the ooze\\" and I think it should have been included on the DVD with a good number of other features. Jim Henson put alot of work in helping to create the live-action characters in this movie. Plus, this was the last movie that Jim Henson helped work on before his death and I think the DVD version of TMNT 2 should have recognize the work that he put into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS transfer?","review":"It's nice to be able to get all four of these together in one package, however the video quality is horrible. I would swear that the source used for these movies are from a pretty bad VHS copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly as good as the original","review":"This Turtles film is almost as good as the oringal. It's not quite as dark and serious as the first and does have a few goofy gimmicks. Actually specifically, it's the two mutants Shredder creates that are gimmicky. Still it's a cool movie. If you liked the first or anything Ninja Turtles related, give it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?!","review":"Uhhhh... This movie is \\"bad\\"! I loved the first one and I used to love 2 but now that I'm over the age of 7.. what a horrible movie. Way too cartoonish. The first fight scene had a whole bunch of dumb jokes and after every time a turtle would hit a guy they would make a dumb coment like \\"awesome\\". Then the whole Vinilla Ice thing at the end... HORRIBLE. The way the beat the 2 bad guys mutants was by spraying a fire exsting. in their mouth which made the 2 mutants turn back into their regular selves. I mean how could the makers of the movie do this to the TMNT fans? If I met the makers of TMNT 2 I would slap them in the face! TMNT 3 was better then 2 but... WHY DID THEY GO BACK IN TIME TO JAPAN? STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! I hope someday there's a TMNT 4 that is like the original where it's darker and like the comic, now that would be amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell short . . .","review":"My opinion doesn't seem to be very popular, but I felt that this was the worst movie of the series. I was constantly rolling my eyes when I would see the turtles fight an army of foot-soldiers and two indestructable mutants unarmed, though their weapons were (usually) strapped to their backs. And the times when they weren't carrying weapons, I wondered what they were doing going into battle without them. I would own this ONLY to have the complete collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"vhs","review":"didn't realize I made a mistake in ordering, I wanted DVD format this is a vhs. Can't use.

How did Shredder manage to survive being crushed in a garbage truck,but he couldn't survive a pile of wood from a falling dock,crashing down on him,when he was a HUGE \\"Super\\" Shredder??? That doesn't make ANY sense to me.I think they should have used a diffrent villain for this movie.I think The Ratking would have been an awesome villain choice.The storyline in this is fair,but sorry.The whole \\"bringing back Shredder thing\\" just ruins this movie for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast From the Past","review":"This was a great gift for my adult son who loved the Ninja Turtles as a boy.

GO NINJA GO NINJA GO!!!!","review":"Yes, it's corny. But this is early 90s. Everything back then was cool at the time, but corny today. This movie took everything the first movie did, but made it HUGE. More mutants, ooze, a friggen 90s style hip hop dance even (this was popular at the time, remember the Urkel Dance?).All the actors did a good job. The new asian kid had some slick martial arts abilities, and his fresh, headstrong attitude added much to this movie. Even the British dude from Titanic was good. The ninja rap at the end of the movie is hilarious to watch today, but at the time was the coolest thing on the planet. I remember seeing people in the theater cheering, getting out of their chairs and singing along to it. It was nuts. Gotta love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 4 Film Favorites version is a SCAM","review":"Despite claiming to contain four widescreen copies of this film, the first movie is a full-screen copy, even though the printing on the DVD says that it is widescreen.Only films 2-4 are actually in widescreen.This company is so utterly inept that they didn't even test their pressing before shipping out thousands of copies of this disc. Do not buy this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles turns up shmaga.","review":"In short, this film wasn't very good. What it lacked in cinematography it couldn't make up for, even with its incredible acting and beautiful script.

I don't suggest seeing this film, but buying it might be fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"TMNT!","review":"This was a great deal for all 4 of the TMNT movies.

It falls apart just by looking at it. I had to reinforce it with brackets just about everywhere. I had to ask for a replacement, and after battling over the phone, finally got the piece one and a half months later (Racks & Stands said they'd forgotten about me, they \\"fixed\\" their mess with a 10% credit). The pieces are made from cheap particle board, which desintegrates when you are trying to fit the pieces together. It looks pretty from the distance, but not worth the trouble or the money. I would buy solid wood next time and never from Racks and Stands again."},{"rating":"1","title":"personal fan","review":"This is a waste of money.

Only if the air is cold will the fan blow cold air.Because the fan lies on your chest, the air is only blowing on your chin (which can be annoying) and the breeze is only coming out of five square shaped holes at the top of the machine.

Another reviewer says Mull must not be used to high protein bars while another insinuated he must work for a competitor. Neither category fits me. I'm an electrical engineer and I've tried many high protein bars now and this is one of the worst tasting I've had. I too had to throw them away after trying a bite or two from several from the box in hopes the first couple were a fluke. Now that I'm more experienced I think it is type of protein they use. If you want one that really tastes like a candy bar but has only 1g of sugar and 2g of sugar substitute try Atkins Advantage (17g protein). Or for higher protein, just not quite as tasty Powerbar Protein Plus, Reduced Sugar with 22g. Ok, it isn't 30g but I'd rather eat 1.5 Powerbars or 2 Atkins than 1/4 of a Detour any day and not have to get \\"used to\\" that nasty taste just to get more per bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"protein bar nasty","review":"They look great on wrapping - nasty tasting - ate 1/2 of it and tossed the rest - payday pro bars are really good - these are really bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best shows on TV","review":"Writing and acting doesn't get much better than this.

The entire cast of Castle works so well as an ensemble that I hope this series has a very, very long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good writing plus good acting = great tv","review":"Mr Fillion fits his character so well he's not so much acting as he is having fun in front of a camera. The writing and acting of even the bit characters in this series is top notch. If you are a Firefly fan you might even catch a few references thrown in a few episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST PLAIN FUN","review":"This nifty little crime drama reminds me in some ways of MOONLIGHTING. Nathan Fillion, and Stana Katic have just the right amount of humor, cheekiness, ( thanks to some excellent writing ), more than fair chemistry, and interesting storylines to raise this series way above most of the lackluster sit-coms, and ho-hum crime dramas that have been taking up network space for at least a decade. I wasn't sure that this series would make it through even the first season ( as so many good series tend to get axed- including Fillion's last one, FIREFLY- before they can even get an audience ). It's good to see that the ratings are climbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Great acting. He's funny and she's in love. Stana looks at him in a way men would kill for. I do like the mix with his fsmily at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"CASTLE, The Complete Second Season","review":"In CASTLE, Nathan Fillion displays his great versatility as an actor. His character, mystery writer, Richard Castle, has a puckish sense of humor, a knack for putting his foot in his mouth and is a caring and loving father to his daughter, Alexis. He has a very unique way of solving crimes, sometimes annoying and exasperating NYPD Detective, Kate Beckett, who he's supposed to be observing/assisting. They struggle to work together, but Kate soon finds out that Castle has a brilliant mind when it comes to crime solving and, in spite of his procedural ineptness, he really does help her more than he hinders her. The supporting cast nicely balances out the he/she interaction and sexual tension between Castle and Beckett. The plots are well thought out and written. I can see why this show continues to be one of the best on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"castle: the complete second season","review":"my wife & myself just started watching the current castle series this past season so we were interested in seeing how it all began. we purchased season 1 thru amazon & enjoyed it so much we purchased season 2 which we're in the process of watching.we enjoy the plot of a writer shadowing a police detective for his books. the inter-action of richard castle & kate beckett is wonderful. castle's mother & teenage daughter lives with him giving some entertaining subplots. the program is light,entertaining & well scripted. the characters are well suited to the parts.would recommend highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has to be my favorite season","review":"My husband and I will fight over which season we want to rewatch, but Season Two seems to win every time.

Also, sender sent this out ASAP and that's always good when you're waiting on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid second season for a great show","review":"Castle is a show that doesn't take itself too seriously and that light-hearted mix of comedy and self-deprecation are what make this show miles better than the thousands of CSI clones out there. While Castle certainly has it's mystery/crime of the week type component too it, it deftly blends in humor, a family we care about and that's relevant to the character, and never gets so serious as to be heavy. At the same time, the show definitely has it's intense moments, it's tragic moments and some moments that will move you to tears or laughter so it's certainly a show that has a lot of heart.Season two builds on an already very good season one and has some very nice stories, a few of which really kept me guessing till the very end. Overall, Castle ends up being a nice breath of fresh air in a TV landscape filled with paint-by-numbers crime of the week shows like CSI and it's clones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Castle: The Complete Second Season","review":"Love this show!!!!!!! Great writing and great acting from all around. You can read all of the other reviews if you want more specific details of what is or isn't included in this DVD set (and I'm not entertaining enough for you to spend a great deal of time reading all about me), but trust me on this one -- you want to have a great time watching a great show -- you can't go wrong with Castle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show!","review":"Witty and funny with heart :) Nathan Fillion is just amazing and charismatic in this role.

This show teams him with Stana Katic, and the screen burns with their chemistry. Throw in a fantastic supporting cast: Jon Huertas, Seamus Dever, Susan Sullivan, Molly Quinn, and Tamala Jones, and you have a show that you must watch every week.

In short simple words, this show is purely amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged","review":"All of the discs were in perfect condition except for the third disc.

During the second season, I realized I was losing interest, all the plots were the same. Sorry, but I guess others feel this was a really good series.

I really enjoy his large collection of cancelled shows. ;-) Castle is his first mainstream hit, and it is a good one. If you enjoy Nathan Fillion in Firefly, then you'll definitely like this show. If you love funny police dramas, sorta along the same lines as Monk or Psych maybe, then you might like this show. It is a bit more gritty than those examples though. If you have been enjoying Castle, but were unfamiliar with Nathan Fillion, I recommend a brief science-fiction show called Firefly. It has space cowboys -- literally."},{"rating":"2","title":"We do like the TV Show","review":"We started watching Castle during Season 4 and we liked it.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it's not Firefly but...","review":"I discovered Firefly about 10 years too late, and started watching Castle to fill the void.

It powers well and it doesnt have any issues with reliability. It does exactly what it is made to do, and doesn't crap out on you. I ran it 4 channels to my Infiniti Kappas and it sounds amazing. You, of course, need the right speakers to pull this off. The settings this amp has makes it very easy to tune to your liking. Just make sure when you run the wires to run the power wire away from the audio wires, or you will get excessive amounts of interference. My only gripe is the size of it, even though it is a 4 channel amp, it's pretty damn big."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 of my favourite vampire-detective novels","review":"I read this book when it first came out, and was delighted when the sequel came along.

Most of your (so called) hip hop albums are two good (usually Neptune produced) track for radio play and 9 to 10 tracks of filler. Black Thought's word play alone knocks of 90% of the competition.

I haven't heard any of \\"Phrenology\\" live yet, but from what I hear, to hear \\"Water\\" and \\"Break U Off\\" live is an experience that's not to be missed. This CD (and the DVD full of extras)continues to fascinate and impress me. This is the \\"White Album\\" of hip-hop. A must own CD that deepens and sounds better every time you play it. The Roots haven't sold out, they've simply become the best band on the planet and world is finally starting to catch up. It's about time"},{"rating":"1","title":"boo this, man","review":"I love the roots, and have seen them live several times. I think this album was a departure from what they do best - great beats and strong lyrical content. The quality of the voices was what made it great hip-hop, and this cd seems flat.

I'd say if you loved those you'll be disappointed by this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phrenology","review":"This is a pretty wack cd. Compared to their other albums, it lacks those real \\"stand-out\\" tracks. They are getting moved out of the industry from all those flossin mc's, and even more concious mainstream mc's like Nas.

The addition of a guitar player to the band (Ben Kenny) has added a new dimension to their already unique sound. \\"!! shows off the band's ability to rock out, and \\"The Seed (2.0)\\" is laced with funky guitar licks and the amazing talent of guest Cody ChesnuTT. Fans of rapper Black Thought will not be disappointed by his performances this time around. Stand out tracks demonstrating his skill include \\"Thought @ Work\\" and their latest single \\"Break You Off\\". Guest appearances by Talib Kweli in \\"Rolling With Heat\\" and Jill Scott in \\"Complexity\\" only serve to add to The Roots' progressive sound.Fans of older albums by The Roots will not be disappointed, and new fans will be impressed by The Roots' fresh approach to hip-hop.Phrenology is one of the year's best releases to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Any true roots fan will enjoy","review":"Any true roots fan can appreciate this album. Black Thought shines throughout and shows his ability to be a solo artist. This album seems very experimental since new members have joined the group. It has a different sound from roots albums in the past, but still delivers and makes you jam all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"One of the best hip-hop albums. the roots have allowed themselves to explore more styles of music and integrate it with hip-hop, making them once again one of the most creative hip hop bands out there, never comprising they're sound for sales, they are true musicians. they deserve all the praise they receive."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ROOTS.......they can never go wrong","review":"The roots can never go wrong. They always seem to find a new way to get you hooked.

There is no way you could ever get bored of their music.I was counting the days for Phreonlgy to come out, and I have to say I wasn't dissapointed at all, when I finally got my hands on it. I haven't stopped listening to it yet. I was just a little surprised, they must of been feeling the rock vibe while they were in the lab during this album. But hey im not hating, I don't think anyone could of done it better. Sooooooo........if you dont have phrenology make sure you add it to your music collection. And if you got some time check out there websitethedst.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what music is about","review":"This album is amazing to me. The Roots are such groundbreakers. They are not scared to experiment and just kick it the way they want. I bought this CD for \\"Break You Off,\\" but now \\"The Seed (2.0)\\" is on heavy rotation. And the cuts are so different.

Real Hip-Hop music is officially extinct! The official declaration of this tragedy is evident in the release of this dreadful album. The Roots have betrayed real Hip-Hop fans with this CD. The Roots was our last hope, but we've been hood-winked. I was so upset when I listened to this album, that I went to bed crying profusely. The next morning I set the CD in a pot of boiling water so that it would whelp, never to be played again. The appeal of Roots was in their live instruments, but on their latest CD- Phrenology, there are just the typical synthetic tracks created by keyboards, synthesizers, and other high-tech .... Despite my former allegiance to Roots, I cannot recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"this aint the roots....","review":"i dunno what the roots is trying to do but this aint what DO YOU WANT MORE!?!?! or Things Fall Apart did for me.

VERY quickly. I don't know what it is though...maybe it's the demo esque feel of the songs. The only songs I'm still feelin is Sacrifice and break You Off. They either feel incomplete or they feel like they run on forever. Or maybe it's just too many rock influences for my taste. Or maybe the rhymes on this album are sorta lacking. Maybe the Roots ARE just going through the motions. Whatever it is though it's causing me to despise this album. Stick with the other Roots albums for enjoyment and only get this cd to complete a collection (The bonus DVD was also a nice addition). That's the honest Truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC Book for both Reference and Study","review":"This is a great book for Researchers, Students, and anyone interested in the *business* use and applications of Artificial Neural Networks.As a graduate student, I was required to read Trippi and Turban's book - a simple compilation of research papers with no explanation as to what we were supposed to be getting out of each article.Smith's book far exceedes Trippi and Turban's.

Also included are two very interesting pieces. One is \\"The New Shadow\\", the beginning of a sequel to LOTR, and the other is \\"Tal-Elmar\\", a story telling of the coming of the Numenorean ships as sees by the men of Middle Earth. I recommend this for all Tolkien fans, and for those who have read the other HoME volumes, you don't want to miss this last, and best, edition.

Here we have material which was compiled for the Appendices at the end of The Return of the King. Much of this material expands upon and enriches the published Appendices. Most fascinating of all is the inclusion of Tolkien's planned sequel to The Lord of The Rings, The New Shadow. This was written in the late 1960s and never stretched for more than a few pages, but the fragment we have here is a treasure not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading for Tolkien fanatics","review":"I think this volume is the best in the whole History of Middle Earth series.

In \\"The Education of Betty\\" a man marries his high school sweetheart's daughter, whom he helped raise from childhood, and in \\"In Her Selfless Mood\\" we are expected to sympathize with a woman who throws her life away on her no-account brother. And the less said of the **appallingly** racist \\"Tannis of the Flats\\" the better. The stories that are not embarrassingly outdated are sappy little romances.

The book should have focused on what has been going on at the Big Three (decisions made, models produced, sales info, market trends, quality/reliability) and how consumer preferences have led to the imports' increased market share in the US......There was just too much emphasis on specific imports with too little relevant content as pertains to the title of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"End\\" In Sight","review":"Despite the sensationalistic title, I was hopeful that Ms. Maynard's book would be an insightful and balanced look at the American automobile industry.

In Section 8, Bob Mayer opens a door on secrets from WWII that still haunt us and secrets from today's world that we'd just as soon not know.

Feynman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Credibility","review":"This is so obviously a book written by a non-scientist masquerading as a scientist. While a different viewpoint may be refreshing, I found his constant focussing on the personal details of astronomers and others (e.g. the references to Kepler as \\"smelly\\" - I have never heard this before) suggestive of a sneering agenda.While the book is, in parts, entertaining and informative, I cannot trust anyone who says \\"speed and acceleration are the same thing\\". This sort of tosh totally destroys the credibility of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"timeless and clueless","review":"Has a more useless book by an author more unqualified in his subject field ever been published? During a recent C-SPAN2 appearance the author made it clear that he has a very tenuous grasp on even the most basic facts of arithmatic and cannot distinguish between a number and a numeral! Would this book have been published at all except for the deserved fame of other members of the author's family. I think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live through the Power of Words","review":"Rosemary Daniell is a woman who has listened intently and found her passion and her voice. She shares both in this book so that others may know what the experience is like.My favorite part is where she is working with students and the class is working on the poem \\"Eggs\\" and students ponder what is it really like to sit in a bathtub of eggs. The words are so strong they don't just invite visualization, they demand it.Having sat in on a Zona Rosa meeting, I can say that working with Rosemary Daniell is just as electrifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on Vocation","review":"I absolutely adore this book. I've grown tired of books on vocation that have a \\"pie in the sky\\" approach to living a spiritual life, as if everyday working people have the financial resources to devote themselves to a life of good deeds. Brian Mahan has a great way of bringing two worlds together---the need to pay the bills and the need to make a positive contribution to the world. Turns out you can do both!I also like his \\"spiritual retreat\\" approach. He incorporates spiritual exercises at the end of each chapter which really help to focus attention on living a life of integrity. Finally, this is a practical and inspiring book---but a book with a humorous edge---that unites compassion and ambition in a fresh, new way.Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative songs and storylines","review":"All four of these stories are very cute, especially the first one which teaches counting and addition in a fun, creative way.

Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this trike","review":"My son received this bike for his 1st birthday a year ago. We finally brought it out this year during some warm spells in the weather and I hate the bike! The handle bar for the parent is useless, the steering is a nightmare, and the bike tips so easily its rediculous. My son became so frustrated with this in the middle of the street and now refuses to get back on it. The only thing he has enjoyed with the whole bike is the bell, which im sure will eventually break. The only thing positive I can say is that Im glad we got this as a gift and didn't buy it ourselves or I would be even more dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous trike!!","review":"First, after four months of light use the seat belt, not the latch - the actual belt part, broke while my [...] year old was riding it, causing him to fall off. Then earlier this month my son's foot became trapped in between the pedal(in the up position) and the bar that holds the wheel on, fracturing his leg! After looking at other brands, it appears to me that Radio Flyer is the only brand that has this gap that is the perfect size to trap a toddler's foot."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Trike is Terrible in Every Way","review":"We wasted our money on this \\"tricycle\\". It is made of the cheapest metal, the handle bars and front wheel do not stay aligned (despite carefully following assembly instructions), the trike has NO BRAKES, and the pieces do not fit together well. This tricycle performs very poorly in all functions. The only educational value this toy has provided for my son was a lesson in EXTREME frustration and as for us, we learned that Radio Flyer is a far cry from the company it once was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer & Stroll Trike is Big Mistake!","review":"I purchased the Steer & Stroll Trike by Radio Flyer as a gift for my 2 year old granddaughter because I thought I was buying a good quality item for her. The steering mechanism was faulty and broke within a few days. The trike was returned to the store where the display Steer and Stroll Trike was faulty as well. The store refused to give a refund--just another trike. I wish I had never bought this!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wishing we had bought something else","review":"This tricycle was a lot of fun during the phase where we pushed my daughter around on it, but now that she is trying to pedal herself.....she tips over ALL the time. If she just leans over to look at something...it tips. Or if she turns the steering...it tips. She is sooo frustrated that she can't ride it. I didn't realize just how bad this trike was, until she hopped right on my nephew's bike and took off like a pro...never tipping over! All this time , it has been her trike and not her lack of control. It appears to us that there is a poor center of gravity based on the design of the bike. We are currently shopping for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best toy I bought my son for Chanukah","review":"With the reviews listed, I was a little hesitant in buying this trike. My 22 month old son loves it. The steering bar works well and with an adustable height it saves my back. Just don't do sharp turns. I had a little trouble assembling the trike's axel and tightening the clamp to the steering wheel but a quick trip to the bike store solved that. When I come home from work the first thing my son runs to is his trike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parent steering not working from the start","review":"I bought this trike b/c it had the features of most higher end trikes. I should have read these reviews better b/c we had the same problems. No matter what we did to the cables, the steering for the parent would not work. The one time we got it to work, you had to have the handle way to the left to get it to turn the wheel both ways. I am glad that we figured this out before my son started even riding it b/c it is promptly going back to the store. You would think you would get more for 50 bucks. I am very disappointed in Radio Flyer and doubt I will ever buy from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This broke after a few months of very light use. After being outside in the rain once, the front wheel/pedals were not functioning properly. No seatbelt, plastic tires. We were really disappointed but ended up getting a schwinn trike for our sons second birthday which was 100 times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Axel detaches from wheel","review":"I purchased this bike based on all the positive reviews. We assembled it without much difficulty but were surprised by how the axel fit over the wheel. It is plastic that you tighten with hands/wrench, but there is no part that overlays and actually seals the connection. Subsequently, after one ride, the axel began detaching from the wheel every 50 ft. Clearly, not optimal. We returned the bike, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can wake the dead!","review":"This trike has a lot of great features. The freewheeling pedals, the parent steering, event the built in handle on the seat. One feature I could do without is that the things squeals so loud that it will give anyone a headache within 5 minutes. I tried everything I could think of to stop the earsplitting shrieking, but even an quart of oil couldn't help it. I might be able to fix it if I could take the wheels off, but they are attached in such a way that they can not be removed without breaking them. No nuts or bolts on these low cost items. We got it for our daughter for Christmass, but I think we are going to have to replace it with something else soon. Too bad, because other than the noise it is a good product for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective, Had to Return","review":"We thought that this would be a great trike for your little one to learn on. Unfortunately after only two uses, the parent steering mechanism started to malfunction, leaving a lot of play (wiggle room) in the controls. The outcome of that was us having to swerve and weave all over the place to keep from going off of the curb. He almost tipped over quite a few times because it was like we were trying to dodge and weave cones or something! We contacted Amazon to return it, and they took it back despite it being a gift, and it being a week outside of the 30 day return policy. Great job Amazon for standing behind their products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio Flyer Who???","review":"I like so many others, was fooled by the name Radio Flyer. Everything seemed so practical. My cousin put the bike together in about 40 minutes. But the part that attaches the wheel was slightly short, the handlebar clamp was cheap, the seat did not attach well to the bar (how can you tighten straight bolts on a curved bar?), the steering bar was a joke and my 2 1/2 year old son fell off from the the bike tilting, one too many times. Radio Flyer you should be ashamed putting something like this on the market. I am taking this bike back to Toys R Us and purchasing a Kettler Tricycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say NO!!!","review":"I don't want to repeat what has been said already by most reviewers. Please do not waste your money. This trike is dangerous, poorly engineered, and poorly designed. Browse the stores for something else. After trashing this trike we bought a kettler. It is easier to use and has excellent engineering. However, even these can be a bit steep in price. Ironically our son has discovered our neighbors Fisher price trike for only 14.99 and loves it and wants one of his own. We are now planning on getting one this weekend. Lesson- let your child ride around on one in the store first. You just may get off cheap, but stay away from the Radio Flyer!! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time","review":"I am very disappointed with this product. I have an ultimate family trike and it's pretty much the same except there's additional stuff like push handle for adults, cup tray and a back bag to attach on the cross rod. First of all, the assembly is not easy. You have to get out your hammer and all other tools to assemble this piece together and it takes some time. It's poorly designed as the pedal is too low to hit our baby's feet as she rides this bike. It's seat is too small and narrow. It also tips very easily so you'll have to be very careful. Personally, I've seen better products that's much more friendlier. It's not worth the time and money. The only thing good is that I didn't have to pay for it because we got it as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio Flyer Steer and Stroll Trike","review":"My son received this tricyle for his 1st birthday. It was difficult to put together and as excited as he was to ride it, we were only able to take it out a couple of times.

Expected a better product than this from Radio Flyer, especially for $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsafe at any speed","review":"This trike looked so cute in the store but has been a huge dissapointment.

He really loves it! It makes him feel like a \\"big\\" boy. He's a little short yet to peddle, but it's a great introduction to doing it on his own. It's great on the one that is doing the training as there is no bending at your back. The little bell on it is a cute little added feature as well as the the little storage unit in the back. We bought one for our other grandson a year ago and he loves it as well. Big hit at the Birthday Party!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One more thing","review":"I see the age range is up to 5 years old?

What a shame that we have to add to the landfill and now spend more money just so we can try and enjoy a stroll around the city with our toddlers. We have two for our two toddlers and both are so loud with constant ear-piercing squeaks that we've finally given up. So loud they are headache inducing and an embarrassment to be \\"heard\\" going down the streets with. Thanks Radio flyer for showing us just how little money gets you these days. Had we known such we would have spent more and actually gotten something we could use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeers to Radio Flyer for putting their name on this trike!","review":"I can't begin to explain how frustrated and angry I am at Radio Flyer for putting out such a piece of junk with their name on it. The frame seems sturdy enough, but the plastic is flimsy; the plastic housing for the push bar broke the FIRST day of use. We were never rough with this trike, but after a few more weeks of use, the parent steering mechanism broke and it could only turn left or go straight. A couple months later, the plastic housing holding the fork/front wheel to the body of the trike broke, so the tricycle was basically in two pieces, and it happened while my daughter was riding it! This was not a cheap tricycle, but the quality is TERRIBLE. Too bad I didn't read the reviews from other consumers who had the same trouble first (and there are many). It's a shame that Radio Flyer decided to risk their previous wonderful reputation by selling this tricycle. I don't think I'll buy Radio Flyer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steer and Stroll Deluxe Trike Review","review":"This product is very easy to assemble however one tiny piece is missing from the frame. We emailed and called Radio Flyer for the piece and are still waiting. The part that is missing doesn't prevent the tricycle from being used but it would be nice to have a tricycle with all the parts. This tricycle is much bigger than it appears. I expected it to be low to the ground. I purchased it as a Christmas present for my 2 year old and I'm not sure when he will be able to ride it. Overall, I think that this would be a great present for a 3 year old or a very tall 2 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I bought this bike for my son's 2nd birthday and was concerned that since he is small he would not reach the pedals,he did, the seat has 3 adjustable positions so it will grow with him. My son loves it! The fact that he can rest his feet on the pedals without them moving while I push is great. I read the manufactures review comment and made sure to get this model because the previous model had steering issues, steering still is not effortless, there is a lot of play. I am able to steer and the handle bars move so it is teaching my son to steer. Quality seems good and assembly was nothing major. I have already recommended it to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Crap","review":"We have model #53 (supposedly improved) and WOW is it poorly made. The front wheel fell off while my son was riding it (no injuries -- but, seriously, ?????!). Even after \\"fixing it\\" the handle bars wiggle front to back more than 1cm. We consulted an experienced bike tech who admitted to having junked more than 1 of these for similar reasons. It's ridiculous how cheap this trike is. Shoddy crap. Nostalgia aside, I wish we'd bought a Kettler and saved the trouble..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tips over & poor quality!","review":"This tricycle is such a disappointment. It has broken or worn in several areas, for example despite repeated tightenings, the handle bars do not stay true and turn the wheel as they should. It also tips over WAY to easily- just asking for an injury. I would not recommend this to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tricycle for several ages","review":"This trike is great for our 1 year old. It is very easy to use as a \\"stroller\\" with the handle, and it steers very well. Our 3 year old daughter loves to zoom around on her own, and it really fits her size as well. Very sturdy design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this trike","review":"We have been extremely disappointed with this trike. It was not cheap, but we thought it would grow with our boy thru the years. My biggest complaint is that it is very unsturdy. With the handle on it was bad enough, but once we took the handle off, I can't tell you how many times my son has tipped over.This product should be recalled before someone really gets hurt. It is in our trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"Got this for Christmas for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and it seemed to be very well made and durable. We have finally been able to use it due to nice weather and what a pointless piece of junk. It is impossible to steer and very frustrating for both my daughter and myself. Totally out of control and poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China, inferior quality, and a safety hazard","review":"Contrary to what is stated under this item description, this Radio Flyer, or at least the one I bought for my three year old at Target, is made in China, not the USA. The plastic, screws, and bolts are of inferior quality. The parental handle bar broke off after two weeks of light use. This tricycle is also VERY unstable. My daughter tipped several times, which did not help to foster her self confidence in riding any kind of &#147;wheeled&#148; vehicle. I am returning this item to Target and getting something else. My advice: DO NOT BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"substandard","review":"This trike was given to us as a gift. The buyers had the trike assembled in the store. My first mistake was to not re-inspect the assembly. Thus, I was not aware of how fundamentally dangerous this trike is.What turned out to be the primary concern is the attachment of the seat to the frame. The seat is made out of plastic, and there are two bolts connecting it to the frame. The bolts are secured with nuts (over flat washers) on the bottom of the trike. The store employee put a washer on only one bolt. After a month of intermittent use, that nut came loose and fell off while my son was belted into the seat. As the seat tilted sideways, the remaining bolt pulled through the plastic seat like it was butter, spilling my son onto his head from a decent height. He was wearing a helmet, and therefore received only a minor cut to his temple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it despite problems","review":"Our son received this bike and LOVES it. He likes the freedom he feels not having us hovering over him steering and directing, though we still do that from behind without him really knowing it. He wants to ride it every day! It fits him perfectly.However, after 2-1/2 weeks, the steering broke, making it impossible for us to steer from the pushbar. He's too young to know how to do it himself, so it's worthless to us until Radio Flyer sends the replacement parts. Other posters mentioned this problem, so I hope RF gets on the ball and fixes it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile","review":"This trike did not last very long. My wife and I are very careful with all of our possessions and we by no means were rough with this trike. The plastic housing that connected the steering handle to the frame of the bike broke quickly and easily. I had to make my own wooden frame and bolt it on the bike, otherwise the handle would be useless. Now that my son can control the bike himself, the frame has begun to twist out of shape, meaning we have a continuous left turn. I have had to continually correct this by taking the front wheel off and readjust. Try another model. Radio flyer goofed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - poor execution for Radio Flyer","review":"We received the trike as a gift and it seemed so perfect for our toddler. Assembly was a little difficult and we had to improvise. After 3 weeks of occasional use, the plastic steering parts began to crack. Radio Flyer was quick to send out new parts stating there has been a problem with the plastic parts. Reassembled with new parts and it worked again for another 4 weeks. We took off the steering bar and hoped to use the trike that way. Unfortunately that didn't work either. We just set it out with the garbage which possessed me to write a review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tricycle","review":"My son loves riding this tricycle. He's 1 1/2 so he's too little to petal very well, so it's nice that he can just rest his feet without needing to petal. I can push him from behind with the pushbar, which is very nice to not need to lean over. A very good tricycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor build quality","review":"So disappointed with this trike. The wheels have to hammered on to the end of the rear axle - nothing so advanced as a bolt like normal bikes - so are prone to come off and are not quite in line. Also the method of attaching the handlebar to the upright involves tightening a cylinder over a thinner (smooth) one with no notches or grooves, so there is next to no grip. Hence the bar wobbles and is prone to coming off. As for using this trike outside, forget it. You can almost feel it coming apart on a normal asphalt sidewalk, within minutes. I would safe this \\"toy\\" is unsafe and not durable"},{"rating":"1","title":"The co-pilot feature is good, but...","review":"It's nice that the co-pilot feature allows us to steer the trike, but there are a couple of serious problems. First and foremost, this trike tips over every easily. Second, the wheels started squeaking after a few days. I contacted the customer service about the second problem, but they were not very helpful. I was told to \\"lube\\" it; so, I did, but the squeaking noise comes back in the matter of minutes. It's a pretty loud and annoying; so, it virtually makes it impossible for my son to ride the trike. I would not recommend this product to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality","review":"We were really excited about this purchase for our 18 mth old son. Unfortunately, the steering for the parent-attachment failed to work after only a few months. Even the nuts and bolts came undone while we had taken a stroll in the neighborhood. Now the pedals will turn but they don't actually move the wheels and the steering for the kids handlebars don't work either. It was a great idea, but a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Quality","review":"The tricycle looks as nice as the expensive European brand, but the quality is quite disappointing. The headset squeaks loudly and no amount of oil seems to make it go away. The plastic bushings are cheap substitutes of a real roller bearing.The adult steering assembly is getting looser by the day. Soon, the adult will not be able to steer the tricycle. It must be a plastic steering part.Lastly the pedals keep falling off the tricycle. This is primarily because there is no metal cotter pin or retainer holding the pedal to the spindle. This pin would only cost a few cents, yet they cheaped out on it!This is quite disappointing, considering my daughter used this for two weeks. We should have known that you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality","review":"I regret this purchase. The handle bar doesn't steer well. It keeps making a loud clicking noise when you force it. It is now not true. The white plastic wheel cover is held together poorly - only a plastic male-female snap connection is holding it together. The pedals have slipped off. The plastic that was securing them have cracked. There is also the clicking noise even when the wheels are turning.In short, it's a very cheaply made product. Waste of money if you want any long-term use out of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinding Freewheel","review":"We were happy with the trike overall despite the reviews that stated problems with the push bar. However we were disappointed to find an annoying problem with this trike: the front wheel made a loud grinding sound when we pushed our child on the trike. We contacted Radio Flyer and they generously sent us a replacement wheel, but sadly the replacement wheel did the same thing. We felt it best to return the trike and make another purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful. Tips when turns.","review":"We purchased this for our two year old since her feet touched the pedals. When pushing it, it's ok. But when she tries it by herself and turns and even leans a little, it tips. We took it out in the driveway and it tipped with her on it. She's tried it several times and I don't want her riding it anymore. It's way too dangerous to use for little ones trying to get started. Do not recommend for starters. One positive, she really liked the storage bag in the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Trike","review":"My father-in-law purchased this trike for my son not quite 2 years ago. After only moderate use for that time, the trike is now junk. The steering doesn't work, pedals are broken (they go around, but no longer turn the wheels), and as it goes it makes horrible screeching noises that no amount of WD40 will fix. We're junking it and buying the Kettler Air Navigator-- the one we liked and wanted in the first place. Moral of this story: Do your research and go with your gut. Don't be swayed by the better price tag. You'll spend more in the end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, very poor pre-assembly, and poor steering colu","review":"I would NOT buy this product. I wish I read the reviews before going to Toys r Us. The steering column was an absolute nightmare. I had to disassemble it completely (including the pre-assembled parts) and re-align it by hand. In the end, the parent steering column functioned, but poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed mom","review":"I purchased this bike for my daughter's second birthday and it ended up being a total disappointment. It seemed to have several fatal flaws: 1) putting it together was a drag, 2) the parent steering handle did not allow sufficient control to direct the bike and did not seem to reliably override any handle bar steering, 3) the wheel base seemed too narrow to provide a sturdy ride and my daughter tipped over two times when we took it out for the first spin, 3) to top it all off, one of the pedals kept popping off. Needless to say after 2 hours with it I returned it and purchased another bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun but the bell poses a laceration hazard","review":"My son sliced his pinky finger open on the bell's metal edge, practically butterfly-ing the whole pad of his finger off. We ended up in the ER where they had to glue his finger back together (stitches wouldn't work because the cut was in the crease of his finger).If you buy this trike, consider removing the bell. When I ran my finger over the metal edge of the bell, it didn't seem that sharp to me, but little ones' skin is not so tough and it sliced through his finger like it was butter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, awful quality","review":"I had decided to buy this based on the Radio Flyer brand, and what appeared to be a great design. Right away, I found it to be hard to steer, and it quickly developed a loud squeak that I couldn't get at with lubricant. My child had difficulty pedaling it at an age when she was able to pedal other tricycles. Eventually the pedals stopped engaging at all - they would just spin and grind, frustrating both child and parent.Since this piece of junk didn't even survive my first child's use, I'm now in the market for a decent trike for my second. It's too bad that the Radio Flyer brand is now being stamped on junk. I would consider buying their simple \\"retro\\" style trike for my son, but I've completely lost trust with the brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it and then stopped liking it","review":"I read the other reviews about not being able to assemble it or parts not working correctly and I haven't had any of those problems. It has worked as advertised for our child so we have like it but now, we are disappointed. Our son has outbrown the need to have a parent steer it for him so we removed the parent steering to allow him to do on his own and guess what? It has no brakes. We live in a hilly neighborhood so there is only two ways to stop...hit something or put your feet down. He likes riding it but can only do so in our garage since our driveway is on a slope. So overall I would say that it is a good attempt but not to great of a product. I went to the store today and bought a different one that he can ride on walks with us in the neigborhood that has brakes....so this one was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT what I expected","review":"I really thought this was the perfect tricycle for my 3 year old. I was sorely mistake. The steering does not work one bit, which was disappointing because that was the main reason I bought it. It is top heavy and my daughter tipped several times thankfully I was standing right beside her and was able to catch her before she fell. Also, the pedaling sticks. I thought my daughter just didn't grasp the concept of pedaling. Then our neighbors daughter got on it and she had the same issues as my daughter. This is a little girl that avidly rides her tricycle on our street.Overall, I am very disappointed with the Radio Flyer product and wish I would have spent my $$ on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one!!","review":"We bought this for our daughter and the whole reason it was chosen was b/c of the steering bar! What a waste that feature doesn't really even work well, the foot rest is inconvienient, the little bike bag kinda drags along if your child puts anything in it!Oh yeah and the bell broke after very little use, it tips over costantly! This needs to be left out on trash collection day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"I thought that the name and weight of this bike would make it a great buy but my friends plastic tricyle is looking better and better. My two year old loves the bike with the exception that it falls over every time he tried to steer or climb on and the parent handle broke in half after only 1 week of use. It ruined the bike so we could not replace it. I trashed this one and bought the plastic bike like my friend did for $20 and wished I hadn't wasted the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Thankfully we only paid about $50 for this piece of junk before Christmas. When we brought it out for our two year old it quickly developed an AWFUL squeaking noise that could not be fixed with WD40 or anything. The steering is terrible too. Don't waste your money. We will not buy another Radio Flyer/Made in China product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good trike for the price, some assembly issues","review":"This is a good-value alternative to the over-priced Kettler trikes. The best feature is the parent handle bar that allows you to push and steer the trike even if your toddler is just sitting on the trike.Assembly is not as easy as expected. One of the nuts did not fit well with the fork stem and I had to use a hammer and screw driver to widen the opening. Also, one of the Radio Flyer stickers was already peeling off when we opened the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Low Quality","review":"Our son loved this trike when he first received it. After one year of fairly light use, almost everything on this trike has broken. The parent steering column completely broke down and can't steer, the bike squeaks and tips, and finally, the pedals stopped working (or only catch about 10% of the time). My husband tried to take the front wheel off to fix it, but it appears to be a single welded piece that does not come apart. Our son still insists on riding the bike, which usually ends up in frustration and tears when the pedals don't work. In fact, I'm online shopping for a new trike now! I strongly advise against buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"Grandma bought this for our toddler from a big box store. First problem was the poor construction of rear wheels. This trike is dangerous in my opinion because there is no way for the child to apply any braking mechanism (forget hills). The parent handle is now completely worthless since the steering bracket can no longer align with the front wheel. Cheap, made in China garbage! Boo Hiss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This bike looked good at the store. I wish they'd had a floor model for us to test first. However, I figured it was a Radio Flyer so it must be good. Wrong!I didn't get to put it together right away but if I had, I would've returned it right away too. At first it was good - the kids sat while I steered. Unfortunately, after that it was downhill. It does not pedal well AT ALL which makes for a very frustrated child. I wish I would've gotten something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I am very disappointed in Radio Flyer for manufacturing and selling such garbage. It is cheaply made and doesn't last long. The wheels are plastic and strip out on the inside making it impossible for my son to ride the trike. The plastic on the wheels wear away VERY fast. It is very easy to damage while assembling. So overall I would steer clear of this and any other trike that is made of plastic. We have had ours for 6 months now. My son is average weight and height and we probably use it a few times a week. Not durable at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality","review":"Started falling apart on the first use. The parent steering post became loose and slipping, finally came out of assembly. Child handle bars started getting loose then came out of the assembly and now the tires will not turn when the child pedals, they continue to slip. It's impossible to keep this product together no matter how tight you crank down on the bolts. Unless this item is super glued together it is not going to last beyond the first couple of uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far very pleased","review":"My brother in law put this together for me. He claims it was relatively easy and hopefully he is not just sparing my feelings. My daughter was impressed with her new trike. I really like the adjustable seat feature as she is still a little short for the pedals. We are still working with her on being able to keep on it with feet on the pedals. The push handle is a must have for me and steers easily and nicely, I'm so glad I chose a trike with this feature. This is a new purchase so I can't speak for durability but I hope it will continue to be a great toy for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improve it by making Air Tires standard on this product","review":"The good thing about this product is that when the child is first learning, she/he can just sit there and the parent can steer and they don't even have to pedal. The big disadvantage this product has is the plastic tires - not a smooth ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginner tricycle","review":"Love the Radio Flyer tricycle!!! It's very easy to steer for the parents, and our little one just loves to cruise around with it! He really loves his little storage bin in the back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"The steering handle of this bike broke by about the 4th or 5th use - which was the main attraction of buying this model. The handle bars kept coming loose so my son was steering sideways. Also tips over pretty easily - not good for 3 year olds who want to zoom around. We junked this bike after about 2 months and are using a sturdier plastic 3 wheeler that rides closer to the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so disappointed with this tricycle!","review":"I am very disappointed w/this tricycle! The whole \\"radio flyer\\" brand made me think it would be great and it's not. The steering does not work, the parental handle bar is a joke- you can hardly help your child while they're riding because the bike will tip. My daughter can't reach the back foot rests and ends up dragging her feet on the road. It's now sitting in our garage while I shop for another one. This bike is not at all recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT GET THIS TRIKE","review":"When we opened the box a part was broken. We called radio flyer and they said they were redesigning the part and we would get it in 3 weeks. We got the part and then the hub cap came off. We called radio flyer again and they sent three replacements. Hmmm... THEN we finally got out and the steering wouldn't stay straight. IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!! I rated it educational because I have learned a little about putting a bike together. Something I didn't know before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best first wheels for toddler!","review":"We ordered this tricycle for our son for his 2nd birthday a couple months ago. It is great for going on walks. The push bar is comfortable and easy to grip (though not ergonomically designed), which makes pushing a snap. Plus the bar allows you steer from behind at a normal standing stature, so there's no bending over to grasp the seat and the handle bars. My 6' husband does find the bar a hair shy of being at the minimum comfort level, so anyone over 6' may not find it as comfortable to push as a shorter person (you might still have to bend over). The construction is sturdy and durable, the wheels can go 'off-roading' at the park or on gravel.All in all a very good buy for the money! My son loves it. The bell and basket in back are also a huge hit with him. The only drawback, if it can be considered a drawback, is that you can't adjust the pedals to turn or not to turn as the trike is moving (they always turn)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled by \\"Flyer\\"","review":"The first box we bought was missing a wheel!!! The missing parts should have been a sign. The trike was a piece a crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep shopping for another one","review":"Terrible tricycle - the steering is too hard to handle, for parent and child. It tips over easily and if you live in an area with hills, don't risk it. Assembly was hard and parts broke. Save your money and go for a cheaper one or take a Kettler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio Flyer needs to fly away!","review":"Poor quality. It's too small, constantly tips over and the steering is horrible. I had it for 2 years but only used it twice (hoping that it would ride better without the steering). This spring my daughter is big enough to use without the steering and guess what? Still tipping, hard to pedal, yadda yadda yadda.End result, I took it back to Toys R Us, got an in-store credit (...). Shame on you Radio Flyer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"We bought this for our daughter when she turned 2; it was very difficult for her to ride and the steering was impossible. She's now 3 and we decided to re-introduce it to her and let her ride without the parental sterring - still impossible. The bike tilts continuously and it's very difficult for her to paddle. To solve my curiosity, I took her to a toy store and had her try another trike to see if it was a paddling issue with her. The problems did not exist on the \\"other brand\\". This was a total waste of money. I'm going to see if I can exchange since it was only used in our basement. BUYERS BEWARE - DO NOT BUY!!!!! This really puts a damper on the Radio flyer image - I purchased based on their reputation. Based on this, I will never buy a Radio Flyier anything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UNSAFE","review":"The bottom line is this...the Steer & Stroll Trike has no BRAKES! I bought this trike due to the fact I like the free-flowing pedals. From an adult point-of-view, I thought it was nice to have a feature that would allow you to coast while riding the trike. The one thing that I failed to grasp..your child cannot stop unless they drag their feet. Think about it, your child is coasting down the sidewalk or driveway and something appears to block his or hers path..what do they do? As adults, we know how to coast and brake. but can your child, at 3-4yrs know what to do? Do you want to find out? Bottomline..this trike does not have brakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Trike Ever","review":"I bought this toy in May of 2002 for my daughter's 2nd birthday.The first one had to be returned for a faulty steering mechanism. The emblem on the nice little tote bag that comes with it wore off the 2nd day. The trike tips over constantly. We have called the company numerous times to get new locking clips for the handlebars because they keep turning without turning the wheel. It is a freewheeling trike which means it will pedal forward but if the child tries to pedal backward the pedals go but not the bike. This makes it VERY hard for young kids to learn to pedal. 7 other 2 year olds have tried to ride her bike and cannot. My daughter has no problem riding any other trike; but she cannot ride this one. Radio Flyer has been TERRIBLE about standing behind their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't teach child to ride","review":"The trike is poor quality and the front wheel functions to allow the trike to coast. Which prevents the petals from turning when the trike is in motion. This feature has confused my child and even though we have owned this trike since she was 18 months old she still doesn't know how to petal and she is 3 now. It prevents your child from learning how to alternate legs because they don't have to. I would NOT reccomend this to another parent because of this feature. Also the coasting front wheel means THE CHILD HAS NO WAY TO BRAKE AND SLOW DOWN when on their own. This is a problem if your child encounters a small hill (or in our case steep driveway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for the money","review":"The Radio Flyer Deluxe Steer & Stroll Trike is an excellent value for the money.Our 2 1/2 year old daughter loves it. During a recent vacation it replaced the stroller and it was a lot more fun for her and us than having her sit still in the stroller.The trike is easy to steer with the push bar, which is high enough even for tall people and easily detached for transportation.Assembly was easy enough, but I am somewhat experienced. The instructions were clear and easy to follow.The wheels started squeaking after a few days but a little WD40 took care of it.The only thing missing is a break. As long as we push her around there is no break necessary, but as soon as she is old enough to ride the trike without our help we will have to see if it is save enough without a break or if we have to switch to a different ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"The steering broke","review":"Bought this tricycle for my 16 month old and within two months, the steering broke. I guess you get what you pay for and I am going to look at Kettler."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS TRIKE NEEDS TO BE RECALLED!","review":"Bad steering, top heavy, not what I expected. I won't be buying another trike from Radio Flyer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst trike ever","review":"This is the worst investment I have ever made. My sister in law also purchased this trike and feels the same way. It is really hard to steer. When we took the parental bar off, my son was unable to ride it because the handles move, but the wheel does not move with them. It tips over. I can not say anything good about this trike. Looks and name are deceiving!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good Radio Flyer Bike","review":"I brought my one year old daugther this bike for her birthday and that was in September. Now that it's the summmer and she finally get to ride it, it don't even work. I can't even control the front wheel like I'm suppose to be able to the wheel goes a total opposite direction. Also I can't push her being that she don't know how to pedal the bike yet because she to short and to little I would end up twisting her ankle. I think this was a total waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio Flyer Flies","review":"I love this Trycycle especially for the fact that the handle turns the wheel. It is a great Starter bike. My son is 2 and he can't peddle or steer yet, but we spend a lot of time going around the neithbourhood or to the park on his bike. It is a great alternative to the stroller. I admit it doesn't really give him the incentive to peddle himself since I'm doing all the work, but he's 2 he has plenty of time to learn that. Right now he loves being out on his bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this trike!","review":"I bought this for my 2 year-old son and it was a nightmare to put together first of all. Certain parts did not fit together easily and it is just a poor design. Then, after all the hard work to assemble it, the steering mechanism was broken! The handle bars don't lock and the footrest is in the most obscure area---it doesn't make any sense! Poor craftmanship, poor design, poor quality!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great science-fiction book.","review":"This is a great science-fiction book. It was easy to read and exciting throughout. I recommend this book for anyone with a love of science-ficition. Amazingly, I found a new paperback copy at a local 1/2 Price Books for $5.00. I don't think I will ever own a Kindle or Nook, so I was dismayed when used paperbacks were selling for $90.00 on Amazon. I guess I just got luckly.

It was also published by Gollancz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best scienc-fiction novel I have read (so far)","review":"I have short-listed this novel as one I would be locked up with. I am currently on my third copy (the first two wore out!), and tend to revisit it about twice a year. The immense scope of Poul Andersons' vision, involving the cream of the scientific community, faced with a near-insumountable problem and the sheer personal will to resolve it, are unmatched by anything I have read so far. I was particularly impressed by his avoidance of the \\"now-that-we-are-starting-over,-we-will-do-better\\" trap he could have easily taken at the end of the novel.

NOT a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought provoking, yet lacking as a novel.","review":"Ok, first of all, I was stunned at the end of this book. I mean conceptually it cancels out my worst thoughts of despair in that anything created artistically will never last as the sun explodes and the universe crawls in on itself. With the technologically advanced star ship Leonora Christine humans could effectively become God as they live through the contractions of an oscillating universe. All data from earths history could be stored on a fleet of ships at certain points in a universes time line and set off to re-establish in the next form the universe takes. Although masterworks completed after the ships leave would perish. What would human music sound like after say 1000 osculations?But alas the book itself reads like a hypothecital lecture by a science fiction buff.

It is a great workout, from beginning to end. It starts with a warm-up, and goes right into a high-intensity fat burning workout, focusing primarily on the legs and mid-section, and it ends with a cool down.

The stupid \\"hey just do the moves and stop lookin' at the chicks\\" comments were really tiresome!

While Barnstone is a talented translator in his own right, the translations in this book are not his. Rather, they are culled from various sources, many in the public domain, such as the R.H. Charles editions of the Pseudepigrapha. While these translations are passable, they are often not based in the latest scholarship.If you are looking for a Readers' Digest Condensed Apocrypha, this book might be worth it, but for serious study, your money would be better spent on the Charlesworth Pseudepigrapha, the Schneemelcher/Wilson New Testament Apocrypha, the Garcia Martinez Dead Seas Scrolls, and the Robinson Nag Hammadi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book in good condition","review":"The book was in good condition and sent quicker than I expected!!

As initially stated, your faith must be very strong because much of what you believe as a Christian (or non-Christian) will be challenged.

It claims that Jesus as a child would turn other children into other animals because He did not like what they said. Yes Jesus came to earth as a human, But, He never sinned! Nor was He vindictive. It goes against everything He was put on earth to do. That is not to say he I'd not get angry, He did. He loved but knew right from wrong and acted like the Son of God, not a spoiled brat.

I started getting humming noise in the right side of headphone and I thought that it was low battery that was causing it. I replaced the battery and checked its voltage but the humming sound did not go. I called the customer service and I got to speak with a live person after three failed attempts. They took all of my information but told me that they cannot replace this headphone since the warranty is only for 90 days. Why would you buy a product that has a warranty of only 90 days. It is not a good quality product and I feel that I was stripped of $150 from Panasonic. It is not worth in my opinion to have a product that is defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic RPHC300","review":"The RPHC300 is not what I expected. I would describe their performance as only Ok. The most irritating feature is they appear to allow all high frequency noise pass through leaving you with a constant hissing in your ears. I initially thought that this was typical performance of noise canceling headphones.

No hissing with the Bose."},{"rating":"1","title":"More noise muffling than cancelling","review":"Pros: Comfortable, well made, nice case, folds flatCons: Does not really do much noise cancelling.Wanted these for airplane trips. I found that they muffled noise rather than cancelled them and then only lower frequency noises at that. You have to turn on the switch for them to work but there is no big difference in them with the switch on or off. Plus you get slight hissing with the switch on.I didn't really expect them to shut out all noise but was dissapointed in the level of noise that still leaked through.

I also do a lot of traveling for my company (ie flying). About a half year ago the headphones started emiting small pops and hisses (all of which are pretty much covered over by music). I contacted Panasonic help center and they referred me to an \\"authorized dealer\\". A search from their website shows the nearest \\"authorized dealer\\" is a measly 1200+ miles from my location.

I have used Sennheiser PXC 250's, JVX HANC 100's and inexpensive noise cancelling headphones from Maxell. These are clearly the worst of the bunch at reducing the noise in a commercial jet. I was hoping that the closed design would improve the ability of these headphones to reduce cabin noise on a jet aircraft. Instead they failed to reduce the noise in the lower range and did a mediocre job in reducing the mid-range noise. I am very disappointed and I am returning these headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good job and worth the money","review":"The wife and I bought two pair of these for our trip to Germany last year. I have since used them several on flights to FL where I go monthly. They are very comfortable and the battery life is good. The case is handy for carrying them also.

The lows a little boomy.Highly recommended though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing hiss - does not come close to Bose","review":"I had fair hopes for this product after reading reviews that claimed it to be a \\"worthy competitor\\" to the Bose's.No Way! That review which Amazon highlights - is totally misleading.There is a distinctive hiss which is not quite apparent in an airplane but very disturbing in a slightly quieter environment. However, that hiss does fatigue your ears after a while.When travelling Japan to SFO - my co-passenger had a pair of QC2's - we exchanged our units for a while! You can't even compare the NC performance of the two - let alone the sound quality. The Bose is way superior in every way - even comfort level.My RPHC300 pair is headed to ebay.Save your money - go for the other options out there!Probably the first panasonic product to dissapoint me this bad.Incidentally - a leading consumer magazine gave this a rather low rating confirming my experience.

It's definitely accurate, but I wouldn't call it an \\"awful awful movie.\\" I've seen much worse. It's by no means Oscar-worthy but if you enjoy slightly goofy sci fi movies that don't offer much explanation, this is a decent choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aberration","review":"To put things in perspective - this isn't, I believe, a movie that is meant to be taken very seriously.

I'm glad I didn't pay much for it. It lasted for only about 2 months of gameplay when the X button jammed. Since I have 6 other controllers I could use, I took off the back to this and found out that the pad for the right shape buttons was slightly cut, causing the button to jam while your furiously trying to skip scenes or using it to fight. Because of this minor issue, the controller didn't work and since most of the games relied on the X button, it was pretty much done for. During play it was fine till the button jammed, then it was pretty much useless, you can get better controllers than this and cheaper, believe me. So don't buy it and find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! Power cord is bulky","review":"The power cord that accompanies this charger is bulkier than the charger itself.

Well, its back to my reduced-life 6yr old OEM battery since my trip is Friday. :((Follow-up) Got back from my month in the Philippines. And bargaincell agreed to replace the battery (twice!) After 3 batteries from 2 different lots, my original review stands. Bargaincell had GREAT customer service, maybe cause they know they are selling garbage.

After we received this, she did some research and found that it is actually worth more than is being charged on Amazon (if you find the right collector, of course). She says it is the closest example of what she has read so far in the comics - she has other figures in different sizes that are not what she considers \\"authentic\\" Deadpool figures.

After Christmas, I found a copy of it on the bargain table, and thought it was worth checking out. What a treat I had been missing! Now, I'm ordering the audio book, because to hear these hilarious stories read with an Irish brogue has got to be even more fun. I can certainly see how some people might be offended at some of the language and raw anecdotes, but if you can handle such things, this book is a rare treat. Don't expect another Angela's Ashes; the books have almost nothing in common! Remember how Frank McCourt describes his brother in his two books: as an irrepresible, irreverent, adorable, charming scamp, you'll know what to expect from A Monk Swimming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much.

This, on the other hand, had me laughing out loud at times because of the incredible language and interesting irish slang. this book was different than his brother's, more light-hearted, but with the same wonderful voice. Malachy is very witty, and i can see how he was so well liked in New York during his day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contradiction is a word Malachy knows not!","review":"First of all, as a recovering Irish Catholic alcoholic I must congradulate Malachy on his fine job of describing what it's like to be intoxicated. Thank you Malachy, for without your help I would never have known! Idiot! Contradiction is indeed a word not in Malachy's volcabulary, for he spends a fair amount of time bashing capitalism while at the same time attempts to make a PROFIT off of \\"Angela's Ashes.\\" Frank should slap his brother up side the head for the embarrassment he has imposed upon Frank's reputation. Malachy, you are no Frank, just a pathetic self-centered drunk. Instead of writing why don't you go visit your friend Ronald Reagan. You are no friend to the proletariat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malachy, No Brother Frank","review":"Malachy McCourt, brother of Pulitzer prize winner Frank McCourt(author of the splendid ANGELA'S ASHES) uses his brother's revered reputation to write nonsensical drivel. It's a pointless story. A memoir? Most people never heard of him! He writes in a tedious, stilted style that will make your eyes glaze over. You will be yawning before the end of the first chapter. He acts the pixilated leprechaun. He does a hatchet job on the U.S.A., without which this ungrateful former stewbum would be sitting in a pub in Limerick, on the dole, without his teeth.

It's a story about a drunk who's life stories teach us nothing. Page after page of disgusting behavior you would think he would be embarrased to tell. The last two pages were so moving, yet when I closed the book it reminded me of Malachy's relationship with his father, too little too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do I give zero stars?","review":"The worst book I've ever read.

He sounded delightful and very funny. As I'm a student and work part-time, I don't have much time for pleasure reading so I bought the book on tape. Don't waste your money. Although the author's voice is delightful, this is nothing more than a boring account of the adventures of an egotistical drunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Egotistical Trip","review":"A complete waste of a readers time.

I have recommended this book to others. Worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tedious story written by a horrible man","review":"I, like many others here, wanted to read this book due to my appreciation of Angela's Ashes. It is a great disappointment. It tells the stories of a drunken ne'er do well and how he injures just about everyone around him, wife, mother, children, brothers. I kept waiting for the part where he sees his wrongful ways and corrects all and makes all well. He never does. Its a story of how alcohol and laziness can ruin a life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malachy McCourt is no Frank McCourt, nor is he PG Wodehouse.","review":"I began McCourt's book with high hopes, having been an enormous fan of his brother's work, Angela's Ashes. Within a few pages, I had the oddest feeling that I was reading a poor imitation of P.G. Wodehouse. Within a chapter or two, the acknowledgement was made: McCourt is a fan of Wodehouse. The book is so derivative that I'm surprised he didn't have to pay royalties to the Wodehouse estate. The book is tedious, and I soon grew tired of McCourt's name dropping and pointless stories. My fatigue grew to distaste as I read McCourt's self-congratulatory, unenlightened account of his life. May God pity his children and keep them from repeating the mistakes he so clearly made throughout his life. And finally, I believe that the book and the mere fact that it was published is a sad commentary on a brother who was willing to ride his brother's coat tails, and a publisher who was willing to do it in the interest of making a quick buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down.","review":"Started reading it a few days ago and I cannot put it down.

The other reviews here do a good job of describing the merits of \\"The Dark Valley\\" with which I agree. \\"The Dark Valley\\" is 5 stars...both informative and fun. If you wish to go further, or want a deep treatment of the rise of the Nazi party, the Evans books are 5 stars on depth and information, but fall far short of \\"The Dark Valley\\" in terms of writing style and just plain good old story telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"husbands book","review":"Husband just loves reading about the different ways that things where done in the old days.

You other reviewers have got to be kidding!? (Or else they sent me a completely different item.) The quality is so poor it makes me think they've outsourced their product to China, really. I can literally see my hand through the heel. The toe has a thick band on top and is uncomfortable with and without shoes. I am so sad to be having to find a new manufacturer.

This album possesses two tracks at least. The problem with most of the reviews that are positive is that they are probably written by early to mid twenty year olds whose ears are so used to the garbage on the radio that this slight improvement as reflected by this album seems like Nirvana to them. Buy Do You Want More and Iladelph Halflife play them several times and then play this album several times and then compare and contrast. The Roots wanted to make money because in making music, art was stating to imitate life too much, and they weren't making any money.

There are a couple OK cuts that keep me from just throwing it out, but it's really not good. They don't do what they used to do really well, the subtle organic hip hop, and they don't do anything new that's interesting, it sounds like a series of tunes attempting to copy other artists, and in the end, it's only \\"different for different's sake.\\" If you've never heard The Roots before, this isn't the album that would win you over, definitely check out previous albums.

Do You Want More was by far the greatest Roots Cd they ever recorder. Things Fall Apart went a little down hill as the roots started getting into \\"harder\\" beats. This Phrenology junk though, is taking it too hard. All the songs sound like any other song played on BET or MTV these days...all exactly the same. What happened to the originality? What happened to the jazz? what happened?

This is the album the Roots were destined to make. After a lackluster last album, then receiving some highly deserved exposure with the Jay-Z unplugged sessions, the Roots upped the ante with Phrenology. Don't judge the potential of the album off the first wasted single, Break You Off. At first the song feels out of place in the running order but makes up for its inclusion with an extended free form session that last upwards of three minutes. Unlike Jay-Z who had the tools and the know-how to make a revolutionary hip hop album but came drastically short in taking any real chances, the Roots prove that there's more to hip hop than meets they eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"so dissapointed","review":"ok....ummm....what the hell happened?? how can a group go from something so good...to so bad...so fast??

All of the songs are great. Some of the best include \\"Sacrifice\\" (featuring Nelly Furtado),\\"Break You Off\\" (featuring Musiq) and \\"Water\\" which is a message to the group's departed emcee, Malik B. The song indicates that Malik obviously has a drug addiction. The last 6 minutes is a musical journey through the usage of a drug. It is a harrowing journey. The music seems like it belongs in a horror movie. It is truly one of the best Roots songs. The whole album is a great trek through some of the best hip-hop music.

Easy to sharpen, anyway. If you want to drill heavy stock, no. This is for thin sheet. Probably 10ga maximum. Stainless? Get one of the cobalt bits that cost 5 times as much. Given that's it's not a premium expensive item, it's great. Far easier than a hole saw or knockout punch. No slug to pry out. No starter hole. Don't expect to hold the work freehand for large holes. It needs a lot of torque and 2 hands to control the drill. I would not attempt to use it in a drill press for large holes. Needs maybe 100 RPM and unless you clamp the work it's dangerous.

Literally everything looks new, except for the dirty/faded coloration on the outside. Every penny spent on this rucksack has been earned back through its trials and tribulations...this thing is almost indestructable!

I can't for the life of me find anything useful to attach to the outside of the kata.3. Make it so that cameras like my D200 with the vertical grip fits more snug or give us an extra pick of cushioning material to place under the lens of camera's that sit so high.

The extras that come with this backpack are amazing, mine came with 2 sets of camera straps and one reflex e neck strap (that I love). On that bag it did say it was free while supplies last. The rain gear cover will be wonderful to use, and I do not think the pictures really describe the tripod holder well enough. It comes with the straps to attach it to the backpack as well as a stiff cup like pouch to hold the tripod. Hopefully this review helps.

(However, there was nothing in the product description to indicate that!) We have a 2004 Chrysler Town & Country with the factory installed roof rack. The clips on the latch-down belts that you have to wrap around the rack do not fit between the bottom of the rack and the car! For that reason, we were unable to actually use the bag, but it did appear to be of decent quality. Make sure you have half an inch or more between your roof rack and the roof of the car before you get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cargo carrier","review":"This cargo carrier worked great. B/c of the reviews that mentioned it not being waterproof, we packed everything in those plastic space saver bags. We drove over 1600 miles w/ it, not a problem!! On our way home it did rain and the inside did get wet, but it wasn't bad. Next time I will try that waterproofing spray you use for tents and see if that works. That is the only reason I give it four stars instead of five. We were definately happy w/it, and recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"I purchased this for our 12 hr drive to vacation. I knew with the price being so low that I wasn't getting anything fancy, and I was fine with that. I also knew this was not waterproof, and packed all my stuff in giant ziplock storage bags so it wouldn't get wet. It did rain for maybe a half hour on our drive, and when we arrived to our destination and when we opened the cargo bag, we realized that the interior of the bag disintegrated from that little bit of rain. Little bitty pieces of chipped off 'water-resistant' material went EVERYWHERE when we opened up the cargo bag to unpack. All over carpet in condo, all over ziplocks. Good thing I used the ziplocks, as they were more durable than this piece of JUNK! To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed with Amazon for even carrying this product. I trust the quality of their products, and this was a total fail. Will return ASAP. My advice? Spend $10 more and get a waterproof cargo bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"car top cargo bag","review":"So we used this exactly as instructed, and only filled it 3/4 of its capability.

We had to tape the straps and rips halfway home to ensure it made it. Ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me? The straps aren't waterproof?","review":"I have a 2008 Prius without any sort of roof rack. I purchased the 15 cu. ft. Roof Bag and installed it with no real issues. Then it started to rain--the straps soak up the water and transport it to the interior of the car, where it drips all over the seats. This is completely unacceptable! To add insult to injury, I can't get in touch with their customer service department. The recording either states their business hours (which I called well within) or that all their representatives are busy, then asks you to leave a message, and that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bag for the price.","review":"We needed a rooftop carrier for moving things one way from IL to AZ. We actually put 2 bags, end to end on top of our van and used ratcheting straps, instead of the straps included with the bags, across them in both directions to secure them to the rails on our van.

But from here on its mostly downhill. \\"Vuelvo al sur\\" is given a very simple repetitive drum-bass treatment with no variation of beat.What drew me to this album was seeing that track 3, \\"Homage to Chet Baker\\", was based on the wonderful tune \\"Alone Together\\". Unfortunately it's just a mess - the wonderful melody has no chance. Listen to Jo Stafford to hear this tune done properly.Track 5, \\"The Gaucho's Pain\\" is indeed that, a painful reworking of Piazzolla's \\"Oblivion\\"In summary: a commercial attempt to cash in on the tango nuevo mini-boom, with little of originality - sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Rich Mixes","review":"I bought this CD just for Libertango and found myself with quite a few nice surprises.

It combines elements of history, suspense, romance, and sentimentality in a very polished and effective fashion. In fact, because of its sentimental heart, I would say that the film is quintessentially Italian, except the writer/director Ferzan Ozpetek is Turkish.I appreciated the layers of storyline that Ozpetek created, and the film has such a lush sheen, it makes lower-middle class Italian life look pretty good. In fact, I enjoyed this movie so much, here's how far I have to stoop to find something to criticize:Why do marketers insist on giving movies asinine taglines? In this film's case it is: \\"Desire has no bounds.\\" This is so stupid, it would have put me off the movie had I been aware of it beforehand.

From beautiful faces, to mysteries of plot, to the sweetly understated ending, I found this film to be quietly heroic. What a shame that the manufacturer has discontinued production of this DVD.

The mother has a less than perfect marriage, has a frustrating job, and fantasizes a new life with the man with an an apartment with a window facing hers. The older man has a complex and checkered past, but has been able to provide for others. Although he can no longer find happiness or even peace in his own life, and reverts back to those times in the past where he did have love and meaning, he is still able to inspire. The movie deals with the questions of long vs. short-term goals in one's life, moral responsibilities to a spouse, ones children and ones self, different kinds of love, and more. I found it not an uplifting move, but an otherwise worthwhile one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facing Truth","review":"I love Ferzan Ozpetek. He is gorgeous and very sensetive.

It was originally written in Italian, but the book's publisher seems to have hired the worst Italian-English translators available, so the English is horrible. Also, many diagrams (and even some sections of text) are still in Italian (for example, see pages 31 and 40)! There are even some factual errors. On the other hand, it has some amazing pictures and a great layout, but that's pretty much all that's good about it. It would probably be really good in its original Italian version, so it's too bad I don't know Italian.

In some parts, the grammar is wrong to a level that makes it hard to understand sentences, or even paragraphs. In some instances, there are also original Italian words in the text which must have slipped through untranslated.Furthermore, there are lots of typos, and when it comes to numbers, this can make quite a difference. For example, on p. 226 some temperatures are given as 102 to the power of 7 K, and 101 to the power of 5 K (written with a superscript 7 and 5, respectively), where they actually should be 10 to the 27 K, and 10 to the 15 K, respectively -- quite a bit of a difference...All of this together does not build up a lot of confidence in the accuracy of the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst translation jobs ever to see print","review":"This book was originally written in Italian, and \\"translated\\" into English by someone who had a tenuous grasp of the language at best. \\"The Atlas Of The Skies\\" is full of misprints, nonsensical phrasing, weird punctuation errors, and outright mistakes of every kind imaginable (and some that I could never have imagined, until I came across them).Several photo captions are still in their original Italian - I don't know if they were missed, or if the \\"translator\\" threw up his hands in despair, and gave up.\\"The Atlas of the Skies\\" rates two stars, and those are only for the beautiful photos and excellent (though poorly annotated) diagrams it contains.I bought this book for my son, who was two at the time.

It has obviously been written by an Italian with an imperfect knowledge of English grammar and syntax, and it makes for very heavy reading. Sentences are long and difficult to follow. Other sentences have no verb. Some captions are wrong, and others are labelled in Italian.

It actually helped me to see the true side of the horror of the war. I can't imagine the pain the suffrage Meyer and Manya and her family went through. It is not only a story about getting through the war but also remarkable love story that happens during the Holocaust.In a way I recommend the book to teenage readers, because it focuses on the teenage Jews and the difficulties they went through at such young age. Meyer and Mayna were tough and by maintaining the faith and not loosing there hope in the fight to stay alive all through the time. We must not instruct our children to in no way let anything resemble like this happen again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing tribute...","review":"My dad had an autographed copy of this book and had recommended it for years.

Amanda Bynes is so hilarious but kind of annoying, but in a good way. Her antics kind of remind me of Laverne and Shirley. The older sister(who we all remember from 90210) is also funny in a neurotical kind of way. It is good she made that comedy transition, Jennie Garth is way better in this show than 90210. Simon Rex(who stayed on here for 1 season) plays Jeff, he is also funny and reminds me of Jack Tripper(3's Company) but in a laid back style. Gary is goofy and a great sidekick to Holly. The later seasons brought on more goofy characters as well like Lauren and Henry(who were also in this season) and Tina, Vince, and so on. This is not a chick show, it is a funny show for everyone, you just have to have an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Keep on whispering in my ear...\\"","review":"What I Like About You - The Complete First Season is my absolute favorite of the seasons. First of all, what's not to love, Amanda Bynes is a hoot, she has great comic timing and a cutiepie. Jennie Garth finally gets to shine in a comedy series, I loved her as Kelly Taylor on 90210 and I love her on this show as well. Garth is funny, silly, and possess's a girl-next-door quality. Bynes and Garth have great chemistry, they play sisters in the show and you believe their relationship, this show works really well. Created by Wil Calhoun who used to write for my other favorite show, Friends. Too bad hottie Simon Rex is only on the first season, he plays Garth's boyfriend, Jeff. Hey and look out for Dan Cortese who plays Garth's boss, Vic. Cortese reprises his role in season 4. I highly recommend getting the first season of What I Like About You, it's fresh, appealing, and laugh-out-loud funny. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely sitcom","review":"This is one of my fave guilty pleasure shows. It's a cute fluffy show about two sisters who live together in NYC. Jennie Garth and Amnda Bynes are hysterical. The first season is good and has some really great moment. But really it a show trying to find itself during this season. Jennie Garth was Pregnant, so alot of here scenes have her safe behind counters and such. Also she is in a relationship, so it kind of keeps her grounded and keeps her from having too much fun. However, toward the end of the seaon you start to see the show shaping into what it is going to be. The character of Lauren is introduced, played by the hysterical leslie grossman. she become much more centralized in season two and beyond. And Val ends her relationship with Jeff, which will soon be proven to be great for stories for Val. Its a great first season of a show in search of itself. A must own, as it gets so much better after here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Show!!!!","review":"I never was able to watch this show when it was on the air but now that they have the re-runs I have been able to watch all the episodes.

I was so bummed when I found out about the last season. Jenny Garth and Amanda Bynes are like true sisters! The relationship there is so realistic and heartfelt. I totally in love with Nick Zano and Dan Corese (even though he was only in last season and a few episodes of the second). Simon Rex in the first season is FALL DOWN FUNNY!! What a fantastic show!

It's hilarious and just so much fun and I LOVE Amanda Bynes. I hope the other seasons come out on DVD soon - this show always makes me smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the worst show...","review":"Here's the problem with this show- it starts out good in the first season as it explores the relationship between an odd couple of two sisters, and then quickly declines as it solely focuses on the love triangle between Holly (Amanda Bynes) and two young men. This cliche ends up ruining the cute and fun aspect of the show. I happen to think amanda bynes is talented and plays these quirky characters quite well (especially in What a Girl Wants and She's the Man). But seeing Jennie Garth play a character with awful comedic timing and who barely gets to deliver a comedic line is difficult to watch at times. Especially because of how great she was on Beverly Hills, 90210. I also think the show finds difficulty finding its own voice and struggles between being a comedy and being a cliched corny drama.

Soviet navy included (and the Russian Navy still includes) Baltic Sea Fleet, Black Sea Fleet, Northern Fleet and Pacific Fleet. The unnamed helmet on pp. 112-113 is (at least its current modification) KZ 94 (\\"Kaska Zashchitnaya\\" - protective helmet) and was intended to use both for crowd control (as Author has mentioned) and in fire service (where it still has some use)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST!","review":"I discovered this great poet at random in a library.

Another depressing bunch of stories, except for the title story, which was actually very funny in the beginning. All was internal thought, with no real action and, worse, no real resolving of problems. The endings just seemed to dwindle off into nowhere. How this man ever came to be thought of as a great writer is beyond me. And it is puzzling why almost all his characters who have internal dilemmas are women. He is always trying to get inside the mind of a woman and delve into how she perceives sex and men - while she is still a virgin.

All of my favorite characters are there, and the setting of the racecourse at Newmarket is different than most of the Victorian and Edwardian mysteries. The description of Lillie Langtry and her life seems pretty accurate from all that I have read, and so does the decription of the racing world at the time. I really enjoyed the mystery, although I was a bit disappointed if not surprised by the resolution. I enjoyed it very much on the whole. The authors have a knack for bringing historical figures to life and writing a good mystery along with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid entertainment","review":"Robin Paige has developed a Victorian mystery series revolving around Kate and Charles Sheridan that is well worth taking the time to explore. The author has clearly done her homework concerning the era and rarely makes a mistake, knows how to develop an intriguing plot, and gives us an enchanting hero and heroine. However, like M&M's or a hotdog at the baseball park, the books by Paige are quickly swallowed, thoroughly enjoyed, yet just as quickly forgotten after awhile. In other words, this series is excellent for entertainment, yet not a series I would spend my hard-earned cash for in order to own them in hardback.Unlike Anne Perry's fascinating darker Victorian mysteries involving the characters of Thomas and Charlotte Pitt, or the darkly deep written historical novels by Laurie King centering on Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes, this series by Paige is a lovely light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent picture book","review":"DOGTEAM is a beautifully illustrated, as well as beautifully, simply, dramatically written book.

Ruth Wright Paulsen is his wife and the spectacular watercolor illustrator of the book.

For example, the killer went to great pains to lead everyone to a certain conclusion about the killings and the type of person who had committed them. Then for absolutely no reason (other than as a plot device) the murderer completely changes tack. Also the killer's motivation to commit the crimes strikes me as beyond the realm of believability. It's okay to have farfetched plots and unusual motives, but they have to be believable within the context of the plot.

About 2 years ago, 500GB drives did not exist so instead LaCie decided to use RAID 0 2 x 250GB to get the 500GB capacity. BAD idea! Great for performance but you have zero redunancy. The fact that it only takes 1 drive to fail to lose all your data is highly risky to put any important files in it. Buy an external drive with 1 drive only or one that offers RAID 1 or RAID 5.

In any case, I heartily recommend this novel if you've read the first book. It zips along nicely, is well-crafted, like most Silva novels, and has a lot of suspense and excitement. It gives a pretty clear view of various aspects of \\"The Troubles\\" in Northern Ireland. One downer for me is the inclusion in the plot of a malicious global organization which exists only to foment turmoil. I think that's a device that insults the reader. Also, the ending gets crazy and silly. Silva cooks up such a good plot that he doesn't know how to resolve things, so he just makes a mad dash for the exit.

I assume he means a \\"Browning Hi-power\\", also known as a P-35 and is chambered for 9x19 mm cartridge. He then refers to a \\"high powered Herstal firing a 2 gram bullet. I assume he means the Fabrique National (FN Herstal) 5.7x28 mm pistol. Among several loadings listed are a 32 GRAIN (1.8 gram) bullet. Please, Mr. Silva--in the USA we measure projectile mass in grains, not grams.He also exhibits clear bias against hunting, the Republican party and features a protagonist so dumb that he tells terrorists to put down their sub-machine guns (instead of shooting them first)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Sequel","review":"Unlike many sequels, this was every bit as good, if not even better, than the original. The two protagonists, Osbourne and Delaroche, are such fascinating character studies. That alone made the book riveting. Also, I really loved the rather unconventional ending. I am now reading the later works by this author, but the absence of these characters makes them problematic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not ask for better","review":"I had read the book before, about 2 years ago. I needed another book to bridge the release of Mr. Silva's latest, The Defector. I'm glad I chose this book, as it was the last of the Michael Osbourne series and after listening the recording, I was impressed by the the quality of the recording and the quality of the merchandise I received.It has been an experience that I did not expect and will continue to purchase the audio books, as it is the instrument to break the monotony of commuting to and from work every day and expectation for the drive.Thank you for quality all around in merchandise, theme and service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up","review":"After having read \\"The Mark of the Assassin\\" I was looking forward to read this follow up. Unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations.Even if the lead characters are all the same and the conflict in Northern Ireland is insightful and interesting the story is much simpler this time. Even worse - the way they bring down the Ulster Freedom Brigade is so simple and unrealistic it almost hurts. (Such a simple trap is all it takes? Give me a break...)After having finished this book I could not get rid of the feeling that the author quickly needed a follow-up to his big (and first) success and did not take enough time to develop a better story.Too bad, a wasted opportunity..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute drivel","review":"I managed to get through the previous book, but couldn't manage more than 120 pages of this one. The writing is atrocious--it's so bad, I'd swear it was ghost written by an amateur--and the story simply laughable, beyond implausible and yet utterly predictable. The worse aspect of all is wishing the main character would die and why he didn't when there were so many easy opportunities is the biggest mystery of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Marching Season...you can't put it down","review":"Silva creates another winner with The Marching Season. Like Unlikely Spy and Mark of the Assassin, Silva copies from the Tom Clancy best-seller formula. Take one unassuming man, thrust him into combat with villains, and wait for the royalties to roll in.I couldn't put the book down. It's a tad implausible, but exciting just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"Warning: Do NOT read this book before reading Mark of the Assassin as this is really MotA Volume II. There are many references back to MotA (another really good story in my opinion). I really liked this book and I felt the story was very well told. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"thank god for good story tellers!","review":"In the past 4 weeks I have read several books; novels, non-fiction and some that are somewhere in between. However, \\"The Marching Season\\" makes them all pall. Mr Silva now ranks with Clive Cussler, Jack Higgins, W.E.B. Griffin, Michael Connelly, and outshines Tom Clancy in my list of favorite authors. The book is extermely fast paced and readable. I started the book at 8:30 a.m. and finished at 6:30 p.m.. Mr Silva please don't change your style or your characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic but fast","review":"I reread this book recently and failed to see why it had stuck out in my mind as one of the better espionage books I had come across. The plot is derivatave, taking elements from authors like Ludlum as well as modern movies...believe me this isn't anything anyone familiar with the genre hasn't seen many times. The main characters are pretty clich��d, the new family man who must return to the CIA (think Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan) and the coldhearted assassin who will stop at nothing to fulfill his mission. On the positive side, I was never bored with the book. It hums along on a decent page and builds tension fairly well. Unfortunately, the ending is anticlimactic and the story goes more or less where expected. Basically, if you are looking for the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific sequel - with more to come","review":"The troubles of Northern Ireland spark the return of Michael Osbourne to the CIA and his nemesis, the assassin known as October to the killing fields. The Society is still up to its usual deadly mischief, double dealing in Washington DC is alive and well and it looks as though there is little that can be done to stop an assassination which will sabotage the peace process. How all of this plays out is what keeps this book humming from start to finish. Some scores are settled, but it is doubtful that we have seen the last of the characters that survive David Silva's sequel to The Mark of the Assassin. And that is very good news."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great poetry","review":"A friend is a Howard U classmate of the author and introduced me to his work.

The price of this reader is hefty. Considering what you get in return, only confirmed enthusiasts should pony up that amount. A big point in the book's favor: an interview with screenwriter Daniel Mainwaring, aka Geoffrey Homes, (Out of the Past, Invasion of Body Snatchers,et.al.), a major influence on the genre, and the only interview with this neglected figure that I know of. Lastly, it's remarkable how many of these artists were unaware of contributing to a distinct body of work we now call film noir.

Told with gripping narrative, it is hard to put down: it took me only three days to read. As a Colombian, for me it is also a source of profound sadness, because the book, through its tale, illustrates all the workings of colombian politics, with all its lies, manipulations, self-interests, and lack of any decent statemanship and generosity. Except for a few personalities, all the actors in this drama show an inmense human mediocrity, from the president of the nation on down. Also, it shows the brutality of an armed force that has always been distinguished by its corruption and incompetence in the field of battle. This book should be mandatory reading for anybody interested in Colombian politics, history and society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another absorbing journey with Freeman Dyson.","review":"Mr. Dyson is one of the most respected and distinguished physicists in the world. He is also a great science writer for the layman. Although a gentle and gracious man by nature, Dyson is not afraid to take on the sacred cows and unfashionable areas of science, and it is obvious that there is little beyond his powers of comprehension. When I read Freeman Dyson, I feel as though I am in the presence of supreme, but very kindly intellect. This is a collection of 17 lectures that touch on many subjects, including 6 on biology. Unplug the phone, lock the door--whatever it takes to have some quiet time to yourself--and read this absorbing and thoughtful book. It will change the way you look at the universe around you. This book will also introduce the you other fascinating books that you've never heard about but will wish that you had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infinitely Intereting","review":"dyson is such fun to read.

While this book has great historical and wine production reference information,it seems to be a pay to play publication. Many of these books feature only wineries that are willing to pay to be a part of the publication, If you don't pay, you're winery is not included. Many, many fine wineries in both Sonoma and Napa are not listed in this book. DO NOT use it as a guide to all wineries in the area - you will miss many of the best. Some of the smallest wineries, with limited budgets have the best wine - they are not represented in this book - probably because they couldn't afford to pay for inclusion. The so called \\"Master List\\" in the back is very misleading - it is missing many wineries.

The author also describes in fascinating detail, the opulent wealth this family possessed, and the mansions, social circles, and life-style that went with it! It is so sad that the family could not have worked together to better manage their inheritances; and that many of the beautiful homes this wealth afforded were shamelessly demolished!

It was so easy to connect to my TV, Satellite Receiver and VCR and the interface is very simple. I have already recorded television shows and I've already backed up some home VHS tapes onto DVD. And they look fantastic. DONT FORGET YOU HAVE TO FINALIZE DVDs to get them to read on other DVD players!!

I have a Panasonic DVD-R recorder which is much better: better picture quality, better reliability, and better user interface. Also, DVD \\"minus\\" discs are much more compatible with DVD players than DVD \\"plus,\\" although if you have a new player, it should have no trouble with either format.The real problem with the Lite-On/Gateway is build quality. The player feels cheap, and it does tend to get hot as some reviewers have pointed out, which is a problem for those of us wanting to keep it in an entertanment center. You literally need to put an AC next to it to cool it during long recordings. Also, my particular unit broke after a few months, so I don't have much confidence in this brand.You might be better served with a Panasonic or Toshiba, which will offer better quality and reliability (important for DVD recordings) at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems good so far","review":"I have only one nights experience with this unit to grade it on but so far so good but I wanted to know does anyone else notice that when you copy a dvd that was already copied say through x-copy or any other decrypter software it seems like the picture is darker than original any one have any ideas on this"},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to change the setting to use s-video","review":"For the guy downstair.

Worse yet, LiteOn tech support will not replace my unit unless I send it to them first (a process that will take 2 weeks). Plus, I have to pay for shipping.

It was the piece that helps to hold down the DVD while reading and recording (I assume). I took it back to the store (had the extended warranty)and they gave me a new one to replace it.

In fact it's basically a game script because the exact same things happen in the book as in the game. The Master Chief gets in a billion fights, and its really fastpaced. The thing is, it gets really old really fast. It's basically M. C. running around and shooting hundreds of guys every page, a book shouldn't be like your playing the game. The only thing I really like was the other Marines and their story of struggle. The Covenant's point of view during the story wasn't bad either. Overall, it's an alright book. I wouldn't recommend it, but if your a die-hard Halo fan go ahead and buy it, otherwise borrow it or steer clear of it. Play the game, it's funner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mirrors the game","review":"Maybe it's because I've played the game so many times, but I found this something of a slow read.

The Fall of Reach was actually pretty good considering it was a game tie in. The Flood is terrible as a literary work. It reads more like a synopsis of someone playing the game than an actual book.

This book is only for those addicted to Halo even then you can't be too picky about your storylines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, not nearly as good as The Fall of Reach","review":"This book is an acceptable action romp, with plenty of action and gore and etc. However, it suffers from two major flaws. Both can be overlooked, but this book isn't going to be winning any awards.First, the author just isn't that good. The Coventant aren't very convincing, and the marines hollow stereotypes. The description of the actions scenes is passable, but all two often degrades into \\"Master Chief shot so and so, then turned and shot so and so.\\" Hardly what we want when we can just play the game and get the same effect.Which leads me to the books second major flaw: it's basically the game translated into book form. The parts with the marines are interesting, and fill in some of the background material the game was missing, but the parts with the Master Chief (comprising probably 70% of the book) are scene by scene adaptations of the game, with very little new.The final word?

Too much dialogue, and lines that weren't in the game sound more like they belong to a wanna-be badass in some cheesy action movie.Mr. Dietz, I pray you have no involvement with the writing of 343i's new Reclaimer Trilogy.

The franchise is one of my all-time favorites, so please do not write off this review as if it was written by your average internet \\"troll\\".With that said, this book was one of the most disappointing pieces of literature that I have ever read. The author managed to take the storyline of the first Halo game and turn it into something akin to a 1980's action flick. The Master Chief acts completely out of character in many places and it appears that the author just threw any established lore and cannon out the window in others. In addition to this, parts of the book are just BORING.It pains me to write this, but please do yourself a favor and avoid this book. This book is in my opinion only marginally better than Mr. Dietz's other infamous work, Mass Effect: Deception.Again, STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book pretty much follows the game to a tee.

In this edition, it's pretty much a novelization of Halo the game. But it fleshes out behind the scenes parts that we didn't get to see in the game. It chronicles all the events of the Master Cheif fighting for his life and the survival of humanity on the ring world as well as giving us moments with supporting cast, no matter how large or small.Despite having a different author than the fall of reach, elements of the first book play a part in this chapter as well.Reading this book brought back all the memories I had of playing through and beating Halo the game for the first time and made me remember why I loved the game so much.Although fans of the game might enjoy it more than people who haven't played the game, anyone that's a fan of good sci fi should check this book out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo [The Flood]","review":"Halo the flood, was a pretty good book. It had Humans, Aliens, and mutans all killing each other. Master cheif is a sparten that likes blowing up stuff that gets in his way. I hope you get this book because it's really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally worthless book","review":"this book totally follows the game almost word for word it goes into a little more detail but its useless detail. if youve played the games at least once there is no reason to read this book. however the first book (fall of reach) and the third book (first strike) are a thousand times better with a better author (eric nylund)"},{"rating":"1","title":"legendary","review":"I recommend that you read this book on the \\"legendary\\" difficulty setting. You will have to read and re-read certain sections endlessly, but you'll finish the book with bragging rights. Do you really want to tell your friends that you only read this book on \\"normal?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite book of the series.","review":"And for good reason. The book doesn't really delve into any backstory or characters. It's basically a walkthrough of the game. Some parts are really good, but then go into pages upon pages of Master Chief mowing down Covenant and Flood. I just couldn't give it more than two stars because there were just too many pages of mindless killing of Covenant. We understand the book is based off of a video game, but it doesn't need to be an exact walkthrough of the game. I'd like to see future authors branch out a little more and really create more of a Halo Universe. Definitely a skipable book in the Halo series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This book was pretty darn good. I have played the game and this book ads a great storyline to great action. The author's style of writing seems very militaristic which gives the reader the feel of actually being in the story. My favorite aspect of the book is the accuracy, and the newly added events to fill up blank parts of the original story without completely changing the story. Good book. If you liked the game, you'll love the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"i thought that the book was not very good the first book was much better. In the first book \\"the fall of reach\\" you learn about the Master Chief and the Spartans you learn why Master Chief is the only one of his kind left. you learn all about his training and it leads up to the game perfectly....but when i read the second book \\"the flood\\" i thought it shouldnt have been written.... maybe if you havent played the game you should read it but for all of us die hard Halo fans you played the game and already know whats going to happen. so i wasnt really into the book because i already knew the outcome. In \\"the fall of reach\\" you dont know whats going to happen next. so i recomend reading Halo \\"the fall of reach\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironically, this is the wrong book for a Halo fan to read.","review":"The people who are the target demographic of Halo novels - namely, people who've played Halo games - will not be well-served by this book. It really is just a recapitulation of the first entry in the game series, focusing almost completely on action, and even then not very well.Boasting that your futuristic pistol can \\"reach out and touch someone\\" is not what you'd call high art in terms of prose, but that's not the real issue. The problem is the direct description of the game as it goes from level to level and room to room. Getting lost in the confusing map design of the library level? That's actually in here, and not in a charming way. It grinds the story to a halt. It all feels like a retread of the story you know very, very well.Anyone who wants to get more out of the Halo universe should go to the other books to expand it. This one's too familiar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halo: The Flood","review":"Halo: The Flood would be great if you wanted a book that read like a war video game, which is what it came from.

Found myself skipping entire chapters on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replaying the video game would be more interesting.","review":"The Fall of Reach brought real richness to the Halo universe in terms of history and characterization. It's a book based on a video game, sure, but it doesn't insult your intelligence and gives your imagination some new space to roam.In contrast, everything in The Flood is dumbed down. There's little sense of wonder, some things don't make much sense, and the battles are formulaic. Even the prose gets repetitive. For instance, every ship that is hit \\"shudders\\" before going down. I got bored, gave it another few chapters, and then shelved it.I would recommend skipping this book and replaying the video game."},{"rating":"1","title":"A verbal account of the Halo 1 video game.","review":"This book seemed awkward to me as the author simply describes the actions a player would be going through as they played the game. Cut scene dialogue is verbatim, some scenarios are expanded for plot purposes, and some new characters are introduced to fill out the straight-from-the-screenplay storyline. Perhaps the only somewhat interesting part is that you get to know what other characters are doing on Halo while you are completing missions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing if you've played the game","review":"The only people I can recommend this book to are those who have not played Halo but wish to play Halo 2. It basically tells, blow by blow, exactly what happens in the first game and what astute players were supposed to infer from hints dropped through the game.It's competently enough written, but is a waste of time if you want more from the Halo universe. Try \\"First Strike\\" instead, which takes place immediately after Halo."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have played Halo, you have already \\"read\\" this book!","review":"If you haven't played the Xbox game Halo then this book is not a bad read. It will completely ruin the story for you if you ever do play the game though.The best way I can describe Halo: The Flood is if someone sat next to you while you played the game and just wrote down everything that happened, added some extra dialog and \\"off-screen\\" action and put it all in a paperback novel. I couldn't wait to finish it, but of course...I knew how it was going to end before I even started reading it.If you haven't played the game and never intend to, it probably deserves a 4 out of 5, but if you have played the game don't even bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Sides to Every War","review":"A Very well written book, following the game in every aspect, including both sides of the story. Covenant and Human thinking, with a pinch of Flood thoughts, this book shows all the aspects of what happened on the forsaken derilect called HALO. You also learn a new appreciation for Master Chief as he goes through the Lybrary. The writer allows you to relive the game, and want to play it over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"bad reviews but it really is a good book","review":"i bought this book inspecting it to suck my friends and the reviews told me so, but after reading it, i thought it was a good book it kept me interested and gave me more details of what was going on in the first game. there were some parts that were drawn out, but if you like halo and want a good read its worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"I have only read this book once and it was several years ago but I still feel the taste of disgust in my mouth when thinking about it. This book is not a fun read nor does it add anything interesting to the Halo Universe.

It wasn't what i expected, but there are some really good perspectives in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Success","review":"The second book in the Halo series was incredible.

Good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its been awhile since I have read a book that fails on so many levels","review":"The title and cover say HALO but you wouldn't know it to read this book. Whereas The Fall of Reach and Fleet Strike were light and fun The Flood is painful. Basically the problem that I had with this installment is that both Master Chief and Cortana behave in ways dissimilar to their ingame personas and new characters when introduced prove boring and tedious to read.Overall-It's the literary equivalent of having the author hit you with a baseball bat for 200 pages and that's difficult for me to say because I love all things HALO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo flood novel","review":"This is exactly according to the original Halo game plot.

I read it at least three times a day to her. The book has great illustrations, and it's refreshing to have a story in which the father interacts with his child in such a fun and playful way. The story is told from the child's point of view and recounts a snowy day in which the father is snowed in and can't go to work.

This book is about a boy, Vince Luca, who is the son of a known mob leader. Everything in Vince's life is based around the outside of the law. Every relationship Vince has is screwed up because of his father's business. But then he finds Kendra. They fell for each other quickly but then Vince finds out she is the daughter of the head agent investigating his father. So it's the Son of the Mob and the Cops daughter. What happens next you ask?

If you like to have an easy read type of book i would reccommend it to anyone. The main character is 17 yeards old, but his language and reactions are that of a 12 year old.

Oh, Kendra's dad just so HAPPENS to be an FBI agent, and the one that's investigating Vince's family.

One of his most often quoted analogies, \\"atoms to bits\\", is explained in this well written look at the future. With verve and clear vision, Negroponte examines the effect of being wired, and (correctly) emphasizes content above all. He makes concise statements without techno-babble, and does some small debunking of current myths. The work is flawed by the one-sided, totally optimistic look at technology. It is almost as bad as Stoll's raving in _Silicon Snake Oil_, and the need for an unbiaised, critical opinion is clear. Regardless, _being digital_ is a great book to tell venture capitalists to read before they invest in your Internet capable weenie roaster"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prophetic","review":"Prophetic.

Being a writer, maybe I see things that other people would not see, but his metaphors just seem a little wrong, his adjectives just a little off. But hey, that's nitpicking.

He also sets the stage for WWII and builds the suspense to the boiling point until in the last tantalizing paragraphs the second World War, the one that Turtledove has been marching towards during hte entire series explodes.

Nietzsche was misunderstood all his life. I am not surprised if Gorfu too, has misunderstood him. The book may be well written, but what is the purpose?

Gorfu?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but requires a lot of knowledge from the reader","review":"Though I have a degree, it is not in philosophy, and my knowledge of Nietzsche is very scketchy, to say the least.

Gorfu's grasp and understanding of the biblical story of the Israelites and the history of Europe, is superb. Though I have no question in my mind it is a well written book, I found myself repeatedly going back and re-reading some sections and paragraphs just to make sure I understood it. This book is not lesure reading. It requires some serious concentration in places. After all, the subject matter is philosophy.

I read Gorfu Contra Nietzsche, and have now mulled over it for a good three months before I decided to write this review. Gorfu has a valid point.

The book helped me see that it was my job to help set my son up for success and teach him how to use that set-up.4. The book showed me that the school was dead wrong when it told me just to dump the problem in my son's lap and let him struggle.Sure the book is mostly common sense. But not everybody has the ability to crystallize the information so succinctly or help tailor it to one's own family situation.The school year is still young, but we're light years ahead of where we were last year thanks to this book.

A Very pop and UPBEAT flavor that hooked me right from the first 10 seconds of the song. Religous fanatics may be offended by JESUS IN A CAMPER VAN but chances are, religious fanatics wouldn't buy this CD anyway.

Save your money Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop music at its best","review":"I will be honest, I am not really into pop music of this type. However, the lyrics are realistically blunt with some interesting melodies. For exapmle, you have probably heard \\"Millenium\\" with a sample of Nancy Sinatra's \\"You only live twice\\" from the James Bond movie of the same name. \\"Jesus in a camper van\\" is a catchy tune. \\"Let me entertain you\\", ... did he manipulate a line of Nirvana's fame?? Well i think this is one of the better cd's i bought in 1999. And because i think most new music is awful, that says a lot. I encourage you to get this cd even if you only know and love a few songs. You are sure to like the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for CD due to lyrics, otherwise five stars","review":"My interest in Robbie Williams began after hearing MILLENNIUM on the radio. I searched for this song. I finally heard the name, Robbie Williams, mentioned and went to Amazon.com. I listened to the clips available to hear and ordered the CD.I was shocked when I listened to the entire CD. Robbie Williams has much talent as a singer, and the music is wonderful to the ear. JESUS IN A CAMPER VAN, is heretical. The first line of STRONG is truly distasteful. These two songs, in particular, are 180 degrees from MILLENNIUM and YOU'RE ONE OF GOD'S BETTER PEOPLE.The music and vocal talents earn a five star rating, The CD earns only two stars primarily based on the quality of the lyrics. Since I won't be listening to it anymore, I truly wish I could get a refund"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustrated...","review":"I must start and end with saying that Amazon.com have been great!The seller who was supposed to ship the CD, however, was very poor.

THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE YEARS MUST HAVES!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome blossom!","review":"Why aren't people attacking CD shelves and breaking doors on their way to grab this CD? I expect no less from the masses. Backstreet Boys? Ricky Martin? ARE ALL OF YOU CRAZY? This man's the real deal. His respectable, yet not too hefty, sales records proves, once again, that Americans have no taste. Shame on us! Robbie Williams is truly amazing. His sound has depth and a texture that embodies a real character--he really comes through his music. I was knocked-off my socks listening to this CD. I guarantee you will enjoy listening to Mr. Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"The nicest surprise of the year...","review":"I hated (Read: despised, abhorred...) Take That so imagine my surprise when I came across a little song called \\"Millennium\\" from Take That's own Robbie Williams. Bright, brash and bouncy. I guess I can see the comparisons to Ricky Martin, but, come on, RW's lyrics are obviously miles ahead of Martin's! This isn't your normal \\"boy band\\" mindless tripe. It's intelligent without being overbearing and just plain fun. Plus, RW's got a cover of a World Party song (\\"She's The One\\") and he's \\"endorsed\\" by Oasis. What more could you want? Buy it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Amazing!","review":"I was recently in England to visit with my family for Christmas. While I was there, Robbie Williams gave a concert on t.v. I watched because there was nothing else on. He was amazing. I liked him and his music so much, that I bought a 1999 calender of him. My family noticed that I liked him so much, that they bought me his first two cds. I never stop listening to them! I have tryed to get my friends to listen to him, but they aren't quite ready to dive in yet. Once he is big over here (U.S.A.) they will have wished they had taken my advice! His music really says alot. It tells you different ideas that people may not be aware of. I can't wait to listen to every cd that he makes! I recommend his music to everyone. It's Amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It's a concept album. The concept being, it's terrific!\\"","review":"And it is. It's pop, it's rock, it's sweet, it's outrageous. Held together compeltely by a distinctive, charismatic style. Every single song is amazing, no exceptions. I too wonder why he hasn't caught on here, but I feel all the more privileged to be a fan. His concert in Boston was one heck of a show - he lives to entertain, and I love every second of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"thumbs down","review":"I hate to say it, but Robbie Williams is the male version of Madonna. I like Madonna, but I can't stand Robbie Williams. The only song that I barely tolerate is Millenium. He probably thinks that he's Sean Connery the way he acts. So in other words, he sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music and vocals are great, the lyrics drag down the CD","review":"My interest in Robbie Williams began after hearing MILLENNIUM on the radio. It took me some time to finally discover who the artist was. I found out and went to Amazon.Com. I listened to the available clips and ordered the CD.I was shocked when I listened to the entire CD. Robbie Williams is an extremely talented singer and the music is wonderful to the ear. JESUS IN A CAMPER VAN is heretical. The first line of STRONG is truly distasteful. These two songs, in particular, are 180 degrees from MILLENNIUM and YOU'RE ON OF GOD'S BETTER PEOPLE. Due to lyric content I only can listen to six songs on this CD.The music and vocal talents earn a five star rating. Sorry the lyrics lower the rating to only two stars. The hidden track is very sophmoric and below a talented artist as this.Just for the record I have written email to the Robbie's Management without response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk.","review":"It's a good thing that butt-ugly British import Robbie William's popularity seems to be taking an expected nose-dive.

I hope Robbie Williams ends his days very soon at the end of a sewage duct pile-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool cd","review":"I thought this cd was really good, except for the fact that he copied Oasis, the Beatles, and, apparently, Elton John. My favorite songs are Millenium, Win Some, Lose Some, and Angels. I really liked this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta say this...","review":"I really like Robbie's style, he's a kool and sympathic guy. i also like his videoclips because they are somtimes so outrageous and therefore kinda brave, I like it! But still: This man just can't sing! I really think his voice is an unpleasant tone which makes u wanna turn off the radio and watch the videoclips without tone. I mean Robbie is a good entertainer and a kool gyu but his voice is a tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the antacid, quick","review":"The title tells it, actually: the ego has landed -- right on your head. The best way to torpedo this Britpopstar is to simply let his music torpedo itself. Glittery, catchy, and fulsome, Williams' idea of pop music is to simultaneously flatter and insult his audience by cooing into their ear while letting you know that he's the one uniquely qualified to do so. Pure pap for nonpeople."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD & Great Music","review":"I read in Entertainment Weekly magazine that this was their choice for Best Album of 1999. This made me very curious, so I decided to check out the samples on Amazon and read the other customer reviews. I was hesitant about buying it, but finally decided to go for it. Boy, am I glad I did...this is a fantastic Cd and I can see where Entertainment Weekly is coming from ~ if you have doubts, erase them because this Cd is worth owning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robbie Rules","review":"Quite simply you must listen to this CD. It's soft. It's hard. It's loud. It's easy listening. It's everything. Robbie shows just how versatile he is and often bares his soul in doing so. Clever lyrics and great catchy tunes. Lets hope for more of the same from this most individual of artists. All tracks tell a story and my favourites are the raunchy \\"Man Machine\\" and the beautifully anthemic \\"She's The One\\". ENJOY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars","review":"So what if his first album spent about a year in top 10 and his second album has gone 8 times platinum? It doesn't mean that everyone who bought his album liked it. And just because he's been compared to Mick Jagger, George Michael, Elton John, Freddie Mercury, Frank Sinatra, Sean Connery, Tom Jones and John Lennon doesn't have to mean that he's really that good!PS. Check him out. I gave him five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant,fantastifc, Robbie's album is the best!!!","review":"The album has great lyrics and catchy tunes. Very brilliant.

We've had the privilege of listening to Robbie for the past few years since he split from Take That and the fact that he managed to break away from that TeenBoyBand image and gain the respect of proper music lovers is phenomenal. His performance at Glastonbury last year was voted as the best - outing the indie groups who regularly take the top slot. This is a cd that has to be listened to LOUD. I guess it's a pity that he's such a cocky little sod. :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the US!","review":"I would give it 5 stars, but his two imports are a better choice than this collection - however, \\"Angels\\", \\"No Regrets\\" and \\"Let me Entertain You\\" are amazing songs. From one rockstar to another, Robbie, your ego is welcome here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robbie Williams is the new George Micheal!","review":"I know being English makes me biased but I always knew Robbie could make it in America! Also I couldn't find Westlife's debut single Swear it Again but I would like everyone to know it's great! They are managed by Ronan Keating from Boyzone and if you like boyzone and britpop you will love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robbie Williams in person","review":"I haven't yet heard the whole album, but as someone who works in a radio station, I had the pleasure of meeting Robbie and his band when they came in for an intimate performance at our studios. The songs he sang (all from \\"The Ego Has Landed\\") were fantastic, and I look forward to getting the whole CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"His voice is the combination of pet shop boys and oasis.

The album is new and has songs from his many songs from U.K., Tons of quality hits!1"},{"rating":"2","title":"No regrets","review":"It is unfortunate that Robbie Williams has not truly burst onto the American music scene. I found this album a refreshing break from the pomposity and fluff that is American pop music. I enjoyed the fact that instead of every song sounding like the next, each was unique in and of itself. Is this my favorite album? No...that place currently belongs to \\"Sing When You're Winning\\" Am I glad I bought the album? Yep, no regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robbie Williams - THE EGO","review":"The Albums \\"Life thru a lens\\" and \\"i've been expecting you\\" which robbie has released in britain are both fantastic so the combination of the two makes for an absolute beauty of an album. He has already released 9 singles from this album in britain and will have a new album out in September. Robbie Williams ia a good singer but has unbelievable character and his uniqueness will ensure that he will be in the music business for many years to come - if he can be bothered that is! This cd is fantastic - end of story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT CD","review":"Robbie rocks. That's all I can say. From the exciting, uplifting \\"Millennium\\" to his just really cool songs like \\"Jesus in a Camper Van\\" and \\"Win Some Lose Some,\\" Robbie Williams has a great way of writing and singing that just makes you feel great."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE POP STAR: wacky, sexy, poetic, derivative, TALENTED","review":"The best pop star in a LONG time. A smashing combo of Iggy Pop, Elton John, Freddie Mercury, and many more pop icons.Tip: fast forward to 13:40 on the last song to hear Robbie recite his poem \\"Hello Sir,\\" where he tells an old schoolteacher where to go!LONG LIVE ROBBIE WILLIAMS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fan of his since Take That","review":"I think that if Robbie Williams had not left Take That when he did then he would have gone the way the rest of them have over here. That is out of the picture. He is a great singer, he could give the Spice Girls a run for their money any day. He did a tv special over here that was in the Royal Albert Hall and yes ok people did complain about his swearing and yes it was after the watershed (9.00pm) but that is just the way he is. He is fun loving. So buy this album and give him another chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is so cool!","review":"He has got a unique sound, that makes you feel like you are on cloud 9. Makes you wanna tap your toe. So go out and buy \\"The Ego Has Landed\\", it will be a great addition to your CD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Pretty good album I must say.

Very \\"britpopish\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An artist that's sure to win the hearts of millions!!","review":"I've only heard of Robbie Williams from MTV and the radio, but I love this guy already! I'm voting to have \\"Millinium\\" as our senior class song of '99 @ Victoria High School in Victoria, Texas. I love the message it sends, it's perfect for us seniors. It makes me think of our lives and the real world that lies ahead for us to take on!! Thank you Robbie!!Love, N.P. Rockin'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music","review":"I am sick of the pretentiousness of some reviewers who think if it's not got some deep message, it's not good enough. Robbie Williams has a beautiful voice and that's enough to make this CD worth listening to, beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ego You Can't Help But Love","review":"Robbie Williams is the BritPop equivalent of Lauryn Hill. His honest lyrics and catchy hooks, that play on melodies from some of our favorite old (and new) school British artist, are undeniable captivating. Every song is worthy of a top 10 single and his ballads are ripped from the same cloth as \\"Candle in the Wind\\". His cheeky British humor that comes across in quite a few of his lyrics may be why he hasn't totally captivated a US market whose only concern seems to be a preoccupation with half naked boy bands professing which way they want it. But, for those of you who want more substance (and a cute mug) this is THE album to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try this fuel pump","review":"I would recomend this fuel pump for a muscle car or any car that does not need a high pressure pump it is great for the price & is not very noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This churned-out biography tries to sensationalize Conrad by speculating an affair with Jane Anderson and speculating Conrad's dislike of the sea and speculating, and speculating, and speculating ...Don't waste your money.

I agree caring for the environment helps all living things but really???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Young adult fantasy for everyone","review":"I read Unicorns in the Rain nearly ten years ago and the story is still fresh in my mind. This book tackles a future where humanity has lost all hope and one woman unwittingly finds herself thrown in with a family who believes that the world will be flooded as it was in biblical times. This family has collected two of every animal, including two unicorns. Since this book was, I feel, originally written for the younger crowd the prose is simple and the novel short and direct, but withing the few pages is a tale that has haunted me for ten years with its tragic view on a possible future for our world and the fate of fantasy's most beloved animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young Kids!","review":"Overall the book isn't worth reading.Also, I know the book was intended for middle-school aged girls, but you should read it before you pass it on to anyone.*Spoilers**Spoilers*In the book, there was the brutal death of an animal stomped on multiple times; the main character 'used' to be huge into drugs but now she only smokes joints every now and then; a pregnant girl in the house smokes cigarettes and asks for a joint - then proceeds to ask the main character if she has ever had an orgasm; and finally she ends up having 'passionate' sex with a guy she met the day before.Pretty hilarious, actually.The only part that was good was one brief interaction with the male unicorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good I read it twice","review":"I first came across \\"The Inverted World\\" in a SF collection of short stories many, many years ago. The funny thing is that the ending was very different and to be honest a lot more plausible than the one in the full length book which does require a great leap of faith.Having said that this book totally sucked me in. I read it more or less straight through (I can't remember the last time I did that with a book) and then I read it straight through again (never done that). I am surprised that there has never been a film but there again Rendevous with Rama hasn't made it to the silver screen yet either. Priest builds a quite plausible little world out of a completely implausible situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"great to start a business or to stay in business","review":"As a person going through the struggles of starting my own business, had I had this book in the beginning, I believe that many of the struggles I faced would have been diminshed. Melvin Gravely has absolutely captured the essence of the \\"going into business\\" experience. All entrepreneurs go through the same stages and fears. Melvin has given me insight into the challenges I had and still do struggle with. Now I have insight and tools to understand and work through those issues.

The acting is in the standard British \\"stiff upper lip\\" model but none the less superb, as is to be expected from John Mills. Also, this copy, provides an adequate soundtrack, unlike the other DVD production copy, also available from Amazon, which presents an extremely noisey sountrack on our DVD system.

This knife is made in Japan, cuts paper thin vegetables and the short length is just perfect. After using it for the first time, I noticed the blade started rusting. I called the customer service to see what they have to say about this before I returned it. Apparently, this knife consists of three layers, the outer layer being stainless steel, middle layer being another type of steel, and the innermost layer being \\"carbon steel\\" which is the blade itself. The innermost layer is the only layer which rusted. According to the customer service, if the knife is not washed and dried immediately after every use, it will rust.If you have the patience to immediately wash and dry the knife after every use, rusting should not occur (so it is claimed). But I have the habit of washing my knife and let it hang dry in the knife storage. It is going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"I use this knife daily","review":"This is an outstanding steel knife. The blade stays sharp for a long time. It is very well balanced for cutting and chopping. Comfortable handle. Blade is not too big, but plenty long for cutting just about everything.

There are quotes from Einstein, Jim Davis, Abe Lincoln, T. S. Elliot, Erma Bombeck, and Mark Twain just to name a few. Only a cat lover could understand exactly what the author meant by his or her quote. There are also little tid-bits of cat lore, information about the animal, nursery rhymes, and superstitions mixed among the quotes themselves. I found this book a \\"Must Have\\" for any one who owns a cat or has owned a cat and feels that he or she truly understands this amazing creature. I laughed and smiled as I read each page.

I was hoping to learn about the history of Islam and origins of the violence from some of the modern-day Muslims. Instead, I wasted my time wading through supposed \\"history\\" and \\"facts\\" to find that I was reading a biased, non-factual and emotional polemic. It is shocking what passes for scholarly and historic these days. Do not waste your time and money on this when there are many books on this subject that are worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"From the preface forward, Schwartz spins a tale that would have the believer swallow the nonsense that Wahhabists are hijacking this peaceful religion called Islam (submission). He misses few opportunities to insult conservatives and even compares Christians who embrace the fundamentals of Christianity as similar to Wahhabism (p. 79). There must be some value to this work, but it is disheartening to wade through the muck contained in this book to find an occasional gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and mendacious","review":"The author's suggestion that pre-Wahhabist Islam had been peaceful, and the Ottoman Empire tolerant, is a fallacy better understood in the context of his own conversion to Islam. Mr. Schwartz is known among his co-religionists as Suleyman Ahmad and has an eccentic entry on >jews-for-allah.org< about his relgious experience. This is essential information about the author and his agenda. It is unfortunate that it is missing from the blurb or from the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"pictured wrong","review":"The product photo display depicts 2 ea. tube, an o-ring and a pressure coupler.

The white stick is not as soft as it should be, and the flavor goes away very quickly. I was extremely disappointed, I've bought this from other makers and it had a much stronger flavor. In other words, this is a cheap imitation and the company that makes it must making LOTS of money off of it. Don't buy it, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like cloves, you'll love this gum!","review":"I love love love this gum! I used to find it at World Market, but they have stopped selling it. It was $1 per pack, so this is a little better deal at 20 packs for less than $18, but not by much.The clove taste is \\"full\\" but not too strong. It's definitely not like the cinnamon in \\"Big Red\\" that burns your tongue it's so strong.The gum does lose it's flavor somewhat quickly, but not so fast that it would deter me from buying it.If you like cloves, you should definitely try this gum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clove Gum - The wrapper taste lasts longer - wast of money","review":"The gum was hard (very old) The flavor lasted less than 2 minutes - no exaggeration. This product is a waste of money. Dentyne is far superior not to mention so many long lasting refreshing flavors out there today. Maybe that's why this one is not carried by your local drug store or supermarket - nobody would buy it a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro Gum","review":"I was never a user of this gum back in the day, but recently took up the gum habit once again. In looking for a gum with the least amount of added \\"stuff\\" and phony sweeteners I came across this gum-straight from 100 years ago..Since it\`s only a gum and not a laptop I\`ll keep this simple..The gum is enjoyable. Its clove flavor is subtle and has just the right amount of sugar to make it not too sweet. The gum while being chewed is rather firm as opposed to Bazooka or other bubble gum. The clove flavor slips away after a short time but remains in your mouth. If you don\`t like cloves you might not like this gum but the clove flavor is not overpowering.Looking for a gum without fake sweeteners and a unique flavor, this might be for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gum is old and stale","review":"First I have to say that I love this gum.

The mat comes folded, so there are creases that keep puzzle pieces from lying flat. Also, the felt makes it impossible to slide a piece into position. If there was a way to make the pieces more movable, it would make using this much easier. (I know the mat needs to be a bit \\"sticky,\\" since it's designed for keeping the puzzle intact, but still, when not moving a puzzle from place to place, this makes for a very annoying \\"feature.\\")Until this is repackaged so it's sold rolled (uncreased), I WOULD NOT advise anyone to purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it because it doesn't work.","review":"It did not work--I rolled it up and the puzzle pieces fell all over the place!!!!!!!!!So I lost a lot of my precious time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"DIDN'T CARE FOR THIS PRODUCT - INCLUDED AN INFLATABLE ITEM WITH KEEPS PUZZLEIN TACT AS IT IS WRAPPED UP.

I put it in a drawer! It would be very annoying to do a puzzle on since the pieces dont slide around. Puzzles have dust in them so you could never just dump a puzzle on the mat.

The only thing I regret now, is not making those tubes myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely worthless","review":"I must say that this is truly unbelievable. I cannot believe that anyone would create a puzzle mat that sticks rather than slides. ANYONE who has EVER worked on a puzzle knows that one must slide the pieces at times (quite often, actually).

It is huge, not user friendly having to blow up the interior tube to roll up the puzzle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I agree with other reviewers, folds in the felt never straighten out. The felt make it impossible to adjust the alignment of pieces without them pulling apart. I bought a large piece of foam core instead...it doesn't roll up but I can move it off the table and serve dinner! A similar product made with a smooth plastic or silicone would be better for those who need to roll it up thier puzzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big, puzzle pieces still escaped","review":"whomp whomp, I was looking for something to protect my puzzle, all I got was misc pieces coming out the sides of the felt as the tube slightly deflated over time. It's also really awkward to store because it can't be placed on it's end and it's a pretty wide tube. Seemed like a great solution, but in practice it didn't work out so well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"dislike of product","review":"I dislike it immensely would return but didn't get a return slip. not suitable at all.

I used the Stow & Go for a few hours and then opened it back up to show my husband how great it was. When we opened it up, several of the puzzle pieces' corners were bent upward. I was disappointed and stopped using it right away. I wonder how much damage it would have done to my puzzle if I had kept on using it? I do not recommend the Stow & Go and am still in search of a puzzle mat that will hold a puzzle in progress without damaging it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money...DO NOT BUY!","review":"Trust me when I say this is not worth a dollar, nevermind ten. I wish I had read the review before buying this piece of garbage. It consists of a square piece of felt that will not lie flat (kind of necessary when doing a puzzle), a blow up tube that is sure to pop and 2 ties that a bound to get lost.

This was just a large piece of felt and very bumpy surface. I don't see how anyone could do a puzzle on this surface. I just requested to send this product back because it did not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product, Functional and Sturdy","review":"I am really happy with this product and it does exactly what it is supposed to do. It's basically a large, heavy weight piece of felt that rolls around an inflatable tube and keeps your puzzles in place to work on at your convienence. It is a nice weight of fabric that seems like it would last quite a while and the inflatable tube holds air well. It does have folding creases right out of the box, but that was easily remedied by throwing it in the dryer with a wet hand towel for a short time. When removed from the dryer, the creases were absolutely gone and we proceeded to puzzle away. The only improvement I would make is to add an extra strap for the middle of the rolled puzzle, but other than that it is a product I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk that doesn't work","review":"I was hopeful for at least some kind of usefullness, but this is not of any use at all.

The plastic blow up loses air quickly. The puzzle started falling out of it. Dont waste your money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"This product does what is expected. It rolls up and stores a completed puzzle. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because is it tough to work on the felt base. When building the puzzle, the pieces don't slide around so that you can connect them to other parts of the puzzle. Just a suggestion, but before you start a new puzzle, take out the yellow felt, open it up and iron it flat. It comes in the box folded, and the folds at the creases make it difficult to keep the puzzle flat. I know there really isn't another way to pack it, so ironing it first will save you a headache later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was a disappointing purchase. It just seems like I overpaid for a cheap piece of felt and a couple straps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"This thing does just what it says.

One thing though, I got mine brand new at Walmart for only $9.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, packaging could be better","review":"The Stow & Go should be a God-send for puzzle addicts like my daughter (for whom I bought it) but it turns out that it causes more problems than it solves. The yellow felt mat included arrives with some pretty heavy-duty creases which take FOREVER to settle down. The uneven surface makes for an extra challenge for puzzles with lots of pieces. It would have been much better if the product was sent in a tube, with the mat rolled rather than folded in on itself, that way it would be playable right out of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent atlas to accompany historical study","review":"I found this atlas very helpful as a companion to studying Greek history.

He shows that sunlight and wind protection are more important that temperature--and, by the way, most of the U.S. gets more winter sunlight than Coleman's place. Inexpensive, unheated greenhouses that he calls tall tunnel houses--some say hoop houses--and cold frames protect from wind and keep snow off the veggies.

I showed up with an open mind, and left with the knowledge of how I can build a hoop house for a reasonable price.Yes, this book is a bit of a travel tale, as he does write about his travels to France, but the whole point of that is to introduce you to the many different foods you can grow in cold climates, such as mache.

As a Sailor with many years sailing in Blue Moons' geographic area I was stunned by the crisp realism, accurate depiction of the ocean setting and authenticity of the story. It is evident Dalia Vargas has first hand knowledge of the sea and has spent some years on boats. Blue Moon is a fast paced Adventure/Romance that makes you yearn to meet characters that you know are only fictional! In a twisting convoluted tale of lovers, scoundrels, intrigue and danger the characters weave and bob from protagonist to antagonist and back again until you don't know which one is going to \\"get the girl\\" or which one you want to.

I also have a Samsung 26 inch hdtv, which is great, will hook it up to my computers tv tuner card someday.UPDATE: this TV quit working around Jan 2012. It's had problems for the last couple years.

There is very little footage of real tigers in the wild. Most of the movie is about some Indian villagers who hired a British hunter to kill a tiger that attacked and killed one of their villagers. Even a National Geographic documentary utterly sucks on this DVD. It shows some Indian movie star that lives in New York City and then goes back to her country to see tigers in the wild. They talk about poaching and loss of natural tiger habitat, but there is very little footage of tigers in this documentary.

I'm actually putting tablespoons of it in the sixteen-ounce salsa jars now. Two years ago, I'd have run outside and eaten grass to put out the fire. Now? I've gotten my tolerance up. It's time to go a little further.Mega Death is that next gradation of heat, spice, and taste. Really tasty, the single-most important criterion when picking a sauce. It adds distinct flavor and, when properly used, gives you the blend of heat and spice that turns you into an addict. You could literally overindulge with a good sauce, so be careful.I have to revert to my one- or three-drop amounts, and that's not only economical but good sense when dealing with Blair's sauces. If not graduallly tested, you could end up eating grass instead of salsa, and that's not a good way to get fiber.Fred"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a heat additive than a proper sauce.","review":"I tried this on pulled pork and on a chicken sandwich, and I found that I dislike it for the same reasons I dislike the original Dave's Insanity Sauce: it's a heat additive with no attempt to make it taste good. What little there may have been to taste got washed down with the first gulp of milk, leaving only the bitterness, pain, and desire to have nothing more to do with this sauce. Lower-tier sauces in the Death series--like Pure Death and After Death--have great flavors and are worthy as condiment sauces, so I was disappointed by this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really amazing stuff...","review":"I greatly respect this album.

Throughout the book, written as a novel as opposed to in free verse, there is a forced sense of grandeur from the author. Conversations between characters seem more like monologues than any actual dialog. Two chapters, or books, that immediately come to mind are when Zeus and Poseidon are talking followed by the almost laughable conversation between the main hero and a swineherd. Rouse uses a more rustic dialect for the swineherd yet maintaining the long drawn out mini-speech approach used previously in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to its reputation","review":"I read this epic in English my freshman year of high school.

The children had a meeting with Smokey to try to get him to stop selling tobacco to small kids and adults, but the meeting didn't work. finally the children and the papa decided to get the police involved.I think this book was very good. It tells children that they should not smoke. Sometimes things look cool because the person selling them looks cool, but it can kill you.

The way is revealed with a skillful blending of imaginative narrative, words from the Bible, and dialogue, that bring Biblical scenes to life. The reader feels that this is a picture of the real Paul, with all his strengths and frailties, often tragic, frequently heroic. It tells not only the story of Paul, but also of the early church the early apostles were struggling to establish. We see Paul through the eyes of his various friends and companions, most of whose names we know, and their characters also come through in their actions, manners of speaking, and styles of writing. The author has even included Seneca as one voice in this group, not as an associate of Paul, but as a writer and personage of the age, with a knowledge of Rome and its culture contemporary with Paul."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome book about Paul","review":"Wow - when I finished reading this book, I felt like I had been right there with the Apostle Paul through all of his missionary journeys, trials, and triumphs! I felt like Paul was my close and personal friend! The author takes the basic historical facts and truths about Paul and weaves a story around it.

If you can make it through the first hundred pages, this book is a gem.Among the many characters providing a multi-layered view of Paul's struggle to spread the Christian message to the world are Seneca, reflecting the history and politics of the timeand Priscilla, showing the vital role of women in the early Christian church.Paul becomes a lovable, invigorating and genuine \\"person\\" to thereader as he teaches love, forgiveness and grace. The message: Early Christians survived much conflict as the new church grew and developed, showing us that minor conflict today is surmountable!

It really opened my eyes to what really went on in the life of Paul. It was very easy to read. Over all it was just an awesome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Adventure","review":"This book lacks nothing. Without giving a history lesson, Mr. Wangein has given us a looking glass into life 2000 years ago, and in particular, the life of Saul of Taurus a Pharisee, prosecuting the new Christians and becoming the Apostle Paul a Christian champion. Beginning with his conversion, Paul's life was filled with enormous challenges, and even greater successes. Opposition from Rome, Jews and even Believers, Paul feared none and conquered most."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging portrait of what might have been","review":"Take the book of Acts and then try to fill in all the details by painting a written portrait of what things might have been like. That is basically what Walter Wangerin does in this engaging novel. Staying true to Biblical sources, Mr. Wangerin shows us Paul in a way that many people may have never seen him before. The Paul we see here is one who is often disliked by his fellow believers, but always respected. We see Paul as a man of such strong convictions that people can't help but have strong reactions to him, either positive or negative. The only complaint I had about the book was that it slowed down in places. Otherwise, this is a very well-written fictional account of someone who we know about only in Scripture. This novel does a neat job of taking you back to those times when God was moving in his people and letting you play with the idea of \\"I wonder what it might have been like to be there.\\" It is well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Novel!","review":"This is a great novel that enables the reader to better imagine the people in Paul's life and ministry.

Get it for yourself or as a gift for a friend or family member."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Having just finished the book, I was very disappointed in the novel. I was expecting much more. Mr. Wangerin portrays Paul/Saul of Tarsus as a tiny little man, with bandy legs and a head too large for his body, who ran about like a mad mad. this completely ruined the story for me. I realize it was fictional, but at the same time, I can't imagine the man, the roman, the Jew, the Pharisee, the one man who exerted such a wide influence on the worlds affairs, and Christian affairs, to be as he is described here in this horrid tale. Chritianity needed such a man as Saul, and the world needed such a mind. I do believe that he preached Christ crucified with a passion, and he did stir up the people. But not as the character described in this book.If you have held the Apostle Paul, in your heart, as the great preacher of the Gospel that he was.

It doesn't take much rough play (removal from the rims & such) before one of the tires is ripped & no longer wheel-shaped.Would I recommend these? Only if you don't want to spend money on the bigger Automoblox, or if you've got less destructive children.

Light weight and strong, easy to use. Good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"Purchased this cooling stand, and it worked for a few weeks. Price was right and it was called \\"portable\\". I travel for my job, and figured it would be good to put in my suitcase. This Kensington cooling stand never even made it on an airplane...it broke in my house after only a few weeks of use. The stand opens on plastic hinges to allow for the incline and space under your PC. These hinges broke with just regular use of my computer on the cooling stand. I've been trying to use it broken for the past few months, but it's driven me nuts. Planning on spending a few dollars more for the kind that don't have hinges. Would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low tech and lovely","review":"This fits easily into my carry bag and is incredible easy to set up and use. It is molded well without any scratching edges and seems to be quite durable. I only use a MacBook Pro 15\\" and find I use it at home all the time. My order arrived in a timely fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"an expensive piece of plastic","review":"An expensive piece of plastic. It took 20 minutes to cut open the tight wrap. The tilt is too low to elevate the notebook screen to eye-level for comfortable viewing. The notebook can easily slip over the plastic because there is no catch at the bottom. The opening is too small for good airflow. It would be better to pay a little more money on something well-designed and with a fan. Try the Targus products, for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product, But Not Worth $20","review":"I like the product and it does what it claims to do; but if you can find something similar for about $10 or less go for it. It's just two pieces of plastic on a hinge with, for lack of a better word, a little kick stand to give you two different heights. The price is the only reason that it did not get 5 stars. Then again maybe I'm just cheap. Lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plastic with a hole","review":"I failed to read the description thoroughly and didn't notice that this is really just 2 pieces of plastic joined with a hinge. There is a hole in the top plastic piece which opens when you separate the two pieces of plastic and elevate the laptop with a little wire brace. The hole may or may not match up with the fan on your laptop - it didn't match mine. If you don't elevate the laptop,there is no hole for heat to escape. NOTE! There is NO fan - just a plastic stand with a hole in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does What It Says","review":"I purchased this to help a problem I was having in my neck and shoulders because my head was tipping to see the notebook's screen. It's working just as expected and I am having some relief in my neck/shoulder area. The gripping material on the top which prevents the computer from slipping holds well. The only drawback is the limited number of choices in adjusting the tilt of the stand.It does just as it says!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very sturdy","review":"Did not seem to support a 15 inch laptop very well. The plastic that it is made out of seemed to flex too much while in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practical for 17 inch laptops","review":"Useless for large screen laptops.

Not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate Product","review":"Absolutely not worth the money! There is no ledge to hold your laptop in place and the lift was not at a proper height to do any good. Since return postage probably would have been close to $6.00, I didn't bother to return it. It was also sent in a box that was probably 4 times bigger than necessary. The one to buy is called a PortaBook on \\"As Seen On TV.\\" I have had one for over a year and a half and it works quite nicely. I was glad to finally be able to find another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I had a heck of a time choosing which stand to get. I chose this one mostly because Amazon offered a bundle deal with a cooling unit. I think that for 20 dollars it could be a bit wider to fit along with the wider screen laptops everyone is getting now. Other than that I think it is sturdy enough for most peoples needs and thin enough not to stress your laptop case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen better","review":"Basic tilt stand with hole cut in to let computer breath better. Hole doesnt line up with all my heat escape holes. Dropped it on carpet and a hinge broke...brittle plastic. I think this works but is worth less than $10, not $20 as charged.I also have a Belkin u shaped stand with no hinges and a fan and all exhaust holes breath...better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This is flimsy and the one I ordered was missing the metal part that keeps it open!

One, its to narrow the laptop slides off and you have to keep your legs close together or else it falls between them. Two It still gets hot! Three the anti skid rubber only goes around the center hole, not enough to prevent the laptop from sliding off. Four , the hinges on the bottom stick into your legs.Five its to expensive this product should sell for $1.99 at walmart its total JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend a little more","review":"I bought this to help elevate and cool my laptop.

I of course brought this product based on the 5 and 4 star reviews. I can not believe that people actually gave this piece of junk such a high rating. I wish I could give this thing a 0 rating. Needless to say, I'm going to have to spend money to sent this crap back. In no way shape or form is this a cooling stand. Instead, it is a flimsy lift stand. My computer still runs hot. This stand is misnamed and misleading. This stand is for a toy laptop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a cooling stand","review":"After reading reviews that people were able to use this stand while sitting on their laps and that's exactly what I wanted. Yet, the first day I had it and used it on my lap, it shut off within a few hours. In the next couple of weeks of having the cooling stand, it hasn't worked. My computer is constantly over heating, no matter if the computer is on my lap or on the table. It just doesn't work on keeping the air circulation going on my computer, so my computer is constantly overheating and shutting off. The Targus chillpad worked much better, it's just to bad that the usb cable for it no longer works."},{"rating":"2","title":"portable cooling stand","review":"I got to keep the laptop from getting too hot but it is a little clumsy but it does what it was designed to do.

But the construction is very flimsy and it broke 2 months after purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting out of packaging not worth it!","review":"The plastic packaging Kensington uses is not worth the trouble to me. I have never cursed so much in my life trying to get the stand out. Not only is the packaging kid proof, it is also adult proof. I was ready to send it back before I could get the stand out to even try it.

This is made poorly and is very flimsy. However, it is light weight, portable, and functional. For the price, it wasn't worth the hastle of returning it. I am using it broken and it still functions."},{"rating":"2","title":"reasonable price, does the job","review":"I was having trouble with an overheating laptop and this solved the problem instantly. I have a small 13\\" however, and it slides forward sometimes. The rubbery rim around the hole loosened and slipped a bit because of this, but I simply pulled it up and stuck it back in place. Not exactly something you expect from a quality product, but it only cost me $15 and suits my needs perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is worthless!","review":"This item is essentially worthless! The laptop wobbles endlessly unless it is so far forward off the front of the stand that it almost hangs off the front of the desk - 2/3's of the stand just takes up space behind. If you put the laptop solidly on the stand, the front of the laptop is elevated close to an inch above the desk surface. If you accomodate by raising your chair so that you aren't reaching up to type, then your feet will dangle off the floor.

I set my laptop on it and all it did was wobble on the stand, because the stand was so small.

Just terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works","review":"Got this to go under a Asus Transformer because the table is a bit low for the chair my wife uses. While she was reading she'd almost always take the tablet and put in her lap so she could read.

I would highly recommend it to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Everything As Advertised But...","review":"Watch out for the packaging. Opening it up is an exercise in frustration so if you abhor blister packaging you might want to think twice about this. As far as the actual product, it is a great deal. It adjusts to three heights (I believe the product description picture shows it at the highest setting) and is collapsible so you can take it with you in a bag or backpack. It's affordable, especially considering other companies charge $30-40 for a similar product.As far as the cons, it's not very attractive (it looks like a cheap plastic cutting board) and if you use a larger laptop make a note that the width of this thing is only about nine and a half inches so it might be wobbly for wider laptops (I use a 13\\" macbook pro and it's pretty stable). All in all this is a good product at an affordable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This product doesn't work and messed up my battery. Avoid it like the lague.

People in \\"the know\\" order a $30 for $2500 knowing full well it isn't a book they are receiving but something worth much more only thinly disguised as a book with a normally narrow audience. Is something illicit going on here? Or are the sellers merely grossly misinformed? Or merely having high hopes?

It's nice to look at and a supplemental to any Constantine fan's library. But that's it. The first story, 'Such a Nice Girl,' is interesting to a point with a few intriguing devices, but never realizes its great potential. 'Last Come Assimilation' also has potential for an interesting science fiction story, but is clumsily handled. 'How Enlightenment Came to the Tower' is downright silly.

The color reproductions could have been better on some pages, but it really doesn't hurt the overall message. Sometimes I like a book that I can pick up, flip through, and learn something without much investment of time -- this books can work like that. But it is also a great book to read cover to cover because of the author's ability to keep you interested in the creation of pastel art. This book should be read by anyone who plans to use pastels.

I would highly recommend any of Barbara Robinson's book and especially \\"The Best Christmas Pageant Ever\\" and \\"The Best School Year Ever\\" as well.

It really keeps my baby and stroller dry in the rain. Attaching it is very easy since it basically fits right over the top and you just need to pull it down over the stroller. There are a few snaps on the sides so that you can open the flaps that cover mesh air vents, which is a nice feature in hot weather. It can be slightly bulky to store when not in use, unlike before you open it from the package, since it never folds that flat again. I usually just cram it into the bottom of the stroller basket and eventually it gets flatened out by all the stuff I pile on top of it. It also is a good thing to have if you're going to be out in cold weather, since it helps to shield the baby from the wind. I highly recommend this to anyone who plans on using their stroller outside a lot. It really works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I had this on my baby list as it claims it fits over most strollers.

There are no straps or snaps or anything to keep it over the stroller and it kept blowing off like an inflatable balloon! I spent more time chasing it across the parking lot than anything else.

Since we live in NYC, it is an absolute essential! We had a Prince Lionheart Rain Shield but left it behind on a trip.The quality of this shield is excellent; durable, heavy plastic, nice side vents, etc.The major flaw is that it does not hang down far enough in the front, and when we were out with it last, my 17 month old's feet were drenched because the shield left them exposed. He is of average height but since he will obviously grow before he is totally out of the stroller, this shield is useless to us. (I will save it for any future babies, when we are using the carseat/stroller combo).I am really disappointed and will have to buy another shield."},{"rating":"1","title":"seeing pattern","review":"you need to set up the \\"ISBN\\" boxs so the customer can input the isbn # so they won't mistaken with other similar books.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Exactly what I needed for my English Writing class.

If she has misread others and their conduct, THEY have to convince her otherwise?! Dream on... Too much doesn't add up in this book. I respect the author's individuality and right to live a high drama life, but there is no way I'm donating this book to the church library and thereby condoning poor choices and excuses made - and worse, cloaking them in scriptures to further excuse bad behavior.

Do they really think that babies can't learn more than that? Good grief! They are just getting started there! This DVD is very entertaining. Indeed,it is mostly entertainment as the numbers one through five will be mastered in very short order there by making it pure entertainment. Save your money and buy Richard Scary's Best Counting Video Ever. It is just as entertaining (if not more so) and goes to number 20, with lots of cute dialogue that babies love. Similarly, check out Leap Frog Letter Factory (for letters) and Trebellina (for music). You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner!","review":"My 15 month old is a tough critic of baby videos. He'll only watch the Baby Einstein collection.

It uses real life objects to show numbers and is captivating for both adults and children alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"It is clear the producers are not experts in common sense. Why in the world would they use dounuts, cookies and cupcakes as examples in teaching counting? It's hard enough to keep kids away from this junk without glorifying it and showing a kid under two eating a cupcake on screen. That is just stupid.

The first time he watched it, and he loves it !! He laughed and giggled, and was rocking with the music. He normally does not like to watch TV, but he watched this from the beginning to the end without any breaks. I got other Baby Einstein DVDs because he loves this so much. However, the other ones were just so so for him. I highly recommend to try this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring","review":"First introduced to baby when he was 11 mos old. He didn't like this one bit so I assumed perhaps he was too young to appreciate Baby Einstein videos. Re-introduced at 15 mos, and then 18 mos. Same reaction from him, he would sigh, fuss a whole lot, and when older would walk out of the room the moment he discovers it's the numbers video. But he would gladly sit through and interact with other Baby Einstein titles like World Animal Adventure and Baby Wordsworth.The pace of this video is very slow though it may appeal to very young babies watching a DVD for the first time. I feel that it doesn't capture attention the way the other Baby Einstein videos do. Numbers 1 through 4 seem like a drag while suddenly number 5 picks up pace as if time was short and the video had to end. My 20 month old now knows his numbers 1-10 and learned the sequence through books and live demonstrations, sadly not from this video.

Perhaps expecting people to be absolutely politically correct when wartime emotions run high and different cultures and military operations collide is a bit absurd. Keeping an open mind always helps. For all hardcore Disney fans, this set will introduce you to yet another facet of Disney animation which until now has been locked away in the vaults.By the way, Amazon reviewer John D.

The Paris Opera production is intelligently directed, well-sung and acted, nicely conducted by Kurt Nagano, and has a drop-dead gorgeous physical production that looks wonderful, glittering and detailed, in this beautiful transfer. Anyone comfortable with Strauss or Korngold won't find this music difficult going -- much of it is ravishing -- and the psychology of the libretto's still intriguing.

The butterfly 'wings' that you use to hook the ponies to the ferris wheel are constantly falling off also.It's very frustrating for my daughter, she loves it when it stays in one piece.

Don't waste your money on this piece of crap!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy","review":"My 3 year old daughter loves My Little Pony's . . . so when I saw this toy I thought she would like it and I guess she might if it didn't fall part all the time. She isn't even hard on toys. The pink \\"track\\" like part comes in three pieces and they don't stay together. The purple wheel that the horses are supposed to fly on starts to come off after a couple spins and because of the weight of the horses pulling it foward, it causes those three pink pieces to fall apart even more. If everything actually stayed together so that it was a usuable toy my only comment would be that it is quite cumbersom for having such a limited entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made*********************************","review":"My daughter collects my little pony and she had to have this.

I will carefully consider future My Little Pony purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...what junk","review":"I am very disappointed with this toy. My daughters love My Little Ponies and this is the first playset we purchased and if all the other ones are as bad as this one, I am sorry to say this will be the last. Although my daughters do love to play with it, it has become very tiresome for me, putting it back together all the time. I don't care what any reviewer says, no matter how you try to get the pieces to \\"click\\" together, they don't and as soon as you move it, or bump it, or blow on it the track falls apart. We haven't had any trouble with the ferris wheel leaning, YET, but I am sure it is in our future. I do think I agree with the one review and I am going to try super glue, maybe that will keep it together so my daughters could actually play with it for more than 5 minutes before it breaks. I really would not recommend anyone buying this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So cute to look at but DON'T TOUCH!!!!!","review":"This toy is very flimsy. My daughter just turned six and got it for her birthday, she really wants to play with it but I am continuously putting it back together. The rollercoaster comes apart, the ferris wheel leans forward if you actually put ponies on it and eventually comes apart...over and over and over. We love the my little pony play sets and up until now have never found one that was so C-H-E-A-P but that is what this one is. If you buy it be prepared to repair again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK!!!","review":"What a PIECE OF JUNK!!! My daughter received this toy for her birthday and couldn't even play with it because it continually kept falling apart. The ponies would fall off the ferris wheel and the roller coaster kept breaking any time she would even touch the toy.

With the new bulb, I was able to get it to suction onto the bulb but once I put the bulb into the socket, the suction would be lost, then it became very difficult to do anything other than let the bulb fall.

The imtermediate lessons (actually looks like beginner) is of HIGH value. It covered the triple step and how to make it look correct. Although, where I study the rock step is at the beginning and not the end, but it is actually minor because after first basic, they did the rock step first anyways. It also helped me with the spots where you initiate the turns, which has been a personal challenge for me who started with single step swing.The basics of left and right turns were gold as well. The hand positions presented make more sense then the way I am being taught in class.The advanced level stuff I wouldnt use, its more like country style than I cared for. However the beginning sections were well worth the money spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum..","review":"On a positive note Sharon Green's characters are very well devloped. Unfortunatly she also has a tendency for using cliches and I don't for a minute believe that people in that era would speak the way most of her characters would. Each member of the blending seems a little too perfect for my tastes and there was far too much time spent whining about how bad the situation was. Naran's lack of talents seemed to be a little bit disappointing as well as the fact that she is now one of the 6. I'm sorry but there is a reason why this story is under the \\"fiction\\" section and that is because the characters are not realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing the saga...","review":"You really need to read the first 5 books to follow everything (but believe me, once you get started, you'll devour them so fast you won't believe it!). This book introduces a LOT of new, minor characters (and a few new major ones) that help show the changes that the empire of Gandistra is experiencing, while also following our Seating Blending on their mission into Gracely, where all sorts of political struggles are going on. You need a chart to keep up with all the characters, but having read everything Sharon Green has written, I promise you won't be disappointed for your efforts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intriguing Beginning","review":"The new series starts off with another slow-paced but interesting beginning as we are introduced to new enemies and allies and witness the changes being wrought by the new order. Not all of these new characters develop quite the way you might first expect. Yet as we begin to explore the world outside of Gan Garee, I can't help but to think that a map of some kind might be useful. The action in the next book, Deceptions, should pick up now that all the players have moved into position, especially with the surprise thrown in for the cliffhanger. The one thing with which I was disappointed was the development of Naran's prescient talent - or rather the lack of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too sweet!!!","review":"This is about twice as sweet as I can handle.

Sadly, that is not the case. I gave this game today to my seven year old son and he quickly became frustrated with the dodgy controls, time limit, and overall poor game play. Perhaps ten years age this would have been seen as a cutting edge game. However, this game has the appearance of a project thrown together over a weekend by a group of not overly skilled junior programmers. P.S. Dear Big Idea, in order to get people to learn from your game as they play, you need to make a game that people will, in fact, want to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My son (who is 5) loves everything Veggietale. Buying him anything Veggie related and he's going to be happy. He also really loves to play video games; this seemed like the perfect fit. He played this game for about 20 minutes and turned it off.

Don't be dismaid, your not missing key information by using this 2nd year stuff (you get all of the math too at an easier to comprehend level).The disk included with mine helps to build your financial knowledge through a website connection and with practice, but this is not mandatory and is designed for the hardcore finance junkies like myself.It is only a 4-star because I want more challenging material, but being a 2nd year course I have to wait until 3rd year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Financial Management","review":"I ordered and paid for this book on 7/24/2009 and have still not received it!

You will never find me listening to crap like this...if you want REAL MUSIC, with bands that can REALLY play guitar and can write some awesome lyrics, I recommend: Metallica, Guns N Roses, Led Zeppelin, Iron Maiden, Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage, and Slayer.If you are one of the preppy-teenage-drake-loving-morons, vote NOT HELPFUL!If you agree with me and you agree Metallica and Guns N Roses kick Drake's a$$, vote HELPFUL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly surprised","review":"I'm currently addicted to the song, \\"I Know.\\" I'm a bit too old for Drake and Josh and yet I turn to it sometimes.

Drake Bell's musical influences shine through in this freshman effort. Though he is a Nickelodeon actor, this cd doesn't show it. The lyrics are meaningful, thought provoking, and artistic. After the poppy \\"I Found a Way\\", the cd takes a whole new direction. These songs are storytelling reminiscent of Bob Dylan and the Beatles. The influences of Rufus Wainwright and Ben Folds also shine through. Drake Bell proves himself as an artist with definite maturity beyond his years. My favorite selections include: Telegraph, In the End, and Down We Fall. These songs represent feelings of inner emotion that successful artists allow their fans to experience along with the artist. I've been a fan of Drake's for three years and I am glad to see that he is maturing into the fabulous singer, songwriter, guitarist, and pianist that he deserves to be. Talent like his doesn't come along everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drake Bell is more than an actor and a pretty face!","review":"I was blown away by this album! For a debut album, it is awesome!

Especially with lines like \\"another day, gone without a say....\\"The album has a sound reminiscient of late 90's Christian bands like Reliant K, the W's, and the staying power of Switchfoot.Bell's lyrics are more thoughtful than many \\"big\\" artists of the day and he derserves credit for actually possesing the talent and the voice to carry off his lyrics.This is a very good debut, and I look forward to Bell growing out of his teen-pop days and into his bright musical future."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"Therion Magnetic Shoulder Wrap - Therion Magnetic Shoulder Wrap - AC523A respected pharmacist stated that such magnetic devices do no good.

One feels the blows of the sword, the clashing of arms, and the pangs of war, while reading this timeless epic. The bold harangues of Greek and Trojan warriors and the artful intrigues of the gods, still resound within the imagination of the reader nearly twenty-eight hundred years after its composition. The Illiad is a definite recommendation for anyone; but for those not especially fond of the war-like, masculine tone, which underlies this work, then the Odyssey will be a much more rewarding read.

The plot of the story takes place in the late 20's and early 30's; still, it applies to today's world as well, especially to the issue of Hispanics and the United States.

TV shows that lasted one or two seasons and got canceled because they stunk (like Fox releasing Pamela Sue Anderson's dreadful and rightly short-lived sitcom \\"Stacked\\". The \\"Complete Series\\", all 18 episodes on DVD) and yet you can only get Season One of Drew Carey. This unreliable release pattern of older TV shows on DVD by the studios is very disrespectful to the fans of these shows, not to mention, the creative geniuses behind those shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"left out disc #2","review":"this was to come with 4 discs, #2 was left out and replaced with a another Drew Carey dvd which I also ordered seperately.

The book is not really a new release, nor is it a mystery. It was initially released in 1988 but the first American release was in 2007. This review is like a euology for a person dead twenty years.The novel is a spy thriller that takes place in the UK in the era of IRA bombings and prior to cell phones and ubiquitous video surveillance. The central character is Miles Flint, a refreshingly unassuming and anti-glamorous domestic spy. Flint stumbles into a scandal within his agency that takes him from London to Ireland and Scotland. It is easy reading but plods along for the first two thirds. The prose is simplistic with few memorable quotes. The plot becomes a little bit convoluted as is common in this genre, but the denouement is implausible and has holes.This book is OK for a quick read if you don't have anything else at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad start & trite ending","review":"The first 173 pages went slowly, and ponderously toward the must be expected ending. The last 82 progressed more rapidly to the trite and expected ending. The only surprise was naming the CIA one of the good guys. Don't bother"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable selection of mysteries","review":"The stories in this anthology are consistently good, which is a relief. There are not centuries but millenia of possible settings and the editor has done a good job of selecting a spread of times and places as well as authors. The historical settings are not annoying or invasive to the reader except in one story, the weakest in the book IMO. I'm glad I bought the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holocaust brilliance.....","review":"This book is undoubtably one of the best written books on the Holocaust and stands together with such masterpieces as Olga Lengyel's 'Five Chimneys' and Alicia Appleman-Jurman's 'Alicia, my story'. Vrba writes in a plain, informative, no holds barred fashion and describes in intense detail his escape from Slovakia to Hungary, the time at Novacky Camp in Slovakia and ultimately the time he spent in Auschwitz. His escape from Auschwitz together with Fred Wetzler is nothing short of a miracle. This book seems to have been forgotten and does not appear on the shelves in bookshops these days and it really should as one of the best testimonies from the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as expected","review":"Nice as other olay product, it comes in perfect package.

As other reviewers have stated though, the bulb has only lasted up to one year and they are expensive. The first one was almost $400 installed.

We thought this TV would be a less expensive second unit when we bought it at the same time as our LCD flat screen. This Toshiba has now cost a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE!","review":"I have had this TV for a year now and it has a great picture and sound. This, however, does not make up for the the fact that Toshiba will not honor their warranty. My HDMI input went out at 9 months and the part is no longer available. Toshiba informed me that I had 3 options. 1) Leave the TV the way it is. 2) Buy my own part and fix it ( the part is still out there, but since it is not available at a Toshiba authorized company, they will not pay for it. 3) they will give me $500 for it. This is the second product that Toshiba has tried to screw me on."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET AN EXTENDED WARRANTY or pay the price.","review":"I wish I knew before I bought this TV for my dad. I think I paid $799 for it just 15 months ago and the lamp has to be replaced. Until this point I was happy with Toshiba products(I have a 42\\" LCD and two HD-DVD players) but now...How can you justify a TV that costs $1000 retail having to have a $200 part every year? Of course the warranty expired 3 months ago. An extended warranty may have covered the new bulb but you have to make sure, for $50 bucks or so the 2 year warranty would cover 2 bulbs at this rate and save about $400."},{"rating":"1","title":"DLP Lamp Review","review":"I have a Toshiba 42HM66 Model # TV. We like the picture quality of the television but the sound is lacking - can't increase the way you want.

These lamps are advertised usage over 3000 hours - that's so false!!!

Too many inescapable apologies","review":"I have most all the Disney Treasures DVDs. Watching these over and over, I get tired of the Leonard Maltin apologies for the content. First, the content doesn't offend me. I guess that must mean I need to know why it should. The Maltin intros tell me every single time I see each offending short. I hope those in charge will consider putting one disclaimer at the beginning of the entire set, which can be bypassed with the ff button in the future.

I found entire areas that were merely \\"pasted\\" into the book and others (e.g. Chapter 7 & 8 on VLANs) where the material was simply repeated from the previous chapter word-for-word.No effort was made by this author to edit or explain the Cisco concepts. I always thought a book like this would contain explanatory material - but alas it was not to be!Since I have yet to take the test, I can't comment on the substance of the material -- but only on the fact that I could have obtained the same material -- verbatim -- from Cisco's site.

Nothing about Brown's novel is really elucidated, just more 'details' are given to pad the fiction. I enjoyed Brown's novel, knowing full well that the so-called facts behind the drama were mostly not facts.Some of the trivia in both books are indeed historical fact, but the connections between the facts -- the conspiracy parts -- is completely flimsy.I agree 100% with another Amazon reader who asked where are the citations? Where are the primary sources? This is not history at all, just more mumbo jumbo. I can dig mumbo jumbo in fiction, hey I'm a big Star Trek fan.

Sadly, Lunn missed the mark. Here's why.What other books has Martin Lunn writtern?-none. And it shows. The guy clearly knows a lot about history, but when it comes to getting his point across, his rookie status as a writer really shows. Also, Lunn doesn't seem able to grasp what the average reader (a.k.a. Dan Brown fan) really wants to know. More than anything else, I felt like I was reading a tour guide to Europe when I read this book, instead of reading a real thoughtful response to Brown's bestseller. This may be because Lunn lives in Barcelona.The book's PR description says Lunn's volume \\"provides an exhaustive tour of the locations visited by the novel's characters.\\" Very true-I was exhausted by reading the book. I would rather have closed the last page enlightened with a few really interesting facts on which to hang my thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Read the Da Vinci Code","review":"What a joke! This book was obviously rushed into print to capitalize on the Dan Brown phenomenon, but it is nothing more than a recap of the research presented by Brown - much of which is questionable.Martin Lunn claims to be an historian, but he falls into the same traps as many of the \\"historians\\" on which Dan Brown relied for his own research, making wild leaps of logic and mortaring historical gaps with assumption and preconception.For Brown, this was fine; he was writing fiction. But Lunn claims to be telling the \\"truth\\" - a truth no one can possibly know after two millenia of obfuscation. So what Lunn ACTUALLY does is recount Dan Brown's research without all of that confusing \\"plot\\" and none of those annoying \\"characters\\".

I bought 2 books: the conservative debunker \\"The DVC: Fact or Fiction?\\" by Hanegraaff and Maier and this book. I read the Hanegraaff book first and thought it was rather unreliable because it's main argument seemed to be, \\"Because the Bible says so.\\" Then I read \\"DVC Decoded\\" and was amazed at how inept and ridiculous Lunn is. His willingness to go along with any theory, no matter how preposterous, made me yell out \\"Come on!\\" more than a few times. Unsatisfied with either book, I got Burstein's \\"Secrets of the Code\\" and can not recommend it enough.

He trots out all of the usual 80s 'Holy Blood' retreads and expects us to be impressed. Big deal. As well, I purchased all of the Disinfo series on the media ($200+) and was sorely disappointed. There was only one decent article in the set from Russ Kick on 9-11. Other than that, nadda. And there is likewise absolutely nothing new to be gleaned from Lunn's stenography here.For the keen student of the occult, I would be much more inclined to recommend Fritz Springmeier's awesome magnum opus 'Blood Lines of the Illuminati.' His book is the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Formula but no Proofs!","review":"I have read Martin Lunn's book, and will say that it is rich in content. It could be a great guidebook for those that wish to know more about what Brown's many plots were about, but lacks any real hard scholarship. He fails to provided his reader with any direct references to Primary, or reputable secondary documentation. While he claims a Masters degree in History, He would get low marks in any freshmen history class, let alone a graduate program. I am not referring to the contents interesting points, nor the informative entertainment. This books failing is in it's lack of proofs provided by Martin to establish a foundation to base his many assumptions. There is no bibliography, nor footnotes to speak of, and the references section provides only secondary sources of questionable scholarship as well.

The other reviews state that it is cheaply made but I have had no problem with it with proper care. If you place it in the rocks than it probably wont last long but mine has lasted for two summers in the sandy part of my lawn. It is a little difficult to drain on its own due to the plug constantly closing and the weight of the pool constricting the opening. If you place a pool toy under the drain hole between the pool and the ground it will drain much faster. I have let it sit unkept for awhile and it filled with green goo but it cleaned up with a waterhose and a quick sweep with a broom. This year we put chlorine and shock in it and we haven't had to change the water yet.

My son's blow up saucer fit in it and his feet didn't touch the bottom so he was able to kick. The only downfall is that it take about 24 hours to drain.

So, younger children may not easily follow the story line without the reader stopping to explain that, \\"And the sun went down. And the moon came up. And - Tippy tippy tippy pat, Dive-paddle, Splash! Splash! Splash! Dig-scrabble, Scratch! Scratch! Scratch! spring-hurdle Dash! Dash! Dash! Muncha Muncha Muncha!\\" means that the rabbits tip-toed to the garden, jumped into a moat, swam across it, climbed over a wall, jumped over a fence and ate the vegetables. The illustrations are cute but again, (for younger listeners) don't lead the children through the story very well. It's an empty story with not much other than pesky rabbits and a weekend gardener who attempts to find new ways to keep the rabbits from eating his vegetables."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"It won't play in our part of the world.

It shows a sensitive but also very calm, shy and yet self-confident soul. A human being who is not exclusively comfortable with being a celebrity. A New Orleans jazz enthusiast from New York who misses Europe when he's at home, and vice versa.Meet the man, meet Woody Allen, watch Wild Man Blues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If its Tuesday than this must be tedium..","review":"If we did not know previous to this; this movie/documentry affirms that Woody Allen is a tedious, boorish, selfish man. To add insult to injury we must suffer his attempts to cross over to music. At one point Allen or a band mate proclaims \\" ..they don't even play Dixieland in New Orleans any more..\\" Yes, and they don't build temples in Greece anymore either. What is the point? Anyone foolish enough to order two full tortilla de patatas for breakfast (one serves four persons and is seldom eaten at breakfast, Spainards eat their eggs at night) really should just stay in New York and order Dim Sum at four in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"My introduction to Woody Allen.","review":"I'm not a Woody Allen guy. I've only seen one of his movies, and although I enjoyed it, I wasn't hooked. Then came Wild Man Blues, a documentary about Woody's private side on a blues tour throughout Europe. Allen, who is a superb clarinet player, charms us with his fast-firing wit and keeps us rocking as he and his New Orleans Jazz band tickle our musical funny bones in one European country after another.A very funny film that shows just how Allen is truly a comedic genius, be it in his films or in reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilde Man Blues","review":"Woody Allen's blues are clear in this film. I think it's called depression is some parts. The jazz is good like a memory of jazz from a time we imagine. There is a scene when lights go out. I think it is in Venice. After some time, a single light keeps the show going. I liked that and will never forget it. Woody loves his own innocence. He is uncomplicated in this film. But you see that he is attracted to complexity. His mother was great in the film, a real natural. But I can see why he left her house and wanted the Dream. Here's looking at you kid!

Henry James would be proud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed in the pseudepigrapha","review":"I personally have found the book to be way over my head as the explanations and footnotes are all in Latin, egyptian, hebrew or other of the old languages that I have no experience in.

My first impression was, \\"This is a fascinating story written in a style combining Danielle Steele and Mary Higgins Clark, romance and mystery.\\" Then I reread the book a couple of weeks later and began to use a yellow marker to emphasize the creative symbolism. As I looked at the marks, I realized how the story was helping me to continue healing in my own personal life with my own personal past, addressing some of my own shadows and dreams. As the story developed, I realized that the two cultures of New York and Georgia were interesting, but the story as a whole was transcending any culture. I can hardly wait for the next book in the series. This book proves it is possible to write a moving book without all the sordid details of today's literature.

I think this game eclipes each of these mentioned in everyway except network play. The solo game storyline is gripping and fun. The voice acting is top-of-the line. The score and soundtrack is one of the best in gaming to date.

No one believes Joey when he tells them his stepmother is trying to kill him.

Mr. Cawthorne just highlighted the worst, made ancient aboriginal rituals look like \\"ridiculous\\" practices and portraited the characters look as if they were broght from hell.

It begins when he inherits the throne in 1908 at the age of three and continues to 1967 when the Maoists begin to rule. These 60 years witness a remarkable period of change: in 1912, China becomes a republic and the emperor merely a figurehead; in 1924, the Dynasty collapses and the emperor flees to Singapore and a roaring-twenties lifestyle; in WW II, there are more hardships as Japan ravishes the country and the emperor is a prisoner; then the Commies take over and the emperor is \\"remolded\\" into a citizen.

Even if you find it in a bargain bin for 99 cents, leave it alone. Unless you need a new coaster or something.Instead buy the new Criterion 4 disc remastered version.

The emperor is living better than a God in his palace city while the Chinese people are living worse than his mouse. Trust me, the emperor's dog, if he had one, was probably living better than the Chinese people. The only thing I saw this man really \\"doing\\" during the entire film was play tennis. Other than that, he just sits or stands there expressionless letting events happen around him. No doubt, the filmmaking is impressive, but a movie cannot rely solely on that. Also, the movie portrays the Empress Dowager as some kind of enigmatic god-like creature. In reality, the Empress was an extremely cruel woman who does not deserve to be protrayed the way she was. There is an old Japanese proverb that says, \\"If you believe everything you read, best not read\\". Here are my words of wisdom to aspiring and great filmmakers: \\"If you are going make a movie about an uninteresting man, best not make a movie.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"WAAAAAY TOO LONG","review":"I watched the original version of this film and I can't really figure out why they would want to add another long dull hour to it. I didn't enjoy this movie much, mainly because I didn't feel any sympathy at all for the character. Maybe it's me, but when I can't relate on any kind of level to the people I'm watching on the screen, I don't have a very good time. The fact that it was an agonizing three hours long didn't help. I can see why this film won so many awards, though. It was very well done technically. The cinematography, sound, screenplay, etc., were all of high order, and the movie overall seemed to be well made. I just wish the people in it hadn't been so distant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, but of questionable accuracy.","review":"The books that I have seen that told the life of Pu Yi have differed from this film. I guess that it does admirably at asking this question: What caused this man to become a sidekick to Hirohito? How could he have brought such harm to his empire, China, and his dear homeland, Manchuria?I have to say that I detest the gratuitous erotic scenes in this movie. They seem to want to you believe, for one thing, that there was something Oedipal about his relationship with his wet-nurse. Perverted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime cinematography and costuming.","review":"I have to confess that there is probably no way that I personally could make it through this entire movie in one sitting. It's really long, and it's also heavy. It's worth seeing!!! Which makes me thrilled to have a pause button. :) This is a visually stunning movie. Gorgeous. And the costumes are divinely done. I do not know enough about Chinese history to make any assessment of the accuracy of this movie. However, as a Westerner with little knowledge of Chinese history, I felt that the movie helped open up another culture for me. [There are some scenes that are more difficult to watch than others; and I would recommend previewing before showing it to minors, as some will and some won't do well with the occassional--and realistic--graphicness.]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a DVD of this film worthy to own!","review":"I just received a review-copy of this set, and the DVD set is as magnificent as the film.Both versions of the film (theatrical and extended) are 16x9 anamorphically enhanced and are \\"very good\\" transfers, though there's just a touch of mild edge-enhancement that will only be visible on large televisions and front projection screens. But the picture is still excellent, and finally the film has been done justice on DVD. the 2 discs of special-featues are a bonanza of bonus material for anyone who loves this film.

While the movie is 3 and a half hours long it is never boring and always fascinating. Absolutely masterful cinematography and a beautiful score keep you hooked. Lush production and great direction by Bernardo Bertolucci make this movie a beautiful epic and one of the greates films of the 80's. As with all period epics this one has great costumes and art direction. The DVD is not all that bad, and if you like Bertolucci I recommend 'The Conformist' or 'Last Tango In Paris'. Highly recommended, see this movie. From a scale of 1-10 I give it a 9!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie.... Awful DVD","review":"Enough comments have been made on the movie so I'll just tell you my opinion on the DVD edition. It is one of the worst DVD transcription I have ever saw. I really had the impression to watch a DivX. Do I need to tell more about the resolution? Only the english soundtrack is available (I wish the movie had been shooted in Chinese or Mandarin but that's not the point) and no subtitles. The DVD presents the director's cut which makes the movie 3 and a half hour instead of 2 and a half. The theatrical version is not available on the DVD... Otherwise there is no additionnal material."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm watching as I write this. Poor DVD quality","review":"What a shame that a gorgeous movie like this is given poor treatment.

Artisan sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Director's Cut is better.","review":"I thought the Criterion version would have an improved picture but there was no difference. The Director's Cut although poo pooed as a Korean knockoff had clips that added continuity to the story and helped me understand why some things were the way they were. For example, I thought the interrogator was an awful grouch. The reason was because the Japanese buried his mother alive. That was a segment that was originally clipped out but put back in. Amazon graciously allowed me to return the Criterion version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent movie, *very* terrible DVD","review":"While this is an excellent and engaging movie, DVD collectors should wait until another release to become available. The picture quality of this DVD is amazingly BAD, worse than VHS in some segments.

The original (2.35?) aspect ratio of the film has been reduced to 4:3 pan and scan, then \\"enlarged\\" for 16:9 by cutting off the top and bottom! The resolution is AWFUL. Worse than over-the-air analog broadcasts.I was so horrified at the quality of the picture I can't speak to the value of the additional footage, or even to the sound quality.

I love the quotes - and that they are not all by dead white guys.What I really want to say is the book was interesting, and not too complicated. It gave me many ideas both on how to help me manage working and my family without getting too stressed, and how to do better at work.

Thankfully, though, the book doesn't just dwell on what made the shows bad. It also gives credit where credit is due -- if there was anything good, that is.I only two complaints, neither of which are major. First, this book is that it could use an update -- notorious recent flops such as \\"Nick & Nora,\\" \\"Seussical,\\" \\"Dance of the Vampires,\\" and Paul Simon's \\"The Capeman\\" are missing. Secondly, there are many shows that never made it to Broadway for previews that are included in the book of \\"Broadway flops.\\" While these shows do have their place, I wonder if their inclusion was necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing but flawed","review":"An amusing but flawed book. It makes a good read but cannot be relied upon as being very factual -- too many chapters rely on gossip and are strongly one-sided. The author needed to interview more people involved with certain productions. This book is fun to read, but is often inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising subject let down by bad journalism","review":"Although this book makes an amusing read, it is sadly spoiled by bad journalism. In researching the stories behind these Broadway flops, the author seems to have been happy to talk to one person involved and take their word for everything. This leads to some serious inaccuracies. Any researcher knows to get the story from a number of sides, but Mandelbaum reports gossip as truth, and fails to check up on the most simple of facts. As a result, the text is littered with inaccuracies, half-truths, and spurious statements. In the hands of a better journalist this might have been a great book, but it sadly cannot be relied upon for any accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for any theatre enthusiast.","review":"The others who have reviewed this book have said little beyond the fact they haven't really read it. Not Since Carrie is not, in any way, about gossip, unless you consider the published words of dozens of theatre critics and statements from those involved with the works in question gossip. The story of some of Broadway's greatest musical flops is told through the people that were there--the stars, the composers, and even an important element, the audience, as represented by Mr. Mandelbaum. He has done his homework, and has created a brilliant, must-have book for any theatre enthusiast's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor remake","review":"The 1970's version with Alan Arkin and Peter Falk was far, far superior.

Run - do not walk - down to your local video store and rent the original starring Alan Arkin and Peter Falk. Right now.Dianne Crittenden, who did the casting for the 1979 original, deserves a lifetime achievement award for pairing up Arkin and Falk. [Remember, Falk was one of the biggest stars on TV at the time as Detective Columbo. Who knew he'd be such a master at comic timing and deadpan delivery?]This isn't a swipe at Albert Brooks and Michael Douglas, but they had to know that by accepting these roles, they would be held to an unattainable standard.Let's force Hollywood to come up with some new ideas instead of destroying old ones within our lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother.","review":"Remakes have it tough; everyone who's a fan of the original will be hypercritical of any shortcoming.

The role he plays here is extremely funny. It's always Michael Douglas' character who is in perfect form- meanwhile Al Brooks always finds himself in awkward situations that he must get out of on his own.My favorite moment is the part where this French guy repeatedly hits on Albert Brooks' character.Just an overall really humorous film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute WORST!!!!!!!!","review":"Awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful!!!!

The opening scene clued me that this was not written as well as the first-- It was completely believable that Peter Falk could be too goofy to actually be an agent (Columbo?) and that made his role so much better but Michael Douglas is just not goofy enough.I just couldn't stay interested enough to even get to any laughs.

Our department selected Stewart's book about 7 years ago, but I was unaffected by the choice. Now that I am teaching out of the book, I am disappointed and sometimes even angry. The author does not have the crisp logical presentation that I expect of college-level text. The writing has no personality. It is almost like I am looking at the Reader's Digest of calculus books, with one page taken from Book A, another from Book B, and another from Book C.

The next time our department meets to discuss calculus texts, I plan to participate in the decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Students Do Not Like This Textbook","review":"Our department has been using this book since September, 2001. Like most math teachers, I don't use the book much. So, I would have said that the book is fine. My students, however, have developed quite a passionate hatred of the book. They say it is difficult to read, the tone is patronizing, the exercises are not well matched to the examples, and the odd-numbered answers in the back of the book have several errors. Also, a couple of the more theoretical members of our department say that the book is off in some of it theory. Our department has decided to hunt for a new book for the fall of 2002."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing explained","review":"This book does a pretty terrible job of explaining anything. It seems to gloss over the theory very quickly, maybe assuming we already know it (in which case we would have no need for the book)!It has a few examples, which are decent in that they illustrate the ideas but they are not enough in number nor in variety. While doing the problems in the book whenever I get stuck I often find that the book is of no help in helping me understand, either because the examples are too specific or more often than not because there is no explanation at all.This book has a lot of great problems that I guess promote understanding (as someone else has mentioned), but it does nothing to help you solve them, and that's the major flaw of the book which is why I simply cannot give it more than 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I was forced to teach from this book for one semester. I hope I never have to do it again. The worst part of it was that my students found the book so confusing that they were constantly in my office asking questions.

At first, I thought it was practically gibberish. After the second semester of usage, I love it! Stewart is clear and while his formalisms may be a pain, they are necessary.

It does not have nearly enough examples and is calculus dumbed down for the new math student. I found I had to look at the Thomas and Finney Calculus book, the old standard for calculus.

There are very few proofs in this book and the ones present are in shorthand with chunks missing.This may be acceptable for the \\"thank-you-laude\\" engineering crowd but to those interested in understanding what's going on under-the-hood, it's like putting a jigsaw puzzle together.After a year of flipping through the pages of this error-laced tome, I have finally put this glorified recipe book to rest.
