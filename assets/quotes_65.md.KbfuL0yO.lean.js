The Troublesome Truck with the red tarp rocks up and down, while the Troublesome Truck with ballast rocks side to side. Also, when the red tarp is pushed, the trucks giggle.Overall, 5 stars.

It worked fine for a while until the Screen started separating. June 2010. Repair man advised it was not repairable so we contacted sears with our service agreement and found out they would not refund or trade for a same price unit. Instead they said TV's are cheaper now so they would only credit about half of what we paid for this unit. Now I'm getting a 400 dollar tv for seven hundred dollars...A big ripoff.

The DVD instructions are frustrating, with no written instructions. It is a pain to refer to a DVD for some detail you might need, such as a temperature requirement.

However, upon watching this version, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. Instead of seeing Blu-ray sharpness, the picture is grainy and mushy. Picture resolution is not nearly as good as on the older, standard DVD. It appears that transfer on this one was made straight from an old, VHS tape without any clean-up being attempted. It's really a shame, too, because this item comes with a really informative booklet describing the film, a film poster, and an appreciable number of disk extras. I have a substantial collection of Blu-rays and Tenebrae has absolutely the worst picture quality of the lot.

The other thing that is beginning to make me mad is that Francine Pascal just can't let Gaia be happy. Geez...she's been dragging out the whole \\"Gaia can't get close to people otherwise they die\\" thing out for 23 books already. Can't she give the girl a break!

It's a beautiful display piece with the black lacquer roll top box, and if you're a Beatles collector it's something you might want to pick up. Yes, the used CD bins are full of the individual 1987 CDs, but this will ultimately be a true collectors item.

There is no reason for the price of this box set to appreciate. As another reviewer says, the 2009 remasters have made this box set obsolete. Compared with the new CDs, the sound on this set is like throwing a couple of sheets over your speakers. And the box is just normal wood--not even Norwegian! I can't believe this is Amazon!

I think a lot of the issues have to do with shooting technique. This is not a lens I would shoot using anything but single focal point AF. The 5DMIII has an ability to further adjust AF inside of a single focus point box for an even more accurate shot and I have had very good success using this function at f1.2. The shots render beautifully with plenty of warm color. It is an amazingly versatile lens and I've come to appreciate the L quality living here in the Seattle rain... If you're on the fence, get it.

The older and classic books explain things much better imho.This review refers to the 4th edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solutions Manual","review":"The solutions manual give a non-detailed (by this I mean that some steps are ommitted) solution to the chapter problems.

I regret however that no paperback edition seems to be available."},{"rating":"2","title":"probably the best book for learning quantum chemistry","review":"I read the fourth edition of this book as an undergraduate student in chemistry. Now that I am a grad student involved in research problems in quantum chemistry, I find myself reaching for this book everytime I need to refresh this concept or that. The best part about this book is the level of detail at which a lot of basic quantum chemistry topics have been treated. I highly recommend this book for any serious student of quantum chemistry and those from other fields who need to learn some quantum chemistry on their own for their work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"writen by a teacher, with a great teaching art. As a beginner ( satellite engineer) , it provides me a clear first understanding of how atomic & molecular waves functions are computed. I appreciate the approach, very oriented to understanding the computation aspects. I agree that symmetry introduction should be more developped. References are systematically documented (in the text). Gives me understanding of \\"basic\\" explanations which are usually only shortly referenced in many other chemistry books I open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moony About Stripers","review":"It's \\"different\\" alright: too much earnest style and mysticism for the money. I have no doubt Abrames is a good fisherman and loves the striper and its world --but you gotta wade through the mucky prose of the post/neo Romantic style to get out to what Abrames knows. It is apparently meant to be EXPERIENCED --perhaps read by moonlight to a woman in an Edwardian dress in Blake meter. The doors of perception into the striper world swing open but it's still just a beach and saltwater and a primitive vertebrate from which I want to elicit a feeding response. The transcendental drawings ARE lovely, but they show less than meets the eye, and any one of the new primers of fly fishng for stripers are better esp. Taboury's \\"Stripers on the Fly\\" (Lyons/1999). This is waa-aaay too different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"I thought Ron Campbell did a thorough job describing the degrees of Freemasonry and the Egyptian roots associated with this organization.The information is a little \\"dry\\" when he is describing the different \\"degrees\\" that Masons go through, however the details were needed.I think it is well worth your time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable as hell.","review":"It might just be my face who knows but the metal part of the sunglasses really bugged the hell out of me and rubbed and such. & within a week or so of having them the frame bent and the lens scratched.. :/ they were cute while they lasted i guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis sunglasses","review":"The glasses were dispatched very quickly and arrived suitably packaged to limit the possibility of damage during transportation.

Both the picture and sound are excellent. The reason for 4 stars (instead of 5) is the inability to permanently set the contrast, brightness, tint, color and sharpness.

This book is highly readable for a general audience; indeed, it pulls the reader along quite well, while vividly describing the personalities involved, the life of the average crusader, the magnificent city and court of Constantinople, and other lively evocations. Where there is discrepancy in the historical sources, Phillips gives us both sides and then weighs in with his own considered opinion.

I think the authors were paid by the word because it is so over-written. For a town of 63,000 people, the insider's guide should not be this thick. Please. For example, the authors go into lengthy (but useless) detail about the MALL: \\"Next door to Stride-Rite, which offers a wide variety of footwear, you'll find Spencer's, with a plethora of ecclectic gifts for everyone on your shopping list.\\" I'm making that up, but that's about how ridiculous it is.

We've watched these numerous times on vhs and are now starting on re-watching them on dvd.My 14 year old cynical son (who is into such things as Call of Duty 2 and Battle for Middle Earth pc games) asked for the series for Christmas and was delighted to find them. He puts a disc in nearly every night for us to watch an episode (or two or three) and when he thinks no one can hear him, he sings along with the themesong.I guess the best thing to be said for the series came from him: \\"I really like Wind in the Willows. They're all so KIND to each other.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute best","review":"My baby was 2 months premature and was in the NICU for 6 weeks. When she finally came home, we were still using the disposable bottles from the hospital and did not know which bottles to switch to. I tried Avent but my baby had the hardest time with the slippery and tough nipples - it wore her out. Then I tried Playtex, Gerber, Evenflo and the angled one made by Munchkin. None of them worked. They either leaked, had a lot of bubbles, or the nipples would collapse. I had been avoiding the Dr. Browns bottles because it looked too complicated but it was my last hope. It worked! After using it once, my husband told me he loved everything about it from ease of use to the clear markings on the bottle. The only down side is that it takes 2X as long to wash the bottles, but it is worth the time considering what I have gone through. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from wide-neck!","review":"We received the wide-neck started kit and they were awful! They leaked all down our baby's chin, which is horrible when you're fedding him in the middle of the night. We ended up buying the Playtex VentAire and have been quite happy with them--but our baby has never been particularly gassy. I have a friend who swears by the standard size Dr. Brown's, but I had such an awful experience with the wide-neck that I don't think I'll try another type of Dr. Brown's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"I bought these bottles thinking they were neat and inovative. Well, to my surprise they leaked like crazy. You can't make a powder formula bottle in them at all because that's when they leak. There are also too many parts to clean and you have to make sure you don't lose the little brush they include w/ the kit. I ended up throwing the bottles in the garbage and purchased the very inexpensive evenflo 3 pack instead. Much better. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product","review":"I used this web site to research bottles, and saw all of these great reviews, so I registered for this bottle system. And I have been very happy with it. I have only tried one other bottle, one of the angled neck styles, and my daughter was much more gassy with that. I will warn you, it is a little more work than other bottles, just because there are multiple parts, but it is worth it. It was either this or the systems that use the bags, but I didn't want to have to keep buying bags, and risk running out. The hardest part is explaining to other people how it works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Best","review":"This bottle does what it says. I received one at the baby fair with my son and I loved it. Now I am 6 months pregnant with a little girl. I will, without a doubt, use these again. My favorite of all though, is the Playtex Disposable bottles. That is because I breastfeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product for newborns!","review":"I love these bottles. I wanted to use a bottle that would start me off on the right foot and these were it! We notice there were no bubbles in these bottles as oppose to the Playtex Ventaire when we shook the bottles with the breastmilk/formula, which I think helps a newborn tremendously with gas. We are able to use them in our bottle warmer as oppose to the PV - we could not. It helped tremendously when we brought our son home in the winter. The 4 oz bottles were perfect for newborns, since they don't drink that much at one feeding anyways. There are many parts to clean, but it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bottles","review":"I originally was using the Playtex drop in bottles. I saw the Dr. Brown's and decided to try them. Within 2 days of using them my one month old son had severe gas for 2 days straight. I switched back to Playtex and haven't had a problem since. I strongly advise against these bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are more work ,but seem to work well","review":"I only use these bottles, my daughter would not take any other ones right from the start. I can not compare to other brands but I can tell you that she doesn't spit up, which may be her naturally, but I wouldn't switch from these bottles just in case. They are more work to clean ,but if you buy enough they can be put in the dishwasher so it really isn't a big deal. I also read other reviews about leaking and can honestly say I have never had a single leak. There is a line on the bottle that says not to fill above and also for travel they provide a \\"travel disc\\" to fit under the nipple to prevent leaks so I am not sure how other people have all these problems. I really think these are a great product and certainly worth trying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made baby sick!","review":"I researched for months before our daughter was born and decided on the Dr. Brown's bottles. Well I spent lots of $$$ on these things and fed her with them for 2 non-consecutive days and she threw up after each feeding with them. Luckily some were still in the package and I was able to return them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"After 3 weeks of using these I went out and bought new bottles. They leak way to much and you might as well deal with spit up. Cause after you are done feeding the baby they are soaked and you have to change them. Then they are awake fussy cause they have been moved around to the point that they spit up any way. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY TILL THEY FIX THE LEAKING PROBLEM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful invention","review":"These are the best purchase I have made for my daughter. They are wonderful bottles that cured my daughter's gas and spit up problems!In response to other reviews, you need to not fill it up pass the DO NOT FILL line in order for them not to leak--although I have never had a problem with any leakage.These bottles are absolutely THE BEST. My daughter is now one and is still using Dr. Brown's. I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"I found these bottles to be completely useless at preventing gas and they leak like a sieve! My daughter's gas actually worsened with these bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOMEWHAT OF A PAIN, BUT WORTH IT.","review":"We got these bottles after trying every single other brand out there. Our son was born 10 weeks premature, and had a difficult time learning to suckle in the first place, then had awful reflux. He would spit up constantly as well as projectile vomit. When he was 4 months old we saw the Dr Brown's in the store and decided it was worth a shot. They made a HUGE difference. Immediately he stopped spitting up almost completely. The only thing is that they do not travel well with fluid in them...they leak if they are tilted, you cannot mix formula in them, and they have a lot of little pieces. BUT if your baby has problems with reflux,or feeding, these bottles are totally worth the trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product! Definitely worth it !!!","review":"I bought this bottle when my baby was 4 months old. I was using Johnson& johnson heathflow before and she was fine. But then suddenly at 4 months old, she start gagging a lot. I took her to a pediatrician, and he said that she had too much gas and he suggested to give her Mylicon drops. The gagging disappeared when she took Mylicon but it showed up again once I stopped the medication. Finally, several friends of mine in my new mom's group recommended this bottle to me and it is unbelievable, within 2 days the gagging disappeared. Right now, she is 7 1/2 months and never have any gagging problems anymore!!!! She doesn't need to take Mylicon drops ... Thanks to Dr. Brown bottle, it's definitely worth it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy at all with Dr. Brown's!","review":"My son has been very gassy and not only did these not help the situation, they only made it worse!

They made for a miserable feeding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do their job, but a pain to clean","review":"Our baby was very gassy/spitty, so we decided to give these bottles a try. They do definitely help, but they are also a huge pain to clean, requiring a special tiny brush (included) to get all the nooks and crannies of the little parts. We also tried the bottles with the disposible plastic liners, and those work to keep air out too with less muss and fuss, but now that he's trying to hold the bottle himself they are less practical and so at 10 months we still use these bottles (and wash them, and wash them) every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff's Still on Top Form","review":"Great to see Jeff back so soon (2 CDs in two years). His playing is quite mesmerizing, and it's good to see he's still willing to experiment with new styles and electronic devices.

The only reason I don't give this CD 5 stars is that it is much too short (37 min.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"We are not worthy!","review":"We are not worthy of such a masterpiece by the greatest guitar player on the planet.

I almost missed it because it wasn't really promoted the way I envisioned a Jeff Beck event would be.Why the 4 stars and not the 5. Well.... even though he's checking in with Techno and staying on with the progressive slant to his career. He's almost sounding formulated. Since Guitar shop you get the screamers, the blusey, hyped up delta song, The Veil type of song. But, hey his chemistry checks in and goes to work. Plus having been a fan since the early 70's and a musician I'm only going to congratulate him and say.... dig this cat! I wonder what a George Martin production would sound like at this juncture?

I was expecting to hear some great guitar tone and amazing riffs, and interesting hard rock guitar-related music. What I actually got was not identifiable as music in any traditional sense, certainly no identifyable guitar music. Instead, a way out pyro-technic auditory \\"junkyard\\" ....a series of irritating sonic trainwrecks producing an instant throbbing headache and sensations of a sound mixing board being eaten by giant guitar-wielding nuclear rats with blazing red eyes. But that's what I get for not advance-listening to some \\"sound bytes\\" first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is The King Dead Or Just Dazed And Confused?","review":"Once again, Jeff Beck, who I used to think was, \\"Guitar GOD\\", has traded in melody for FX, tricks and weirdness. We all know he doesn't need the money and he'd rather be working on cars...but if he's going to put his name on something you'd think he'd be worried about looking himself in the mirror everyday.This latest effort is only slightly better than, Flash, which was a diaster.

Logging in a massive 36 minutes (YES less than 1/2 of a full CD - maybe it should sell for only [half the price]), once you take away the 1 minute drum loop intros with dull, repetitive bass lines, this CD probably has bout 20 minutes of real guitar playing on it. I recently bought the boxed set of \\"Blow by Blow\\", \\"Wired\\" and \\"There and Back\\" and can't believe it is even the same guitarist.It's time to quit using words like \\"Genius\\" & \\"Guitar God\\" for people who put out this type of an offering. Any of Eric Johnson's albums blow this one right out of the galaxy. If you're looking for a stunning guitar playing, spend your money on the new Frank Gambale, Joe Satriani or Eric Johnson CD.

This record is a damnable outrage of maniacal guitar playing. I've never heard anything quite like it, really, even from Beck.

(w/Rod Stewart, Ron Wood, etc.), In my opinion Jeff's playing leaves Page & Clapton way behind. Beck leans way out over the edge while the other two are sitting on picnic tables about 50 feet back. \\"Who Else\\" absolutely blew me away (Space for the Papa!) and I was looking for a similiar musical ride with this CD. While close, I did find this CD less melodic and a little harder on my ears. \\"Rollin' & Tumblin\\" and \\"Blackbird\\" are my favorites. Still well worth the purchase price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Electronic Approach Works Well","review":"Track 1, \\"earthquake\\" is a punching song dictated by repitition, pulsing beats, and driving rhythm guitar. It basically an electronic song, as are most songs on the album. The drums, as far as electronic drums go, are well programmeda nd diverse, enabling the song to continue above all else. The rest of the songs gradually expand away from the pure electronic to a style more similar of his previous album, \\"Who Else!.\\" This is a blend of the electronic trance style with tough lead playing and unbounded creativity!The final verdict is, if you would like a MORE electronic \\"Who Else!,\\" you'll like \\"You Had It Coming.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck is a guitar Diety","review":"Jeff Beck is one of hte greatest guitarist ever born.

While his early contemporaries have simply recycled their product (ala Page or Townshend) or have played it safe (like Clapton), Jeff keeps pushing the limits of sonic exploration and this album has to rank as one of his greatest works to date. Everytime I listein to it I hear something different. It's overall sound impact is downright \\"rude\\" and it may alienate some people whose admiration for the artist is still mired in The Yardbirds or his Truth days, but for my money this is cutting edge industrial buzz saw rock by a guitarist that only Hendrix surpassed. Can't say enough ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Reinvention-Beck Always Amazing","review":"Jeff Beck never ceases to amaze me with his guitar playing. You Had it Coming is no exception. He is the greatest guitarist ever, and YHIC is another snapshot of what he can do. I say snapshot, because an album really only is a snapshot. It's live where an artist really shows what he can do.This album is filled with enormous talent. Even if the more electronic approach isn't your thing, the guitar playing is great. Every one of Jeff's solos on this album is amazing. As said previously, his solo at the end of Left Hook is awesome. Nadia, of course, is the standout, and Jeff once again shows us he can drown Clapton with his guitar (not only his phrasings and ideas, but his tone as well). The guitar tone is quite good, and even better on this stuff live.You Had It Coming is worth the money you have to pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Strat.","review":"hey, the guy who judge the album by its longth, please note: though this JB's new album is a little short, but its good music run time is the longest of all the albums i've ever seen since 94's TheVere's A stream in heaven.So, you got a 37' album, but with 37 minutes of good music, let's say: you got Aerosmith's last album, which is 51', but certainly you don't have more than 25' of good music. JB is the reason i still thingking of upgrading of my stereo. His Strat sound really deserves you put more money in your system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Goes Techno","review":"This CD grows on you after a while.

Now that I've read a few of the reviews, I see that other people noted the slow first half. And boy, was it slow. I got about 40% of the way through before stopping. I didn't like any of the characters: Lisa was bitchy, Clodagh complained too much, and Ashling was too goody-goody. I also couldn't sympathize with their so-called problems -- I didn't have a reason to care. The combination of \\"meh\\" characters and slow pacing made this book a DNF for me.

My average time to finish a book is 3 days - 1 week. Previously, I've enjoyed several of Keyes' novels and enjoy the 'Chick Lit' genre, but I was so disappointed by this one, that I threw it out afterward. The characters lack a great deal of depth, which unfortunately created indifference toward the characters. The characters of Lisa and Clodagh are so shallow, that it's difficult to find emmpathy for them. In contrast, Ashling is uber-naive and sugary sweet to the point of annoyance. The pace of the book is too slow and monotonous. However, the final third of the book, finally picked up and was somewhat enjoyable. I think this may have been better off as a short story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marian Keyes always entertains me","review":"Sushi was a fun read, not as insightful or as complex as someof her other books.

She is gorgeous, has a wonderful husband and two \\"delightful\\" children, but, something is missing.Marian Keyes weaves her story through the empty places in their lives and develops an enchanting and piercing tale of coming to terms with those things in life that really are critically important.

But this book was so slow, so sleepy, that it took me nearly a month to read it.Pick it up if you've read all her other books and can't wait for a new title. All in all, it's not vintage Keyes.

Normally, I loved Keyes' work as much as the next person, but not only was this book flater than a manhole cover, Keyes' attempt to somewhat mimic Helen Fielding's style was absolutely disastorous. My only hope is that Keyes' thought that this style would attract more readers, but my advice is to stick with the Walsh sisters. The old adage rings true- 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' Unfortunally for Keyes, this absolutely hideous novel has completely undermined all of her writings for me, and has made me quite hesitant to pick up anything new by her (should she dare to write it). I really do hate to see such a sarcastic and humorous writer go by the wayside, but fellow readers be warned, a rebound from this book for Keyes would be astounding and a modern miracle at best, and a brave attempt to save face at worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love her!","review":"\\"Sushi for Beginners\\" is the best book by Marian Keys.

Yet in SUSHI, in common with her other novels, she examines issues that neither are shallow nor trivial.While the theme of Dublin singles is a bit boring and a bit tiring--looking for love being universal--the rest of the book is marvelous. The author examines infidelity and betrayal, the crippling aspects of clinical depression and the problems of the homeless. And, while this list of issues may sound appalling in a woman's novel, these topics actually are what gives this particular book texture and richness.Readers can rely on Marian Keyes for a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good book from Marian Keyes","review":"The first book that I read from Marian Keyes was \\"Lucy Sullivan is getting married\\" and I really liked it.

Part of the problem is that it is essentially a taped stage production. Not that this is always a failing, but in this case it seemed to make Shakespeare's most driven play far too static. Also, there was too much \\"acting\\" going on. Especially from Olivier -- he was so busy trying to be \\"black\\" with the eye rolling, exaggerated vocalisms and gestures that I couldn't believe a word he said. His Othello is a caricature.

That attitude is still prevalent in Japan.The fact that the attitude seems rather universal in Western societies, and increasingly all Asian societies as well, the young people grow into adulthood, keeping their adolescence.It surely fosters the ME, ME, ME behavior and makes real human compassion difficult in light of this obsessive selfishness.I cringe at some of the scenes in the film because it is such raw reality.

And now that I've sampled other DVD instruction by professional dancers, I can see I was correct in thinking she was all about trying to look sultry and alluring and not so much about teaching the dance.

I bought the HTC1000 mobile base for the heavier planer and one of the other brands of universal bases (you get the wheels and corners, but have to add lengths of hardwood)for the jointer. The HTC came with missing parts as well as a disjointed mixture of metric and non-metric bolts and nuts. In the end, because of their poor quality control, I wasted much time, it cost me twice as much as I paid for it and I have an inferior base. I am very disgusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the money","review":"Does exactly what it says it will.I have a 275lb Jet jointer gluiding around like an office chair now.The directions/diagram could be greatly improved.I would rate those poor.But once you look the parts over it will make sense...after all,it's not a Rubik's cube by any means.So I would not let that point stop you from buying one.And the bottom line is it's the best price going for that weight class.But that may a negative point as well...I would buy another when needed without hesitation.But as far as the quality to price ratio goes? ...I would be curious to see how long the wheel bearings last if you move it around frequently over the next 5 years?So I will lubricate mine yearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"wouldn't buy another","review":"i have this base - and i have the delta/rockler base. i wouldn't buy this one again. My beef - that it's not really foot friendly.1. it's tough to lift or lower with your feet.2. when the base is in the lifted position the handles stick out far to either side - i now have at least two pairs of boots with gouges through the leather because of it. A beater pair of shoes - ok - but sometimes i'm just cutting through the shop or have only a couple minutes of work to do and don't want to change...The rockler model is great. i didn't get another because i didn't want to bother making the oak rails. should have sucked it up and put the hour of effort in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for trying to keep the shop in order","review":"I have limited space in my shop, so I use these to give me the ability to roll large tools and work benches to and away from the walls. I can move the bench or tool away from the wall to use it, then push it back when Im done. The base holds up very well including a cross country move. At one point one of the wheels on one of the bases did bend, I don't recall how, but still, these are very sturdy for table saws, work benches, lathes, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery with a happy ending","review":"I love a good mystery as much as the next guy, but not when it comes to assembly instructions. As others have noted, the assembly instructions are somewhat limited, but the end result is worth a little trial and error.

This unit is rock solid, rolls smothly and is nice and stable."},{"rating":"2","title":"good mobility","review":"i found the stand very sturdy in it's stationary position and very mobile in it's rolling postion. the only drawback i found was that the swivel wheels must be manually placed perpendicular to the frame in order to achieve maximum stability in it's stationary position... a minor annoyance considering the price. i found a similar unit in my local home center for $10.00 more. all in all this unit is a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful!","review":"I ordered a second one of these mobile bases after I found the first one very useful for my table saw. I will use the second one for my sliding miter saw after I build a stand for it. The only drawback I find is that if you have the base on an uneven surface such as an older driveway, sometimes it can move slightly even in the down/locked position. This is probably only an issue w/ a table saw since you are pushing against it horizontally.

If you have a youngster that is into pirates, buy this cd and the whole family will be singing and laughing. There are narrative transitions that tie the whole album together from the pirate ship setting sail to when they head home. Many songs are similar to artists adults know such as Beach Boys and 50's doo-op style. Even better, this age group 2 to 6 or so wants to listen to something over and over to make it their own (age appropriate according to our kid's teachers)--this music is easy to listen to over and over. We are all singing along in the car and trying to dance the pegleg tango at home. My favorite song is about the sea monster; they wisely make it almost a lullaby so as not to scare the kids.Great cd, I can't say enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise for A Passionate Heart","review":"A Passionate Heart is a loving, insightful and thought-provoking look into the spiritual, political and personal life of a student and her interactions with her teacher.

The most divine picture is on the back cover: a close-up of one of the highly-decorated women's gowns. Black & white photographs simply cannot express the grandeur and eloquence of design. The Russian \\"style\\" is completely lost in it. There is page after page of folk dresses, paintings, portraits, art objects...blah blah...they're just boring. The text must take a second seat to the images and it cannot replace them.Jackie Kennedy Onassis was about as stylish as you can get. And this book was published in 1976 so she somehow got around the Iron Curtain (which is ironic regarding the Bay of Pigs and Cuban Missile Crisis).

The relationship of the \\"brothers\\" and disintegration of same was amazing to experience.

I believe that understanding the spiritual world and struggles behind the world we see is very important, and I thought perhaps this book would have some interesting things to say about the fall of that great being who was a pinnacle of creation and who has made himself so twisted. So I did want to enjoy this book, and I am sympathetic to its theme! But I agree with all the reviewers who gave this one star. It was so poorly written I could not even finish it. I no longer have the book to refer to to give a more detailed and helpful review; I didn't even want it taking up space on my bookshelf! The Christian message is not well-served by this book, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I am not a huge, fiction fan and I only tend to read it if the story line truly interests me. There have always been two prominent themes expressed with fiction that I have found fascinating, History and Biblical History. I know that Wendy Alec gets a lot of flack from the naysayer's concerning God t.v. and her support of Todd Bentley, however I truly felt upon reading this book that the author had a fully literate understanding of the Judeo Christian God's love for mankind and the sacrifice he made by sending himself to die for his creation to quench his own thirst for justice when no one else would fit the job. As I read earlier, it was clear to me that Wendy was more so telling Christ's story in the book rather than Lucifer's. It was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I came away from this book with a completely new perspective on the story of Lucifer.

You see Lucifer as he was before the fall. An Angel of the highest rank, brother of Micheal and Gabireal. We see the creation come about and Lucifer begins to question God. His doubts become more and more severe until they bubble over and his transformation from Guardien to Fallen is complete.Theres tons of imagery in this book, so much in fact that a Movie should be made with no other purpose than to see that images and depictions of them.While there are a few biblical facts askew here (mentioned in another review) this books is to be taken a Christian FICTION and no more. I urge all sound minded and faith rooted Christians to read this book.(Also, If you like this book or are simply interested in the stories of Lucifer, read the Book MEMNOCH THE DEVIL by ANNE RICE. Its also fiction but it is very well written as well)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever better for having read this series","review":"This series was at least as powerful if not more so than Peritti's \\"Pearcing the Darkness\\".

While it is fiction, it is none the less believable. A MUST read for anyone, especially for Christians!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"Alec is unable to display spiritual worlds. Lucifer is in rebellion at the idea of a material yet Heaven is described by Alec as being very much a material realm (they eat, sleep, draw blood from one another, have computers and electronic equipment!!!).Furthermore, it seems silly and somewhat blasphemous for an evangelical Christian like Alec to even float the idea that God needs the help of billions and billions of sapphire armored, platinum braided, emerald tinged angels (this is the way Alec writes) to assist in creating the universe.I was very disappointed by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent seller and Quick delivery!!","review":"Excellent seller and super fast delivery in two days!!

Symbolism, metaphor and mythos are visible only in those empty spaces where they died stillborn. Contrary to the jacket promo, the writing is far short of epic; it might qualify as fantasy only as it chronicles the writer's fantasies. I personally was grieved to see a concept so full of potential wasted on such trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! That's All I Could Think!!","review":"I read this book when it first came out and was checking on line to see if the sequel had come out yet. I thought it was coming out the first part of this month.

The brilliant descriptions of the heavenly realm and the cosmic and earthly battle that ensued were breath taking. This is a story one might look for in Genesis.

What is all that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not inspired","review":"I understand that this was fiction, but some readers have expressed the view that the author was inspired and wrote under the influence of God. If that were true then surely it would have been more factually correct? Small things bothered me, such as Gabriel struggling with the temptation to follow Lucifer, the angels having to sleep at night (they don't have earthly bodies), Eve being blonde and also the daughters of men being blonde, when most likely they would have been darker skinned.I could take what I liked and spit out the rest, but I fear for new Christians or gullible ones thinking this book was inspired by God and therefore factual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"This book is fantastic. I couldn't put it down once I got started. Wendy has done an excellent job capturing the emotion and drama that would have taken place in heaven before the creation of earth.

Some have complained about the noise, but with regular ambient noise in an office and at home, it's not intrusive.

After many emails back and forth to the company, turns out it is compatible starting w/ Windows 98SE, not Windows 98. The company was very responsive. I've loaded on my laptop w/ Win Me in the meantime. If you have a lot of items to scan, you may want to look elsewhere as this is pretty slow. The quality is adequate, color resolution greater than 300 dpi slows it down. If just an occassional scanner its ok.

The (Macintosh) software that comes with it is infuriating. The install process installs 5 programs, each of which asks for the same information, install drive, several \\"next\\" clicks and something I've never seen -- after each install you must confirm to exit that installer.Try as I might I couldn't get anything but dark, washed, grainy scans. I tried a software package called VueScan which was able to produce semi-reasonable scans where were merely dark and washed. However there was quite a lot of fringing, so much so that the software could not auto-crop correctly due to fringing which it detected as part of the image.I think this is a case of you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Died after 4 uses!","review":"The software was a pain, and now it's dead after just 4 times i used it.

Scans very well all the way up to the reported 1200dpi. You do have to look to find where to adjust the resolution. It is a little slower due to the fact that it has no power supply (which is a very good thing) and gets its power from the USB port which has limited available power. Be sure you have a \\"powered\\" USB port. The long-term reliability should be very good because it consumes so little power. I've always loved Canon products and have never been let down. Small, lightweight, cheap, low-power, well engineered, good software, 1200dpi resolution... What else do you want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits in the file folder!","review":"I was worried about where I was going to fit the scanner on my crowded desk, but I discovered that is was small enough to easily fit in my file cabinet in a hanging folder.

Great quality for a very reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twain error","review":"Unfortunately, this scanner did not work. I got a continual error message of \\"twain error\\", which Canon support could not fix. Therefore, I'm out my $50.

No more waiting for the bulb to warm up or for the system to locate the scanner.The included photo editing software has an automatic adjust feature that does a fantastic job even on poor photos. I've stopped using Corel and switched to ArcSoft. This feature alone makes it worth it's weight.I really enjoy the absence of an electrical cable. The unit operates from the USB port, and allows one to use the scanner with a notebook running from the notebook's battery. Great for scanning documents at the library.All in all, a big thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"LiDE 25 Review","review":"I had rated it as 4 star, because it deserves it.

I was seeking only a basic scanner of good quality that would be relatively simple to operate. This item is low in the Canon line but I guess I assumed the name Canon would assure a high level of quality nevertheless. I was disappointed. The LiDE 25 is a very light weight unit - literally. It is almost toy-like in its construction and it's capabilities - it produced below par scans for me. I was replacing a mid-line Epson 1670 but the Canon was in an entirely different league and in my opinion is just not a good investment when you realize for a few more dollars you can have one of several other \\"real\\" scanners.

Upon further examination of the glass, there were large particles of dust underneath the glass with no way to get it out. I contacted Canon directly and they said it was \\"anti-glare treatment\\" applied under the glass. Whatever!

The photo editing software it comes with isn't the greatest but overall this is a great scanner. And it's so thin and sleek it can even fit on my messy computer desk!

Had some issues with setting it up on my pc (win XP) which I found strange; but besides some minor issues, it has good/average scanning quality. Do not expect professional quality scans from this machine. Although the settings can be changed to achieve greater scanner resolution, it takes forever to scan a letter size document, and the end result is really not worth the output."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"When it works it works fine. But after a few scans the thing tries to calibrate itself and usually fails, telling you to follow the instructions in the manual.

In fact, I was interested until the last 30 minutes when the smart characters, as played by Sharon Stone and Dennis Quaid, started doing REALLY DUMB things.I mean, If you have just run across your expansive property in the rain and lightning, and you have reached your house and notice your Jeep is on fire in the front yard, do you run inside the house to hide? Hmmm, where's the bad guy? Also, why not spend a little money on security (locks, gates, etc.) to keep the bad guy out? This couple could have easily afforded some security when they got the house for nothing.Juliette Lewis is now definitely type-cast in my mind.

Fans of bad movies will love this DVD to death, particularly the deleted scenes which include Dennis Quaid as pool shark humiliating the Massey character. Stephen Dorff flares his nostrils menacingly while strutting around shirtless, oiled up, and chewing the scenery like a starving man. Several laugh-out-loud moments throughout this film.

You can decide yourself whether that means a purchase or a rental. But after seeing \\"Cold Creek Manor\\", I think you'll probably agree with me that the whole affair is basically, in the end, much ado about nothing. What we ultimately have here is an expensive, lavishly produced film about an annoying neighbor. That's it. Yes, the neighbor gets somewhat more dangerous as the film progresses, and there's a bit of a mystery about his past- and admittedly more serious- misdeeds, but ultimately they made a whole movie about the kind of disorderly conduct / nuisance neighbor case that most middle class neighborhoods have to put up with from time to time. I guess the producers felt it was high time that all those creepy, ex-con, handyman types out there finally got their own film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I told my wife not to rent it . . .","review":"And she didn't listen. We were bored out of our heads. I left her watching the movie and went to read. From what I saw it was a one dimensional plot with one dimensional action and pointless screaming.

Not interesting or worth renting (let alone buying)in the least. Fortunately, it was only a 99 cent rental and that was about 98 cents too much. To be fair, I'll give them an \\"e\\" for effort.

I'll save you the lenghty detailed account of the plot you read in other reviews mainly because I don't want to relive it myself let alone relate it. Ms. Stone gives her worst performance to date, and Mr. Quiad is simpering in a role that requires strength. Sharon has no maternal repore with the boy and girl playing her children, and you are painfully aware that they are \\"acting\\" the part of a family. The plot also has holes big enough to drive a truck through and in the end you're left with more sympathy for the bad guy than the family. This movie is so self aware it is almost comical.

Believe me, you will be rolling your eyes at a number of dumb things they do.If you have something better to do with your time than to see this movie, by all means, do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"mislead","review":"Once again the previews mislead the audience. I like most people I talked to thought it was a ghost story. No such luck. Dennis Quaid is great, Sharon Stone can't act her way out of a wet paper bag. I knew that going in but thought I'd suffer through her because it looked like a good movie.The movie was ok, just ok. As I said it's not a ghost story, but just another thriller. Don't get me wrong thrillers are great but this one was very slow to get going. Once it got going it was ok. I've heard of developing the characters but this took so long the movie was over. I should have saved my money. I could have watched this on TV when I had nothing else to do and nothing else on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes filmmaking to a new low","review":"There are bad movies, then there are movies like Cold Creek Manor. It's in a category all by itself - and...I don't mean that in a good way. It's really scary...how bad the script and the storyline are, that is. To demonstrate how boring and uneventful this piece of crap is, I fell asleep watching this movie TWICE. Run, don't walk...away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Suspense","review":"This DVD is described as a \\"heart-pounding thriller\\" with \\"tension filled suspense\\"......it fails.Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone buy an old home in the boonies (120 acres and a manor for $210K...yeah right!) and never question any of the strange events that occur. Like a weirdo who shows up in your house looking through your things. Instead this guy, played by Stephen Dorff, gets a good meal and a job.As for suspense, it only happens during the snake scene and when the two city ding-dongs are standing over a pit....you just know one of them will be pushed in! All in all this movie could have been interesting if only the characters would not have been so incredibly weak and stupid. Worth watching but not buying unless you adore mindless scare tactics."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Cold Creek Yawner\\"","review":"This is one of the worst movies of 2003. A documentary filmmaker (Dennis Quaid) and his wife (Sharon Stone) move to an old, rusty house with a suspicious past. \\"Cold Creek Manor\\" is the name of the house, how special! A con man (Stephen Dorff) murdered some people and well, the house isn't haunted. Damn! The movie plays like \\"Cape Fear\\" and other really bad movies. Always predictable and ultimately ennui. In the movie theater, I fell asleep for a while and when I woke up during the \\"thrilling\\" moments, I wished I went back to sleep. Come on now, snakes in the house were chasing the family up to the roof. A horse is found in the pool. Cool, now the pool has a Hawaiian Punch color to it! And of course the only stained glass in the house plays a major role in the movie as the ex-owner of the home crashes through it. Why didn't I get my money back you ask? Well, it helped me get some needed sleep. It's one of the most boring \\"thrillers\\" ever made. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold Creek Manure","review":"Is there such a thing as a \\"straight to radio\\" movie? This isn't even good enough for \\"straight to video\\"!A predictable dud with as many twists and turns as a ruler. A couple moves into a creepy mansion, the previous owner is an obvious psycho, and they hire him to fix the place up. You do the math.The real mystery here is how Sharon Stone, Dennis Quaid and Captain Von Trapp were duped into filming this slow-moving, half-dead snooze-fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie about two Democrats from New York.","review":"There is a certain suspension of disbelief required to enjoy many movies but the plot holes and complete idiot lead characters in this one are too much to ask.The best acting work was done by the children in the movie.If you watch the movie as a spoof of thriller movies, there are some laughs to be had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now do you even wanna call this a thriller?","review":"Most of \\"Cold Creek Manor\\" is drama, and the thrills are not even thrilling. It's beginning is OK. It kinda makes you think you're going to get an OK movie, but once they move into the house, it starts to get better, but then just crashes downhill. It becomes extremely boring and the setting of a trashy-looking house doesn't make a good and enjoyable setting. I'm wondering if some of these thrills are even supposed to make people thrilled or creeped out, because one or two scenes are actually good comedy material, like that snake scene. The ending was OK, and kind of intense, but it can't make the film better, and it just flops. It is NOT a movie I would want to see even a second time. It's just 1 1/2 to 2 hours of waiting for the film to actually get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIKE FIGGIS, OPUS 12","review":"*1/2 2003. Directed by Mike Figgis. A NYC family buys a house in the country. The mansion's former owner starts to harass them. A surprisingly bad movie from the British director who never manages to enthrall us with a story seen a hundred times. I really don't know what happened to the inspired director ofInternal Affairs,Leaving Las VegasandOne Night Stand. There are several themes in COLD CREEK MANOR that could have been interesting to evolve like the difficulty for an urban family to integrate in a small town or the implied sexual elements of the story for instance. Instead, we have to watch a pseudo horror movie without any originality. Inadvisable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, MADE IN MEXICO!","review":"I love this movie. I loved it the first time I watched it. It is a thriller, scary type movie without any demons or aliens in it.As for the disc that one is buying, I had to return one because it became stuck and then digitally challenged, and couldn't play any further.Amazon has sent me another of this movie. I haven't opened the package yet, because on the back of the sealed paper the words, \\"MADE IN MEXICO\\" is printed.I frankly don't know if this movie has been sold to someone in Mexico to make reproductions or not.

I wish I could figure out just what went wrong, but so much is wrong with this movie that I hardly know where to start. You know you are in trouble when the man of the house finds a stranger in his house and confronts him with nothing more than a blank stare. It just goes down hill from there. Soo much talent was wasted on this film that the only reason to buy it would be so that you know how bad a film can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It!!","review":"This movie was a joke!

It was not scary, suspenseful or even interesting. I found myself wanting the last 2 hours of my life back following the completion of this movie.

Keep shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, what is that?!!!","review":"Man, what a sad excuse for a thriller!! Absolutely nothing works here. I almost cried watching Dennis Quaid embarrass himself, and seeing Juliette Lewis adding another steady step to finish her career once and for all...This movie is boring, slow, pedestrian, and it causes no fear or scares.

A waste of money and time! (Good thing I paid only $2.50 to see it!) Avoid this movie at all costs is all I have to say. Who ever made this movie should vanish from planet earth, and who ever decided to put it into theaters should be tortured to death, or at least until they vanish too. What can I say, when I was with my sister, watching this piece of you-know-what, I thought 4 hours had passed! (And that was only half way through the damned thing!) Also, the 'suspense' music was horrible. (When that scene with the snakes started, me and my sister couldn't stop laughing! There were only 4 snakes in the house, and they all started screaming like babies [even the father!]) Now, I usually find something good about movies I watch, but I won't even try that with this one. Bottom line: waste of money; waste of time.-Ater"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"If you prefer more suspense than 'scare' factor, you'll probably feel this movie is worth watching. It's a 'what happened to the previous family?' type of story-line when Dennis Quaid and Sharon Stone's characters pose as the unsuspecting home buyers who think they're getting a great deal on a fabulous manor with gorgeous land, until they meet the previous owner who is a bit 'messed up'. Not bad for a suspense flick.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This Movie is not even worthy of a review, it was the worst movie I've seen in years.

Not to ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it--the stunt with the rope that does in the villain--is pathetically unrealistic--and no villain would ever put up such feeble resistance in an attempt to escape such a \\"trap\\"--especially one as crazed as Dorff is made out to be.I don't really recommend this movie--but if you're bored with nothing better to do--it's an ok way to squander away a couple of hours.Another thing I found tedious about this movie was the role reversals-the husband basically acting like the stereotypical wife in these alleged \\"thrillers\\"-and the wife being portrayed in a manner like the typical male lead--with a testosterone heavy female Sherriff as well. Can anyone say \\"Lifetime Movies\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad, In Spite of Fine Actors","review":"I've always like Quaid and Stone, but even both of them could not save this poorly directed, awfully scripted movie. It just doesn't work. It's affect is flat, the scenes are so poorly directed I can't believe it made it out of the studio. It's all shiny on the outside, but the inside is dry-rotted to the core.

The script is full of corny dialog, clichéd sequences of events and predictable plot twists, and the direction by Mike Figgis is horrid.

I also think that if it came with some sort of magic liquid like the protectors for phones/ipads that it would help keep the bubbles down and help it to adhere to the window better.

I'd put it in my kitchen so I didn't notice the noise right away. Then it started getting off track with time and now it's so far off I can't even use it. I live in Las Vegas and I don't really need a clock to tell me the air is dry but according to this thing the air is practically normal and it's always 80 degrees (I wish!) Of course I've tried changing the batteries about 3 times within a 6 month period and then realized it's just the clock. Someone mentioned the fact that it's not real metal - which is true - it's plastic painted with silver metallic paint. As I sit here I notice how the seconds hand seems to keep ticking like it should be working and yet it never says the correct time no matter how many times I re-set it.

The author presents a clear and concise format while maintaining a warm and friendly style which keeps you interested. I was however interested to discover that the author is a catholic priest which is kewl and all but the book should not be placed in the metaphysical section of the book store, which is the only thing I found misleading about it. I will say however that even if your not christian this can be a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"I found this book and bought it after looking at it a few times. Not a bad book to add to your spiritual library. Written by Father Hays of the Roman Rite, this book gives the reader some different prayers and ways of praying that compliment most any spirituality. I also like that throughout the book, Fr. Hays has different illustrations of incense with the Psalm, \\"Let my prayer rise like incense before you\\".....Very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"gothic metal at its best","review":"This is an incredible album. Dawn Crosby died of alcoholism, I believe in 1996. Anyway, my first exposure to this was an intense video \\"Betrayed,\\" one of the most intense tracks off this album. The overlay of voices throughout the album makes it sound as though a wall of hanting female banshees laid down the vocals. Far superior to the harsher, stripped down follow-up, this evokes early Danzig and early King Diamond, yet is a wonder all to its own. Very under-exposed and under the radar... get it if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product works for me....","review":"At 45, I just wanted to find a product that helped to maintain the moisture around my eyes! I have spent lots of money on eye creams, but this is the best I have found in years. There aren't many eye creams on the market that say you can use it on both the upper and lower areas of the eye, but this one does, which is why I wanted to try it. I did have some very fine wrinkles, but they are hardly noticeable now. The only downside to this cream is that it's a little bit on the greasy side at first and doesn't absorb very quickly...but eventually, it does. Other than that, I'm very happy with its performance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First 250 Pages 5 Stars Plus Last 50 -1 F- Great Read Though","review":"The first 250 pages or so of this book were incredible, this was the best book at that point since Ken Grimwood's Replay- John Kaye's writing and subject were incredible at this point- he combined Bobby Fuller, Charles Manson, Frank Sinatra into a fascinating novel that made it sound like he was there but the last 50 pages were pathetic, like the guy was sick and just called in these pages. What the flunk! I was waiting for a climax- there wasn't one.

As such, they do not work well (or at all)for some applications. When I used them to secure pieces to a workbench for chiseling, they would lose their grip after a limited number of strokes.That said, these clamps work very well in other situations. I find that these are the best clamps for securing plywood to sawhorses when cutting with a jig or circular saw. They can be applied and removed within seconds, speeding up the work flow immensely. These clamps would be worth purchasing for that application alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick-Grip Review","review":"These clamps are my least favorite clamps in my shop. The springs fall out of the handle grip often and need to be replaced (if you can find the darn things). For quick applications they are okay at best. For serious woodworking I recommend paying a few dollars more and get better clamps for your project."},{"rating":"1","title":"too little clamping pressure","review":"I thought these would replace my spring clamps, which are sometimes too strong for small jobs. However, the Handi-Clamps don't provide enough clamping pressure. I returned mine. I would recommend the Quick-Grip bar clamps, they are just as quick to use and can provide a large amount of clamping pressure. I use them on almost every project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great inexpensive alarm clock!","review":"I purchased this alarm clock for our guest room. Since my elderly inlaws visit often I was impressed by the added night light when I purchased it. After receiving it I was further impressed to see it has a hi/low setting for the night light, as well as off. An added feature is the extra large digits, helpful for people who have difficulty seeing at night without their glasses on! This ended up being a really impressive, inexpensive compact alarm clock! I'm glad I ordered it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT ALARM CLOCK","review":"This alarm clock is exactly what I was looking for. It is very small in size so it doesn't take up a lot of space on my night table but the display is very large and bright which is great for my not so perfect eyesight. It has a built in night light, which is convenient to have and the wake up beep is just loud enough to wake you up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have gotten a lemon.","review":"Within a couple of weeks my clock suddenly started to speed up until it was more than 10 hours ahead of the actual time.

I spoke with the company I purchased it from and sent pictures and they instantly sent a refund. The night light on front was very bright white, which made the color on top and sides look like a light tan or cream with a brown tint. Now that I look at the photos you can see the color difference.

The first one arrived completely smashed. The box looked as if it had been handled by a clamp truck. I returned it and Amazon was good about shipping another one promptly, but this one too, arrived in unusable, unsalvageable condition. The problem seems to be that Bosch does not package the table with enough protection for shipping and UPS handles it like they are in a Samsonite commercial. I ended up canceling the order. Very disappointing, since I have not seen the table offered at any local dealers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Ben 2000 Baby Ben Deluxe","review":"This clock is an improvement over the Style 7, 8, and 9 models of the past, as this clock has a glass dial instead of a plastic dial like the other models do. It also has a quieter ticking to it compared to the other models as well. I also like the fact that this clock has a second hand on it. The main problem with these newer models is that the body of the clock is made of plastic instead of metal (like on the other models), and there is no SOFT/LOUD adjustment for the sound of the alarm on this model (like the others do.) It also is a shame that these clocks are now made in China instead of the USA, but there is nothing we can do about that! I would definately recommend buying this clock as a new clock to buy, but if you want better quality in a new clock, look for a new model of the styles mentioned above new in the package on eBay or some other site. Check out [...]/westclox for more information on the other models of this type of clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Ben Alarm Clock","review":"Normally, in years past, this clock has been a staple in American homes, and greatly applauded.

Very poor quality. It is a shame the quality has fallen so far. His old one worked reliably for over 10 years which is why he wanted another baby ben. This one didn't work at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good...","review":"I've been looking for a good mechanical alarm clock for a while. Last year I went for the Sternreiter purchased here on Amazon (see my review) at three times the price of this Baby Ben. The Sternreiter started giving me problems after only a couple of months and after less than a year was inoperable. The Baby Ben (by Salton) has been operating reliably for three months. Westclock has lost its good reputation over the past 10 years or so, but this mechanical alarm clock may be an indication they are on their way back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like it used to be.","review":"Bought this clock hoping it was like the one I had years ago. It wasn't. Though it looked the same, the weight of it was different and I could tell easily that it had been cheapened.

I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice alarm clock.","review":"Mostly metal, has a second hand, which was a nice surprise.

This is an interesting but unfortunately FAILED experiment. This long pseudo-artsy \\"documentary\\" provides nothing more than a series of shots of Gaudí's buildings presented with an annoying electronic background music which sounds like it belongs in a cheap thriller. There is NO commentary, although buildings are labelled at times. Judging by cars in the streets, it's a rather old material. Most of my students in a Spanish art class were either annoyed, bored, or fell asleep during the viewing of this material. On the positive side, the DVD format lets one access just one building at a time -- in small doses it may be more palatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaudi Needs Some Words","review":"The two-disc set -- Antonia Gaudi -- is truly gorgeous. The slow and elegant tour of Barcelona's Gaudi collection is very satisfying visually. What is missing is any kind of voice-track. I was hoping to discover how he raised the money to build all those art works. What kind of developer would take a chance on him to bring back a profit on a big apartment complex?

Having visited Barcelona/Sagrada Familia, Park Guell in May 2001, I was extremely interested in seeing (again) the magnificent works of Gaudi, and hearing the intoxicating Catalan language. Thankfully this DVD provided striking images of the magnificent buildings, but what I missed was any sort of background on the man, his inspirations, schooling, etc. While I may be regulated to perusing books and other assorted publications to find out more about Gaudi, this video will provide stunning visuals. My favorite part ? When his student discussed Gaudi himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully captured images of Gaudi's work.","review":"When I first saw this film, I did not know what to expect. One thing is there is no dialogue, just footage of the glorious city of Barcelona and the effect Gaudi's work had on the place. It's beautiful, surreal and an extremely awe inspiring experience to view it all on film. There is a depth to this film which words cannot convey, only seeing this film can one appreciate Gaudi and the city of Barcelona. A city imbued with enormous beauty and creative genius. One can feel great pride for the Catalan people by just his (Gaudi's) example alone.

The one I bought for the car took about 45 minutes to get a bottle warmed, and you also had to be in the car the whole time with it plugged up. This particular bottle warmer works in 30-45 minutes. (depending on how cold the bottle is to start with, of course) So, it's better than the standard plug-in type when you're on the go because you don't have to keep it plugged in. If you have a predictable enough baby, you can just start warming about 30 minutes before you think your baby will be hungry. If you don't have a predictable baby, you can get stuck with a very angry baby for a very long time. I believe, in the end, that going to a drive thru and asking for a half-full cup of hot water, and placing the cold bottle inside (all restaurants are happy to oblige - even without a purchase) is still the best method! (ready in less than 10 minutes)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a little while...","review":"Even though this warmer takes a little while to fully heat a bottle it stays warm for a couple of hours without over heating it. I just fill a bottle with the amount of water I will need and break the activating seal about 45 minutes- 1 hour before I know when my baby will want to eat. Even if he sleeps through his feeding or doesn't want a bottle right when he wakes up, I can count on it keeping the water warm. And I just add the formula powder when he is ready. So granted it takes it's time heating up, I would assume that most moms know when their baby will want to eat (especially by 2 months old). What do you expect from something that you can't plug in? It's called on-the-go for a reason. Even car adapter warmers take a long time. Just work out a schedule and this warmer is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I tried using this warmer when we were on the go.

I was disappointed by the book and believe there are better books out there than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Work - A little too much personal bias though","review":"I gave this a 4 star rating only because of the importance of the overall topic. This book really can help one understand some of the underlying issues that make communications difficult between men and women at work. Ritual opposition and ritual apology are two important topics that are often seen and important to understand. I do believe that the author engages in a small amount of \\"axe grinding\\" though. Although, you know what Dr. Tannen? If I were a woman perhaps I would have viewed some of your experiences through a different \\"lens\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of information, but what do I do about it?","review":"I read this for a leadership program that I'm in, hoping to find a better way to communicate with my peers and supervisors. Instead, I found many examples of what's wrong with very few examples of what's right. Tannen is a good writer, but I found this book to be lacking solid guidance for communication needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting, however not useful","review":"I listened to the audio book version of this book. At first, it seemed quite refreshing to know men and women were so different that you could explain in your work environment why people behaved like that. However, it just didn't give any solution and keep saying it over and over again in this book can bore anyone.This book is more like a psychology paper rather than a practical handbook. The person who performed the book makes it more disturbing.In one word, from this book, you will understand that people are so different that you can't expect others will think like you. Men are more hierachical and women are nice and think all men are equal. My understanding is that even if it is like this, you can only be yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Feminist Book","review":"Book talks in perspective of Victorian Women.. tries hard to explain why 'She' talks the way she talks.

It really opens your eyes. Among its topics, the book discusses gender differences in salary negotiation and office rapport. I really appreciate these points. This is helpful for any professional, especially those working in an environment with gender minorities."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 1970's Viewpoint of Women Today","review":"I had hoped women had progressed more than Tannen implies. Of course the relationship between men and women is still not perfect, but whenever there are differences, you will have imperfection. Tannen's examples are dated and her observations of women stereotypical. She frequently cites studies, but does not reference the situation or the dates of research.I was very disappointed. I used this book in one of my graduate level organizational communications class. It certainly lead to a lengthy discussion. The students were angry at the lack of \\"current\\" information and the stereotyping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opener","review":"This is a word study examining the Hebrew words in the text of Daniel chapter 8. The Mathenys point out flaws in the traditional interpretation of this chapter while providing a clearer understanding of the chapter through careful examination of the individual words and phrases. Their work is easily verified with an interlinear Hebrew text and lexicon or with a concordance. The result is a realization that the prophecy given in this chapter is imminent. More so, in my opinion, than Ezekiel 38 and 39. Incidentally, the product description is in error where it says \\"The goat, weakened by the battle, collapses.\\" The text does not say that (see Daniel chapter 8 verse 8). This is an excellent study for anyone interested in prophecy and very relevant for today."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is excellent!","review":"It is excellent!

What it really shows is the coastal area around St. Augustine. The so called points of interest are little black dots with microscopic labels.

The one in the picture would work better.2) It is oversize for a variety of models. The drill press rests on the inside of the brackets which are not heavy enough gauge to provide firm support which can amplify any vibration.3) There are no holes drilled in the base to bolt the top heavy drill press to the stand.4) The center wheel design would allow a child to easily tip it, creating a real hazard.I am now bolting the drill press to a 1\\" oversize MDO base mounted to a Rockler mobile base supported by a 1 1/2\\" steel channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"HTC Mobile Base for Jet 17\\" Drill Press","review":"The picture displayed for the HSO-593 does not match up with what the actual drill press mobile base looks like.

There are a few niggles, however. For example, the tool holster however, lacks the puch for the driver bit adapter and bits that can be used on the large phillips and the tool itself is too large to fit into other Gerber holsters that have a pouch for the adapter and bits. Also the handles are slippery with the kraton inserts not located in the places where grip is needed. This can easily be solved by applying skateboard tape to the appropriate locations."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gerber 600 is much better","review":"I bought this for my boyfriend and promptly returned it.

Alas, he could have actually chosen to look at all of Jesus' reported words as a body of work, rather than peering through a keyhole (of a single short collection of teachings) and declaring that only what he saw was all there is. Neussner's technique seems to repeat itself endlessly from Steinsaltz to Jesus, and therefore relieves me of any desire to read a single word more in any further books he might ever write."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read!","review":"Excellent!

The text is intended to be instructional, but EGC writes in a very personal fashion. He throws in tid bits of his philosophies of theater (he was a professional scenic designer), he attacks the character and ability of peers, digging up what was probably a personal feud with a Professor Gehimrat. There are personal anecdotes and the whole thing is generally an enjoyable read. The prints included are some of my favorite illustrations and just from a purely historical interest give a good impression of his theatrical aesthetic.

I thought this is what the title meant. Instead I found a mishmash of scattered information, and some of it may not be particularly accurate. The whole thing just does not make much sense. You certainly do not get a profile of the Portuguese people. In a way this is a book that leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good first impression, then disappointment","review":"Something that made me buy this book was the large amount of websites. I was quite impressed. Unfortunately I found out later that the same web addresses appear in several chapters, they are much fewer than it looks at first, and some may not be active or only remotely relate to the topic in the chapter. Another disappointment was contradictory information. Not only the same web sites come around several times, but the same topics too, though under different headings. The information you get under one heading may not match what you get under another. It is so for example with Estado Novo. Portuguese history in general is rather confusedly presented anyway. I have since found another book I would recommend instead. It is a Penguin book by Marion Kaplan, The Portuguese, the Land and its People, published in 1998. I enjoyed reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gives you a strange picture of the people and the country","review":"I have been to Portugal several times and have friends there. When I showed this book to my Portuguese friends they were very critical. A lot of wrong information, bias, etc. Not being a national, there is much I don't know, but in some points I can easily see good reasons for my friends' disapproval. Just to mention one of them, there is a whole section of the book on things like witchcraft and related practices. It makes the Portuguese look rather superstitious and unpleasant. This is the opposite of what I have experienced. They are quite open minded and easy to relate to. I think this book gives the wrong picture of the Portuguese people, and not a very nice one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worryingly unprofessional","review":"If this book seeks to be entertaining, well, perhaps it is. If it seeks to inform, that is the main problem. It may be telling you tales that you may believe to be truths. Statements are attributed to individuals, but we do not know where the statement was copied from. Figures are given as statistical data, but we don't know where they come from. All this is rather unusual. It is normal practice to inform the reader of the source of your quotes. Not in this book. This is rather unprofessional, particularly where quotes give a negative picture of the country and its people, which is often the case. According to this book the number of Portuguese people who cannot read or write is over twice the official figure issued by the EU. I wonder whether the author got her figures from. It is worrying that this is not known. Very unprofessional. A book to be taken with great caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be read with caution","review":"This book amasses a lot of information from different sources, apparently more interested in capturing the reader's attention at any cost rather than in giving accurate information. Some statements are a challenge to the basic facts of Portuguese history and a challenge to the basic notions of history periods in general. There is no such thing as a \\"pre-historic Lusitania\\" as this book says. In level of mediocrity this book is comparable to Ian Robertson's A Traveller's History of Portugal, two books to be read (if at all) with a good deal of caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbingly inaccurate","review":"This book makes statements that may be just a personal view but are presented in a manner that may suggest they are confirmed facts. It is so with statements on education and status. History is given inaccurate coverage too. You may find some faulty statements about well known periods of Portuguese history like the discoveries in the 15th and 16th centuries and Salazar in the 20th century. Instead of this book I would like to recommend a more objective and informative work, Terry Payne's Portugal Matters, published by Education Matters. It covers geography, history, politics, culture, society and language. It also has interviews with Portuguese people coming from all walks of life"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit high priced, but....","review":"It's a bit high for a disc..but, if you're a fan of Peter Sellers...treat yourself..It's his last film and will probably be a cult classic, if not already.

You could get just as much information from reading the Javadocs!I'm an experienced Java programmer and originally purchased this book some time ago in hopes that it would cover GUI topics in depth.

Then the trigger operated switch failed; the machine kept running whether or not the trigger was pulled, and I assumed that it would eventually self destruct under those conditions.

The author's answer -- that there is too much bureaucracy and not enough entrepreneurship -- is given using coined jargon but the author is himself a creature of bureaucracy and that's the way it talks.But about half-way through, the book becomes a screed about what the author believes to be the West's foreign policy mistakes for the last 150 years.

The Subtitle, \\"Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good,\\" gives pause to anyone who thinks the answer to the poorer world's problems is to simply give it aid and watch it grow. Aid has been handled horribly, handled politically, handled with anything but care. Because of this, $2 trillion and five decades later, much of Africa remains in a rut of bad neighborhoods and badder outcomes.In today's climate of budget cuts in richer world nations worldwide, political liberals would probably rather this book go away, since it's tailor-made full of excuses for why foreign aid budgets can be cut.

I was crossing through Tanzanian immigration near Arusha. The Black Tanzanian immigration officer asked an older Austrian gentleman in front of me what his occupation was.

He correctly focuses on the aid community's penchant for big projects with no specific accountability vs. smaller, user-oriented ones. However, he seems obliged to maintain a veneer of \\"neutrality\\" by opposing military operations despite their proven success in cases like Japan and South Korea. He also over-uses statistics in questionable circumstances that make for heavy going and undermine his credibility. It's also a little pathetic that he has to make clear from little family vignettes that he is a vegetarian and imposes an artsy-fartsy lifestyle on his kids. Not a surprise that he's divorced.

The gun still leaks. I called the local repair shop since I needed the gun and was willing to pay for a repair but they said that it is real hard to get parts from Senco these days.

While this book is firmly based on Christian teachings, the author acknowledges wisdom from many cultures and disciplines, rejects easy formulas, and guides the reader through a complex maze of shock, anger, depression, to realistic hope. Recovery is a process, sometimes a long one. West does not point directions but walks hand-in-hand with the reader, as one who has been there and understands.This book is well-organized, artistically written, and in its depths are many nuggets of truth.

The coffeecake was composed almost entirely of streusel topping, which is always the best part anyway. And the scones were deliciously tender and uniquely flavored, like a treat from a gourmet coffeehouse. Based on these recipes alone the book was worth buying.My only problem was that both recipes make A LOT. The scone ingredients didn't fit in the food processor, for example, and had to be divided in half. I figure that the large yields are evidence of the recipes' restaurant beginnings.

A total of TWO recipes (out of 200, I'll remind you) required the Jelly. Furthermore, Ms. Foster calls for any kind of pepper Jelly, not just her own. I hope that the reviewer did not send back the book without even trying it out. It seems to me like it'll be a great investment (and based on other reviews, I'm guessing I'm right)."},{"rating":"1","title":"She ain't no Barefoot Contessa","review":"This book was very disappointing. The Spicy Gingerbread recipe was EXCELLENT. Everything else I've made out of here was just okay at best. Really not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cookbook I own (and I'm PICKY)!","review":"The criteria I set forth for an ideal cookbook is that the recipes must be relatively easy to make (but the food has to be outstanding), it has to be beautifully organized, and the ingredients must be easy to obtain. The magic touch of this cookbook is that it not only meets all of these criteria, but you can use it for weekly family cooking *and* for entertaining. The recipes are simple and affordable enough to work for nightly home cooking but tasty enough to feed guests for special occasions. What a star you are, Sara Foster, for sharing these lovely recipes with all of us! The Foster's Market Cookbook will be my number one gift for fellow home cooks and food lovers from now on and I'll continue to use it each week in my own home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Loeb's Callihroe","review":"This is a great edition of a frankly flat work. I've read several Hellenistic 'erotica,' and found this to be the dullest yet. However, I want to emphasize that Goold has done a great job of translating, introducing and editing this text. HIs thoughtful footnotes were especially appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't wear the band -the pulses were SO uncomfortable!","review":"Unfortunately I was never able to test this product to see if it worked on my car-sickness. I turned on the band to the lowest setting (#1) and the electrical pulses were so irritating and uncomfortable! It was so awful that I only wore the band for 10 seconds before having to turn it off. Who knows if the product would have worked?I suggest that if you are thinking about getting this item to try and find someone who already has it so that you can test their band and see if the electrical pulses are comfortable or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT DOESN'T WORK","review":"I wore the Reliefband while flying on a floatplane and lost my breakfast and didn't make it to lunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool belt","review":"I do all types of capentry and this tool belt is easily the best I have ever used for the price. With so many pockets you can hold all the fasteners you need and the nylon is extremely heavy duty. I can see myself using this tool belt for many, many years to come. The belt its self is padded and is comfortable to wear all day long, I only take it off for lunch. I can honestly say the only complaint I have about the belt is that there's no holder for a nail puller, but you can fit a small one in the largest pockets.UPDATE: It's been two years since I bought this belt. I wear it everyday and it still looks great. It has some fraying on the largest pockets where I put it down on the floor, but no holes or tears of any kind. The only thing bad is that I've had to buy a pair of suspenders because I put so much stuff in it that my hips would hurt at the end of the day. That would have happened no matter what tool belt I bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY THE BEST","review":"I believe there is no equal in the industry to the ridged unequaled brute strength of Dewalt products.

There are several illustrations of many of the common species including the colored plates. I used it several times while making a collection for an entomology class and was really glad I had it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of color makes this virtually useless","review":"Although this book certainly appears to be detailed and comprehensive, its lack of color photos (there's a single, small section) makes it less than useful. Want to identify that iridescent green bug? Good luck -- this won't help much. The Nat'l Audubon Society's book might be a better bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of good information","review":"I garden extensively and wanted to be able to identify insects on my plants. Unfortunately, there are too many insects to allow all or even most of them to be illustrated in one book. At best, this book will get you to genus. I could not even get to genus on most of them. It's not as useful as I had hoped. The illustrations that are shown are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"no phtoraphs","review":"I was disappointed. The guide, although complete in many respects, has only black and white drawings. Also there were little in terms of interesting details about the insects, items such as folksy stories or enjoyable tidbits of knowledge. It was more of a science book for classroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"In-depth is an insufficient description for this book.","review":"Most who use this book have the same general complaint -- no color. Color, however, can be one of the most useless characteristics in identifying insects (especially if there are multiple color morphs).Since this is not a guide which was designed to identify every insect species within a given range (which is impossible within the scope of a single tome), it does its job well...and that job is to help narrow the possibilities of identifications for each individual insect. There are specialist books for more specific (excuse the pun) identifications. This book may be used to point toward the specialist books necessary for correct identifications and should be used in that fashion.There is a lot to be learned from Richard E. White's book, and reading the book from cover to cover is recommended for every insectophile. That's why, in spite of the inability to correctly identify even every insect in my backyard, I give this book 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is valuable for both scientists and lay-people.","review":"There are few books that can carry the responsibility of identifying insects easily. This is one of them. More illustrations would be helpful as would more information, but the limits of a field guide size limit this. It's a sufficiently detailed book that field researchers can use it but not so scientific (read opaque) that naturalists can't use it. It would be a useful book for anyone who's identifying insects and has little formal training in entomology. It'd be nice if the authors covered arachnids, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware of the painful Adobe activation process","review":"Please see reviews of the previous version 7.0. The Adobe activation process can cause a lot of continuing problems for legitimate users of this software. Too bad such good software is hampered by such a process. Being in the software business, I don't mind companies worrying about piracy and taking some measures but this is a bit too much. You might need to allow the software to access the internet regularly to keep your activation (and not bother you with notices of reactivation) but that also means you open it for Adobe to do their push marketing into their software. I have used Adobe products for over 15 years and have always liked them. Too bad, they have lost the customer focus in their rage for software piracy and greed for intrusive marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably SLOW!!","review":"This is the worst software application that I have ever purchased. It takes an average of three seconds to page up or down and an average of one second per line when scrolling through a document. It is this slow regardless of the size of the document. It is not my computer, because version 7.0 worked perfectly. My computer has a 2.6GHz processor and 1Gbyte of memory. Don't believe their marketing propaganda which claims that they have improved the operating speed over the 7.0 version. Some are blaming the performance problems on their licensing processes that are constantly running in the background. If you don't need the added features in this product stick with the free PDF readers that are available on the Internet such as Foxit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Causes serious conflicts with other software applications","review":"I installed Adobe 8.0 at the request of a client in order to view secure docments on-line. Two serious problems were caused by this: 1) Window 2000 Outlook runing under XP would crash after the Adobe reader was launched. Closing the reader and restarting Outlook would not always fix the problem. Often the computer would require a cold re-boot.2). More serious, Adobe 8 installation corrupted my Agilent Technologies Genesys 8 and later (Eagleware) RF simulation software tools. This resulted in the Genesys simulator to fail to find the authentication file. Because the correlation between installing Adobe was not apparent considerable amount of time was lost on this project. Adobe also causes problems with OrCAD 15 license server.I have currently un-installed Adobe 8 had to re-install and patch previously installed Microsoft and enginnering software tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple, effective, but not overly powerful","review":"The product came shipped in original packaging and was easy to install. The product is invasive by nature-integrating itself into most microsoft programs. This is good if you like having constant access to the program, but bad if you want a program to use a minimal amount of computing resources (which is my inclination).The interface is intuitive and pretty easy to get used to. The program is not especially powerful, but has yet to entertain and gliches.Not worth it if all you need to do is print to PDF (for that, use a freebie PDF creator). But if you need to assemble PDF packages, work with the bookmarks and add security; this gig is for you. (though not very cheap)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adobe Acrobat 8.0 is SUPER SLOW","review":"My advice would be to not go to 8.0 as it is slower than anything I can ever remember. For a software so many people rely on you would think they would have noticed performance issues in development. The problem does not lie within my computer, I hear it from other people that have upgraded to 8.0 as well. I called Adobe about and they know of the slowness issue but for new users they will not give you a key to revert back to 7.0. If you can get 7.0 stick with it until they release an update. Adobe blew it big time with this one. I hope they release a fix soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adobe Support SUCKS!","review":"The product is pretty good IF you can get it to run on your vista machine. Just hope you dont have to talk with support, they will try to give you trial and error \\"solutions\\" and then get off the phone not even knowing if it works. I have now called back 4 times and have waited 30 minutes each with no resolution.Acrobat + vista= sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Donot buy it","review":"I use window vista and office 2007. The adobe 8 standard can be upgraded to 8.10 in order to create a PDF from office 2007. However I found that it is so unstable I can not use it every time. PDF is super but Adobe is not as good as its product.Office 2007 has a add in program to create PDFs but this program does not work well especially when I produce figures and save in word 2007. It case super problem when I convert the word file to PDF. So I wish Microsoft can do something for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Adobe","review":"Like many other Amazon customers, I too have had serious difficulty with Adobe Acrobat conflicting with other programs. In fact I phoned Adobe's corporate office seeking help in rectifying the issue only to be told that they we're unaware of Acrobat causing any issues with other software. Well, clearly this was a disingenuous response. Based on the sheer number of similar posts here, how could they not know about this problem?In Adobe's case, bigger doesn't mean better. But you certainly get what you pay for... a lot of headaches for the money. Until the powers that be at Adobe are willing to acknowledge the conflict issue, I strongly suggest you purchase another PDF creation tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely hated it","review":"the first reason why we bought this program is to basically make pdfs! It works fine after you install the product but after a week or something I could not make a pdf on a word document anymore. I had to reinstall everything for it to work. then after a week it would not create the pdfs again. I wish I bought the 7 instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Acrobat 8.0 Vista Ready","review":"The 7.0 was the pits for activation. And it doesn't work with the Vista at all. I contacted Adobe so many times to try to get the 7.0 to work and finally uninstalled it. I am hoping that the 8.0 will work with the Vista. Apparently Adobe website says they have a patch for it. I have used Acrobat for 7 years and love the product. Great for web work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Delicious...","review":"Read Or Die is a must watch for all anime fans. The anime contains beautiful animation, attractive character designs, and fluid action sequences! The main character Yomiko uses paper to battle villians in the most creative way you can imagine. It's hard to imagine how cool paper can look in battle, you just have to see it for yourself. The story unfurls at a fast pace and never lets up. For an action fan like myself it's a dream come true.

The continual re-use of images from the Mercedes museum, the third-grade stop-motion of images of cars on the track, the lack of footage of racing or production cars in motion, and the overly lengthy interviews with Mercedes-Benz staff w/ limited English all conspire to make the film almost unwatchable.

However, I did think that the final scene with the 3 women, right after Ochs leaves, was particularly touching. Vocally, the women are superb, particularly Stemme.

The problem sets, however, are not particularly useful, as they are neither directly applicable, as in a traditional math text, nor the kind of reflective questions the text would seem to support. The book also assumes a significant level of previous experience with statistical methods. The focus on psychology might be off putting but I do think it would be useful for any person in a behavioral science that uses empirical methods.I would not recommend this book for beginners, however those with some previous experience with statistical methods would find this book useful, if not exactly fun to read.

It either jammed, or froze up on me 7 out of 10 times I used it. In each case you have to take the gun apart, clean it out make sure everything is moving. I would not reccomend this particular gun to anyone, although when it does work it does the job its designed to do very well.Overall I liked the design and weight, and the fact that you can drive a 2\\" nail into very hard wood. the gun just is not reliable enough for everyday use.

It saved lots of rollout and rollup time on punchout. The next day it wouldent work, batteries were fully charged, fuel cell was nearly full. We only used a hundred or so nails the previous day. I cleaned the nailer per instructions, still it would not work. I returned it to the store where purchased and exchanged it for another nailer. This one works about 80% of the time, and i'm only getting around 500 nails per fuel cell. I love the paslode when it wants to work, but with the cost of the fuel cell and only 500 nails per fuel cell and the constant matinance, the time saved ends up costing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK!","review":"I bought this to do odd jobs around the house - I am not a pro. I have had it less than 6 months and used it twice before it stopped firing nails. Tried a new fuel cartridge. Still no go. After successfully using it for about 30 nails, 1 nail would fire for every 20 pulls of the trigger. Total - I have fired maybe 1 1/2 lines of nails - that's about 40 nails. Took it to one of Paslode's authorized service providers and 3 weeks later they say \\"it needs servicing which isn't covered by warranty.\\" Naturally! A $49 bill for a barely used tool!This gun is a BIG WASTE OF MONEY! IT'S AN OVERPRICED PIECE OF PLASTIC JUNK! Do NOT waste your money on this gun. I can not vouch for any other Paslode product, but based on how this one worked (or didn't) and the fact you can't return it to Paslode after so little use, I wouldn't buy any of their products again. I'll happily use my trusty hosed guns for anything I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misfires Constantly","review":"Received the 16 gauge angled finish nailer as a gift recently. Worked at first, then began to misfire with increasing frequency. Recharged batteries and new fuel cells don't help. Will have to take it to the service center soon, but from the other reviews I've read, I am not holding out much hope of a fix.I don't know the circumstances of folks who claim that their guns work, but Paslode is obviously seling a significant number of guns that don't work. It beats me why anyone would want to roll the dice on this device when a reliable alternative (i.e., pneumatic nail gun) is available. With such a high number of defective guns sold already, has there been a product liability class action of any sort initiated yet? This device is clearly not fit for its intended use."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Nailer","review":"I consider the PASLODE cordless 16 gauge angled finish nailer the perfect finish nailer.

I'm just a weekend warrior kind of guy and not a contractor so I don't use it that much, and I've still had problems with it during limited use. I love the freedom from a compressor but it comes at a price: reliability."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good.","review":"I have recently purchased this tool for professional carpentry applications. It has been used for a week, with no problems and not one single misfire. The battery fits snugly and tight, the fuel cell issues must be resolved,no problems. Very light tool, angle allows access to hard to reach places. The adjustable depth is an excellent addition to the original guns which did not have depth adjustment.I own the Paslode straight nailer and the 18 gauge nailer for trim and we have two Paslode framers.We also use pneumatic tools and trimmers and these Paslodes are not the best alternative for heavy production jobs. For an additon, a kitchen, or a room remodel they are perfect.I do not think homeowners or weekend warriors should spend the money, but if you like nice tools then the whole line of Paslodes are a super investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't spend a cent on this piece of junk","review":"I use the word nailgun loosely because it actually has to fire nails to qualify. I bought this gun brand new and right out of the box there were serious problems. Primarily with the fact that I have to depress the nose so many times to even get this thing to fire once.

The framing nailer is OK but the finish nailer is just awful. It only fires about 30% of the time and will just stop working. I then have to remove the nails, battery, and fuel cell; jiggle the wires to the controls and spark plug and then maybe just maybe it will fire a few more times.(I am at 5500' and am using the high altitude fuel jet but that doesn't make a difference.)From my experience I would not recommend this tool. I thought that the absence of a compressor hose would be a very good thing but when this nailer stranded me I had to go to my local rental store and rent a pneumatic nailer to finish my job. I found that dealing with a hose is not as big a hassle as I thought it would be. I will return this portable nailer and replace it with a pneumatic one and save about $250."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nailgun!!","review":"This is a great tool! I own three paslode cordless nailers, and they are all great!! The angled finish nailer is so much easier to get to tight places than the straight nailer.

I basically use it on punch list items and places where I couldn't bring a compressor with a hose.Note: Some of the other carpenters I work with prefer to use this gun rather than the nail gun with the hoses. It is a lot easier to carry around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nail Gun","review":"I bought this finish nailer on the recommendation of a friend as I was installing baseboards and crown molding and found that air compressor models could be cumbersome at times.

All of this takes place in Rio during 'Carnival' and we are shown how professionals work together to obtain the goal. A Playboy, A Safecracker, An Electronics Expert and A Military Enforcer work as the team.

He has a foolproof plan to steal a fortune in diamonds from a Rio bank vault during the Carnival. To reveal more would be to kill the suspense of the film. Suffice it to say that, like many Italian crime films of this period it carries a sting in the tail and leaves a bitter aftertaste.

Starting with a gentle introduction to both XML and XSLT, John quickly moves into incorporating SQL Server 2000 into web applications, including discussion on Virtual Directories, executing SQL via HTTP, and Forms based queries. He then moves onto advanced topics like XDR Schemas and XPath, before concluding with chapters on FOR XML and OPEN XML, which are both important Microsoft extensions to SQL that are explicitly designed to improve the performance of SQL Server 2000 with XML.One of the only disappointments I had with this book was the neglect of Web Services, which I would expect would be a major reason for using XML with SQL Server 2000.

The calf skin leather is very soft and I really like that the bible came with a velvet cover to help protect it. The wording is nice and large, about 12 point font which makes it easy to read. I also like the single column format. It actually made some of the longer verses easier to understand and it was much more like reading a book so my eye follows easily. The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars was that the words of Jesus aren't in red. Other than that I'm completely satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"This Bible is made in China and it shows. Don't buy it, get the In Touch Min NASB as it's still made in the USA. I am so disappointed with this bible; the page layout is the best of any bible.

I am returning this one, as I have returned others from various sources. Foundation Publications really messed up when they outsourced printing of this wonderful bible to China in 2006. Even though you may do your due diligence and call the supplier prior to ordering, the supplier will always tell you it is a 2002 printing, because they did not change the ISBN when they started printing in China. I would not pay $20 for the Chinese version. It truly is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEIR WORST LIVE ALBUM","review":"if you want to hear a good O.A.R. live album, go buy Any Time Now.....34th and 8th is pretty good also.This isn't worth owning in comparison to Any Time Now.....honestly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band, outstanding performance","review":"I've been a fan of Dave Matthews' infectious live energy for over a decade and have always wondered if any band could compete with DMB for title of best live band. OAR is that band. If you're only loosely familiar with them through their recent radio releases like Love & Memories, Hey Girl, and Heard the World, you're in for a very pleasant surprise. Taking nothing away from the album versions of those songs, they are considerably better live.This version of Crazy Game of Poker is unbelievable and will have you singing along & dancing in your chair for all 17 minutes. It's worth the price of the album just for that song. Other favorites include About Mr. Brown, Anyway, Lay Down, and of course, the concert closer City on Down.Buy this album, you won't be disappointed. After you've heard how great they are in concert, you'll be yearning to see them live yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite CDs!!","review":"OAR is phenomenal.

From what I can hear he does a fine job. However the sound quality is so poor as to seriously detract from the enjoyment of the music. It has that tinny, scratchy sound that you associate with a well-worn 78 rpm record. In the quiet passages you can hear a rumbling that sounds like a motor running in the background.

On top of that all the 3rd party software is over $30. Might want to consider just saving your $10 and put it towards a phone that you know will link up to your computer.

First, they explain branding and give many good examples of successful campaigns. Then, they introduce a series of assessment tests to help you determine your strengths and passions and how these fit in with your personal brand.

A month later, the batteries that came with it died, and I replaced them but it wouldn't work again. My 30 day return period with the store had expired, so I had to return it to the manufacturer (at my expense for shipping and they said they would do it this one time only because they recently changed from having a lifetime warranty to only 90 days and that is through the retailer).

We're a month past Christmas, and she is still consulting this book regularly, drawing pictures of the various animals shown in full-color, and learning so many facts that she's becoming a walking encyclopedia herself.

There are pictures and snippets of info on so many animals he has never been bored with it. Rather than just identifying an animal as a shark, bear or fish etc, he loves identifying the different types of each animal. He loves for someone to read it to him, but he also simply enjoys just lying on the floor with it looking at the pictures. Even though it is a very large book, as a small 2 1/2yo he could still get it off the shelf and look at it himself if he wanted. It is very sturdy so it is still in great shape after MANY readings. We had been considering buying this new from National Geographic at a $40 advertised price so were amazed to find it USED for about $5. So well worth the $5, but seeing how much he loves it and how much he has learned from it already, I think even if we had paid $40, we would have thought it worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lexmark E238 Compatible Toner Cartridge","review":"\\"Item received before date promised.

We use it in the ocean but not for long distances or very far from the shore. Our friends have the same model and recommended it highly.My only complaints would be that it doesn't come with it's own storage bag, which seems to be essential and would keep it safer and help prevent damage. Also, the internal air chambers in the side can twist a bit, but with a little work they can be straightened out before it's fully inflated. At a little over 36 lbs, it might be a bit heavy but still easier than trying to store and transport a hard kayak, so this is perfect for our family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid enough for a dog, light enough for two old people to carry.","review":"After pulling out our backs multiple times loading and unloading our Pelican, we decided enough was enough.

I do charge it using the AC adapter instead of the car charger when I get home so I clip/un-clip the Aura every day.It has a nicely hidden visor \\"clip\\" built into the base that disappears when not in use. The hold on the visor is a bit light, but seems to hold on the visor OK.As for sound quality, I've asked people I called \\"Can you hear me now?\\" and the answer is always yes and my car isn't the quietest. The microphone and speaker are certainly loud enough.I rate it five stars because, as a Bluetooth device, it has worked for me without fail so far. Sound quality and volume are great. Ease of use is great. I do like that it comes with all of the plugs and cables and that I can use it as a speakerphone if I needed to."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may not work with your phone.","review":"I just sent my second back to Amazon.

I initally was able to pair it with my Nokia, but when I tried subsequently to use it my phone signaled it could not connect with the device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs work","review":"I purchased the Spracht AURA hands free speakerphone 12 months ago. The unit was rather large but had great speakers and good voice pick up. A plus for a noisy carThe style is very dated and the battery life is horrible. I am in my car most of the day and averaged about 6 hours per battery charge in standby mode and much less if I am actively using it. I have since purchased a different brand due to the extremely short battery life. If you can keep it plugged into your charger, it is a great speakerphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The mouse that roared","review":"I bought this primarily because of OTHER good reviews on it.

The speaker part is actually pretty good. The mike part is not nearly as good. I constantly get an echo and have people tell me the quality, while not horrible, is not even as good as the built in mike. There is a solution to the echo that works somewhat (see directions), but its annoying and has to be done seemingly each call, I just want to set the speaker and forget it.It does synch up with my blackberry fine, seems ok, better than the blackberry speaker (which is not saying much). Overall, I really was going to send it back, but time just slipped away and now I own it. Its ok for just listening to those 2 hour conf calls, so that is what I use it for. Never tried it in the car, not really interested in that so know nothing about sound quality or batter life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice unit... works well","review":"Was at a big construction meeting with at least 15 people and the polycom unit was not working.

And, I must admit I am satisfied.The movie has a somewhat disparate plot, interspersed with unnecessary \\"vogue\\" displays, but they do attempt to tie it together. The women are very attractive, especially the supporting characters, and I didn't see as much blatant use of implants as I had expected, which was good. The exotic scenes could have been a little more \\"aggressive\\" or hard core, especially with the \\"orgasmatron\\". Still, there are some nice softcore domination scenes, my favorite being the slave spanking.So, if you would like a softcore sci-fi/dominatrix movie with plenty of attractive women, this is it! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY SOMETHING ELSE!","review":"This movie was a major disappointment. The plot is awful. The dialogue stinks. The camera-work is amateurish, even by b-movie sleaze standards. It's poorly lit. The acting is terrible, and most of the actresses are in fact ugly slags. There is a lot of nudity, but don't expect to be aroused by it. The people who made this did not put much effort into it at all and it shows. I guess they figured that nudity + perversion was a big enough selling point, and that they could lazily toss the rest of the movie together in a slapdash manner. Unfortunately, this movie does not even excel on the nudity and perversion front, except for perhaps the odd fellow who has a thing for trannies. In other words, this movie has no redeeming value, and even the onanist should look elsewhere. For something in a similar vein and from the same era, but that is actually enjoyable, I'd recommend something from the Something Weird catalogue instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Jess Done Tanked With This One","review":"I have the uncut Euro version of 99 Women and have seen Barbed Wire Dolls, and this is his worst women in prison film.

After one of the captive girls dies:\\"This is terrible.

It was VERY easy. Melt the chocolate pour it in the mold and let it set up in the freezer. I thin popper out the finished chocolate and all but 2 pieces were perfect. Two of the pieces had air bubbles. The second batch I put the chocolate in the mold and then tapped it on the counter to remove the bubbles and that worked perfect. Then, while the chocolate was still hot I took the first pieces and sat them on top of the freshly poured hot chocolate. When that batch cooled I popped them out of the mold, trimmed the edges and they looked PERFECT. Made a batch of white chocolate pieces and a batch of red chocolate pieces and then used a red Pawn and the white Queen on a twilight themed cake for my daughters 7th birthday. She LOVED it and the guests enjoyed the rest of the chocolate chess pieces...had a couple people ask me to make them a set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy.","review":"Received in a timely manner, that's the only true positive thing.

Personally, I think it's a very good overview for someone who's starting their exploration of the \\"Dark Age\\" period in the island's history and does an excellent job dispelling myths about post-Roman Britain. It's a quick and easy read, and a good way to get a better understanding of what we know (and what we don't know) about the AS period. Think of it as a transition between the \\"one chapter\\" you'll get in most history books or mass-market publications and the scholarly (and sometimes mind-numbingly dry) tomes you can find gathering dust on a lot of library shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as versatile as a cordless vacuum!","review":"I wanted to like this product. I looked forward to its arrival. The day it came, I unpacked it and raced to sweep my kitchen. Unfortunately, I was let down from the very first sweep. Whether on \\"auto\\" or \\"manual\\" setting, I have to almost knock the front of the unit with my broom to get it to turn on. Once on, the suction lasts 5 seconds during which I have to furiously try sweeping the debris in. Even then, it does not get it all.I suppose if I had back problems this might be a true boon -- until it came time to clean the unit, that is. In the meantime, I've reverted to using my broom and my cordless vacuum to accomplish the same thing... and I gave this unit to a friend who hasn't shelled out for her own cordless vacuum yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dig....we miss you!","review":"What a band!

I was stoked with their second album release, 'Magenta Manta Love Tree', and wondered could the band get any better?. Got to see them in concert in Euless, TX and they put on an awesome show! When I bought Ascension 7 (their live album from the Cornerstone concert) and got to the end of the album, I knew they were not going to be around much longer. The recording of the live album was not the best, but it doesn't make me enjoy the music any less. If you want a smattering of some of their greatest work, get this record! The first track is a wonderful, rockin' praise song; track 5 (my favorite) makes you wish you were in a mosh pit; track 6 is a great ballad - this live recording didn't do it justice! 4 stars given only because the recording wasn't the greatest.Oh, DigHayZoose, where art thou?

After reading it I have to say that the book is somewhat dissapointing. There is nothing in this book that most do not already know. It is not that the author's points are not good, but rather that many of the same points are repeated over and over again.

They are very well made, very thick rubber and they have the BMW logo outlined in the middle. They are great because you can wash them easily to get any dirt off, and the material is ribbed so the dirt or debris gets trapped in between the lines, instead of your shoes.They can be fastened by the bottom corners so they don't slip and move around. All in all, a great buy. My only complaint is that my car's interior is beige, just like in the picture, so I ordered the floor mats in the beige color. However, the ones that came had a \\"brown\\" label, and the actual color is more of a taupe or a darker greyish beige.

Three of the largest flat bladed ones have bolsters right below the handles where you can also use a wrench to get even more torque.

The parts of Big Ben and Principal Peabody are hilarious no matter how many times I watch the movie, along with Dolly, Madison, Mr. Thorne, La Wanda and Smith. This movie isn't funny for the reasons it's supposed to be... I find Little Ben, Junior and Trixie some of the most unfunny characters in the whole thing, and their parts are boring but are supplemented by the more funny supporting characters. Not to mention the 50's sci-fi reminiscent special effects. Anyway, this may not be funny the first time you watch it but keep watching it repeatedly and it gets funnier every time!

It had a few small moments of being actually funny, but in general it was a poor, silly, and not very funny movie. A large part of the plot rests on the viewer's compassion for the two main children in the movie, and neither were anything but completely annoying. I enjoy slapstick comedy, but this was a failure. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Its only possible merit is John Ritter, who gives a mediocre, but not awful, performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute WORST MOVIE of all time!","review":"\\"Problem Child 2\\" is also one of the worst sequels of all time. Thank God John Ritter's almost disappeared from the movies, since he himself was probably tramatized by being in this junk. Michael Oliver as Junior Healy is one of the most repellent kids I've ever seen in the movies, but that was pretty much intentional for his character. However, the little girl in this movie, Trixie, is much, much worse. This is the only little girl I've seen in a movie that I wish had died a horrible, painful death! Both the \\"Problem Child\\" and \\"Home Alone\\" series are so-called children's comedies that never should have spawned endless sequels and clones, or even be released to the public, for that matter. They're crass, exploitative cinema designed for children who are \\"BAD TO THE BONE.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My Own Problem Child Loves This Movie","review":"Bought this movie for my seven year old boy.

What I found to be the most useful was simply the player's ability to read virtually any CD format: from regular manufactured CDs to MP3 burns. I've found that CD players that have difficulty reading the data stamped on the disc seem to be \\"cheap\\" somehow. The speakers of the unit are another great attribute. They fill the room nicely and provide the listener with a good range of sound. The bass boost is excellent and the surround speakers are also a lot of fun. Finally, the dual tape deck came in handy even though tapes are obsolete nowadays. Its fun to record songs off the radio and the cassete/recording playback certainly meets my standards. To sum it up, this is an ideal system for the casual music fan who just wants to hear good, quality sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good system...just disappointed we have to get a new speaker","review":"This stereo system is great and my daughter loves it.

I find this a strength. Already fairly familiar with Descartes I found this book to cover a broad scope of theories related to Descartes'. Admittedly there are points where depth could be needed. I think though that the people that complain about depth, are the same people who need to be spoon-fed how to think. I found that the work, made me ponder about some of the issues put forth by it. So if you want to be spoon-fed opinion, and then consider yourself an \\"intellectual.\\" Then by all means avoid this book, and find something more detailed. However if you feel you are capable of deeper INDEPENDANT thought, but simply need a starting point, this is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immensely Disappointing","review":"I fail to understand the purpose of this book. My intent for this purchase was to get an introduction to Descarte's philosophy. To my utter disappointment, i found this book lacking any materials to this regards.

I have had them for over a year, and I liked them so much that I got my Dad a pair. Unfortunately, his broke immediately. I wasn't sure what happened, but the image was misaligned, so you couldn't focus on anything. I assumed it was a fluke. He sent them back under warranty and they sent him a new pair (for a fee, not sure what it was).Turns out it wasn't a fluke. I dropped these about about 2.5 feet in the case recently. I didn't think it was a big deal, although I never want to drop a precision instrument like these. I look through them, and they are misaligned. My conclusion is that these things are just not durable.

Really a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product!","review":"The cutter comes with no useful instructions about inserting or removing blades. Trying for 15 minutes, I could not make the seemingly helpful instructions provided by an Amazon reviewer work; the blade wouldn't fit in, and eventually I stopped, afraid I'd cut myself on the very sharp blade, fooling with it. This a dangerous tool, and it should be avoided. I have returned my cutter to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade Change Can Be A Problem","review":"The instructions provided by other reviewers are correct as far as loading and unloading a blade. Mine seemed to work just fine for the first few months after I purchased it.For some reason, the blade change is no longer such a cinch. Taking the blade out is usually no problem. However, the blade often is difficult to install, even with the \\"slider button\\" pushed all the way forward and down and while pushing the blade release (yellow button) fully. This is unfortunate, since the knife is otherwise solid. The angle or contour of the handle is just right, it fits comfortably in the hand, and you can get a strong grip on the handle.I have been generally pleased with Stanley hand tools and will continue to purchase them. However, this one did not perform as advertised, at least not for me, and so I recommend that you avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have utility knife","review":"I concur the instructions sucks....had the utility knife for about 2 yrs and could not figure out how to use it so I stuck it in my tool box.

Before I go further I just want to state I have thoroughly read the instructions. You have to press the blade lever all the way forward. Well, mine would not go all the way forward. So I went in and manually pushed the plastic retaining piece to the left side in order for the lever to go all the way forward. Now I pressed the yellow button and tried to insert a blade. Now the problem is it will only go half-way in no matter how hard I press the yellow button. The blade of course won't retain. Pressing hard on the blade to insert could have resulted in me having a deep cut. I gave up and am returning the product. This is a horrible product and if this represents Stanley tools now it will be the last tool I ever buy from their company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daily carry for four years","review":"Pros:Quick blade changeRunning a blade out to \\"change\\" extension gives a deeper cut (great for 1\\" ISO board, 1\\" shaftliner board, etc).The slight angle to the handle is a more natural scoring position (works great for Type C wallboard where multiple scores might be necessary).Cons:The first time you drop it, the bottom black plastic blade storage will break somehow. Mine just cracked, so it's still usable. My buddy's broke the push button - result, he duct taped around the whole thing. Meaning his no longer has onboard blade storage.After a few years of grit from daily use, the deployment button will stick. Often I have to push down with my thumb on it while physically pushing the tip of the blade against a solid object (nearby i-beam, cut table board, etc) to get it to re-sheath.All in all, I have yet to find a better retractable knife. And as much as I like the fixed blade knives, I'm not a big fan of being covered in curad products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so 'instant'","review":"While the tips presented by other reviewers work, at times, I still believe the instant change feature is not reliable enough. I've been frustrated too many times, because the blade won't come out easily. Then, when I try to change the blade like any other utility knife (by opening it up), I get even more frustrated because the two halves of the knife do not easily come apart. The knife wasn't designed to be opened, because it has the 'instant' change feature. When the instant change feature works, it's great; it just doesn't work 100% of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Design, Horrible Execution","review":"The instructions given above would work if the sliding button would stay locked in place. When the blade is inserted with the yellow button completely pushed in, the blade still forces the slider back and unlocks it. The blade will then not insert any farther. This is a horrible tool and no one should purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"Thanks, Eric for the step-by-step instructions. I threw out my knife's packaging ages ago and had to search the web for tips on how to do the blade exchange. Even now, I'd say if you want a good utility knife, keep looking. The blade release button is hard to push, there's no way to know if it's been pushed in far enough, and the blade is still reluctant to come out/go in. Back to the drawing board Stanley!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawsuit waiting to happen ...","review":"Although, some reviews are raving about this product, I have to respectfully disagree.

Neither would take the blade and hold it securely in place. Now I know why there was another knife in the display that looked like it too had been returned. If you buy this product, save the packaging and receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade removal feature awkward, then failed.","review":"Even before it failed, it was inconvenient to use, as removing the spare blade took one compartment opening and replacing the in-use blade took another step. Both involved plastic parts that were difficult to use and prone to failure.Pressing the yellow button no longer releases the blade on mine. Blade removal was always quirky, taking multiple attempts, and finally, the blade cannot be removed no matter what. I think the yellow blade removal depressor is made from an inferior plastic that is not up to the job.I took it back for a replacement, but the second one was not much better.It replaced it with a Kobalt 50074 from Lowes. It is all metal construction and sliding one button opens the whole knife for blade change and access to the spare blades. It also fits my hand much better, and does not threaten blisters after a whole day of using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful design","review":"I finally threw mine in the garbage yesterday, I didn't even consider selling it on a garage sale. It is the worst utility knife design I've ever had,,, and I go back to the old style with the screw in the middle to remove for blade changes.

On paper, a good product. But hard to load the blade. Despite a few tutorials online. Won't offer suggestions on how to, since don't think I was really successful. The blade kept sliding out.And frankly, a bit dangerous design. The storage for extra blades pops out and the blades inside jump around. Imagine if they fly out into your face. Secondly, the blade is such an effort to load while pinching the blade, that I kept thinking, I might cut myself up at some point.Bought at HD and cost me about $9 plus taxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst utility knife I've ever used.","review":"This knife is cheaply made and clunky. The process to change blades is annoying and the directions are vague at best. You must push the lever all the way forward, which will unlock the button, which you hold down to insert the blade. This is difficult because this knife is so clunky and difficult to operate. There is a little slot under it for snagging on insulation when cutting it. I don't know how you could design a utility knife worse than this one. zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the sharpest blade in the tool chest","review":"It has all been said,but another vote on the POC side.

My only misgiving of the tool is that it is not exactly \\"instant change\\" as the title might indicate. You retrieve a spare blade from a swing down compartment below the knife, then put it through the front opening while pressing down on a button. It is an improvement over the \\"unscrew the body\\" method but I still find myself fumbling with the blade. Nonetheless, a fine utility knife for any shop.

However in truth there isn't much authoring going on here. This book is more like a collection of pieces by other folk.

At any rate, the content is about the same and I've had more success with the exercises in the older edition than the students with the newer one."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic ski porn","review":"Really good segments.

Deserving a higher rating for its historical content, it nonetheless is flawed by the narrative's lack of cohesion.

The characters are so unsympathetic that I had a hard time caring what happened to them. They lead very dreary lives (yes, even the Crusades are dreary in this novel) and they seem almost completely unable to communicate with each other. It is almost unheard of for me to leave a book unfinished -- even if the book is bad, I usually feel compelled to find out what happens -- but I quit this 491 page book on page 227. I tried, I really did, but I was unable to maintain any interest in these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot choro . .","review":"More great tunes from Da Velha and Pontes . . self-styled as the world's smallest big band.

The recording manages to follow strictly what modern musicology has found about performance in Bach's times, all done with deep musicality and true mastery of the harpsichord. Here we hear Bach as he is likely to have played for himself, with discrete rubato, consistent yet varied use of different types of articulation, excellent rendering of ornamentation, well choosen registration. A must for most harpsichordists, including professional ones.Claudio Di VeroliBray, Ireland[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony does not stand behind this product","review":"I speny just under 8,000 USD for my KDF70XBR950 in August 05 and it recently started showing a blue squiggely line in the center - bottom of the tv. I had a repair tech come out and he told it had a bad optical assy and that I should contact Sony as there was a known issue with this part. I contacted Sony and they claim that while there is a known issue that \\"my particular issue\\" wasn't the specific issue covered by the extended warranty. Bottom line is they want $1,400 to repair it. So I am stuck with a peice of junk KDF70XBR950 that I paid more for then my car and Sony refuese to stand behind it. Buyers beware - Sony does not stand behind their products.

So there are not many design patterns and applications for you.However you can solve this problem by going to check out the on-line source codes.There are couple bugs inside this book.But that did bother me much,if you have experiences on programming you can fingure it out.That is why I substraced one star on the scale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This book is very well layed out.

Granted, this is an exhaustive reference covering objects, properties, event handlers, methods and functions. However, the examples have absolutely no context to them at all. Further, I found inaccuracies about which objects are supported in which browsers (e.g. indicates that navigator.plugins is supported in IE and this is false). This means that this boos is useful purely as a reference, where you know EXACTLY what it is that you want to do, EXACTLY what method you are looking for to do something, that you need no illustrative application examples, and also that you are very experienced in browser compatibility issues. Personally, I feel the O'Reilly definitive guide is far better, both as a reference and as guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad, if it were released in 94....but....","review":"Hi there, I had a lot of hardcore JS todo, that broke browsers, and hella stuff like, crossbrowser dhtml etc. and needed a quick reference. I'd say if you're a hardcore commercial js/dhtml programmer this book is not for you. as a reference if you're starting out and need a quick what does this do type of thing i'd use yeah. but as a hardcore concise reference stay well away.part of this has to do with the way it was organised, with very little cross-referencing (which when doing cross browser is very important). more-over, <div> and handlers were very poorly documented, with netscvape <div> documentation almost non-existance.let's hope the second version proves to be more of a concise reference then this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and Complete","review":"This was exactly what I was looking for in a JavaScript book. The first two sections, which explain the language, are concise and simple, and do not waste time with rudimentary things that programmers like myself already know (i.e. what is an array, etc). The third section is a full reference to every command in the JavaScript language, with code and syntax examples for each. If you are already a programmer (in any language, but particularly a C++ or C programmer), this is probably the best book on the subject to get on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"First if you have not gotten the impression from the other reviews by now, this book is NOT for the beginner. As a beginner you will not learn how to use JavaScript from this book. It IS an extensive reference on everything about JavaScript. If you need to know if your code will work with certain browsers or what a specific object or syntax does, this is the book for you! This book very well cross referenced and laid out nicely, it is easy to find what you are looking for when you need it and that saves a ton of time.Pure JavaScript is exactly what I was hoping for: THE reference book on JavaScript!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A much needed reference","review":"I bought this book in Oct 2001 and have been using it because I needed a reference for JavaScript; by the way, this book comes a CD and you can search the CD for info if you don't like thumbing through the 1600 pages. Har, the older version died after two months of daily reference, so thus the rating for the 4 stars because I feel that that the binding for the new book should feel more robust. Hmmm... only time will tell. On the whole this is a needed reference which has some more info on server side scripting. It covers JavaScript 1.6, but if I'm not wrong the most people who are not into IT or web programming use Netscape 4.7 or IE 4.01 still. JS(1.2 or 1.3). Rest assured, it is a concise reference, if you need one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broad but not deep. Disappointing experience","review":"The first 162 pages is what the authors have come up with themselves (of low quality), the rest they seem to have borrowed from various sites on the internet. You will be much better off both with respect to 'finding the right info fast' and 'value added knowledge' (i.e. knowledge other than reference knowledge) elsewhere.I ,as an experienced software engineer, found this book much to broad and superficial, it lacked real (deep) knowledge.It also lacks context, good thorough examples and humor, but it has attributes like: brick shaped, heavy and expensive, so maybe you still can find it useful in certain situations...be warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference","review":"This is the best javascript reference book I've seen. I haven't been able to find a better reference in print or on-line. This isn't a wordy how-to instructional book, so it's probably not for novice programmers. If you understand the basics of programming and objects you should be good-to-go with this book. Great reference for cross-browser compatibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book you need for JavaScript programming","review":"For both experienced and unexperienced users, this book will provide a great deal of help. It has it all. Examples, definitions, and lots and lots of code samples.

Typical of the quality of a SAMS book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Javascript \\"Handbook\\"","review":"This is a handbook or desk reference for developers who already know JavaScript. As such, if you're a developer who regularly (or occasionally) uses JavaScript for client-side and server-side scripting, this book is for you. I've yet to find a better reference for reminding myself of syntax; researching some of the more esoteric objects; and determining which functionality is applicable to a given browser version. What other JavaScript book has 2+ pages on \\"try-catch\\" with cogent example code? I finally ordered my own copy yesterday after dog-earring my co-worker's copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for those experienced in JavaScript","review":"For those who have experience in JavaScript, I would definately recommend this book. It is important to note, however, that this book is EXTREMELY CODE-INTENSIVE. This is the equivilant of an unabridged dictionary; definitions of every word (code and method) with examples and other information. This book can be an extremely powerful tool to the experienced JavaScript programmer, but those with little or no programming experience, or those wanting complex examples, should NOT consider it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Refernce Book","review":"This is an excellent reference book.

In Japan this tragic event happens during schooltime, so when the girls come back to life as cute-looking but flesh-hungry zombies, they go around in those (to me) sexy uniforms killing and eating people. Since this is a situation most people under 15 and above 17 are not satisfied, the government has founded a special section to deal with the problem.HOT ASIAN ZOMBIE CHICKS! I liked this movie. Although the only problem I had with this film is there is too much lovey dovey rubbish and can get irritating. But what do you expect, it's a Japanese film. The story is desent, the gore is nice, and the chicks in this movie are all hella fine. Get this if you can find it. (lots of zombies)most entertaining part: | the gory stuff! |"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shot on tape","review":"What a weird film.Lots of gore. It reminded me of Re-animator at times, Japanese style. Maybe if it was made on a more serious note rather than such a campy style, it might make a good movie.The fact that it was shot on tape didn't help it one bit either. I hate that.And the theme... something must have definitely been lost in translation because I did not understand the point of this movie at all.You take your chances on this one. I can't recommended it but neither can I trash it. Zombies. Japanese schoolgirls. Lots of blood and gore. Did I mention shot on tape?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it Zero stars if possible","review":"I am an avid horror movie fan. I also love dark comedies and this was by far the worst movie i have ever seen. Each copy of this movie should be burned in a fire before it's mindnumbing LACK of plot, acting talent, and gore spread to more movie fans. In theory the story itself sounds extremely promising, however this is a movie that i could not turn away from while watching because i just kept assuming, \\"it has to get better at some point right?\\". Wrong. The acting is absolutely horrendous. The gore is really not nearly as gorey as others on here would lead you to believe. And the general underlying premise of love in the story is far too care bear and cotton candy campy for any actual person to believe. If you have any theatre background or appreciation of fine arts at all, watching this movie all the way through will only prove that you have masocistic tendencies towards your own intelligence. Save yourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"B Movie with some laughs","review":"The description is real good, but when you start to watch the movie, you realize it's a B-Movie with some American influence (Bruce Campbell and Drew Barrymore).

In fact the acting was so bad I found it annoying. There are a few (and let me emphasize few) mildly interesting gore scenes, but I was really put off with the attempts of comedy, which I thought added to the overall feeling 'why on earth am I watching this terrible movie'....I bought this DVD for $5.00 at a used bin.

It was THAT BAD I could not stand the thought of watching it again.Sooo if you want to believe the good reviews, go for it but you have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"In all honesty...","review":"This film is a guilty pleasure if there ever was one. It ranks right up there with ABBA Gold in terms of guilty pleasures. While not the best movie ever made it does have some strong points. Frankly it could have been an honestly moving and heart-wrenching film had it not been so badly acted and silly. From what I understand the movie \\"Stacy\\" has nothing to do with the book on which it is based except that girls are dying and returning from the dead to consume human flesh. Go ahead and lay down some bucks for this film and try to be open minded while watching it. Hey, its better than that crap from French film maker Jean Rollin."},{"rating":"1","title":"T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E","review":"I don't know what was going through my head when I paid forty dollars for this at HMV. Reviews I read made it seem somewhat okay, but no, no it's just terrible. From the moment I pressed play I was dissapointed. The Camera quality was awful, acting awful, gore effects...incredibly awful. Seriously, this looked like it was done by a bunch of film students who don't have any knowledge of effective film making, and think that if they use American icons they can win people over, hence the \\"Bruce Campbell's right arm 2\\" chainsaw they advertise in the film. This is probably the worst thing I've ever bought, luckily I talked my way into trading it for The Fresh Prince season one, which is one laugh after another, oh what a crazy mismatch!

Pay attention to the title that says teach yourself Russian CULTURE and HISTORY because it has nothing to do with teaching yourself Russian or Ukrainian. The book basically begins with an encyclopedia article on Ivan the Terrible and ends with an encyclopedia article on Boris Yeltsin.

It is a total waste of your money if you have seen these episodes before. It is 2 episodes, each for 55 minutes they RE-BROADCAST the episode and then for the last 5 minutes give you a bonus addition where they tell you whether or not they homeowners kept it or not and what it looks like now.

We'd never seen Trading Spaces, but I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. Surely the extremely negative reactions that the cover blurb seemed to promise would provide us with the best encapsulation of the appeal of this show, right? WRONG. Nobody bursts into tears, nobody retches and runs from the room with their hand over their mouth, nobody threatens to firebomb their neighbors' homes in retaliation, nobody clenches their fists, throws back their head and bellows \\"WHYYYYYYYYY?!?\\" to an aloof and uncaring deity. In fact, pretty much every reaction is along the lines of, \\"Oh. Well. Maybe I'll get used to it...\\" If you love the idea of watching someone else's boring tract home being redecorated in order to view the homeowners' stoic, listless demeanors upon viewing the finished product, by all means, proceed.

I sat thru 3 hours of the entire repeated episodes just to see a few minutes of the bonus footage. It was a waste of my time and I wouldn't recommend anyone to waste they're money on this dvd. Just watch trading spaces daily, they show enough reruns that your bound to see it again for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough train wrecks","review":"One of my favorite things about the early Trading Spaces, is how the expert designers would completely ignore the requests of the decoratees. (Please keep the carpet, it is only a year old. The decorator, \\"The carpet must go.\\") I hoped to see more of those in clips, like a highlights reel. This was not the case. This is just two episodes, although the second one when the woman is crying off camera after she just needs to be alone for a minute in the reveal made this CD worthwhile. I don't mean to sound uncharitable, but in the great scheme of life, bad interiordecoration is not a tragedy of overwhelming proportions, and it is part of the risk that makes the program enjoyable.

I am repeatedly blown away by her amazing voice. I pre-ordered the CD so it was waiting in the mail for me last Tuesday (release day July 31) and have listened to it at least 10 times a day since then.

(However I didn't expect her to go as soon as she did)What threw me about the CD was that it was CCM and not Gospel. While I do like CCM, the songs kinda bored me at first. As the CD started to grow on me I found myself really enjoying \\"God Speaking\\", \\"Love Somebody\\", \\"Unrestrained\\", \\"(Never Gonna) Steal My Joy\\", and \\"Oh My Lord\\". Her version of \\"Shackles (Praise You)\\" never grew on me, though. Lol!If you're into pop sounding CCM you may really like this CD.

It's not quite as quiet as I thought it would be, I'll have to get a sound leve meter to measure, maybe mine is noiser than normal.The verticle design is nice because it makes for efficient use of your shop space taking up less room than horizontal models. Overall it seems well built and I'm quite satisfied with the design and construction.

Meaning, unless you are going to remember 100 different lists, there is nothing for you here. It's how I would write a book if a Vulcan were to digest it, without the requirement for inspiration, proof or illustration.This book is devoid of insight. The style is \\"Coach like this, by doing 1,2,3,4,5 because of A,B,C and D\\" over and over and over. Really, it's book of lists. I would much sooner tell people to consciously consider themselves a coach, remind them so, and follow that pattern before handing this book to anyone.I guess I was expecting so much with all the 5 star ratings it had.

These are the bioidentical estradiol and progesterone described in Suzanne's book, but in predetermined doses (find more info and target levels in my book).

This new book relies strongly (90%+) on dialogue between a man and a woman in which much of the man's \\"contributions\\" to their conversations seem to come from being quite distracted, he's always asking \\"what\\", \\"huh\\" or making off the wall and ludicrous assumptions. She patiently puts up with his conversational lack of focus. He's certainly not very sympathetic in that he is an assassin for hire. He's clever but I can't imagine any situation (regardless of what I thought he did for a living) in which I'd want to spend time with him. There are other fictional assassins who are much more interesting as individuals. The premise of the story about competition in the assassin business certainly can't be taken very seriously.

I was terribly disappointed. I kept reading this book on the hopes it would get better, and by the time I realized it wouldn't, I figured I might as well finish it. A book of this sort should be entertaining, humourous, and/or educational, especially when you have a lead charachter who is a hitman. This book had no redeeming value or entertainment value. Instead, there were countless conversations and internal monolugue that went nowhere and were often repetitive. The \\"padding\\" in this book was incredible.

The cynical hit man going to an astologer? And altering his behavior because of what she says? I don't think so. Then there's the matter of the back and forth between Keller and his \\"agent,\\" Dot.

In the fiction market it's rare to find even 1 book that dares to step outside the usually well-defined boundaries of 'the usual' and when you do find such a rarity, it almost always misses its mark. The Keller mysteries not only step outside the usual boundaries and hits the mark but it does so with aplomb. They are a delicious telling of what it would probably be like from the hitman's point of view. Added to this is the fact that Keller simply isn't that bad of a guy.

But HIT LIST is thrown together with banter that is useless to the story and only on the page to take up space. A best selling mystery novelist told me that Block will continue this way until someone calls him on it. Well, I'm calling him on it. He needs to write a tightly woven story, and do the work. In a previousBurglar novel, he just got lazy and switched points of view at the end to gain surprise. In HIT LIST, he just seems to be yawning at the kitchen table and throwing down a bunch of dialogue that any novice COULD do but wouldn't lower himself to do.

(Yeah, I know Block is a grandmaster and all that, but he hasn't written a good book in a long time). As several people here have pointed out, the tedious conversations between Keller and Dot in this one - with all her really lame jokes - seem to go on forever.

This story lacks any interesting characters including Keller the featured hit man and the unmysterious Dot, his agent. There are numerous episodes of verbal dueling between Keller and Dot over the most mundane topics that will leave the determined reader wishing for a visit from a real hit man. The actual \\"contracts\\" Keller performes are about as exciting as my trip to the local coffee house on Sunday, they lack any imagination, detail or reason but at least the coffee will keep me awake. I'm sorry, but if possible, I'd ask Mr. Block for a refund on this one, I've read about a hundred books this year in related action/suspense topics and this was absolutely the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hits in Parts But Misses in Others","review":"Some parts of this book are really interesting and a great read while others you are fighting not to fall asleep as they are so boring. When Keller is actually on the job as a hit man it is fascinating and must turn the next page to find out what will happen next reading, but when he is not on the job his life is very boring. Stamp collecting, visiting an astrologer, jury duty and things like this just aren't interesting.Basically this book is about a professional killer named Keller who has some competition. Only problem is that his competition doesn't want any, and it soon becomes apparent to Keller that if he doesn't work out who his rival is and kill him first he will be killed himself. If Lawrence Block had maybe concentrated a little more on this aspect rather than the boring chapters he wrote then this book could have been five stars. Without the editing it barely makes two and a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it really Block who wrote it?","review":"After reading 'Hit man' (and other 11 of Block's books), I expected great time with this one. Were it some 150 pages shorter it could have given me a good time. But I've ended up with nothing but a long, boring time. I simply couldn't stand all those endless, pointless, funless dialogues, and the looong description of the jury thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not on my hit list","review":"This is a casual hodgepodge of corny repartee and a feeble plot involving a stamp collector who is a contract killer. The author devotes pages to repartee between the killer and his agent, both of whom are as cute as they can be trading bons mots for endless pages. None of this has much if anything to do with the plot, such as it is. Here and there along the way, our hero treks off and kills someone, although the author elides all the nasty stuff that might make our hero less cuddly. It's like a play in which all the interesting action happens offstage, leaving the actors merely talking about it on stage. If you're trapped on a long airplane ride, this book might be more entertaining than rehearsing your multiplication tables, but probably not as profitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not love Keller?","review":"I listened to the audio version of Hit Man, and I fell in love with the characters of Keller and Dot. I was hooked right away. Keller is an odd sort of guy with a dry sense of humor that plays off his cohort, Dot, beautifully. I laugh out loud reading their conversations. Hit List was a good continuation of Hit Man. I will agree that Hit Man is hard to replicate, but for a follow up book, I thought Hit List did the job.What struck me is Keller's personal story - so different from any other book I've read. I can't wait until the next installment.

Christmas morning it was in his stocking, but he (and I) were HUGELY disappointed that the lights and sounds stopped working within 24 hours. My husband replaced the battery in it (one of the stranger, harder to find batteries out there), and it made a little gurgling noise for about 15 seconds, before dying completely. I might have chalked this up to an unlucky experience, if it weren't for the fact that the \\"lights and sounds\\" James we also got did the same thing within a week.

While I believe many of the boys in my room will love it--mainly for its football action and Miles's inner dialogue--I'm sure others will be annoyed with the stereotypical portrayals of a \\"hard\\" father, a green-eyed love interest, a \\"what do you think\\" teacher, and a trying-too-hard coach. Coy seems to have tackled nothing new in this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not! so! perfect!","review":"A little less party-going, a little more character development would have helped this book. And, I can't believe I'm saying this, but there were too many exclamation marks! The whole book! Is like! This! And this! And this! (With a little of this thrown in for good measure.)The main couple, Damien and Caroline, did not have that hot, sexy chemistry necessary for an unforgettable romance. Their scenes together were all a bit \\"meh\\" to me. Most memorable was when they had sex, because the prose would go purple for one sentence and then the next would be non-embarrassing. It was like the forces of bad and good writing were battling it out on the page. A novel technique! Only I doubt it was intentional.I concur with the other reviewer who said that bringing historical figures into the story was a little bit contrived, though it did show a geeky affection for the time period, and if you enjoy trivia it's kind of neat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is everyone yelling?","review":"Sorry, but I couldn't even get midway through the book. The author is enamored of the exclamation point. Sometimes whole pages of dialogue would have every sentence ending with an exclamation point, even when there was seemingly no motivation for the speaker's elevated level of excitement. This finally forced me to put the book down, as my inner voice was becoming hoarse. I hardly noticed the plot due to this quirk of the author's. Ah, well, it just shows that typos and bad writing style can take away from even the best story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of Ballentrae","review":"This is a very good version!

While well past his prime -- his bright eyes now dim, and his gorgeous face marred by alcohol and hard living -- Errol Flynn still rises to the occasion with energy and conviction. The story is a rather dark and sad one for a swashbuckler, but it's well worth watching for those who are fans of Flynn or classic swashbucklers. The costumes and sets are finely crafted, the acting is convincing, and the story engages.

She said it was just the kind of slick, easy-to-sell textbook that people want. So I took her up on the suggestion and used it in a class that I taught last fall. BIG MISTAKE. The presentation is bland. The scholarship is 10-20 years out-of-date, and the liberation perspective is a throwback to an earlier era (circa 1960-70's).

The sword fight at the end, billed as the best ever filmed, is very good, indeed.Now, the bad. Even though I had just finished the book, which is excellent, I could not follow the screenplay. Even halfway into the movie little of the books' plot had shown itself, and I could not keep track of the characters, almost all of which had had their names changed. Only some occasional quotes from the book gave any indication that the screenwriters even read it.Also, in certain spots the sound mix has the music so loud that it's painful, and blocks out any dialog.If you want to see this movie, make sure you DON'T read the book first. That's the only hope you have of enjoying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Dissapointment","review":"Having just finished Sabatini's classic adventure story, I really looked forward to seeing how Hollywood put the story on film.

Would he'd starred in features MGM gave to less talented stars. (\\"Cough. Robert Taylor!

I have to wait minutes for the software to load up, and then you have to wait while it switches different applications within the suite.

Every few weeks it just stops printing, and I have to uninstall the thing and reinstall it. On top of that, it frequently asks me to align the cartriges, but whatever mechanism it uses to align the cartriges is broken. The kicker is that it won't let me print anything until I go through the motions of printing an alignment page, running it through the document feeder, and waiting while the machine makes all sorts of noises and flashes that the alignment page can't be detected.

Consequently the printer shakes quite a bit while printing. I have it sitting next to my computer monitor and it shakes the whole desk.3) The result is that the printed document is a little smeared. I haven't figured out a way to slow down the printer to try to get better quality.The main reason it is tolerable is that I don't print very often. I mostly use the scanner.

In fact my work mate at [cellular phone co.] lived in England for over a year. While there he saw the many crop circles come and go. What was most telling was that they would almost exclusively appear Thursday night, just in time to be showed off on Friday's telly. People would come out over the weekend to see them.

According to Frame, the apologist must begin with a strong commitment to the Lordship of Christ and must display that commitment through his use of the Scriptures. The book builds on this foundation to instruct the apologist in responding to different philosophical arguments.

They were touring their debut album. So was Cheap Trick. After Cheap Trick came out and blew us away Max came out and blew Cheap Trick away. I was an instant fan. Max Webster with the amazing Kim Mitchell on vocals and guitar were an extrodinary band with five studio albums and one live album, their last one Universal Juvinials features the track Battle Scar which has all three members of Rush playing and singing with them.As for High Class In Borrowed Shoes, the album is a mix of progressive and pop tracks that rock very hard with a few nice light tracks as well. The above track reviews are mostly spot on. Max is an aquired taste, they have been gone for 30 years now. If you're a fan of Kim Mitchell or quirky prog rock you will like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for beginner","review":"This is for beginner.

After using Procerin for three years now here is were I'm at: After the initial surge of baby hair growth, Procerin has, while not bringing back the thick hair I had as a young man definitely arrested my hair loss. The few hairs I find on my pillow in the morning are still very thin but I also notice sparse new growth that replaces the loss.

Boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl. Boy meets girl, boy doesn't get girl, boy finds another.

Eyedea is in fine form here as he displays his pananche for freestyling that is carefully balanced with heavier content-laden tracks. He is satirical without being too wishy-washy or disenchanted (luckily this album was recorded pre-war on Iraq), and is quite introspective. Eyedea craftily segues each track, so that the varied themes conjoin nicely. \\"message in a bottle\\" is truly a heartbreaking, albeit poetic, song and \\"here for you\\" is equally moving. I can't pick a favourite song among these brilliant tracks, but \\"walking\\" really hits home for me as Mr. Oliver Hart ponders his restless nature: \\"...its like my soul holds a song that eternity has left undone..\\" and \\"Im eager to unplug my speakers, let my heart be my teacher\\".

But, if you're a fan of real ska, you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three words:Fan-bloody-tastic!","review":"Mo's years of work with a voice coach apparently paid off. She and the rest of the band are amazing on this their first full length. I saw them live at the Palace in Hollywood with Let's Go Bowling and goonis' did it ROCK. I talked to Mo's dad for a while. Go see them if for no other reason than because Mo' is painfully sexy.

I have to say that I like the original version of Spam and a couple others better than this version, but otherwise this band is (was) great. Mostly, the point of me writing this review is to correct the misconception that this is Save Ferris' first CD. Everyone seems to think it is, but their first album is a self-titled one with seven songs on it. 5 songs were redone on this CD, but two (also great) songs didn't make it.

There are alot of bands that you get sick of after listening to their CDs again and again, but I have happily found out that this CD is not one of those. If you feel the need to rock out and dance around like a freak in the confines of your home or blasting the songs out of the windows of your car, this is the CD for you. My faves are Superspy, spam, and lies, although the entire CD kicks serious [rear]. She takes off where Kay of letters to cleo left off.

Save Ferris has a good sound and a promising future.

If nothing else, the cover of Dexie's Midnight Runners is worth trying the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Please keep writing songs","review":"I absolutley loved this album.

Finally someone has decided to bring the classic swashbucklers to the DVD medium and it is about time. \\"The Crimson Pirate\\" is one of two Lancaster swashbucklers--the other is \\"The Flame and the Arrow\\"--and a wonderful mixture of comedy and acrobats. While not on a par with the older Flynn/Tyrone Power epics, \\"Pirate\\" stands above most of the pirate films of the late 1940s and 1950s. It is not to be missed by any fan of Burt Lancaster, especially those who wish to see how good he probably was as a circus performer. This is one to hold on to and, hopefully, will be the beginning of more of these grand entertainments on DVD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Old Hollywood","review":"I am a shiplover, age 65 and when this movie came to Europe in the mid 50ties it was my absolute favorite Piratemovie.

His damsel is Eva Bartok, the freewheeling European beauty...I don't know how many times I have seen this buccaneer saga, and still I love it... The film provides lots of thrills and laughs, lots of adventures and excitement ...Great fun all the time...Lancaster's sense of comedy was evident enough for critic Alton Cook to call him \\"one of our most amiable and strenuous comedians.\\"For me, Lancaster will be always remembered as the actor who has given the modern cinema more \\"pure enjoyment\\" than almost any other major star..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item, excellent price & service","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and hard to come by on DVD.

I was concerned that they might make the walker \\"slippery\\" - that is, afraid that when she needed to lean on the walker, it would slide.They do indeed have less grip than the walker's own plastic or rubber caps, but not enough to make it dangerous. She adjusted quickly and the balls work well. We got the grey, looking for something that didn't call attention to itself, and they are barely noticable.They fit on very easily, requiring only a small slice to widen the pre-cuts.Mom does very little walking (mostly bathroom trips) so her pattern around the house is repeated and was beginning to show fine scratches on the hardwood.

Her advice in dealing with others is to make your self feel superior by putting down everyone else. I work at a school, and we dedicate time to teaching our kids how NOT to act like Ms. Martinet suggests. The snide tone of her voice on this tape emphasises her unkind, unsocial advice.

It blended with the milk and had that \\"unique\\" acai berry taste. I will certainly enjoy blending it with nonfat shakes in my effort to improve my health and lose weight.

I couldn't tell if it was working in any other ways until I had finished the package. A wart I had on my foot for almost 2 years magically went away!

The pictures, when viewed up close are horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it stop, dear GOD make it stop!","review":"The promo picture that came with this CD showed most of the band hiding their heads and I have to at least give them credit for that. This collection of tired beats, deliberately misspelled words (what sort of street cred are these blokes looking for?) and limp songs doesn't show a shred of originality. Sure, the songs have some energy, but only as much as the preprogrammed beats can muster. Distorted vocals and screaming into the void does not make a song relevant (the aforementioned misspelled fiasco \\"Foot Soldierz\\") nor does a chorus repeated until you want to put a drill into your ears make a ballad catchy (the utterly dreadful \\"Morning Afterglow.\\")Arista seemed very high on these lads, and their 'flavor of the month' status should hopefully make sure they're dropped back into obscurity with a lack of dignity befitting them."},{"rating":"1","title":"47 minutes and 27 seconds of pure torture","review":"I cannot express how uterly bad this record is. For starters, the band switches between styles more often than Tom Cruise switches women. One minute they sound like Papa Roach and the next you think your listening to Nickelback. These bands are horrible by themselves so imagine an even worse version of them. I guess they wanted to rip off all their favorite nu-metal bands on this record and that is why we have this artistic identity crisis. Another thing is their horrible cover version of \\"Dazed and Confused\\". One minute the thing sounds like REM and then it kicks in with this cheesy 80's hair metal guitar. Horrible! From beginning to end this record is pure torture. Don't waist a dime on this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD surprised me","review":"I first heard Electrasy, like many other people, on the Titan A.E. soundtrack (\\"Cosmic Castaway\\"). After reading several of the reviews here, I didn't hold great hopes for the rest of the album, but when I saw it on sale used, I picked it up on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised. My favorite track remains \\"Cosmic Castaway,\\" but the rest make for good listening. The only song I don't like it \\"Foot Soldierz,\\" which is a bit loud for my tastes. Overall, I would recommend this album to anyone who liked \\"Cosmic Castaway,\\" although much of the rest of the music differs greatly in style, so it might be a good idea to listen to the previews before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Band","review":"I had never heard of Electrasy until I went to a Fuel concert in Atlanta a few years back. The opening acts were to be a surprise and as it turned out, Electrasy was one of those acts.

Their sound is good and original, which is a hard to find these days. The entire album is great. I wish they had another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Peaceful Enough","review":"For the most part, \\"Peaceful Ocean Surf\\" is a nice, relaxing disc that captures the ebb and flow of the ocean surf. However, the disc also includes some rather obtrusive and downright annoying fog horns too. This disc has something of a \\"choppy\\" quality to it as it sounds like the surf was recorded at certain times and then hastily edited togther. If you listen closely, you'll see what I mean. All in all, not a bad disc to listen and relax to but if you like the sound of the ocean surf without all the fog horns and seagulls, check out the far better \\"Thunder by the Sea.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Advertised","review":"The \\"peaceful ocean surf and sounds of ocean waves\\" come with the sound of a great air horn.

I usually notice, but once or twice I've let the thing bake for awhile before noticing. Serious safety hazard. (There *is* a beep when you turn the unit on in any mode, but it's easily drowned out by other commotion.)The inside of the glass door is very hard to clean due to its rising, rather than hinging, action.The thing does work, but I'd take just about any other toaster oven design over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforgivable","review":"Cuisinart RTO-20 Retro Toaster Oven Broiler, brushed stainless and blackI could forgive a dozen idiosyncrasies in my toaster oven so long as I could trust it to TOAST reliably.

Fourth, the included broil pan is so cheap it rusted the first time i put it in the dishwasher. And Fifth there is NO TIMER for baking a frozen dinner.

I really enjoyed the film, which is the bottom line. Yes, the acting is not very inspiring, Robert Taylor never did know how to act, but evidently was a pretty face at that point in time (I was born the year it came out.) But the Technicolor is gorgeous, and the story itself is a powerful one. If the movie makes anyone want to read the historical literature, then it is useful, as well as entertaining. My only gripe is that the disc itself seems to be flawed in its manufacture. I sent the first back and got a second, but it is the same flaw. The picture suddenly changes its dimensions as if it is about to \\"go out\\" and then suddenly straightens itself out. I've played both copies on multiple players, it is the same on each one. How do we contact the manufacturer to tell them of their quality control error?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This film stinks...got it?","review":"This is possibly the worst collision of big budget and lack of direction I have ever seen. The actors stand around like statues in scenes delivering unemotional lines like statues. It's like a shoddy high school play. The swordfighting appeared like they had never even practiced before the shot, looking pathetic and inept. This film is strictly amateur hour. There are teenage-made short films on youtube that are more professional looking then this dreck. After watching 15 minutes I gave up. I paid a grand total of $3 for a used VHS tape of this...and I feel I got took!

Let me be clear, the problem is with Hane's sizing, NOT with the vendor. Tx Shirt Co went out of their way to make sure I got the shirts I needed in the correct size.

The first problem was with the table top which angles up on one side and not perpendicular on the edge where the wing extension attaches which causes it to angle down. The second more pronounced problem is with the spindle housing which is badly tilted towards the front of the table. I have tried for two days to get a hold of Delta's customer support with no luck. They have not returned my emails and their answering machine says the voicemail is full and cannot take my message with no alternative to speak to a live person. I was able to get a hold of a local Delta repair station where they told me there was no way for me to \\"true-up\\" the unit and it would have to be brought in to, \\"see what they could do with it.\\" For the amount of money I was spending I expected more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I wasn't sure whether or not to buy this CD but I took the chance and I'm so glad I did.

Jeff Lorber, Brian Culbertson and David Benoit guest throughout, particularly Lorber, who as ever is superb. Every track sounds as though it has Peter White strumming all over it but infact it is the Piccolo bass playing of Brian - quite expert playing.

On this project, Brian has 14 tracks with unique arrangements. Nothing sounds like a cover of anything you have heard. With guest artists like Jeff Lorber (who is at his best on this), Brian Culbertson (another smoking and rising star keyboardist in the instrumental format), Dave Kochanski (former Rippingtons keyboard and current Brittany Spears(it pays the bills)keyboards) and David Benoit (master pianist/composer) you can't go wrong with a line-up like this.This project has it all. Funky tunes, sweet ballads, and sounds taht you swear are coming from a rock guitar but is simply is the masterful work of Bromberg's amazing bass talent on display. After you get this one, then I suggest you compare it to his covers of Jaco Pastorius's work. Bromberg's tribute is simply called Jaco.

I really enjoyed seeing all of the TV Guide ads again and I had no idea that there was so much merchandise put out because of the show. The episode guide for Dynasty is good but the one for The Colbys is wonderful. I missed most of the show when it was on but after reading this book I feel like I've seen every one of them. I didn't want to read a bunch of recycled tabloid trash about people's feuds or feelings that got hurt like the movie \\"Dynasty: The Making of a Guilty Pleasure\\" tried to display. I wanted something light and fun and informative and this book definitely delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantity Yes, Quality...?","review":"I bought this book expecting to read an authoritative history of 'Dynasty' similar to Barbara Curran's excellent review of 'Dallas'. Focusing more on the production aspects of the series - the background politics and intrigues surrounding how the show was made each week. Instead what we have here is largely a recapitulation of the show's storylines and characters. Such information is readily available from other sources, and indeed a large portion of it in Judith's book is recycled material. New information is sorely lacking and this book substitutes length (over 700 pages) for depth. As it stands Judith's book has the tone of an overly long fanzine, when what I hoped for was an intelligent book reviewing one of my favourite television shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Light Look At An Old Favorite","review":"If you're looking for a book that's going to tell all of the secrets of who did what to whom then you need to pass this book by because it's not like that.

Everyone knows the background on the show and most people know what the episodes were about but the book has a soft feel to it that doesn't even go into any of the rumors and gossip.

Higher doses are required to treat health issues. 5gm to improve cardiovascular health, 10gm for inflammatory pain, and 15gm for depression and neurological conditions.He recommends pharmaceutical grade fish oil, especially at these higher doses, because of less toxins and less gastric problems. Much of the fish oil you see in stores is only 30% Omega-3's, pharmaceutical grade is at least 60%.The author has me convinced. However, the oil he recommends is his own from searslabs.com which will cost at least $1.40 per day, $42 per month, just for the maintenance dose.

And in many pages he goes over again what, if you've read any other of his books, you know. But he won me over and this one is a keeper. Read this with Jean Carper's Your Miracle Brain -- they compliment each other well. Sears reminds his way of eating is not a diet and he's right, its a way of life. A very livable way of eating for life. Get your carbs from fruits and veggies, your protein from low fat sources and fats from the \\"good fats\\", watch the high glycemic foods and supplement with omega oil.

It may well be that some of Dr. Sears's (By the way, Dr. Sears is a chemist, not a nutritionist or a physician) hypotheses will prove to be correct. Time and science will tell.

I saw the film in January and I still find myself thinking about Randy the Ram. The character is unforgetable. In fact, Rourke played him so skillfully, so beautifully (sorry for the over use of that word, but it applies) that it doesn't seem as though it is a character at all. I feel as though he was a man that I knew at some point, though my life never came close to intersecting that kind of lifestyle. I have just purchased this on DVD because this is a great film.

It unfolds in a mind-(and soul-)numbing succession of raw scenes, lacking depth and emotional force. Mickey Rourke has too much in common with Randy the \\"Ram\\" to achieve dramatic transcendence. He comes across as coarse and pathetic; his melodramatic performance, filled with self-pity, made me cringe, especially as the film wore on. I wanted to like this movie but it just bored and sickened me, leading nowhere but deeper into its own vacuous hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"brainyslam!!!","review":"OW, ow, and oh yeah .....ow.

Thestory was cheesey enough, but the wrestling matches, all 3 of themwas even worse than the stuff on Tuesday nights ECW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! Portraits wrestling like it's not real","review":"This movie is actually OK, but it portraits wrestling as if it wasn't a battle to the death. This might be because real wrestling is not suitable to a younger audience which the makers most likely wanted to attract (they play videogames in the movie, as just one example, and the wrestler talks to a couple of kids at one point), or the special effects neccessary to make the death scenes look real were just too expensive. And the fact that a pro wrestler would work in a grocery store when not on stage killing his opponent is hard to swallow.There are just too many errors here to rate the film higher than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRASH, I MEAN THE WRESTLER","review":"If you live in a trailer, if you have two first names, if all your siblings have different fathers, then this movie is for you.Mickey Rourkes puffy, plastic filled face is a tragedy.

So is this movie.Sorry about the Oscar Mick, maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty boring","review":"This movie was simply boring to me. I don't even understand what people mean by depressing, I didn't care about any of the characters to be that depressed, just bored and tedious by the same formulas used over and over again on every single drama that is of this type.

If I have to itemize them for anyone, they need to see a few more films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and moving","review":"A touching portrayal of a used-up hunk of meat trying to get back on his feet. You will cringe when you see what he goes through to make a living as a wrestler; some scenes are not for the faint of heart. You'll also get an inside glimpse of this seemingly crazy world.You will be on edge as you watch him try to rebuild his life and relationships, always teetering on the brink of disaster. I can't say much more without spoiling it, except that it's powerful and moving and ... oops, almost gave it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows the end of the American male","review":"This was an absolutely fantastic film. Great on many levels. Makes you miss the 80's on behalf of the protagonist. Disturbing in that it symbolically shows the destruction of the American male. In particularly the white male. Divorced broke alimented from his kids. Should have won an Oscar. Most Americas have died for there dream job and have more or less failed to reproduce health families. Viewers were probably excited to see how bad Micky looked and miss the unintended symbolic meaning of this brilliant but utterly depressing film.

Besides the thrilling wrestling presentation, there are some very affectionate scenes, especially with his portrayed daughter. The movie proves what some athletes go through. Once the adrenaline instills itself in their acting, they can't abandon it at the risk of losing someone very dear to them. Obviously, it's not only the money that matters to them, but also the fame and excitement of their sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"This movie is one of the strongest products that I have reviewed for this site. It is absolutely splendid. Never to be forgotten.The acting was powerful. Mickey Rourke put everything he had into this role, much like his character, Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, put his all into his wrestling. The direction was flawless.

And there are some beautifully shot sequences.But there's also a lot of hokum, especially in the failed relationshipwith his daughter, and the stripper played by Marisa Tomei, who istrapped in a similar downward spiral to Rourke, and may be his onlyhope, simply doesn't have the depth to balance him.For me, a good, solid movie, but not the masterpiece a lot of criticsclaimed, at least on first viewing.I'm a fan of Aronofsky's, but I found this the least compelling of hisfilms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge wrestling fan, but didn't like this","review":"I love wrestling, both what goes on inside and I love to read about what goes on on the outside.

Having seen many real wrestling documentaries and a fan for 25+ years I expected more than this movie provided. The hype from the oscars was just that, hype for another poorly made movie.The premise was good and this had alot of potential. But it had poor character development and story development. It has some decent action/wrestling scenes and alot of [...] scenes. But that seemed to be the essence of the movie. The relationship with the daughter and Pam came across forced and not well developed.The thing that brings this movie from a 1 to a 2 is the documentary \\"Within the Ring\\" on the making of the film and working with the Indi wrestlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"really beat up for very good status","review":"I ordered this DVD and while it played okay the case it came in was really screwed up and the jacket had puncture marks all over it.

Mickey Rourke really should call it quits where acting is concerned. Its not that he's that bad of an actor, but his \\"talent\\" seems to have vanished to only a sliver of what it used to be. And the cosmetic surgeries he's had have destroyed his good looks, which made it difficult to focus on the movie itself. It's as though I could only focus on the oddity in front of me, of this face that I used to recognize. Somewhere behind the horrible face lifts, is a familiar face that can only be seen in bits and pieces. It makes me sad.Sorry for the rambling. Back to the movie itself. It's essentially about a washed up, used up wrestler-\\"has been\\". Depressing, really. I found very little, if anything, in this movie that moved me one way or another.

It was an excellent story and the acting was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wrestler by Brandon M. Moskos","review":"Outstanding movie starring Mickey Rourke as \\"The Ram\\" A beat-up, has-been wrestler, that all he knows is wrestling. Mickey Rourke was so good in this movie that I forgot that this was actually a comeback movie for him. Wrestling still for the paychecks, he soon faces trouble when a heart attack forces him to retire. He tries to live a life outside of wrestling by trying to romance a stripper (a very good Marissa Tomei) and trying to revive a relationship with his daughter (Evan Rachel Wood). The Ram soon realizes the only thing that ever felt normal and gives him happiness in life is wrestling. I'm not going to give this movie away, but this is a must-see first class movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie and great extra's","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. On Blue Ray it looks fantastic. The wrestlers round table was very fun and gave a lot of insight. Even if your not a wrestling fan you need to see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to see ya again Mickey, don't be a stranger","review":"Somewhere late in the Wrestler after many stunningly painful and true human moments, Mickey Rourke the movie star takes over, we can see the young actor in those eyes again as tries one last time to woo Marisa Tomei and salvage some kind of a life. What starts off as a quasi doc threatens to turn into full on Hollywood near the finale but the acting and directing are so sure fire that the course the script takes is overwhelmed by the talent onscreen and off. It is great to see Mickey Rourke in a vehicle worthy of his talent again, I was reminded of another lost classic HOMEBOY, which is unsettling in the way it mirrors his offscreen boxing career. Brilliant acting and directorial decisions make this the most real and underrated film of 2008, despite the accolades."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ram Jam\\"","review":"This movie is the story of an aging wrester going through struggles inside and outside the ring. Stunning performances from Rourke, Tomei, and Evan Rachel Woods as his daughter. I thought Aronfsky did a fantastic job with the movie. One of the reasons why i watched this movie is because I heard it peeved of the country of Iran (when \\"Ram Jam'\\" breaks a Iran flag in half) so I thought that was pretty funny too. Definitely check out this movie though. Its a movie that I think anyone can get into and it kind of shows a dark side of wrestling also but its definitely not just a \\"wrestling\\" movie, it gets much deeper than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie.","review":"I'm not a major movie critic nor a long time Mickie Rourke fan. I am however a long time wrestling fan who is into much more then just the showmanship of wrestling. This movie was very well done. I was extremely impressed and it's one of the few movies I am willing to spend a lot of money in order to buy it brand new on blu ray. Any wrestling fan, fans of Mickie Rourke, or fans of good movies in general should see this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wrestler... from behind the lines...","review":"I had an opportunity to see this film when it first premiered in Los Angeles. All around, it was a return to the days of great story telling. It differed from your typical Sport Heroe movies. The demise of the man and the impulsion of the character (the wrestler) are enriched with a heavy dosage of realism. The admission of defeat in one arena to seek a triumphant revival/farewell to a better place is absolutely amazing. Few films have talked to me like this one does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was okay","review":"After all the Oscar buzz about this movie, I expected more.

They both play characters that are down hill for what they use to be. Marisa is a stripper in her late 30's (she looks great though) Mickey Rourke play a wash out almost forgotten Wrestler.This movie is about the life of an old retired Wrestler trying make a living and fit in.

In the end, it seemed like a big budget student film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-made but too familiar","review":"The Bottom Line:Mickey Rourke and Marissa Tomei certainly embody their characters fully and the film gives the viewer some interesting information and insight into pro wrestling (I particularly enjoyed when the crowd cheered when Mickey Rourke smacked the \\"bad guy\\" wrestler and then booed when the bad guy hit him back) but the general arc of the screenplay is so familiar and trite that the movie consistently holds itself back from greatness; The Wrestler is a good film, but not a great one.3/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"KINDA DEPRESSING, BUT A GREAT MOVIE","review":"I watched this last night. First, I have been a wrestling fan since the 60's. This movie is NOT about wrestling per se, but the the character Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson. It shows the downside of the business once a wrestler starts aging. They had no retirement benefitd nor health insurance and are taking in the small indepentdent circuits as well as part time work to survive. It particularly had meaning for me as I just went through what he went through 3 weeks ago. Over all not a good experience.Anyway, he continues on after having a Heart Attack, but out of wrestling. At least for awhile. I agree that this was Mickey Rourke's role, and he took it and ran with it. He was absolutely at his very best. Mariesa Tomei, showed she has the right stuff as well. All in all, it was wel written, well directed, and well acted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color Wheel is good blending techniques ??? well no","review":"I purchased this with a wish that it would give details of colors and how they blend.ie, green leather dyed with a British Tan.

At first, I found this book entertaining. I respected Mr. Illig's determination and the sharing of mistakes he made on the trail. However, as Kimbo mentioned in the review, Mr. Illig is quite preachy to the point of arrogance. Throughout this book, he is critical of others, be it Christians, meat-eaters, or day-hikers.

What a Bargain!","review":"Warner Bros. seems to have little clue about marketing their DC-based tv series. Whether's it Batman, Batman Beyond, Batman/Superman, or Justice League, they produced only substandard dvds to date. Now Justice League doesn't reach the level of some WB previous efforts, but it's far better than that sad excuse of a series, Teen Titans, now on Cartoon Network. I digress....Anyway, I simply won't fork over money for this DVD containing a lousy pair of 2-part episodes. Come on, WB, either release season box sets or at least offer six episodes, which would be just over two hours in length. I suspect that some heads need to roll until WB realizes that they can both milk and nurture their fanbase, a win-win scenario for everyone. Until such a time, there's plenty else here at Amazon.com to satisfy everyone's DVD needs....."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BUDGET LEAGUE!","review":"I cannot rate this film because I recently purchased it on Thursday, February 4th at Walgreens for $3.99.

The instructions say that the outside environment can impact the unit's ability to reach the set temperature. Um...in the case, why not buy a cooler?

It was not a great product when I received it. It was hard to see the LED temperature readout, it made a lot of noise and it only fit 11 bottles. I was willing to accept all of those drawbacks in exchange for the price and apartment friendly size. However, I took out a bottle of white wine two weeks ago and found, much to my dismay, that the fridge was at least 77 degrees inside and my wine was warm. About 600 dollars of wine suffered some heat damage, and all I can say is I am glad i only had six expensive reds in the fridge. Ironically, all the wine I stored in my closet seems to be in much better shape. I did call Cuisinart and they are sending a new fridge, but they will never be able to replace the wine that was damaged. I would not recommend this product.

Second, we have gone to some pains and expense to buy quiet appliances for our kitchen--it's right off our family room--and this is louder than my new refrigerator-freezer! Our experience with remodeling our kitchen has taught us that there are many appliance manufacturers selling mutton dressed as lamb. They figure that an outdated or inferior appliance fitted out with stainless steel accoutrements will pass for a true high-tech appliance.

Anyway, after unplugging it while on vacation for a while, I came back and it now doesn't work. It stays at 77 degrees and the vents feel very hot. Customer service (picked up quickly and a native english speaker) tried to be helpful but all she could say was to reset it by keeping it unplugged for 24 hrs.

I've used this camera for 11 months and today got a black screen. Google it- It appears to be an unfixable problem which inhibits you from using the camera or taking further pictures. Nikon's planned obsolescence was not mentioned as a feature, but sadly the cost to repair it is more than to replace it.In addition, I find the features to be cumbersome & difficult to use.The photos load extremely slow to the computer and do not ineract well with non-Nikon photo programs. The Nikon photo program is useless, so don't count on using it for most applications.I upgraded the photo card to 2 GB and although it increased the capacity to about 1000 photos, it loads too slow (10 minutes) to use.As a professional photographer of sorts, I say buy anything but this camera.Worthless!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cool camera......but those darn white spots","review":"I really liked this camera.........cool looking, easy to use, and it takes great photos with natural light..........

For me it occured on about 90% of alll photos that require use of the flash. Now I bought this at best buy and I took it back and got another coolpix s9 ( I really like the camera) and the same thing happened.

I'm absolutely convinced this camera was manufactured cheaply with every design flaw imaginable. My camera stopped working after 10 sessions. Suddenly the camera could not sense/tell when the lens cover was open or closed so it stopped working because of it. I sent it to Nikon and they wanted $154 to fix it. It's a manufacturing defect - why should I pay? The camera was never dropped or abused in any way...not even a scratch.This was the first Nikon I ever bought. I purchased it brand new to use everyday because of its features, size and the reputation for quality of the company. When it worked, it took great pictures. Now it's an expensive paperweight that's been sitting in my house for 2 years. Obviously, Nikon has changed and so will its reputation. I'm going back to Canon and Sony. Nikon?

I checked the reviews on the camera and heard about the dots on the pictures (I also read that's why Nikon discontinued this model). Sure enough, after only a few days of use, I had dots in about 5% of the pictures. I didn't want to risk it getting worse, so I returned the camera while it was still under the 30 day warranty.

I did get a very quick email from Nikon telling me that the white spots are normal for small cameras. I have tried 4 other cameras including Cannon and Olympus and even a Nikon model S3 that had no spots. Nikon told me to not use the flash and I shouldn't have the problem. What the real problem is, the Flash is in front of the lens and it is causing some undesired effects with the lens. 6 out of 30 photos taken with the flash had some sort of spots on them you had to look to find them but they are there , I took the camera back, I like to know or hope my photo will be semi ok when I take it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spots on pictures","review":"Just like mentioned from other reviews, I too had spots or bubbles on my pictures.

It would not be possible to turn the power off, so I would have to unplug it. Never could get it to do any different, but it would still print and would still scan documents.

I have the Porter Cable HVLP air sprayer and I originally bought the 2.0mm nozzle and it would only work if I really watered down the paint. The problem with that is I hardly got any coverage and it was very runny.So then I went with the 2.2mm Nozzle and I didn't have to thin the paint if I didn't want to. However, it did spray a little bit better when I added about 5-10% water and 10% Floetrol @ 45 PSI. The Floetrol will make the paint lay more evenly.So if you need to spray latex paint, buy the 2.2mm Nozzle right away and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had this years ago","review":"As other reviewers have said, I also had the 2.0 tip and ended up thinning(watering) down latex to the consistancy of water.

For great ideas, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product sucks, it's a vacuum!","review":"am very pleased! My expectations were in line with what I received.

It has much less suction than one would expect, especially given the noise it makes. The hose is short and there is no wand. Neither are sized to fit standard vacuum cleaner accessories. The short hose comes off easily when the vacuum is being used.

We were both just blown away by this CD - it is just breath-taking - gives you goose bumps, the whole works. We recommend it to anyone, it is a music lover's CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz Fanatics are just tooooooooo cool!","review":"There's nothing like the pompous opinion of a Jazz elitist that serves quite as well for being a reverse barometer for something I'll be inclined to enjoy. No wonder Jazz suffers from such little wide-spread acceptance in this country when those who claim to be fans are so quick to criticize anything that either doesn't fall under the highly interpretive definition of it or ventures into other realms. Is this a Jazz album? NO! Is this a Classical album? NO! Is this an album of well-performed classically-influenced music that is pleasing to listen to and doesn't make you feel as if you're being stabbed in the forehead with an ice pick? YES! By the way, Dave Grusin is the pianist, not Bob James!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I liked the book and the story so imagine how upet I was to go thru 5 of the 6 cds only to fine out the 6th one was missing and I couldn't finish the book. Very upset with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I was disappointed in this book for several reasons. First, I felt there was too many characters, which made everything feel rushed. Secondly, the characters weren't developed enough for me. It was especially hard to believe that the two main protagonists would fall in love in the end since there wasn't any sustantial emotional connection between throughout the book. I have enjoyed many Sandra Brown books in the past, but this was not one of them. The premise was good, but the story just didn't grab me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Sandra \\"REALLY\\" write this!","review":"I have read every Sandra Brown book there is clear back to her Loveswept days. She has stated in interviews that she is going to write romantic/suspense books. Alot of people are upset that she hasn't stayed with her regular basic romance books. I could expect Standoff to be a first book but not one by an author as established as this one... I started to be interested in the young couple involved in the stand off but as the book went on I couldn't have cared less. As far as romance in this book....she seemed to have just thrown everything together ....in about 20 pages! It bothers me when authors try to wrap everything up in the last page or two. Really felt like I was left hanging! I'm starting to wonder about alot of the more popular authors. Are they under some kind of time constraint and pressure? ....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best to pass this one by","review":"I listened to this book on audio tape while in the car - a new experience for me. Maybe it's because I prefer reading or maybe the narrator's voice became irritating, but this was not very entertaining. Sandra Brown is one of my favorite romantic-suspense authors and I have enjoyed many of her past works. Standoff is a light-weight story. Although the characters were together for many hours as hostages in a convenience store, I didn't feel like I knew them very well. The two teens who robbed the store and caused the problems definitely had some psychological issues, but I found myself not caring too much about them and waiting for the story to resolve. It does and ho-hum. Maybe it is more enjoyable in print, but judging from some of the other reviews, probably not. If you want to read a good Sandra Brown, try Witness or French Silk."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is generous for this book....","review":"The trite plot, poor writing, and tired cliches make this book one of the *worst* books I have ever read. Lines such as, \\"At whom are you pissed?\\" are laughable at best. Every character speaks in the same manner, bland and false. Ugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"I've read a couple of other Sandra Brown books (Alibi was particularly good), and was severaly disappointed by this. This book would not even be a decent effort by a novice attempting to break into the field, let alone an experienced professional. The plotline is absurd, requiring the reader to set aside *any* sense of reality. The character development is sub-par and one-dimensional. The people the central character dislikes (The FBI, the Father of the girl) are wooden and artificially evil and/or stupid. This is just one badly written book. Don't even waste your time. Maybe Sandra Brown will get back to being a decent writer, but if this is the best she can do, it's time to explore other career options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I had looked forward to reading this book as the author had in the past few years been writing so well. I was very disappointed in this book and actually felt embarrassed for wasting my time reading it. It was such a pathetic literary effort. I felt angry that Ms. Brown would actually sell this knowing that people would buy it simply because of her past efforts. The book was boring, contrived, and obviously took a lot of effort to write and stretch out so little into even the short book that it is. I tried to give this book no star, but the system requires at least one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standoff is a write off","review":"Although this is not a best seller it is interesting reading. There were some scenes I found funny and some that were actually suspenseful. I would not recommend the book to anyone who is seeking a \\"hot\\" read for the summer, because \\"Standoff\\" will not qualify. It's good for reading in an airport if you have a long wait and you don't have any other books or magazines of interest to read while you wait on your flight. This was the last hardcover book by Sandra Brown I will buy. I will be content to wait on the next book to appear in paperback. I am disappointed after all these years to make such a statement. Maybe in the future she will return to the type of writing that made her famous and wealthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doy!!","review":"This is one to leave by the toilet. Sandra Brown needs to look up the word \\"prone,\\" which in this book she repeatedly and annoyingly uses incorrectly. Pregnant women are never positioned prone. Duh!! Get a real editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissapointing End","review":"I found this book by Sandra Brown to be very interesting until the end. What a dissapointment. The major story line of the whole book comes to a conclusion in a few short lines. After these few unfulfilling words, you jump from what seems to be a suspense story into a fluffy romance novel. Maybe the next one will be better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Standoff","review":"When I went into the book store to get a new book I saw Sandra Brown's new Standoff. I didn't event read the cover I love her books so much. This was terrible next time I will read the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFL READ!","review":"Once again, Sandra Brown comes through with a real page turner! I was actually late for work, because I had to find out what happened! Make sure when you start reading, you have time to finish because you will not be able to put this book down! You will fall in love with Sabra and Ronnie. There is everything you could want in a book. Suspense, romance, surprises, deep characters! Check it out! You won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read","review":"I could comment on the racism, lack of creativity and lack of substance found in this novel. In conclusion, do not waste your mind and time reading this piece of fluff called a novel. Unless you are entertained by reckless, shallow, and unbelievable characters, I assume any person with a high school education at the least would find this book a real snoozer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great summer read","review":"I made the mistake of reading other reader's reviews prior to reading the book. I really liked this book! Sure it is no \\"War and Peace\\" but it is a great book for the beach or the plane. I found it funny and interesting. Easy to read in one or two sittings. For nine bucks how can you go wrong ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Standoff is terrible","review":"This cannot be the work of Sandra Brown! The writing is so elementary. I did not identify with characters. Story is NOT believable-stupid authority figures-a leading lady you don't even like. Please don't waste your time like i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I have enjoyed Sandra Brown's book in the past, but this one is awful. Save your money. Don't even buy it in paperback. If you have to read it, check it out at your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"I found this book very disappointing. I didn't feel any connection with the main character, Tiel and the ending was horrible. It was as if the author suddenly realized there was no sex in the book and threw it in just so there would be some. It also seemed like an afterthought to let the reader know what happened to Ronnie, Sabra, and Katherine. I'll think twice before buying another Sandra Brown book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This Book","review":"I love thrillers and mystery fiction and am a true afficianado of the form. While I'd heard of Sandra Brown, I'd never read her novels. Lucky me! If Standoff is any indication of her skill, I saved myself a lot of time.While fiction readers understand that plots often fall into place, Standoff is simply unbelievable. Ms. McCoy just happened to be in the convenience store when the teens came in to rob it, and the list is endless of silly, trite coincidences. Even moreso, the ending, filled with gratuitous poorly written sex, offended me. I'm in Italy right now on a business trip which is always my special time to read. Besides this book being a terrible disappointment I can't remember ever throwing a book away. Except Standoff, that is.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Awful","review":"I can't believe one of my favorite authors wrote this horrendous book. Not only was it awful story line wise, I felt cheated since it was such a \\"little\\" book and definitely not worth the money. Is this what happens to famous authors? I'll look to my other favorites since this is the second time she's disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"I would highly recommend this to anyone to read & had a great plot and story! READ IT, A REAL TREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Standoff","review":"The standoff starts out as a book that caught my attention. In the beging i wanted to read more and more to see what was happening. Twords the middle of the book i thought it was getting to long and to drug out. The content of the story is in the same atmosphere for to long. I thought to many un needed detail was applied. It turns out to be drama and love in one which is fun. The ending of the story was ok. It didnt tell to much of what happened with the characters i wanted to know about, but between two other characters it gave a hint to what was going to happen. I guess i didn't really enjoy the book as much as i would of liked to, because of it's long and kind of borring content, but it had some edge to it. My rating i give is two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance and Suspense","review":"Sandra Brown is a great author and Standoff will draw you in. Brown manages to integrate sexual tension with the suspense tension to increase the emotional impact. I really liked the way she started fast and kept you hooked.OK, maybe it wasn't perfect. The coincidence of reporter Tiel (the heroine) ending up in a convenience store holdup with the runaway teens, a runaway ex-doctor turned cowboy whom she had covered when he was still a doctor in Dallas, a couple of very suspicious Mexican nationals, and a midwestern couple thrown in for comic relief is extreme, especially when the runaway girl's water breaks and the baby shows up just in time.Virtually the entire novel took place at the convenience store but the narrow confines of the novel reinforce the trapped feeling that Tiel has--both trapped in the store and trapped in the life that isn't giving her what she really needs.Occasionally it was a guilty pleasure but I had a hard time putting it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandra Brown Could've Done Better","review":"I think this book is like a child that drags itz feet. It was super long and boring. The characters were ok and the plot was ok but it was so LONG !!Tiel McCoy is this reporter and she stumbles upon this major story of two lovers. They're running away from one of their father because that father is a major tyrant. They get involved and the suspenseful journey begins.At least I hope its suspenseful for other readers because this was boring for me. I think Sandra Brown could've done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and quick!","review":"This book was a short, easy read. It was nothing extrordinary. However, if you are looking for a quick mildly entertaining read then this may be the book for you! I have never read any of Ms. Brown's other books, and after this one I don't think that I will be reading anymore. It just wasn't my style. I prefer books with more character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you dont like quickies dont read it.","review":"But if you do like shorter books, this is about as good as one can get in a couple hundred pages. I thought the story was intresting and the pace was very good. I'm very glad Sandra Brown didnt try to extend the book. It ended when it was over, and she didnt worry that the story was too short. Just read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back your old style of writing.","review":"What a disappointment. As an outline for a good story with interesting characters and situations, this is a good book. What has happened to Sandra Brown's writing style? If you want to read some of her good books, read MIRROR IMAGE, BEST KEPT SECRETS or FRENCH SILK. This book is so short that you do not have time to \\"care\\" about any of the characters. It could have been so much more if she had taken the time to develop the characters. Where is all of the wonderful detail that is found in her earlier works?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Standoff","review":"Sorry to say I found this book to be lackluster. I was unable to even finish the book. I was very disappointed as I have been a avid reader of Sandra Brown's books and have always looked forward to the \\"next\\" new book. In the future, I will read the reviews before I buy one of her books. It appears that almost everyone has the same view of this attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did I buy this for?","review":"The book over all was action packed but at the end all of a sudden like the standoff began it happened a romance springs up on the reader all to fast like turning the page and there it was. No, swooning or courting... just bang they did it... not a good romanace that we all know Ms. Brown to write. Next time I'll think about buying her next book very carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"This author writes bestsellers?","review":"This book felt like it was write-by-numbers, filled with far to many outrageous coincidences to be believable. (For example, Tiel's current love interest just so happens to reveal he's married in a phone call right before she gets drawn into the hostage situation, freeing her up for her next love interest who she spots immediately.) I had to wonder if all of Brown's books were like this how she ever managed to get anything published, she was clearly phoning it in for the paycheck here. The most annoying thing for me was the fact that the big bad villain (the girl's father) was never revealed to be anything more than a bullying jerk. I was expecting a damning revelation of physical/sexual abuse or something diabolical, but that never came. His final act, in light of the circumstances of the plot, and crimes other characters have already committed, doesn't seem all that bad. I gave Sandra Brown a chance, but she's not getting another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very bad end","review":"The story of the book is excellent, although it has too many coincidences at the beginning of it, nevertheless, the abduction and all the problems with the hostages will keep you in the book and you will not be able to close it... until the abduction ends.The last 30 pages could be written in 5 pages or less and that end just took away a star, you can end the book when the abduction ends and read the las two pages and you will have an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harlequin romance pretends to be a thriller","review":"This book was an easy read, and that's about the best thing I can say about it. The plot was too predictable, and the sex scene was way too contrived. Sorry, I wanted a thriller, not a smut novel. The cover looked good, however (don't judge a book ...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric story line--sophomoric writing","review":"Aspiring novelists should find this book very inspirational. If the publishing houses are putting out pathetic, stupid, silly, boring, junk like this, well then every high school kid at a typewriter should be crankin' out the stories and sendin' them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the usual sandra brown suspense","review":"I have read every book by Sandra Brown. I like her later works with romance/suspense. However, this book was a disappointment. The whole book consists of one night. I found the characters very predictable and boring. The only positive factor is that it was short so I didn't waste much time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and predictable","review":"I was hoping for a pleasant distraction, but this books plot plays out as predicably as any formulaic made-for-TV movie. The principles are so flat that I had trouble finishing this very short work, mostly because I found myself not caring about what happened. Perhaps the worst contrivance I have ever read occurs when the male antagonist's father relates a story of how, as a boy he kidnapped and killed a neighbor's poorly treated dog (just as he was now kidnapping and perhaps killing a poorly treated girl). Yikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read.","review":"The story is quite ridiculous, characters wooden, and please do not get me started on the dialog. I could not contain my laughter when one of the characters actually said, \\"At whom are you pissed?\\" Grammatically correct, but has anyone ever uttered this sentence in real life? The 'love scene' is equally pitiable and completely out of place from the rest of the book - I read it out loud to a group of friends; we came to tears from laughing so hard.Do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"As a number one fan of Sandra Brown I am deeply disappointed in her last few books. Her whole style of writing has changed. She seems to be getting further and further away from writing romance novels. Being a avid fan of her previous books I just feel let down. I hope that she starts to realize her fans want romance back in her writing, which is what she does best, and not what she has been handing off to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Brown's Best","review":"I too had been waiting for Ms. Brown's latest book. This one left me flat. I read the short story in just a few hours & felt the \\"teenage\\" trama could have been more fully developed.And to be honest, I missed the mix of passionate romantic scenes & suspense of her other books such as \\"Fat Tuesday\\" or \\"Exclusive\\". They always made my heart flutter and as Ms. Brown might say, \\"...my lower regions moisten.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Par","review":"This book was too short. I found myself wanting to see what happend after the standoff in the lives of the the main characters. However, if you are looking for a quick read that isn't too involving, this could be an ok book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"Another flop by Sandra Brown. She's such a wonderful author too that I find it hard to believe she could publish a book that is so incredibly boring. I usually enjoy her books but this one was a waste of time to read. Sorry... However, if you're looking for a great Sandra Brown book to read, try The Alibi, The Witness, Breath of Scandal or Tiger Prince to name a few. They were all fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for users over 170 pounds","review":"I purchased the strike towable because of the great price. When it arrived the box indicated that the towable was not to be used by riders over 170 pounds. This was not indicated in the product description. I returned the towable because it would limit who could ride the tube and I never took it out of the box. It looked like it would be a great bargain if riders were to be under the weight limit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethereal Electronica Done Right","review":"What can I say, I love just about everything Imogen Heap's done except that godawful dress hat combo she wore to the Grammys. Ignore the dress, buy this album. She can actually sing with pushing notes out via her nose, her lyrics don't know the word banal and your coolness quotient will increase. This album is simply good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it...","review":"I love it when I find something and it FINALLY gets big time success. I've been listening to Imogen Heap for more than 2 years now. WAY before \\"Hide and Seek\\" found its way onto the OC. I hate that THAT'S the only song that anyone cares about when they buy the cd...especially since just about ALL the songs are worth delving into.I love every song, except for Daylight Robbery. That just doesn't rub me right. But EVERY OTHER SONG is amazing. And oh so very intimate and sweet (not in a sexual manner at all).I Megaphone is amazing as well. Immi sings in a lower tone and its so cool! She has such a beautiful range!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbly Polished and Produced Effort from trip-hop songstress.","review":"Imogen Heap first came to my attention viaDetails, the debut album from the now defunct outfit Frou Frou. I adored that album, but not as much as I love this album.Solo, Imogen is a more potent and poignant formula.Speak for Yourselfis full of swirling electronica, basically everything that made Frou Frou so great. But the difference here is it is more convincing.Her solo material is great drawing on many different influences, like the Laurie Anderson inspired \\"Hide & Seek\\" and the Bjork romp \\"Headlock\\".Her smokey English vocals are downright sexy snd her ability in songwriting is wholly admirable.In my opinion Imogen was the unfair loser at the last GRAMMY's, she should've taken out the Best New Artist gong over that dreadful Carrie Underwood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaking Up","review":"Speak For Yourself is the first solo record released in the US by Frou Frou vocalist Imogen Heap. The album is a sonically rich outing with electronic buzzes and pulsating bass lines. \\"Goodnight & Go\\" is a pretty song with an immensely catchy chorus and \\"Hide & Seek\\" has a strong synth-pop sound that is equally as catchy. Ms. Heap gets a little experimental on the ethereal \\"Have You Got It in You?\\" and \\"The Walk\\" shows some muscle. Speak For Yourself is an entertaining and well-crafted album that deserves to have commercial success."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is Copy Protected","review":"I was very disappointed to learn that this CD is copy protected. I have been a fan of Frou Frou's work and hoped to expand into Imogne Heap's solo work, but I can not buy a CD that is copy protected AND potentially open's my computer (Mac AND PC) up to harm from hackers.Shame on Sony for doing this and too bad for Imogen Heap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music, GREAT. Copy protection, VERY BAD","review":"It doesn't matter how brilliant the artist is (like Imogen Heap. Love her!). I will NEVER buy a copy-protected CD. Let's keep sounding off, everyone. Sony is killing themselves with this computer-crashing scheme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cd i bought all year","review":"If you haven't heard this album yet you don't know what you are missing. Imogen is one of the biggest secrets in music that I know of and I work in the industry. Absolutely no one I have spoken to even knows of her but I'm doing my best to change that. She is all over satellite radio which is what I listen to. Actually I heard her for the first time on KCRW and immediately went to the playlist to find who it was. Anyway don't spend your time listening to me. Buy this album. You can thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great singer, not the best of her work. still good.","review":"I love her singing espesially in the Chronicles of Narnia the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe where she sings I Can't Take It In.

I would suggest not only this album, but this singer all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sing to yourself to!","review":"The hit \\"Hide and seek\\" is great!

They were just what she wanted. Fast delivery!! Will continue to use Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit Up and Beg","review":"Imogen is the new \\"it\\" girl, the Moby of the 2000s. Her ultramodern popmuzik with Frou Frou and now solo is the perfect soundtrack to these times, weary and involved, simplistic and ultra-sophisticated at the same time. Her simple voice is the pure unadulterated center of the swirling, techno delirium created by her partner/keyboardist/computerist Guy Sigsworth. In the grand tradition of Sonny & Cher, Captain & Tennille, Ike & Tina Turner, and the Eurythmics, Imogen may be a phenomenon created by her boyfriend but there's no denying she's caught the wave of the moment.And she's no Kelly Clarkson, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should not be in NEW AGE","review":"To put this album under New Age is defenitely misleading. it is NOT NEW AGE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore --","review":"If you are into the singer songwriter, trip-hop, electronica, folk, alt, genre and are looking for something new, different and fresh .. well, this is not it. Teeny bopper poop, that's what this is. No offense to the younger listening audience (I've got to assume that's where all the 4 star ratings come from), but I guarantee that you will eventually be bored as much as I am with this stuff, and if you like it now, in a few years it will be in your \\"I can't believe I used to listen to this pile\\". One would hope that this kind of formative music will eventually lead to greater pursuits. I would encourage all of you to open your minds and dig a bit deeper. There is sooo much out there that is sooo much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucker!","review":"I bought this album sight unseen on the strength of \\"Hide and Seek\\" and well.....this one goes to the used record store tomorrow....in a plain brown wrapper to save me the embarassment. What I thought was going to be spare, sonic and personal turned out to be just another teeny pop queen album complete with drum machine and sophomoric Sarah McLachlan wannabe lyrics. I could almost imagine her dancing on stage with her Brittany mike and the Backstreet Boys. Maybe it's a genre thing, or maybe it's because I got the Books' Lemon of Pink\\" the same day, but this seemed saccharine and trite like no other album I've ever owned. Now where's that brown paper....?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Live performance shows her talent (OR LACK THEREOF)","review":"Sorry but even though the album sounds good i have to object to an artist whose talent lies solely in the production. She is an absolute horrid perfomer live which means that she has no talent and therefore she shouldn't be getting all these rave reviews. Sorry but with her natural voice she could have easily made it to the bloopers reel of american idol. Don't buy this album; not because it's bad but because it supports someone who has no talent and doesn't deserve the money or the career."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album speaks for itself","review":"I am so glad that Imogen Heap has gained all the exposure that she has with this album, becuase it is well deserved. This record is collection of thought-provoking ideas and musical sounds. Tracks like \\"walk,\\" \\"headlock\\" and \\"the moment i said it\\" show how the range of her musical and vocal talents. There have been a rash of female vocalists springing up in the last few years, but Imogen really stands out. If you like this kind of subpop/electronica combination is such a relief to find. Also check out \\"Siren Songs\\" by Gretchen Lieberum - another great combination: subpop and acid jazz, and another example of a powerful female voice. And if you haven't seen imogen live, jump at the next chance, because it's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"the pop queen !!","review":"Imogen Heap is going to be known as the Pop queen. She definetly knows how to write a catchy song!Her 'pieces' are voice lead(she said so herself) with electronic and string bases will no doubt impress anyone who listens.Her unique voice takes you through life situations, heartbreak, grief and her headstrong self!If you like frou frou, you will love her solo album.Do yourself a favor and buy it. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I could give it a million stars!","review":"My absolute favourite album.. ever!Imogen Heap is the most amazing performer I've heard.

I promise :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Voice and Songs","review":"I heard HIDE AND SEEK while watching the premiere of SMITH on CBS. The song blew me away and I immediately started searching the Internet for the artist. Heap's album, SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, is fresh and addictive.

You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"Imogen's music is incredible! I've read reviews about her live performances not being so incredible. I cant say that I've heard her live but I have heard singers like Evanescence, and Avril Lavigne and i cant say that a singers ability can be based upon their live performances. If Imogen's CD is wonderful entertainment than Kudos for her.

This is an album full of melodicallyand electronically interesting songs that take you on a journey on everylisten.

Like Isaid, the CD is mesmerizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing! The Best Album of the Year So Far!","review":"It's all in the heading. There is not one single song on this compilation that I do not love for one reason or another. What a fresh and inventive album. It's almost like discovering oxygen again after such a disappointing musical decline the past few years. Kudos to Imogen for always being nothing short of original.Highlights for me:1) I Am In Love With You2) Headlock - The ending chords on this one remind me of \\"Getting Scared\\" from I, Megaphone...which I loved.3) Hide and Seek - Definitely a moving experiment.4) Have You Got it In You5) Clear the Area6) Goodnight and GoI could go on, but I think you get the point. Definitely pick up this album when it hits shelves near you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHEER MUSICAL GENIUS!!!","review":"WOW! Imogen Heap is hands down the most musically gifted creature to ever exist...well, maybe she's not that talented...but she is definately underrated and under-appreciated by the media.There is very little music i ever listened to that's ever made me feel the way her's does.It's not easy to describe, but her talents shine in almost every song.How anyone could not recognixe that this lady is a genius must be tone deaf.Take your listening pleasures to another level...with Imogen Heap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"I really enjoy this cd, it's worth buying if for no other reason than the famous \\"hide and seek\\" (SNL \\"dear sister\\" digital short.) she's as catchy as pop without being annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beautiful tones and colors of Immi","review":"Overall, I'm pretty pleased as punch with my latest choice of auditory bliss. I find it exciting how Imogen is able to paint a vivid picture with her words and vocal productions. She is so good at turning the tones of her voice into its own instrument. My pleasure picks on this album would inevitably be \\"Hide and Seek\\", \\"The Walk\\", \\"Closing In\\" and \\"The Moment I Said It.\\" Some tunes are just a little too poppy for me like \\"Say GoodNight And Go\\" and \\"Have you got it in you?\\" But overall, this CD is definitely worth anyone's time and small investment! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Original","review":"There's not much to say about this album except that it's rare to find true artistic genius that is uncompromised by the b.s. mainstream producers try to inject to make music more \\"commercially viable\\".Imogen's lyrics and melodies are truly unique, despite the fact that the editor's reviews always attempt to compare her to other artists. She is incomparable, and should be labeled as such.This album is twice as good as her collaboration for Frou Frou (and that was a great album!). The stand-out tracks are \\"Hide and Seek\\" (obviously), \\"The Walk\\" (my personal favorite), \\"Goodnight and Go,\\" and...well, all the others, too. HA!This is definitely an essential album for anyone who enjoys killer melodies, great loops, and spot-on lyrics. Imogen is amazing, and so is this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing as usual","review":"Imogen Heap has once again created a truly beautiful and lush collection of music. An incredible album! There's nothing more to say than what all the other 5-star reviews say, but there's one thing I must point out. All those people complaining about the copy protection aren't exactly 100% accurate. I bought the copy-protected version and could still rip it onto iTunes and on my iPod. It plays perfectly. I guess it depends on individual computers.?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy @#$&, buy this album!!!","review":"Ok, I don't want to sound sad or pathetic, but Imogen Heap's (commonly called Immi) album \\"Speak For Yourself\\" has changed my life. I absolutely love this cd and am surprised that my car stereo hasn't simply rejected the thought at playing \\"Headlock\\" or \\"The Walk\\" one more time.A few days ago I saw Imogen in concert at a wonderful, intimate venue in San Francisco and I was just amazed at how talented she really is. I never realized that she is all alone performing, no band or recordings. She creates all of the music while she is singing, using piano, laptop, keyboard and other various things.From the deep, soulful \\"Just For Now\\", to the fast-paced, guiter-laced \\"Daylight Robbery\\", Imogen creates an eclectic and wonderful album that leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The More I Listen, The Better It Gets","review":"Seriously, this is one of those albums. Just put it on repeat, listen close, or just put it on as background noise. It really does get more enthralling every time I hear it. Imogen is such a master at layering, overdoing it sometimes, but only in a way that makes it that much more challenging and exquisite. Each time I listen, I catch new trills, beats, instruments, voices ... just amazing!She really is an heir to the line of Laurie Anderson, Kate Bush, and Dido, as others have said. But I would actually throw in Garbage, attaining what I consider to be that perfect level of layering and mixing, catchy pop + hard driving beats. And what a voice!Hit repeat again, I can't stop listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD from start to finish...","review":"I bought this CD because one of the songs was play on 'So You Think You Can Dance' to one of the lyrical numbers. Truly beautiful. It's one of those CDs that you can listen to from start to finish without disappointment. Great unique arrangements. Beautiful voice. Soothing yet strong. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Vocals","review":"I'd heard nothing of Imogen Heap until by chance listening to her album at a listening station in a local record store.After that I was hooked.With a combination of searing vocals and luscious production, Speak for Yourself was one of my favourite albums of 2006. While there are two songs that drag a bit, the rest are both head nodding and mesmerizing most noteably the opening \\"Headlock\\" and later on in \\"Clear the Area.\\"For those looking for a change in female pop vocal stylings...look no further than \\"Speak for Yourself.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"iMOGEN HEAP speaks for herself :)","review":"I purchased the CD \\"Speak for Yourself\\" by iMOGEN HEAP after hearing the group FROU FROU's amazing CD \\"Details\\". The vocals were amazing and after a little research, I found that the female half(iMOGEN) was also solo artist and that FROU FROU was a side project for her. So I hopped online and went to shopping. After paying the extra couple of bucks for express delivery I was glad to see that my money was WELL spent. \\"Speak for Yourself\\" is nothing less than amazing. iMOGEN delivers a style that'll send you on a musical high. The track \\"Hide&Seek\\" is awesome, her voice and delivery is so eclectic, and ethereal, it's like a cross between Evanessence, and Enya, also her delivery is definately on point. She crosses classical piano with electronica and a dash of rock to make the ultimate audio cocktail. I give the CD 5 out of 5 stars and reccomend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOYCOTT COPY PROTECTED MUSIC THAT DAMAGES COMPUTERS","review":"I BELIEVE THERE WAS A MAJOR CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT RECENTLY DECIDING IN FAVOR OF CONSUMERS WHO PURCHASED COPY PROTECTED CDS THAT DAMAGE BUYERS COMPUTER SYSTEM.

I have owned this watch for 11 years now. The first problem after a few years was the black paint coming off the numbers on the bezel. I had it repainted once and within 6 months it started coming off again. Looks junky as some parts of the numbers have paint and some don't. The clasp on the band bends over time so the watch keeps popping off when clapping hands or bending wrist. Have to keep getting it adjusted. Within one year of warranty ending the watch died and I had to get the movement replaced.

I have had this watch for about 2 months and I have to say that it is a cut above the rest. Although you may think that I am too quick to judge this watch since I have only had it for two months however I have been swimming with it many times and even dropped it to the botton og the pool by accident. Nothing happened. I have been beating it up more then I should at school but it is very sturdy and feels heavy on my wrist. I has lost even one minute from the time I got it and it is very easy to use. Great job Tissot!P.S. Amazon has great deal on watches!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful watch, great price point, easily scratched.","review":"Be careful with this watch. It is absolutely beautiful, and you can't beat the price. However, the high chrome finish is VERY easy to scratch so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a watch for heavy work. Office worker style watch. Cubicle friendly. Nice for a night out too. Well constructed and heavy on the wrist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch..band is questionable..","review":"I received this watch as a gift from a friend who ordered it from Amazon. I looked at the watch in the store(national Jewelry) before ordering. One thing I noticed is the band from Amazon is different than the store bought one. The store bought one weighs a little more and moves more easily and is more flexible and has more depth and dimension to it. Thus, it makes it feel more substantial. For a 3rd comparison, I went to Macy's and the band from Macy's is the same one as from Amazon. So, either the Jewelry store one is different, or the band style has changed form the manufacturer. Not sure which one. I wish the one from Amazon had the band I prefer, but other than that, the watch is beautiful and very nice and the price is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't get past the anachronisms","review":"Okay, I get it. Marcus Corvinus is a wise-cracking detective in ancient Rome. I could get past that. But I would appreciate the author being a bit more clever in his language by using wisecracks that might actually be relevant to the time period. Perhaps we're supposed to accept phrases like \\"...but all the same for Priscus to come home drunk was about as likely as a crayfish tap-dancing the length of the Baian seafront\\" and use our imagination as to what an equivalent remark would be for the time. The book is filled these types of anachronisms and I think it's just lame. The story is an amusing mystery, but not to my taste. I prefer Gordianus the Finder over the equivalent of Guy Noir dropped into ancient Rome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roman detective by Wishart","review":"I will never buy another one of his mysteries. The story line is very good but I do not like to read his f***ing this and f***ing that. There's no need for language like that in a Roman story. I'm sure he could have found a much more Roman term to use than that. Also he writes in too much modern English sayings that you do not get the feel of a Roman story. It sounds like a modern story in Roman dress. I really like the Roman detectives but not his style of writing. He could learn a good lesson from Linday Davis and Rosemary Rowe. Far superior writers and with them you get the feeling of actually being in Rome not in an East End (London) gang. Will not purchase anything of his again. Money wasterd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated!","review":"After 2 solid attempts to apply this caulk to my shower this morning it is all mush again!

Although it may work for areas that don't get wet it is NOT good for a shower or bath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful","review":"Zero stars. This product is worse than useless. Unfortunately, I'd already boight this from the store and done the bath tub before reading the reviews on here. It's worse than useless because it actually makes more work for you when you realize that the product is garbage and you have to redo everything with stuff that actually works.I cleaned up the old caulk, cleaned with alcohol, made sure surfaces were spotless. Let dry for 24 hours.Took a shower and it's bubbling up in several places. Rubbing it (gently) with my finger and it appears it just \\"rubs off\\"... What the hell?Never buying DAP again.

This book is a first in many ways here you have the heroine refusing to take no for an answer and the male counterpart having both the physical and emotional scars to overcome. Tatiana cannot understand why Mathew wants to keep their relationship at the friendship level when she knows that what she feels for him is so much more and suspects that he feels the same way to. Needless to say the two do follow their hearts and what you have is a wonderful love story that shows that love can overcome that which you think is insurmountable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and your time","review":"I read this book. I was determined that my hard earned money would not go to waste, but it was a trial.From the onset, I realized that this was not a greatly developed story. Neither character was very endearing. There relationship was so on again off again, and the characters of Mathew and Tatiana, so wishy washy it left me wanting something, anything!I love reading interracial romance books, but this particular book leaves a lot to be desired. The story is chocked-filled with more holes than a slice of swiss cheese. And there were so many typos, I could have done a better job of editing.I tried to see through to the good part, but it just wasn't there. However, it kept going and going just like that bunny commercial, and it wouldn't stop. Leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks originality","review":"This book wasn't cheap so I felt compelled to finish it, though it took some considerable effort. This is an interracial romance, which should be more than enough drama for the main characters. Yet, the author saddles Tatiana and Mathew with the typical romance story conventions. She is the naive virgin and he is the guy with the mysterious and tortured past. But Mathew's past is more tortured and complicated than most. He spends a lot of time brooding about how undesirable he is. Too much time. I started to believe it about halfway through. His extreme degree of self-consciousness was really not attractive. Tatiana did not seem to be a fully developed character. She seemed incredibly young for her age and I never thought the two were all that compatible. Neither one of them had strong, likeable personalities. Too much of a pity party. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hearts of Fire","review":"Awful. Just plain awful.

They are also very thin and have little \\"wings\\" on them to help keep them in place. I will keep buying them.

Of course, beinga TV movie, there are sinister characters behind it, preventing anyonefrom leaving.

This collection has some interesting material like the gospel-flavoured \\"Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody\\" and an okay version of Peace In The Valley, but is spoiled by an over-dramatic and occasionally out-of-tune Higher Power.

And to his credit, John Faulker did a good job in the telling - the characterizations are appropriately written a bit over the top, the situations are farcical to the point of near impossibility, and the characters are oddly loveable goofs in spite of some very ugly traits and flaws. Having said all of that, I couldn't get past the coarseness of the content to get at the decent bit of writing on display. From that perspective, then, I'd have to give it only two stars. If interested in John Faulkner, try \\"Dollar Cotton\\" instead - a harsh book with a lot of distasteful elements, but set out in a serious way that makes the ugly a point of contemplation rather than of pitiable smirks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crime Mob suck a fat one!","review":"yes, just what we need further perpetuation of the African American stereotype.

There are some excellent tracks, What About Me Baby is one of their best songs of all time...so why was it not the 1st release off the album....better yet never release at all? Some other good tracks are Lost In You with Delroy sounding great on lead vocals, and Feel Much Better, with Denise on lead vocals where she should be souding great. The rest of the album is just not up too par, however the track I Can Show You Love with Lorraine sounding great on lead vocals could have been so much better with some decent production values.

Locals will find the book a way to explore the underpinnings of a city they may have too quickly come to take for granted.

The heroine, Adora was strong and smart as most of Small's female characters are, but I hated Helena (heroine's sis). She never paid for all the numerous things she did to her sister. Spoiler Alert: She killed the heroines second husband. This infuriated me, b/c I liked Alexander a lot more than the hero, Murad. I hated reading Murad have sex with other women. I don't care how many times the author said Adora was his favorite, it was frustrating and not at all a romance. The book was more historical/ military strategy etc. Not a romance. I also hated the description of children being raped. Again not a romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"words can not describe how incedably well writen this story is. The author goes threw adora's life and places her in realistic stiuations that women faced every day back then. you will fall in love with adora and cry when she does, love when she does, and hate when she does. You can't help but cry in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Conquers All","review":"I really enjoyed the way the author built and developed the characters throughout the course of the book. She provided such intense detail of their lives that you felt you knew them by the end of the book. This is the only book that I have ever, EVER read that made me cry at the end. I was weeping uncontrollably by the last few pages.The one thing that has to be kept in mind, is that this book and others like it written by the author, are meant solely for entertainment value. Don't read more into than that. It's a wonderful way to escape, take it for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!!!","review":"I originally read this book when I was thirteen and I have read it at least four more times.

Way to go Beatrice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting","review":"first of all someone recommed me to try a book from this author and i chose to read adora since it was on sale...after reading the book i was left disturded for a while and in shock...a 13yr old is rape by an 60yr old man then suddenly she finds pleasure in him..r u kidding me..to make it short, adora is constantly rape in the book even by the man she loves..sighs..i guess i better go back reading books by johanna lindsey, brenda joyce, judith mcnaught etc...atleast there books leave a smile on your face!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad....","review":"This title is one of Bertrice Small's tougher finds. I'd been searching for years for this book, and once I found it, I wasn't disappointed. It was everything I remembered, and then some... and as a side comment for the reader who touched on the book's \\"rape\\" scenes - it's perfectly believable, given the time period and the history of the places where the book is set. Perhaps a history lesson would be in order.Excellent book. Well worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical","review":"Nothing romantic here...Stolen or sold \\"heroine\\" - raped by all husbands...yet loves them all?Very predictable formula writing here.

I am glad I did. She is an excellent story teller but injects real people of history which makes the story all the more engaging. I recommend any of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bus' out da Kleenex!","review":"I was captivated by this story. Bertrice, you made me happy, angry, sad, and anxious to skip pages so I could satisfy my impatience. A wonderfully written story set in the places that Bertrice loves to take us to."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books","review":"I'm usually a big Bertice Small fan, but I'm glad I hadn't read this book first or I never would've picked up another of her books. *spoilers* I was shocked and appalled at the constant rape theme of the book. Adora was raped by every man she ever married, starting at the age of 13, which I found repellent. There were a few times that 10 year old girls being raped was mentioned, to what purpose, I'm not sure. I couldn't really like Adora as she was being touted as so smart and independent and she really never came across that way, just as spoiled and self centered. Her father claimed she was his favorite then sold her the first chance he got to the sultan who was, I think in his fifties? Really? And there's several instances of incest and general depravity. Not my bag. I was just very put off by a good portion of the book, I kept reading it in the hopes that it would get better, but it just really didn't. Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst romantic history I've ever read...","review":"I have never read a book by Bertrice Small and after this one, I'm not sure I ever will. This was not romance! Not only was the history BORING, but I didn't appreciate the bits of perversion (sex with a 10 yr old girl!!). Maybe that was how life really was for this time period and this location, but I don't want to read about it in a \\"romance\\" book. It did evoke many emotions from me, but most of what I felt was \\"Ugh, will this ever be over??\\" I would NOT recommend this book. As a matter of fact, I went to return the title for a refund but unfortunately I could not. I'm stuck with it. :( In short, if you are looking for a romantic history, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"This was not one of my favorite books by Bert rice small...it was too violent and graphic to the point of disgusting...especially when children were raped and beaten. Would not recommend this to the faint of heart...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Good beginning poor last third.You will want to be buying a new book half way through.A disappointment after Love Wild &Fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever","review":"This was my first book by Small and it will not be my last. Not only was there a great love story involved but also some great history. This book is also not your average everyday romance. It was refreshing to read a book where you got to view a persons whole life and not just a couple of years (or however long it takes to meet there love). Whenever I finish reading a romance I cant help wondering \\"what happens next?\\" Well in this book you view Adora's life from age 4-90. So you get to know what happens next. It was a great read and one of the only books that made me cry. It was very touching if you can get into the characters, not to mention some hot sex sceens. I have never written a review for a book before but once I read Adora I had to share my thoughts. If you can get a hold of this book it will be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute trash","review":"I don't understand how anyone could possibly find anything romantic in the heroine being raped, not once, but TWICE by her \\"beloved.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there such a thing as 0 stars?","review":"Trash, total trash.Poorly written trash.Inconsistencies, choppy dialog and shallow characters.Main character finds it enchanting that men who want her, sometimes have to rape her to get what they want, never the less she falls in love with them, finds pleasure when they rape her and even loves them sometimes. The author overindulged in the \\"rape\\" fantasy here. This book is total waste of money. Read \\"The Love Slave\\", much better history, superb writing and real interesting read, although again forceful sex is omnipresent."},{"rating":"1","title":"bodice ripper, rapist hero","review":"I read this one back when it was first published and it read exactly like a 1980's bodice ripper. The heroine has multiple husbands. The hero has multiple wives, but unlike her he has them simultaneously. Yup he has a harem and this is one of Ms. Small's many harem \\"romances\\". Where's the romance in sharing your husband with other women?I really disliked this book. The heroine's first husband has a eunuch rape her with a wooden \\"thing\\" because he can't be bothered to take her virginity himself. Her second husband rapes her after putting her in some drugged state. Her third husband (her first one's son) rapes her before the old man is cold. And he's the hero!Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehhh","review":"Love the romance part about the book, but the part of the perversions consist of child rape. The part that I would have loved more time on was killed off real quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: THIS BOOK IS CHILD PORNOGRAPHY","review":"Ms. Small apparently believes that writing about children being RAPED is entertainment! Has she never heard of pediaphiles being inspired to ACT OUT after reading or viewing child porn???! This book needs to be banned as it crosses the line. I've read Ms. Smalls books before and her facination with rape and perversion led me to stop buying her books (and I am not a prude!). This one should've landed her in PRISON!"},{"rating":"1","title":"an ok book","review":"this wasn't one of Bertrice Small's best book.

I always enjoy her books. She is an excellent story teller. I like the time period of this book, and I love stories about the old Ottoman and Byzantine empires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a romance novel...","review":"I'm not sure why this book is categorized as romance because it's really closer to historical fiction. Categories aside, I really did not enjoy this book. The hero is extremely unlikable, the heroine is not believable, and I found myself rolling my eyes quite a bit. It moves along at a good pace, but it's basically an unpleasant gauntlet of every bad thing that can possibly happen to a person does, and sometimes more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic journey through History","review":"I have read this book before and thought it was a great read. Recently I holidayed in Istanbul & Turkey and this encouraged me to reread Adora. I liked the feel of Adora, her enduring spirit and cunning, her courage . . . superb! Recommend this book most highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The\\" Love song for any generation","review":"I personaly like all kinds of music, however this is the one to stand before all others.

The story flowed, the characterizations were good, the mystery solvable. There was even some humor thrown in, along with teenage angst and naughty happenings at the sorority next door.Claire's money problems were realistic so that I felt like I wanted to shop in her store and help her out. However, it was frustrating to read about the way she let her daughter do whatever she wanted and talk to her disrepectfully. I also couldn't believe that Claire was so nosy. But then I later realized that Claire and her daughter are very much alike.Though not my favorite cozy mystery series, this one is enjoyable. I'll read the whole series eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arly is much better","review":"After having read a number of Hess' \\"Arly Hanks\\" books, I decided to give Claire Malloy a try. I was disappointed with the characters and, in particular, this story line. Both were much too predictable. I had to keep checking the cover to make sure it was the same author as the one I've always found enjoyable in the Arly Hanks series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundtrack somewhat more buoyant than stage production","review":"After waiting a long time to see the musical, I must say I was extremely disappointed. Despite mediocre acting and tacky looking sets, the musical score itself only had one or two songs that could do anything to help the story stay afloat. I have seen countless musical and stage productions, and I must say that this is one of the worst I have ever seen. It seems that many reviewers have not experienced good theater, due to their high markings for this soundtrack. I don't know if Titanic is worth getting for the one or two \\"good songs\\". The music does not do justice to a storyline that is so popular and important in this day and age. Definitely look in the used section of the music store for this recording as I believe many people will be ditching this one soon. There is a reason this musical is closing after only two years. It stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't wish this music on my worst enemy","review":"Perhaps the music loses something in the translation -- without the visuals, this is just another of the recent crop of big musicals that mistake overworked histrionics for good songwriting. A fan of Yeston's other works, I was supremely disappointed in this outing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Not worth buying. I borrowed it from someone and gave it back the very same day. And you know what: it should have been Jekyll and Hyde which won the Tony for Best Musical in '97; it deserves it more than Titanic."},{"rating":"1","title":"dear god. Help us all.","review":"SO bad. I saw this on Broadway. And I have never had to fight so hard to stay awake. Cardboard cutout sets and the most forgetable music I have ever heard. I even got to go back stage (A friend of a friend, you know.) Even that did not help my enthusiasm or lack there of. I rarely dislike a show. Even the cheesy ones that everyone says are low on substance. But this is the worst of the worst. I liked CATS better... and I didn't like CATS. Do yourself a favor. Help put this CD out of its misery... don't buy it. Get Parade or RENT, or the Producers. Anything but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Musical I have ever heard","review":"This was by far the worst Musical that i have ever seen in my entire life. It was long, and boring, and rather stupid. THe characters were dull, and void of life. The story line and lyrics are pathelic. Don't waste your money on this musical, watch the movie, it's a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful tribute","review":"Having just performed in an amature production of 'Titanic the musical' I can honestly say that purchasing the cd gave me some real insite into how the show should sound and look.The singing was superb, the atmosphere that the braodway cast creates is just phenominal it sent chills up and down my spine. The most outstanding number on the cd is 'The Blame' that just blows me away with all the emotion within the song.In all i found the cd one of the best that i have purchased from amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"At once a poem...and the perfection of [musical] engineering","review":"The first time I listened to this CD, I hated it. The second time, I hated it a little less...the ninth time, I was absolutely blown away. It's true, the music is not always easy or pleasant to listen to, the lyrics seem stupid and awkward. Looking at each part individually, one sees irritating flaws that seem impossible to ignore. But if you let the CD sweep over you as a whole, you end up with a very different picture. It's not about how the songs are objectively, but more how they fit together...and create an amazing experience. You just have to take the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THAT GREAT","review":"The opening of this cd is extremely exilerating however after that it falls flat on it's face. I hardly felt any compassion at all for the passengers and with the exceptions of Victoria Clark most of the characters were very flat. Maybe all of that is caused by transition from stage to recording I'm not sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smaller splash with a much deaper meaning","review":"What can I say that has not already been said about this incredible musical. First when this musical exploded on Broadway I was skeptical that the story of the TITANIC could be captured on music. Well I was wrong. The music is terrific, and the lyrics are cleverly crafted together to bring the story to life. Victoria Clark, Brian D'Arcy James and the rest of the cast shine bright and it is very hard to imagine and come to realize that their character could possibly die at the end. Once I got this album I could not stop listening to it. I never thought that this musical would have such an impact on not only me but a lot of other people as well. I never got the chance to see it on Broadway but it is on tour and is coming to my town in about 2 weeks. I can't wait! You should definitely get this CD. And see the show if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eah....","review":"I wish I could draw a conclusion one way or the other but I saw this show in Boston and felt compelled throughout the show to stand up and shout \\"DO SOMETHING, FOR GODS SAKE!\\" The first act dragged like nothing I've ever seen. The attempt to detail the lives of real passangers really didn't get me emotionally involved with them and it certainly did not flow too well. Like Whistle DOwn THe Wind which I also saw recently, it seemed like the dialogue told the whole story and the music was thrown in to make it a musical. Still, There were a few times I was on the edge of my seat and that deserves something.By the way, since we're counting, I've seen virtually every major show since 1965- not that that matters much."},{"rating":"2","title":"ZeeK lyxe this cd","review":"actuallee the reason i bought this, is because it was on sale used for about $5. but after listenning to it afew times, i was serprised that it really is worth more than that. i love the song The Proposal. the characters are really neat, and i like the way it doesn't focus mainly on one or two of them. the singers are excellent. i guess that a person does have to have patience with some of this cd. some of the music may sound awkward at first. i have not seen it on stage on account i live in a drama remote part of texas, but i am certain that it is amazing live."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"In every age mankind attempts to fabricate great works\\"","review":"This may be one of them. A thrilling musical, with comedy and romantic undertones and of coures the realife connection with the great tragdy. You will be sadden and inspired everytime you listen to it. Of course it is nothing in comparison to a stage production. If you can see it live, do so, if you can't buy the cd and try to picture it. Great to listen to in the car or home working on your pc. I recomend this to either the broadway fan or the everyday music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fine.","review":"I'm still laughing at the reviews from people who count themselves as experts because they've seen \\"Phantom\\" and \\"Les Miz.\\" (So, discovered Broadway in the mid-80s, huh?)

This is a MUST buy item for anyone who is a Broadway fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This soundtrack is so boring and not worth anhyones money. I have seen numerous tony winning plays and heard their music. This is way towards the bottom of good music. First off, it is terribly unoriginal. Did someone say Les Miz? The music is the same. However if you are looking for a nap, listen to this... it'll bore you to death. The reason why i gave this two stars is because it has two good aspects. The orchestrations are really nice, but do not hide the poor score. Secondly, there is one good song, that song is \\"There She Is\\". This song is nice and song well. It is the sole reason why i bought the darn CD. I later figured it was not worth it. So don't waste your money on this CD, simply settle on one of your mom's lullaby"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion.","review":"I am a bit baffled by those who enjoy this musical.

Are you kidding me? That's the whole problem. There is no character development. They introduce you to a million characters, then kill them.

Even if it's onsale for a penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"profoundly disappointing","review":"I do not understand the hype. The lyrics occasionally rise to the innocuous, but usually hover nearer to doggerel. Innapropriate adjectives apppear to make lines scan, and sentence structure is tortured to force rhyme. The music is a weak imitation of Sweeney Todd, but without a tune I can recall. Of course, I heard this cd at a disadvantage -- the stereo was turned on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most amazing thing I've ever seen and heard","review":"I got the Titanic C.D. over a year ago--and I saw the show for my first time over a year ago as well, and I never wrote a review. This C.D. is spellbinding. It's absolutely incredible, and the awesome actors will have you bawling by the second act when they promise, \\"We'll meet tomorrow!\\" Highlights on this recording for me are: Victoria Clark as the hilarious second class passenger and social climber Alice Beane, Michael Cerveris as Mr. Andrews (wow...), Brian d'Arcy James as Stoker Barrett (he has the most amazing voice), Jennifer Peich as Kate McGowan the third class passenger aspiring for a better life, and Alma Cuervo as Mrs. Ida Strauss (she made me bawl). Michael Mulheren and Robin Irwin also make a wonderful and heartbreaking Mr. and Mrs. Thayer. This is a musical that will be around for a long time (I know from seeing it on stage three times--each time more thrilling than the last), and so will this C.D.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not available in the U.K","review":"Titanic (1997 Original Broadway Cast)is not easily available in the U.K.,having not, I understand, been performed on the professional stage here.

Yeston's score for Titanic is truly one of the most awful scores in history to walk away with the prize. While Yeston's music for Grand Hotel and Phantom were nowhere near excellent, they certainly surpassed this lousy creation.

The music and the lyrics that were written by Maury Yeston reach you and touch your heart. The music is the best I have ever heard from any musical.

We bought it, knowing that it would be bad, but were we ever surprised. It isn't worth the jewel case it was sold in. It isn't worth the part of a tree the liner notes were printed on. The plastic of the CD would be better used to attach labels to underwear. All you need to see to understand the quality of this music, is the cover of this CD. Look at it. No, look at it now. Enlarge it as much as your computer will allow. Gaze at the tragic face of the lead singer and his three tragic friends scowling backup.

(So much better than sweeping!) It gets the job done quickly and easily. The flip-down crevasse tool is handy for targeted suction. Since my operation time is short, I have no problem with the battery life and it takes a long time to fill up the vacuum bag. My only complaint is the noise, I don't know if other models are any quieter but I definitely can't run this with someone asleep in the other room and I can't imagine using it for longer periods of time (like cleaning a car) - but I would use a real vacuum for bigger jobs anyway. Overall I am very happy and I will definitely get another one to keep the garage area clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less desirable dirt devil model","review":"This handheld was not as powerful as others I have owned.

A 14 minute wait on hold for DirtDevil customer service resulted in being told that the CSR could not locate the filter part number from the owner's instruction sheet, nor could she find the part through a search. I had already tried to order the filters online from DirtDevil, but they weren't available.

It holds a charge longer and doesn't take as long to recharge when it runs down. It is also smaller and lighter. It's great that the attachments are right on the vac itself, less chance of losing them.

I knew enough about the historical context to be engrossed in the story, but not enough to be bothered by some of the small errors or omissions that troubled other reviewers here. Dean's characters drew me in from the first page, and I was reluctant to put the book down. Every single character was flawed, sometimes deeply, and yet compelling. The blurb on the back of the book marvelled at the balance Dean achieved in treating the two sides of the conflict. I would agree, though if pressed I would say she's a bit gentler with the Catholics. But only a bit. I thought I foresaw the climax of the story, and I was thoroughly wrong. That's not the only mark of a good read, but it's on the list. If the premise of this book interests you, it is well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better living through Taoism","review":"Hua-Ching Ni is a practicing Taoist and a doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine of long standing. This title is a sampler of the many books he has written on the Taoist tradition in English. The contents are well-chosen and offer a delightful and inspiring selection of readings on how this ancient wisdom applies to everyday life. This is not a book of flowery language or abstract metaphysics, but is, rather, a primer on how to improve one's life. It reads easily in nice, bite-size morsels. I enjoyed this book and highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book for starting taoists","review":"This book is an anthology of Ni's many works with articles ranging from the practical to those of deep spiritual importance.

A majority of this book is new age platitudes and has nothing to do with Taoism...Of course if the reader knows nothing about Taoism they would be unable to recognize this fact. Mr. Ni reports that his Taoist linage is far back, yet he tells the reader absolutly nothing of where he learned what he supposedly is an \\"achieved\\" Taoist master is or from... Otherwords his credentials are self reported. Another funny thing is that his entire family are also \\"experts\\"..owning a herb business and school and a cult in California... do a little reasearch before you buy this or any other Ni book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I was concerned this would interfere with a wifi network.

I don't know. My personal experience with this album was unpleasant. Glen Velez wrote some facinating music with some very serious new-age philosophy to back it up. I truly understand where he wanted to go. Personally, this album missed it for me. My chakras (?) did not react the way the music intended. My reaction was contrary to the design of the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discoveries series book this time on Shakespeare","review":"i love this series of books, most have been biographies of famous artists and statesmen, and a few actors and writers...like this one. William Shakespeare, i had a class in high school reading his plays, now i don't read plays at all anymore. still he wrote (or so we think) the best ones in the English language. this book is also about his times and customs of the day and age in which he wrote. i love history and this is a great way to learn it, so far every one of the books in this series is so full of artwork and information and so easy to read and understand that i think that if i have a fire in my room...i would want to save these 40 books of the Discoveries series just so i can understand history and rebuild. i really recommend every one of these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Secrets Here","review":"I have read many books on running. This is by far the worst. Elite runners give you their training routines. This would be OK if one were an elite runner. Some examples are: easy day run ten miles at 6:00 minute per mile pace.

However, I\`m preparing myself for two presentations in two doctoral seminars. I was hoping this book help me to prepare. It is clearly, for me, pretty weak philosophically. You don\`t have any interest to read Foucault by reading this, neither it opens you on the important subjects of this authors. I stop after 2 chapters, what is a honest chance to give to a book. The second chapter of the book, entitled Politics, focus on the personal involvement of Foucault in politics and its problem with Sartre on that matter. I understand that life and subject are interelated with Foucault, but I don\`t want to read a biography! Give me the real stuff, what is his damn theory of power! What his understanding of politic is! I can\`t believe they permit to publish such scrap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In addition to the reviews below","review":"This coveted album remains one of the highlights of my extensive music collection. In addition to the -very helpful- reviews below, I would add that the sound quality is truly amazing for a recording dating back to 1960 (!). Sound staging is superb and the tone is crisp and never raspy. On a decent stereo set you can experience an uncanny feeling of 'being there'. How many opera's have you listened lately that also possess such a magnificent attribute?The reason for this is intelligent remastering of the state-of-the-art master tapes, in an attempt to get as much out of the compact disc-medium as possible. RCA has re-released a lot of old treasures from there archive under the lable 'Living Stereo'. All were given the 'Living Stereo' remastering treatment. Do your ears a favor, and check them out! The artists, as will illustrate this magnificent 'Traviata' set, were no mean players as well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice performances, bad recording","review":"Anna Moffo is a perfect blend of lyric and coloratura soprano that is ideal for Violetta.

Once you fall for a singer and her voice, she usually can charm you in to another round. I am so happy I went for this one.This is what you call \\"happy music\\". For those who are looking for a lesson from Berklee music school, try jazz.Otherwise, her arrangements are very well matched to her style, and her voice.

My only issue is that the song as it is sung in the movie is slightly different than the CD version. I have watched the movie so many times, I sing all their \\"heys\\" and \\"ha's\\" but get tripped up since the CD is another recording. Why would you do that? At any rate, its still a good CD and movie, so its certainly worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"a couple of good tracks","review":"I heard \\"Cruising\\" on the radio and thought this CD would be great. Unfortunately, I felt that two or three of the songs are excellent. The others, well you can go down to your local Kareoke bar and tape that, it would be just as good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's your email, T-LEE?","review":"Fun movie, great music! The song missing, T-LEE, is \\"Rock n Roll, Part 2\\", also known as \\"The Hockey Song\\". I've always been a fan of Huey Lewis, and his \\"Cruisin'\\" duet with Gwenneth shows that she's a great singer, too. Maria Bello holds her own with \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and \\"I Can't Make You Love Me\\", but the real surprise is Paul Giamatti. I would have never dreamed that he could sing, and in fact thought that his part was dubbed until I saw the credits. It made the film that much more enjoyable the second time around to know all these guys (except Andre Braugher) were singing their own songs. Good job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what a GREAT cd...","review":"...what was especially nice is that the cd arrived in the mail just as i returned home from seeing the movie. (the movie, by the way, was terrific, too-- and not just Gwynth-- all the actors!) i was able to play it right away...and it was amazing how it brought me back to scenes in the flick...BUT even if you don't see the movie-- even if you don't like kareoke -- this is a great mix of tunes with a great mix of voices..very, very special."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!

I still can;t beleive that Gwyneth Paltrow can sing as well as she did for this. Huey lewis is Superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Is What It Is","review":"This album is a compilation from the movie of the same name. The vocal ranges and abilities of the artists are pretty much what you heard in the movie. If you enjoyed the movie and the singing in the movie, you will enjoy the CD. Know that, before purchasing this CD, that the music professionals sing like professionals and the actors who are only acting like music professionals sing are less so."},{"rating":"2","title":"DUETS is a DELIGHT!","review":"The Movie DUETS is a splendid movie that was sorely underrated at the box office. Great performances all around, esp. from Paul Giamatti(sp?) & Andre Braugher...When they sing \\"Try A Little Tenderness\\", they light up the screen. I knew I'd like this movie when I saw the previews. Yes, it does lag in some parts, but it has more than enough laughs & genuinely touching moments to make up for it. If U can't catch the movie in theaters, rent the video/DVD as soon as it comes out. The soundtrack itself is great relaxing music that'll have you singing along with the classics covered in the movie. My fave is Gweneth Paltrow & Babyface singing, \\"Just My Imagination\\". DUETS makes you remember why we love music they way we do...BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't forget the best","review":"I have read the reviews and most of them touched on the Gweneth and Maria Bello aspects. But, can anyone honestly say that they don't have tears just streaming during the rendetion of Freebird? That was a wonderful recording of the song and I am still enjoying it now. I also want to say that yes the Huey and Gweneth storyline was interesting and also one dimensional. The Scott and Maria storyline had a little more going for it, but, it was the Paul and Andre storyline that made me love the movie. Sorry, but there it is. A great combination. One of my favorite lines in the whole movie is where Paul says to Andre \\" You can get cigarettes there\\" and off they go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack of the year!","review":"This is a brilliant soundtrack.Who would've thought that GWYNETH PALTROW can sing ?

I'm not at all disappointed. Huey Lewis is as good as he ever was, and Paltrow is a surprise. The other artists on the Soundtrack are capable and it just brought the movie back to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three cheers to Maria Bello!","review":"While Paltrow stays nice but a little bit weak as a singer, Maria Bello got me. Her \\"Sweet Inspiration\\" is an as great performance as \\"I can't make you love me\\" is. The other songs are good, too and it is a quite interesting thing that the actors sing by themselves and do not let other give them their voice. At least on this album they do not have to hide their own voices..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"The singing in the movie was surprisingly good. Of course Huey Lewis can sing, although his big hits had a complex band texture backing them. Not only is Gwyneth Paltrow a good singer for an actress, she's actually a surprisingly good singer.But the show-stealer is Arnold McCuller every time he sings, particularly with \\"Freebird\\". It was a disappointment to hear that Andre Braugher (an actor with a great spoken voice) had to be dubbed, but McCuller is first-rate.That said, I'm not sure how well the CD stands on its own -- it ties back to the movie and if you haven't seen the movie the CD is just a bunch of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"This is such a great cd, way better than expected too. great songs by good artist, though actors they do sing very well. one of the best crusin and soothing cds i've bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duets worth a try!","review":"I bought this CD after hearing a sampling from a local radio station. Although the track with Huey Lewis is on the current play list, the duet with Babyface (Just My Imagination) is better. I tolerated Bette Davis Eyes, and most of the other tracks are worth listening to. Gweneth Paltrow is definately a talented person."},{"rating":"1","title":"They didn't pull it off!","review":"Gwyneth Paltrow does have a sweet, mid-range voice, however, when I heard her attempt at \\"Betty Davis Eyes\\" I wanted to turn my head and look at the floor as you would at the Karaoke bar when someone isn't quite hitting it.

This 1997 Broadway revival manaages to be such a mish mash of styles that it's not in the running to be considered even a halfhearted success. The Candide is sung by a punchy, lightweight Broadway tenor out of \\"42nd Street,\\" the Cunegonde is flat out operatic, without the slightest hint of a smile (she's an atrocious mismatch with Candide), and Pangloss is the usual creaky character actor with scant singing voice.There's no need to continue about the rewrites and reorchestrations, none of them sactioned by the composer. Look elswhere for a Candide that's truer to the spirit of the original, beginning with the classic cast album on Sony with Barbara Cook at ehr best and the rousing Robert Rounseville in the title role."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP-OFF","review":"WHEN I GOT THIS IT SAID 2.5 CARET WEIGHT.

It's about a witch who heals people; when she's not healing people she's thinking about being a witch and healing people. Seriously, that's it. That's all there is to it. The fact that she's a witch that can heal is supposed to be like, some huge secret, as she faces getting burned at the stake, but apparently the instant something's in need of healing she forgets that--I swear, she'll heal anything in sight!The so-called \\"romance\\" between this chick and this married a-hole nobleman seemed pretty nonexistent and not really worth mentioning.

The old and the new, tradition and innovation greet each other in the perfect blend, in which the whisper of a flute marries the tingle of a jazz piano and everything just sounds totally new and totally unique!I feel privileged to have been allowed to enter the mystical world of Mr. De Grassi and Mr. Cruz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty Bolivian Music With A Jazz Twist!","review":"Wow!

It seems grainy much like a picture that was blown far beyond its native resolution. I have never seen a blu ray quite this poor. I would not recommend buying this on blu ray, save yourself a couple dollars and buy it on dvd or audio alone. The audio quality on this disc however, is excellent. I just wish the video could have been up to par. As for the performances, they are all excellent. I did notice that Dave Mustaine's vocals seem to be a little off and heard that he overdubbed them. If that is the case, you might as well buy a milli vanilli or britanny spears record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Lars Ulrich performance ever!","review":"Good shows all four.But I never saw a Metallica video where Lars Ulrich is simply destroying ALL the songs!

In this tale, the princess faces problems that vary between tricky and seemingly impossible. She becomes a heroine by keeping her head and using her mind to figure out the answer to each dilemma with grace, logic, and ingenuity, which is a valuable lesson for girls AND boys. In addition, the world that Jay Williams creates for his story is rich in mythic settings and creatures that really bring it to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful message especially for little girls","review":"I've enjoyed this book since I was a kid and my little daughter loves it. I particularly like it because it inverts the traditional roles of prince and princess but in a sweet, non preachy way.

Tara is given the assignment to go in and get Ruslan Malikov and his son Stepan. It is a vicious mission; where she barely makes it home herself. Once again Tara and another minder are sent on a treacherous journey to Afghanistan to convince Ruslan not to return home.

My advice, after buying and using this vacuum, is spend the extra money to buy a better vacuum, this one is useless! Now, I not only wasted my money on this vacuum, I will now have to go out and get a new one. It doesn't pick up anything, the hose and the attachments are not long enough and the swivel casters do not make this vacuum easier to push. I found it is very difficult to push.

This vacuum has great power, I was suprised to see what I picked up from 1 room alone! My home feels much cleaner, I can even feel the difference in the air! I have suffered from allergies all summer and after I cleaned my home over the weekend with this vacuum, I have been breathing easier and have felt great!

I am constantly vacuuming due to the shedding of the 85LB golden retriever I own. After one week of using this machine, I noticed the suction power starting to decrease. The machine would not pick up clumps of dog hair....just after one week of having the machine. I contacted the manufacturer to make sure I had the machine put together correctly, which I did. The machine has continued to work at a minimal satisfaction level. Recently, my golden retriever ripped up a bag of plant dirt and got it all over my living room carpet. I vacuumed the dirt up and now the machine is not working at all. A vacuum cleaner should not break just from vacuuming up dirt!!! I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst product ever","review":"This was the biggest mistake in a purchase i have ever made. The product is very cheaply made and pieces do not fit together well. the plastic clip to hold the eletric cord broke the first month.

Then, after 1 month, the belt broke,- no big deal really, but it broke again after another month, another, and so on. It was extremely difficult to fix the belt- I'm no stranger to changing a vacuum cleaner belt, either, but after 2 hours of trying to pull the loop on and fasten it down, I realized I had to wait until my husband came home from business to help me. NOW I've had this vacuum one year and the motor has shot, there is no suction - I'm just a suck-er I guess for 90.00 what can I expect. I did have a Hoover for the same price range before this one that lasted 5 years with no problems at all. I am not going through this again. I am going to research what vacuum is best, probably pay quadrouple and never buy dirt devil again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and convenient to use","review":"First, I should tell you that I live in a one bedroom apartment, and while I have a dog the vacuum doesn't have to do real hard duty. The two downsides to this vacuum are its dirt container, mentioned elsewhere, which is impossible to empty cleanly (but I suspect this would be true for any bagless vacuum, to a certain extent) and the fact that the hose attachment and tools are rather short if you need to do really high jobs.On the flip side, this is among the lightest of all bagless upright vacuums, and it moves effortlessly. It weighs at least 10lbs less than the other models I looked at. Further, the rather standard 12 amp motor does an exceptional job of getting ALL dirt. Add this to a reasonable price, and this is a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"My first bagless vac. I haven't had trouble with anything on this and I've had it for over a year! The only down side is empting the container. It gets very dusty which makes for another mess. I agree that empting outside is the best bet. I also have to vacuum the filter to get all of the dirt out.Overall, for the price of this product, it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"What a disappointment! It's really hard to push on thick nap carpet and doesn't pick up on low nap. The cannister is really messy to empty and you must empty it frequently. The hose is too short and while using the hose, the vacuum repeatedly tips over and whacks you. I've been disappointed in it from the beginning and now after less than a year, the motor is burnt out. You'd be better off spending a little more and getting something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 4 Months","review":"Don't be fooled as I was with this vacuum. Oh, it worked great for almost four months, then the beater bar broke. Called Target, NO Help. It was past their 90 return policy. No problem, vacuum warranted for 3 years by Dirt Devil, NOT. Only some parts are under warranty according to Dirt Devil. They didn't say what parts where warranted. I called the Target Store in Bridgeport WV, talked to Chris. He was very unconcerned about my problem and offered no solution. Dirt devel also seemed to think they were not responsible for my problem and were very unconcerned as well. Looking for a reliable vacuum ? Shop where you have been treated well before when problems arrive. If you are having problems like I did check with your state consumer's board.

It is impossible to empty the dirt container without getting a good dusting of what you have just vacuumed up all over you, and the filters are IMPOSSIBLE to find. I have to keep banging my filter on the ground outside to dislodge the dirt because I have yet to find somewhere that sells the filters (I have owned this vacuum for 2 years)If you have a small area to clean, no pets and unlimited time to spend on the internet searching for filters, buy this vacuum.

All combinations have produced the same terrible soggy popcorn. I've even tried pouring all of the popped corn into a large bowl and giving it time to dry off, but still the popcorn is terrible.

First, the washable center plate is fragile and can break easily. Second, the company's customer support is terrible. I ordered a replacement from the Cuisinart Webstore, but they did not pack it properly so it was broken during shipping. They refunded the price of the plate ($10), but would not refund the shipping and handling ($5.95) or the return shipping for the plate broken because of their poor packing ($8.45). I would not recommend buying any products from them. I am out $14.40 and have nothing to show for it except my original cracked plate. I contacted several departments of theirs and received no reply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soggy Popcorn","review":"My review is consistent with the other negative reviews. The idea to make perfect popcorn in a serving bowl is genius. Also the easy clean design is a must. The only problem is the soggy, styrofoam like texture of the popcorn. After chewing several mouthfuls, my jaw began to ache. Perhaps I'm getting these results due to highly humid area in which I live. Nevertheless, I retuned this product to the retail outlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID CUISINART TEST THIS PRODUCT BEFORE THEY PUT IT ON THE MARKET?","review":"I received this popcorn maker as a gift and I have to say I agree with all the other negative feedback that others have written. This machine is awkward to use, messy, requires extra cleaning as the bowl that comes with the machine is tall and narrow so you will probably want to use a wider bowl if you are adding butter to be able to toss the popcorn. Yes, there is a very unpleasant taste to the popcorn-maybe it comes from the nonstick coating Cuisinart has used and yes, the popcorn has a weird texture. Another downside is that you are required to use oil for popping corn, something you don't need to use with a microwave or hot air popcorn popper."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a huge disappointment!","review":"I was so excited to buy this popcorn popper. Our microwave popcorn keeps burning and I worry about the amount of oil in the packages. There must be something better out there!

So, naturally, I got one of these (as a gift, actually). First bowl was soggy, and had a very strange taste. Tried another, with different popcorn and a new bottle of oil. Same results. Maybe some manufacturing coating? I washed it very well, made three more bowls, and no change. Surely I'm doing something wrong, they couldn't possibly have sent out a popcorn popper that gives results like this. So I try to contact customer service. In a few days (!) I receive a form email back that had no relation to my problems (soggy popcorn with a strange taste). I tried, really I did, and when Cuisinart wouldn't even respond to my problems, I just packed it up and sent it back.

You would know this if they had not removed all of the past reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We tried this popper after having the West Bend Stir Crazy. We were shocked at how bad the popcorn tasted with the Cuisinart versus the West Bend. We don't like how the non-stick coating comes off of the West Bend, but we are going back to it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I assumed because this is Cuisinart that this would be a great product and worth the $50.00. It has turned out to be a total waste of money.The design is poor because there are no vent holes in the top of the popper so it fills with condensation which in turn makes the popcorn soggy. Im pretty ingenious so I thought that if I drilled a few holes myself in the top this would take care of the problem. It did not help at all. I tried several types of kernels to see if that would help the situation and it did not. I use coconut oil always and did not change that. I think because the surface area of the popper is much smaller then other poppers that contributes to the problem. I never had a problem with the traditional dome top poppers and im going back to that style."},{"rating":"1","title":"spongy popcorn, nonstick wears off","review":"The non-stick surface rubbed off after 4 uses - the stir stick that rotates the popcorn scraped it off.Poor design - the steam gets trapped and makes the popcorn spongy.I threw it away and am now back to the air popper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed","review":"I received this item for Christmas and had to return after the first use. When I went to the store to exchange it, I discovered that there were a lot of people returning them due to a design flaw. The handles where the top and the plates snap together break very easily. If it breaks, which mine did on the first try, you can't use it. Although we also used less oil than it called for, the popcorn came out oily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this popper!","review":"Thought I had found a quality popcorn popper when I found this but it only worked for about a year or so and then the spinner stopped spinning. When I contacted Cuisinart they asked for money just to ask a question. Of course I paid nothing more to them. They offer no support or repairs for their products. I highly recommend to everyone to stay away from Cuisinart products altogether. Who wants to buy a product from a company that runs from the people who pay them?There is a 'LIMITED' 3 year warranty on the product if you want to ship it off to New Jersey for an additional fee of $10 plus postage. It's not worth it to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Hopes were Dashed","review":"I was so excited when I rec'd this popcorn popper as a gift. It seemed like such a great idea for a frequent popcorn popper like myself. And I thought anything made by Cuisinart would be quality! I was wrong on two counts. The plastic top does not allow steam to vent so the popcorn gets soggy AND then the oil drips thru the center of the hotplate onto the hot coils below and causes quite a mess. I finally threw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, soggy popcorn!","review":"I was excited about this machine, too. But the reviews are right, it makes soggy popcorn. I thought about drilling holes in the top of plastic to let the steam escape, but then why should I pay $50 for something that doesn't work properly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst popcorn ever!","review":"Received this as a gift some time ago and after my son told me how much better fresh popped corn tastes I bought some popcorn, and buttery popping oil, both Orville's Then I broke out the popper and followed manufacturer's instructions to the letter. It popped the corn quickly, but it smelled funny and the popcorn was tough, chewy and tasted very stale. I thought maybe it was because it was the first batch. so I popped another. Same results. Called my son to ask what I could be doing wrong, but he had no idea (he pops his on the stove). I was planning on trying some different oil and popcorn, but then I read these reviews, so I won't bother. At least now I know it isn't just me. BIG disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke for a second time","review":"After using the machine for about 3 months the heating element broke. Cuisinart supplied us with a new unit but within 3 months the machine broke again. I would strong suggest buying a different popcorn maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good ideas but ultimately does not work well...","review":"I am a popcorn afficiando and was hoping that the Cuisinart would be a bit heavier duty than my well working but not very durable Presto Stir-Crazy.Pros:1.Removable/dishwashable cooking plate and cover. - It is great to be able to wash all of the cooking surfaces in the dishwasher.2. Non-stick coasting seems better than most.Cons:1. No steam vent holes! - Popcorn loses its crunch and is chewy.2. Tall and narrow design- Good for storage. Bad for popping corn. Popped corn gets stacked on the top of the unpopped corn however the popper gets a bit bogged down with the taller stack of corn weighing on the stirring rod.3. Non-stick coating does eventually scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk -- Cuisinart terrible customer service","review":"I ordered this in Sept. 2005, and during the first use, it stopped working. I immediately called Cuisinart customer service for a replacement -- not only do I have to pay to send back the hunk of junk, but I also have to pay for them to ship the new item. BUT WAIT -- IT GETS BETTER! I finally got the replacement March 2006 and am told that my three year warranty on the new product begins a month before I bought the original hunk of junk! Because they took their sweet time, I have lost nearly 7 months of warranty time for an item I bought and have yet to use it one complete time successfully! They told me that there was absoultely nothing they could do about it. UNBELIEVABLE -- talk about terrible customer service policies. That is the last time I am fooled by Cuisinart (Conair) -- I will never buy another product from them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish Zero Stars was an option","review":"If you like wet soggy popcorn and gadgets that make life tougher, this is the toy for you! It holds in all the steam so when you flip over the handy dandy now-it's-a-lid, now-it's-a-bowl gizmo, your popcorn is sitting in a puddle of water. We've had ours three weeks and the handle broke already so you have to hold it down while the popcorn pops, otherwise the auto-shut off kicks in. If anyone wants one for free, it will be out on the curb with the rest of my trash this week. It's so not worth sending in for repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This product is great in theory only. The promise of getting the taste and crunch of a pan-popped corn was a pipe dream. The design is poor. The lid traps the steam inside during the cooking process and results in tough, rubbery, styrofoam-textured corn. Plus, the popped corn had a weird taste that is indescribable.We are loyal Cuisinart customers and have used the same model coffee maker for over 10 years. When one wears out, we quickly purchase another of the same. We were very shocked that Cuisinart developed such an under-performing product. And, as popcorn lovers, our disappointment was huge."},{"rating":"1","title":"No soggy popcorn, BUT!","review":"We have not had a problem with soggy popcorn or bad smells, but our popper shuts off on some kind of internal overload after two batches. The last time it went off halfway through the second batch. It does cool off and starts working again, but it takes about five to seven minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Chewy Popcorn","review":"I was very disappointed in this item. I have other Cuisinart appliances and thought this one would live up to Cuisinart's excellence. I was wrong. So much steam builds up in the cover/bowl during popping that the popcorn gets wet, resulting in chewy popcorn. Not crisp at all. I've tried 3 different oils and 3 different types of kernels and there has been no difference. The instruction book does suggest putting the popped popcorn on a cookie sheet in the oven for 15 minutes after popping for better flavor. This does make the popcorn more crisp and does make it taste much better. I will no longer eat the popcorn without following this step. It really does help the taste. Unfortunately, my popping process is now about 20 minutes instead of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Like some of the other reviewers I too love most Cuisinart products, but I am not fond of this one. First it only makes a small amount of popcorn if you are using Black Jewel or Blue Mountain popcorn,something to do with the dense kernels I guess,also I had a bad connection on the popper plate after only the first use and have to put it together just right or it does not work.The design is a little dangerous in my opinion since you have to flip the hot plate over into a bowl, definitely not kid user friendly. The popcorn is not very tasty unless you doctor it up with lots of salt, butter or other seasonings. I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always Breaks....stay away from this product","review":"I have two homes both with this popcorn maker....we like how it pops, but each have broken within several weeks of use ( failed to heat), then I replaced them and those too broke, I then had Cuisinart send me news ones ( had to pay to ship ) and they too broke. I found a microwave popcorn maker at Target for $10 that works just as well and there are no parts to break. Very poorly manufactured.....made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"It makes Great Popcorn but this is my third Cuisinart CPM-800 in the past 2 weeks because they break so easily!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes bad popcorn - bad designed unit","review":"I have tried many different types of popcorn oil and popcorn kernels to get a good tasting popcorn out of this unit. But all attempts failed. What it comes down to is this, the unit traps the steam from the popping process inside the clear plastic bowl that becomes your dispensing bowl. A Quote from another reviewer here, L ODonnell, said this \\"tough, rubbery, styrofoam-textured corn. Plus, the popped corn had a weird taste\\" hits the results of what you get right on the head. The unit looks great but has bad function as its designed purpose in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soggy, Smelly Popcorn","review":"I am a little confused by any rating over 1 star! I have to agree with most - this simply does NOT work! The steam builds up and my husband, who usually eats most anything, would not eat the popcorn because it tasted funny.Back to the Whirley!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great and classic film!","review":"This is a beatifully done film. Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby are reunited in it. The costumes are beautiful. The acting isn't the best, but the songs are very good.

Adding to the atmosphere of torpor is the laziness of the composer, Irving Berlin -- he trots out dozens of his old hits, while his new originals are totally forgettable. Fred Astaire was a late addition to the cast, which may explain his having the worst role of his entire career -- that of a seedy also-ran playboy who ends up crippled for life after a drunken fall.

I own a lot of concert DVD's and Blu-Ray titles and this is the worst sounding one of them all. I literally couldn't finish the concert because of the poor sound quality of this blu-ray.

Solid action scenes throughout. Good acting by most and a compelling story. Movie is about he Russian invasion of the former Soviet republic of Georgia. A very pro Western country that wants into the EU and NATO. The media enjoyed ignoring this little war at the time because we were bogged down in Iraq and Russia knew this when they decided to invade. The people of Georgia were left to be slaughterd alone fighting Russian agression as this movie shows. This movie deserves much more press than it is getting. Its no DieHard but true real life ussually isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda movie","review":"This is a propaganda movie about the Georgia-Russian war. The movie attempts to show the Georgian president as a goody two shoes western freedom fighter against the cruel Russian bullies. It goes as far as revision of history to say that the Russians started the war.Aside from the political aspects, the movie is somewhat cheesy but all in all entertaining. The main character is not very likable, Val Kilmer appears in very short stints only and the character is not developed, then there is the cheesy GI Joe Georgian soldier that keeps appearing at critical moments out of nowhere busting windows and saving the day and always seems to win and do the honarable thing against all odds!The Russians are shown as blood thirsty militia, cruel and unprofessional.I would not recommend this movie. It's very forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad script, bad acting, not a grain of truth","review":"Cheaply made flick created on government's money. Very bad acting and illogical script.

Another shortcoming is that there are no interviews or any extra footage.It is funny to hear Pavarotti sing a pop tune as it is equally funny to see a pop singer with virtually no voice doing \\"O Sole Mio\\", but if it is all in good spirit and for charity, then it is enjoyable.If you are intersted in European music scene or simply love Pavarotti, this tape will be a great treat for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Bought this CD after having received Duets as a gift. I was looking for a similarly well done blending of artistic styles. This, however, was a disappointment. Skunk Anansie's songs were little more than off tune screeching. And, while I like Tracy Chapman, she should never have been paired with Pavarotti at least not without the benefit of studio editing. There were some bright spots, like Savage Garden, but not enough to make this a CD I will listen to again. Not even Pavarotti whom I love could save this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Hot!","review":"Charo is very impressive - there is intense passion when she plays classical style guitar.

Schubert was working on a 10th symphony when he died, and in Rendering, Berio does a superb job of taking those fragments and turning it into a wonderfully satisfying work. The liner stresses this isn't a completion of the symphony, and that's true -- gaps in the music are filled with a soft web of abstract sounds. But emotionally, it feels like a complete symphony: something that combines the energy of the 9th with the darkness of the 8th, ending up very much in an upbeat, major key mood. The melodies are as strong as any Schubert work -- they'll stay with you forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A live taste demonstrating a versatility of styles.","review":"Live renditions of 3 different songs with different musical styles.

Starting to do more and more food shopping on Amazon now that we signed up for Prime.Open a can of BarHarbor and just smell the juice. You'd swear they just came out of the ocean...by far the best tasting clams I've ever had. Tastes and smells like they were just harvested.

Those songs are what gave the movie some punch and feeling, they are important to the film. I also noted that there are bogus photos in the CD jacket and one of the pictures of the players has been flipped, so his number reads 18 instead of 81.The jokers who created this CD should be ashamed of themselves for duping people into believing that this piece of plastic had something to do with the movie.

With the Tea Drop, we can share a pot of tea and when we're finished, the clean-up is so easy. The removable tea tray allows the product to be cleaned within seconds. The adjustable tea strength is a great touch, as well (although I'll admit we both like our tea strong - we've only tried the weaker tea a few times - but it's accurate!

The only feature I wish it had was a stop and pour option like many coffee makers have.

The only thing I now use it for filling my hot water bottle in the winter. However, if you still think your going to buy it, check it out in walmart it's wayyy cheaper there by at least by $10-15!!**Update** I've found if you can let the faucet run for a while to get the water pretty hot then add it to the tea maker then it actually brews a pretty hot cup of tea!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying this ! ! ! ! ! ! !","review":"Don't waste your money.This makes awful, bitter tea.

A burned residue frequently has to be scrubbed from the bottom of the pot if the second cup is not consumed within a half hour.The screen that is supposed to allow the unit to be used with loose teas (instead of with just teabags) broke on just the second washing. the insert used with the teabags is hard to clean.All in all, this has nothing over a nice ceramic teapot with an insulated tea cozy.

It makes an excellent cup of tea, works equally well with bags or loose tea (no more clunky--and leaky--infusers), and keeps your tea nice and hot. Despite the fact that the water is not technically boiling and it doesn't actually steep for five minutes, it produces as strong and as flavorful a cup of tea as I used to get with my old \\"brown betty.\\" Above all, it's easy to use and fast, fast, fast.

This is especially evident when you brew certain teas like genmaicha, which are Japanese green tea with roasted rice.

I make several pots a day and would not like to be without this machine, because it saves time and effort.I agree that it doesn't work well for coarse cut loose tea... it comes out weak - unless you use double the amount, which is wasteful. I have not tried fine cut loose tea with this machine so I don't know how that would be.

For those of you who say the tea doesn't steep enough I have an easy solution. If you use tea bags simply put them in the pot and the tea will be just right by the time the water has all reached the pot. For loose tea users, just use a metal mesh tea ball, put your loose tea in it and hang the ball in the pot. Once the water has all reached the pot the tea is just right. If you like your tea stronger, just leave the teabags or tea ball in the pot to steep until the tea is the way you like it. This is so simple and a lot easier than boiling water and fiddling with tea pots, etc. This is much faster. I have owned this for about 6 weeks and I use it every day.

It seems to have the same burners and wattage as a smaller oven but has a larger compartment, which means it takes longer to get the job done. Aside from that the controls are sturdy and it is attactive. It also toasts very well. But speed is sometimes a factor in the morning rush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toasts okay, but two big problems","review":"I purchased this toaster oven five years ago. It toasts okay, and is easy to clean, but there are two big problems.A few months after purchase, we started having problems with the door closing. It wouldn't close all the way. I contacted Cuisinart, and they said I had to pay to ship in back, and pay for them to ship a new one. No thanks - I might as well buy a new one (I didn't).We learned to live with it; usually after a few tries we can get it to close. However, I've noticed that whatever is coating the back wall of the oven is flaking off. It's obviously because of the heat. It hasn't gotten on our food, but it's disconcerting all the same. I will be replacing this toaster oven with a different brand. Cooks Illustrated likes the Hamilton Beach Set & Forget, which is about $5 more than this one, so I'll be trying that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I purchased this toaster oven in 2006 and it is still working great in 2012.

Yes, I can still remember those days... but, like another reviewer said, the door quit staying closed. After a few weeks of irritation, I removed a screw from the device that keeps it open. No more problem and more great toast. Then after about a year of moderate use, the dang thing just up and decided that it, not me would decide what temperature to cook things at when baking (and it tended to like about 500 degrees. There are not many recipes that call for 500 degrees, especially for a toaster oven. Toast was a similar random process, but the toaster liked both undercooking and overcooking.One important piece of advice for those seeking a toaster/oven- toasters make toast faster than toaster ovens, and this toaster oven makes toast slower than other toaster ovens because it's pretty large (for a toaster oven).Should a $100 device last longer than a year? I guess it depends on whether you ask an appliance manufacturer or a consumer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This oven is a piece of junk. Within 6 months of use, the door started misbehaving (as so many other reviewers mention). Once I closed the door a little forcefully, and the handle broke. I called Cuisinart, and they offered me a replacement but they asked me to pay for shipping both ways. This is my first and last Cuisinart item.UPDATE: Cuisinart sent me a newer version of the oven after I complained to them. They have changed the design: the handle is different now, and there is a click when you shut the oven door -- most probably, they have changed the door closing mechanism. So far the new one is behaving OK, but my fingers remain crossed :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was ever a case for allowing zero-star reviews, this is it!","review":"I've never written a review here but was compelled to do so as I need to do my part to lower the overall \\"star rating\\" for this piece of garbage. As with most negative reviews here, the door on ours started to fail after several months of use. It baked & toasted OK (not great, especially toasting), but the door began to need slamming to get it to shut, and just tonight my wife got frustrated and broke the handle while slamming it. It is now resting in our garbage can and awaiting delivery to the local landfill. This was my first and last Cuisinart purchase. Cusinart company is riding the brand's reputation but it's only a matter of time before their crappy manufacturing and quality standards catch up to them. Thanks to the other reviewer for pointing out that they merged with ConAir and lowered their quality - I had no idea! What was I thinking spending over $80 to make toast and cook fish sticks and pizza bagels, anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine was broken","review":"My unit arrived missing the arm that connects the door to the toaster-oven (it's actually rattling around inside the body of the unit). My experience with this oven and its predecessor has been that Cuisinart's manufacturing standards have gone downhill over the years, since Conair took over the company and merged it with a lesser line. The return policies of both Cuisinart and Amazon are designed to be so burdensome to make the time and aggrevation of replacing a defective item not worth it.

The rack can be moved in three different positions and the settings do what they're supposd to.

Maybe.","review":"This is a handy little oven. It's much more expensive than other ovens and I don't know if it's worth the price -- if I'm still using it in 25 years I'll be able to report definitively. But there are a few engineering problems: The exterior gets VERY hot so finding a solitary place for it in a cramped kitchen might be difficult. The rack must be pulled out by hand -- no convenient door attachment -- and it's easy to bump something hot when trying to remove the food. And the elements are exposed, which makes accidental food drips dangerously flammable. However, it is nice and small, it does cook fast and thoroughly, and everything I've put in it comes out well. Incidentally, I was worried about baking and reheating, but I've found this little oven does better than my big one -- because the oven is so small, it keeps steam around the food, thus preventing drying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient Cuisinart product","review":"Very efficient and easy to operate.

So, I returned it and bought one from a local department store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well--when it works","review":"I like this toaster oven very well--when it works. The problem is that the crumb tray needs to be in an exact position on my oven, and if it's not in that exact, precise spot, it won't work.

I am glad that I live in CA and they have to offer me free shipping (both ways).I got a new one after 2 weeks. Yes, the door closed well this time but the handle was broken through shipment. I had to send it back and waited for another two weeks.

I finally stopped slamming the door because nothing keeps it closed anymore. The larger issue with my oven is the lack of temperature control. Sometime in the last year+, I've lost control of the bake temperature. I keep the temperature dial turned all the way down and watch everything to keep it from burning in a flash. Unknowingly, my boyfriend turned up the temperature one night based on the package instructions of whatever he was cooking. Not only did the food burn in the blink of the eye, but the plug got so hot that it melted it to the outlet. I am surprised the thing didn't burn down the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice toaster unless you want toast","review":"I was given this toaster as a gift. It is a nice looking and does not take up too much counter space. The only problem is that it does not toast english muffins crisp.

After trying this for a few days and remaining unsatisfied, I returned the toaster and pull out my old Delonghi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Purchased the item based on reviews. Found the only merit is,possibly, its usefulness as a toaster.(But who needs that if they have a toaster?)1. The door does not close securely unless slammed several times.2. It's very easy to burn yourself. Although the sides remain cool enough, the back and top get very hot. (And it's easy to thoughtlessly hold the back while trying to get the door closed.)3. The oven does not retain heat.4. There is no indicator light to show when the ovenhas reached the desired temperature.5. There is no interior light.6. When baking (e.g., croissants) the oven maintains its temperature by having the upper elements go on. Result: items get burnt on top.I will donate this item to Goodwill (with some apprehension) rather than keep it since it's too much trouble to send it back.BTW, its cost from Amazon ($100) was matched at local stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really just wants to broil everything","review":"Dont ever walk away for more than a few minutes.

This is definitely a safety hazard. It still works but needs to be unplugged after use.

Within two months of use the door hinge started having problems and now we are having problems with burning in bake mode.

Don't give Hip-O records a red cent until they learn that they can't screw fine artists like Aimee and get away with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Let The Big Corporations Rip off Aimee.","review":"Aimee Mann's music is fantastic and every single song on this record is great, but it was put out against her will (by the very same people that dumped and made her buy back her own record)and therefore should be boycotted by anyone who is a fan of Aimee's music. Go buy Bachelor #2. It is the best album of the year and should be supported, not only for being a masterpiece, but as Aimee's only official release for 2000. Shame on Universal."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasant for collectors","review":"One thing to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to purchase this cd--do you want to make a statement, or do you want a chance to pick up some rare Aimee? This is probably the only chance we'll ever have to pick up some of Aimee's scattered recordings. If you're a fan of her music, do you honestly want to pick up the Jerry Macquire soundtrack for one song? Unfortunately, Aimee Mann is not a household name and probably never will be due to the mechanics of the music industry. If you enjoy Aimee's music, pick this up for the rare tracks. This is certain to go out of print within a few years. Buy it now so you won't have to spend 30 bucks on it on Ebay someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"Respect Aimee's wishes and please don't buy this CD.

(see her review below or go to her webiste) As for my love of Aimee Mann, it began after seeing the preview of 'Magnolia' in the theatre and being captivated by it's song. I purchased the soundtrack before even seeing the movie, and soon after, I went on a hunt to find any and all albums she has put out. Though I'm not a great Til Tuesday fan, her solo albums- Bachelor #2, Whatever, and I'm With Stupid- maintain heavy rotation in my weekly cd playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT The \\"Ultimate Collection\\"","review":"Really it is the Ultimate Rip-off. Not approved by Mann herself. In fact, Aimee offered to help with the project and offered to do the artwork for it. She was refused. While I'm sure she makes a little bit of money off of it, she herself has discouraged fans from buying the album. Don't waste your money. Aimee is one of the few artists whose albums are all good. Buying any one of her CD's is like buying a best of (with the exception of the first Til Tuesday album)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Controversial, but great","review":"Many reviewers have weighed in with strong opinions, but if you enjoy Aimee Mann's music, this CD belongs in your collection.

Her best work--\\"Voices Carry\\" and \\"Coming Up Close\\"--appears on the first 'Til Tuesday record. Though those songs suggested a major talent, Aimee has yet to come up with more material on that level. Instead, she has put out a series of mediocre solo records that have spawned zero hits. As her manager notes in a nearby review, her label passed on her most recent work.Nonetheless, Aimee currently is enjoying a mini-revival due to the \\"Magnolia\\" soundtrack and her live performance on the Academy Awards program. But, if you actually saw that performance (of the song \\"Save Me\\"), you saw the problem: bland songs.So many people WANT to like her, and WANT to believe that she has another \\"Voices Carry\\" in her. But if she had that kind of talent, wouldn't we have heard the songs by now?Umm . . . don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo! Hiss!","review":"You CAN go wrong with this disc.

This cd was released against Aimee's wishes. It has nothing to do with the manager being greedy.

Other channels peak at 130w at 1kHz. The result is you barely hear any surround effects.Besides, controls are really hard on this, especially when configuring your speakers. The test tone switches from one speaker to another too fast for you to set it to the desired level. The remote control is also cheap plastic.The unit I got had switched speaker outs for right front and right surround.I returned this receiver within a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Receiver at a great price","review":"It's true, this receiver isn't the most powerful or certainly the easiest to use; however, it does do exactly what it advertises itself to do. And, that's a lot. It delivers reasonable 6.1 sound, and gives you a fairly pure sound that is quite distinct in its channeled effect.The best part of this receiver for me was that it allowed me to upgrade my Technics rack system without sacrificing any of the main components. Although the remote is cheesy, it matches my system perfectly in integration. For Technics fans, this is about as good a match you will get.Don't kid yourself. If your finishing out a dedicated room to your home theater, then be prepared to spend $1000 or more. But, if your home theater is the family room as it is now for us, then the sa-he200 is a great buy and allows you to enjoy 6.1."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's Captain","review":"Very good book in the Alan Lewrie series.

Lambdin has given the reader a fascinating look at what living conditions were like in England in 1797, and how they set the stage for the Royal Navy mutinies at Spithead and Nore. Newly promoted Captain Lewrie comes across as a younger, more earnest Jack Aubrey in this fine Napoleonic era yarn.

With some interesting misdirections, this novel often reminded me of the work of John Fowles (whom I've always enjoyed). The story is about a very unusual cabin in the woods that is threatened by encroaching suburbia. The novel works on many levels, but in the end it's a great mystery. Does anyone know if this is Johnson's first novel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish and unworthy","review":"After reading the glowing reviews on this page, and hearing it compared to John Fowles' The Magus, which I recently read and thoroughly enjoyed, it was an unpleasant surprise to actually read this book. The writing is amateurish, the conceits transparent, and plot laughable. I confess I did not make it past page 50 or so. It feels like a high school creative writing project.Another small criticism: the book is published very poorly...the binding is cheap and inflexible, the printing offcenter.

Mara is a good instructor and explains the movements clearly. The only problem I had with this video is that the tape is too short and I think it's a bit pricy for the length of the video.Mara spends only a small amount of time for each movement, this makes it a little harder to follow, because I had to keep rewinding the tape. If only she spent more time on each of the moves (I'd say five minutes or so), instead of what seems like 1 minute or less for each move and if she would have spent more time explaining how to do the more difficult movements, then I'd definitely give this a higher rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome & Hard to Locate","review":"I can't express enough how good this dressing is!!

Thankfully when I searched online for the VS-540 model & it was still available on Amazon so I bought two of them. Luckily they still have replacement combs that fit both model numbers available through Helen of Troy, since they do break very often.

The sound is louder which I noticed bothered a lot of people, but I could handle this if it were the only issue. My main issue with it is the drier heats up and turns off literally 4-5 times during blow drying my hair. I have shouldr length, straight hair.

It has served me well for the last two years. Now that I have a family I will most likely move up to a larger-sized grill. I will still use this one for cooking small meals. Once you know the secret of clean-up (hint: clean with damp paper towels while the grill is still warm or warm it up slightly prior to cleaning it) it is really not that bad as far as maintenance. Of course it would be SO much easier if the cooking surfaces could be put in the top rack of a dishwasher (sigh!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lived Product","review":"I started off with this model and the Atkins diet, and loved it for its ease of use and the tilt design. Clean up is definitely not easy after the first 2 or 3 uses, but one trick that works is to unplug the unit and shortly after, wet a paper towel, close it up in the unit and allow it to steam (it will not burn). The steam allows almost anything to wipe away easily. Unfortunately, after each use, we noticed more and more teflon chipping away. I insisted my family was abusing it and finally had to get rid of it because there was so little teflon left making sticking during cooking and cleaning a nightmare. My son purchased a new fancier model for me for Christmas and NO ONE used it but me. Once again, the teflon is beginning to chip away.

Two short months after getting it, it sits dead on the counter after failing to come on tonight. Truth is, I also found that it toughened up the surface of pork chops cooked in it--you can't cut back on the cooking time because it's pork, so you end up with a leathery surface that has to be peeled off because it is inedible. But mostly you can't clean these things! Hamilton Beach makes grills with removable parts for safe and easy cleaning--why bother with trying to clean this without getting water on the bottom?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it away.","review":"Food prepared on this thing tastes like a cross between shoe-leather and cardboard. Meat cooked in a microwave is just as appealing. The grill was too light to sit on the counter-top, too flimsy and prone to tipping or flipping. The grease trays tip over too easily. When in use, the entire thing gets hot so there is no place to hold it down to keep it from sliding around. It is nearly impossible to clean. I'm glad I bought the inexpensive model to try out first.

If you're a big Bob fan, then you're gonna love this CD. Its got everything that Bobby's famous for: bluesy tunes, growls, grunts, howls. The rest of the band is great, too. Rob Wasserman (on bass) and Jay Lane (on drums) just swing. Also, as mentioned by another reviewer, the keyboard playing is excellent. And I love the horns, too.After listening to this disc one time, I just knew that this is going to be one of those CD's that'll be getting heavy rotation on my stereo. I can't stop listening to the tunes...its that good. My favorite track (for the moment) is \\"Lucky Enough\\". My only complaint is that version of \\"Corrina\\" on the Other Ones release, \\"Only the Strange Remain\\", is superior to the version included with this disc. But the music and the soul make up for it.If you're a fan of good music, played by musicians with a heart and soul, then you will have to buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD!","review":"Being a long time and dedicated fan of the Grateful Dead, I was unsure of Bob Weir's album, Evening Moods, and it's ability to persevere the music I have grown accustomed to. What a fantastic surprise! I bought the CD after a Ratdog concert in Buffalo in October, 2000. I had seen Ratdog several times but each show only dabbled in the Evening Moods tunes. I was blown away by Ratdog's ability to jam some of these tunes. I probably listened to the CD 100 times the first week I owned it and really studied the tunes. Excellent stuff! The jams are sweet and the lyrics are traditional Bob strangeness(you know, in a good way). This is definitely Bob's best stuff since Heaven Help the Fool. I'm hitting 3 shows this summer and more in the fall in order to catch more of these hot songs. My favorites are definitely Ashes and Glass and Two Djinn."},{"rating":"1","title":"This single is a rip-off!","review":"At this point, with this cd single being available used for ultra low prices, you will pretty likely get a deal.

Uh-oh.","review":"I picked up The Darker Side with the hope of exploring new, young authors in the horror genre. Unfortunately, if these writers are representative of current horror trends, then the whole genre is on the verge of collapse. The anthology's first story was the best, and there were occasional authors who showed a flash of talent, but overall, the stories alternated between boring and horrible. There was nothing remotely frightening or disturbing in any story in the book. Instead, many of the authors seemed to devote their energy to creating \\"adult\\" (i.e. poorly written sexual) material or over-the-top and substandard descriptions of murder instead of creating a decent story. At times, I wondered how these stories could be a credit to an author's reputation. If you want chilling and effectively written horror, there's always Poe and Lovecraft. Unfortunately, no author in this compilation comes close to their abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this one a pass.","review":"Amazon seems to have eaten my previous review, so here we go again:I am a big fan of horror anthologies and can usually find a few stories that I enjoy but not here.

I wish that when I finished sewing, the needle would always end in the up position. When it finishes on the down position and I manually roll it up, the needle usually comes unthreaded when I start sewing again.2. Mine came with a VHS tape with tips and instructions - unfortunately I don't have a VHS player. I would have preferred a DVD.3. The base does not fit into the space of a normal sewing machine table. In order to put it in the sewing table so that the sewing surface is flush with the table, I'd need to make the hole in my table bigger.Overall, I'd recommend it as a basic, beginner machine.

Useful features are that the trays are \\"stove to serve\\" and the glass cover is great for guests to \\"see and select\\". Tea light candles are adequate for heating. I made spring rolls for appetizers. After 3 hours, they were still warm even with the lid off (to keep rolls crispy.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient and nice looking","review":"Love the oven to table convenience! It could use a lid holder, as I have seen on other chafing dishes. It is difficult to hold a plate of food in one hand, while trying to find a spot to set the lid down, so you can serve yourself! On a buffet, there isn't extra room to set a lid down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat and classic presentation","review":"Used the buffet server over the christmas holidays and my guests were appreciative of neat, clean and elegant presentation on the dining table. I love the fact that one can place the server on the stove top or oven till when ready to serve. I did not need to use the candles, but they sure will come in handy in the future. I have the rectangular, round and oval servers. I intend to purchase another set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant!","review":"I have used this product before.

The only reason I give it a one is the fact there is no zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm don't know whether to laugh or to call RCA and complain","review":"Luckily I didn't spend money on this--it was a Christmas present. Presumably RCA was trying to lure in a new group of opera lovers with this. Unfortunately, they manage to insult both the new listener and anyone who has ever liked any aria ever written. The woman on the cover (and inside, and on the CDROM thing) is absolutely hideous--she alone would cause most people not to buy the CD. As for the music, the clips are poorly chosen (usually the most impressive coloratura sections or the part that most people will recognize, but never the part of the aria that is the most important to the plot or the most musically significant), and no one who actually wants to learn about opera is going to learn anything from listening to 30 seconds of a grainy old recording. I feel bad that newbies out there aren't getting the chance to experience this wonderful art form because all they see on the shelves is crap like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic, bizarre?","review":"What's the point of such a product?

It will drive opera fans nuts with a hundred exerpts that run about 30 seconds each, then fade out without the singers even finishing a single verse. It's more like an index of arias, or a volume of teasers that hucksters might use to sell opera CDs.I never realized how much Bernstein's \\"Glitter and be gay\\" sounded like Delibes' \\"Bell Song\\" until I heard 35 seconds of one, followed 23 seconds of the other.Maybe the TV show 'Jeopardy' could use this CD. 'What is \\"Hush little baby don't you...\\"??'What a waste of beautiful voices and great music. 38 seconds of Enrico Caruso, followed by 31 seconds of Jussi Bjoerling, followed by 38 seconds of Dawn Upshaw.My copy is going to go sailing into the wastebasket as soon as I finish this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you buy this...","review":"you're stupid.

Something of a waste of time (the listeners' that is). The CD requires a link to the Internet; this alone disqualifies it as anything that could be useful for even the tyro Opera listener.

In orchestral music, usually a full movement; in opera, usually an aria, duet, chorus, etc.This collection features literally seconds from many operas, randomly starting and stopping with no thought to context or musical phrases. One doesn't even get a taste for the work or the singers in the length of time alotted for each snippet. The most interesting thing about the whole package is the cover.However, this might make a good gag gift for people who hate opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known...","review":"with 100+ track listings that these were not complete samples.

Again, my fault for not reading the reviews but I trusted that something called a \\"Music CD\\" would actually have complete songs... What else does this company offer?

Most of the meditation is in the last two chapters, some of it a bit weird. The author believes that the source of Joan's power must have been God, because if Joan had been the source of her own power she would have found a way to escape from prison in Rouen. Nash-Marshall's Joan is a \\"doer\\" and an \\"energetic warrior,\\" in seeming disagreement with the Chapu marble Joan in repose on the book jacket (see p. 168). Typos (\\"Crepy\\" for the big battle at \\"Crecy\\") and curious sentences like the one in which Joan convinced soldiers to \\"live without the female attachments to which medieval armies were assuaged\\" suggest some of the difficulties with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems well built but have not used","review":"The cup seems really well made.

As other have said it's bulky. It does work though. If the transmitter from an Ipod or other device is a big part of your mental math, realize that the transmitter is larger than an Ipod Nano 3gen. For me this device sits by itself most of the time on a shelf as I don't need it. If I had then my review would have dropped a star.The main point for me was the receiver for the stereo. This device has worked flawlesly. I have paired it with computers and palm devices on the fly to play sounds and music. It took some time to find a slot it would work on with my 1980's era receiver, but once found it's been great.The only other note I have is that the power adaptors for the transmitter and receiver are remarkably similar but not interchangeable. Be careful about this.All in all for the low $20's price tag I paid, this has been a great purchase to adapt my stereo to playing from my blue tooth devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The product looks like manufactured many years ago and not in good condition.

He does no mixing of this compilation, all the songs were digitally mixed on a computer like any other major label trance mix. this is just another pathetic attempt by record companies to capitalize on the popularity of the rave scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"This disc is like these reviews, you've heard it all before.","review":"Every single track on this album, bar two, are old stuff that nobody should really want to listen to now. The only actual \\"good\\" songs on here are:Delerium feat. Sarah McLachlan - Silence (DJ Tiesto Remix)This one was the biggest trance track of 1999. *1999*! It's good, but it's old...dance music is about the NEW!Slyder - ScoreI first heard of this in Grand Theft Auto 3...and I've been searching for the vinyl everywhere. This is one of those tracks that could easily fit among a bunch of more toned down tracks.A mix full of anthems doesn't work. A mix of 15 or so songs with 2 or 3 anthems works much better. Not to mention the fact that one reviewer mentioned \\"WOW! up to 10, even 15 second mixes!\\" and that made me laugh. Personally, I mix for 2 or 3 minutes per song... Makes me sick. Go buy some Global Underground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial and simple","review":"Without trivializing the sufferings of the Rio family, I honestly feel like this book offers no insight to the complexity of anorexia nervosa. Tara's eating disorder - which was not anorexia at all, but bulimorexia - was a relatively short ordeal, and she did not hide it from her family like many sick young women do (or like the excerpt from the back of the book would have the prospective reader believe she did). Introspection is nihil - rarely expressed is sentiment deeper than \\"I feel fat\\". Moreover, the overall tone is self-centered, as the authors never speculate upon the epidemic nature of the disease; I call this sort of self-congratulatory, non-academic memoir \\"victimization literature.\\" For these reasons and more, I cannot recommend this title as a quality account of an eating disorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I was attracted to this book when I saw it on the \\"New Releases\\" shelf at the library. I could tell it hadn't been read, and the title appealed to the voyeuristic part of me that enjoys peering into people's (published) diaries. I found the book to be extremely insightful and interesting, as it beautifully and honestly depicted the inner workings of a teenage daughter and her mother. I loved how the book was frank and blunt, (as I suppose it had to be, being a real diary) and it truly opened my eyes to the trials and tribulations that a mother faces while watching her daughter go through sickness and coming of age.I would recommend this book to any female I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift of the Anorexia","review":"I purchased this for my wife--she's a psychotherapist whose clients are 15--21 year-olds.

It was non discriptive, including not even telling how low Tara's weight got, her weeks in treatment, and didn't say how much she lost. They never said she got sick looking or anything related. The rest of the book was complete garbage about how she is doing at home and at school. O yeah, her mother is so naive to even pay attention to how her health was going. \\" Tara looks kindof blank and sad\\", says her mother.

The soles are very light but not good for feet that are sensitive to hard surfaces. These shoes are not meant for jumping, they have little support.

Whether its the glare or shimmering glimmer, you'll notice it soon after working with it. Adjusting the adapter settings to optimal doesn't make it any better, and trying to find this monitor on the Proview site, for more info, is a big woop!??My recommendation is: if your upgrading for a better view, this is not what your looking for; but if you just use the computer as a general appliance, with no need to stare at it for long periods of time, then this will do in a pinch."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful machine","review":"I wish I had this years ago.

I stretched a couple of items initially when I was learning the technique, but I think I've got the hang of it now.

I thought that I was going to see a hard working young ska band, but what I saw was a young band that had an inflated ego due to the fanbase of young irritating girls. I am not saying that the music is bad, just really redundant. This band had no energy on stage, they didn't even look comfortable being on stage. My advice to the whole band is that when you are on stage, maybe move around a little. And as for the drummer, everyone already sees you, you don't need to stand up and act stupid. My advice to the drummer is, lose the ego it does nothing but make you look like you are trying too hard to be cool.As for the CD, I would recomend maybe having a listen to it, but don't expect too much.

As a person who did not grow up hearing Bengali I prefer to learn words that are used more in conversation. The Bengali people that I know say that many of the words I use in my speech that I learned from this book are quite literary. Even the conversations use some pretty big words that are not so commonly used verbally. I also think that many East Bengali words and dialect are thrown into this book despite the fact that the book seems to be mainly geared towards West Bengali. The audio is absolutely essential. Bengalis tell me that I have virtually no accent when speaking and I owe that completely to his tapes that came with this book and his explanation of the linguistics of the sounds and letters in the language. In addition, if you are interested in Bengali literature, this book is an excellent primer."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice phone bad display problems","review":"This is my second phone of this type.

The connection on the phone for the charger sucks and it could easily break or (like I'm experiencing) it doesn't hook up right. The signal is horrible and makes cingular look bad (good thing I've had cingular for years). It took a while to get used to because the buttons arranged differently than the Nokias.

He was right, several weeks later the functions started going haywire and even the hands or digital read out won't work. I'm a diver, but never dove with this watch. Been in the pool a few times and sweated with the watch outdoors. I would say this is a very poor design and really ruins any reputation Tissot claims for being a great Swiss watch company.

The sword fighting is barely amusing for 5 minutes, and then repeats itself over and over again until you want to just kill yourself and spare the suffering. The enemy A.I. is pathetically easy, making for no more than a 3 hour game. The level design is boring, with the only puzzles involving opening doors with easily found levers. You just go from room to room killing people as you go. The levels all look basically the same, and this is the worst level design I have ever seen. This game is boring and easy.

(I know, I know, if I can remember it, I wasn't there. But then again, I didn't inhale.)I prefer this album to the Live at the Boston Tea Party vols 1 and 2 because this CD sounds like the way bands sounded before the amps made it too painful for me to see live shows and bands got stupidly overindulgent. The band does the stuff the crowd expects, some blues (\\"Madison Blues\\"), mix in stuff that got the band into rock and roll (\\"Great Balls of Fire\\", \\"Tutti Frutti\\", and \\"Jenny Jenny\\"), and cap it off with a knock-out set piece, \\"Green Manalishi\\".If you're looking to compare it with an album, this CD is a companion to Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac on Blue Horizon/Rewind/Columbia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Systematic Theology ever written!","review":"This is the greatest Systematic Theology ever written.

Monsters with savage attitudes and mouths full of teeth are no match for the tough street hoods who are trying to save their block.While the kids battle the cops and the monsters they get tough and use their street smarts and knowledge of the area to outwit the invaders. This is a fun Sci-Fi flick filled with a lot of British slang that you will have to listen carefully to. It is pretty gory so be ready for some shockers.The movie is Sci-Fi with comedy twisted into it and the special effects are pretty good. In the beginning you don't know whether to root for the kids to get arrested or to win the battle, but ultimately you'll pick a side. It's a short movie at 88 minutes but you will find it entertaining if you like Sci-Fi and fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This movie was hilarious. I loved the characters and aliens! I watched with my friends and they all loved it too. Strongly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was one of the best alien films I've seen in years.","review":"I'm not a big foreign film fan. However, there are a few films which capture my attention and this was one. The acting was actually VERY GOOD. The storyline and premise were top notch. This IS NOT - ET. It's better because its a cross between ET and Critters. The cast was top notch and I'll be looking for other films by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a surprisingly awesome movie!","review":"We had no expectations that this would be anything other than a B-film (like Skyline or Cloverfield) but surprizingly Attack the Block was really good! The action starts minutes into the film, it is well acted and the aliens are unique and creepy. It features an ensemble of quirky, likeable characters. It combines plenty of plot twists and surprises. There is humor, suspense, and loads of action that keep you interested all the way to the end.

This movie is a mess...the alien looks like a Teletubbie with glowing eyes and has rabies.

Do not buy or rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"I want my rental money back. All the positive reviews are totally misleading.

Total absolute garbage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CRUDE, PROFANE, SCARY AND FUNNY","review":"Here's a terrific little film that asks: What if angry, human-devouring aliens landed in South London and had to deal with a mixed ethnicity teen street gang? Crude, profane and funny, this exceptionally well-crafted little UK import hits all the right notes and delivers a superbly poetic, colorful enigmatic stream of British lower-class teen jargon along the way. The kid actors, many of them non-pros, are all terrific and the story reminds how a greater threat can unite and makes us stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad what passes for good junk these days","review":"Bratty kids who sound just like nanny-state liberal moviemakers while they commit crimes against women and animals are interesting to some.

Seriously, I should've waited until Netflix had it for online viewing instead of paying for a rental.If you like the idea of the director making you despise the main characters and then force you to try to cheer for them in the end... either that or you believe pubescent teenagers acting out promoting thug-culture is the only way for them to be \\"cool\\" these days, then this movie's for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"By Thugs for Thugs?","review":"Sorry but like others I found none of the characters likable in this movie. A bunch of thug kids mug a girl and then get attacked by aliens. Bad writing, bad acting, ... There are movies where you root for the bad guys. This wasn't one of them.I almost get the impression this was made by some thug kids for the rest of their thug friends. I'm sure in that case it's an awesome movie but not for the rest of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Well, that was a waste of 90 minutes. Space aliens that are no smarter than bears somehow decide to invade a bad neighborhood of London. They are fended off by a gang of detestable gang bangers.

I didn't because none of them are likable, the rest of the movie proceeds to turn Moses into some unapologetic anti hero, in the end all this movie's really doing is glamorize thugs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, horrible special effects","review":"Wow, this movie was a huge dissapointment. I was told that this movie was both very funny and the special effects were top notch. I'm not sure which claim was more wrong.The movie simply is not funny. Here's an example of an attempt at humor: When trying to decide what to do about the dead alien one guy says \\"Yo, we should call Simon Cowell because this alien's got talent.\\" The only thing vaguely funny about the movie was the kid's accents.The special effects were about on par with the movie alien, which was released in 1979.I don't know what someone could possibly be looking for in a movie where they would be even remotely satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT, FOR 12 AND UNDER","review":"IF YOU'RE MENTALLY OR PHICALLY 12 AND UNDER, THIS IS A FILM FOR YOU.

The first 50 pages have come unglued from the spine where they are now single individual pages. My other problem is fact that I am missing complete lines of information because the setter had off set several pages throughout the textbook. I really do not think that Thompson would have ever published a book in that condition. It looks as though those pages had been photocopied because my textbook looks totally different than my friends. My friends books are published on different paper and its in smaller text.

And in \\"Imitations\\", Shearing even sings... he should certainly keep his day job, but his wavering crooning and the searching lyrics are a good match. As on the other solo Concord Shearing albums, my only reservation is with the up-tempo numbers, which seem out of place and lack originality. Hardly a reason to pass up this wonderful CD, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid","review":"Many things can be said about Blue Monday. In short it is the most important and influential dance single of the last 25 years. The only other single I can think of that even comes close in terms of radical originality and lasting influence is Donna Summer's colaboration with Giorgio Moroder \\"I Feel Love.\\" In both cases, there is only one version that you will ever need, and that is the ORIGINAL. It is perfection personified. These updated remixes here add NOTHING to the original, and to me are a slap in the face. Butchery. Simply atrocious.

Yet with \\"The Deadly Dance\\" I find Agatha to be in the same old rut: she has to be the busiest \\"retiree\\" there is.Possibly in a move to breathe life in to the Agatha series (Lord knows it needs it) Beaton tries to dabble in the realm of the psychological thriller. The insights into the thoughts of the somewhat sinister 60-ish woman who becomes the first employee of Agatha's newly-formed detective agency seem out of place in a series that is composed of two-dimensional, fluffy characters.The twists and turns of the diseased mind are better left to the more capable creative talents of Ruth Rendell or PD James.This written, I had squeezed up a two-star rating for the novel. Upon reflection, however, I must deduct a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition barely readable","review":"I enjoyed the story but Kindle users, beware.

Although the story itself has all the elements of another excellent Agatha Raisin novel, Ms. Beaton's usually entertaining writing style has here turned choppy and abrupt. \\"Deadly Dance\\" reads like a story outline that an over-eager publisher accidentally printed instead of the finished product. If you're a dedicated reader of the series and can overlook the awkward writing style, you'll probably enjoy the latest adventures of Agatha Raisin.

I tried all the fixes available on their web site, including downloading a free version upgrade (v1.5).

I'm back in the old version, which remains virtually flawless.I have to say, the company responded to my e-mail enquiries and the product has an excellent satisfaction guaranteed policy: 100 days, 100% satisfaction, 100% money back.Waiting for version 2.0 ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Get Running and Horrible Technical Support","review":"I recently purchased PCSync 2.0. In order to get the software running, it necesitated several calls to LapLink's technical support line. In each case, their representatives were surly and discourteous. When I contacted the manager of technical support, I was told that they would no longer assist me. At that moment it became very clear where the A-OK for the technical support department's behavior stemmed from. In order to run the product takes an extensive amount of reading through manuals and help files. All-in-all PCSync is far too difficult to operate and their technical support problems are insurmountable. Seekers of file transfer software would be better advised to look at another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Sign Language book ever","review":"I would like to recommend this book to everyone.

I picked up quite a few more just by looking through and highlighting ones to show her. I would recomend this book to everyone expecially those who are working with babies. These are signs they can use for life. I love being able to understand what my daughter wants without having to play guessing games, which she doesn't like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Great but...","review":"Overall I think this is a great book. It is one of the few out there that doesn't try and pretend that you should be signing exact english and does a great job of introducing you to the grammatical structures of American Sign Language which are definitely different from English.The only things I dislike about this book were that none of the illustrations have explanatory text with them and some signs can't be conveyed fully with only one or two illustrations, and that there are only about 800 signs listed, which is understadable for a tutorial style book but you'll definitely want find a good dictionary or deaf friends to expand your vocabulary when you're done with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay far, far away.","review":"This book was *dreadful*. Several of the assignments refer to signs that aren't shown anywhere in the book; one of the explanations refers to posessive pronouns as \\"objective\\" pronouns, which means something completely different; many of the pictures used to illustrate signs are confusing, and there's little attempt to explain them; even the definitions offered aren't always clear. There are plenty of better books about ASL available."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in its class","review":"I got this book ages ago and I'm just now getting around to reviewing it.

(Thank God for Amazon.com!)For all you readers looking to but this book: DO. And don't be fooled by the scant book jacket copy, which unfortunately doesn't give a reader much to go on, or at least in my opinion, enough. Don't be fooled by the size of this little book either. A good story really can be told in just under 200 pages! Anyhow, for those new to Duke Ellington, it's a great place to start. This REALLY IS a fresh, new look at the man, and especially his great sacred music and Sacred Concerts. Really a MUST read for those old and new to The Duke."},{"rating":"2","title":"short-form biography makes a comeback","review":"It's hard to imagine that you could get such a full and complex story in just 192 pages, but that's just what Steed delivers. So don't be deceived by the samll size of this book. Duke Ellington's story is told with remarkable depth, breadth, chock full of great anecdotes, first-hand interviews and many photos that have not been widely seen. There are several side-bar pages, which I particularly liked, and she offers up an excellent discography written by John Hasse. Steed's take on Ellington's spirituality is quite fascinating and, surprisingly, entirely persuasive. Of particular value in this book are the discussions and story of the Duke's sacred music and concerts. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good introduction to Ellington","review":"Very accesible book & good introduction not only to Duke Ellington but the world of Jazz. I suppose an author is limited by the number of pages how in depth one can get but still I expected a more critical examination of the contradiction of Ellington's public persona w/ his spirituality and how he reconciled these contradictions. That said, I still found Steed's argument convincing, especially his leading up to his sacred music. This is especially a good book for the new initiate to Duke Ellington."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"I have tried 2 dvds till now and both of them had problems while copying the data to the computer.
