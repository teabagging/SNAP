A 'New Age' book before it became a popular modern day movement.There is some reliance on old stories of a fabulous Utopia called 'Atlantis' and a bit of propaganda for the USA as a future Utopia!!

The US governement did not buy the land for Camp Pendleton until March of 1942. 2. He refers to Japan's Imperial Marines. Japan did not have marines. They had a Special Naval Landing force often called marines by US troops, but that is not what they were. 3. He refers to a Japanese major's rank insignia as \\"leaves\\". This one I'll have to look up, but I don't believe Japan used the same type of rank insignia as the US. Has anyone else complained about authors blowing it like this ?

I will never ever buy a Microtek product of any sort based on this experience. I urge others to boycott this company. I am amazed that they get good product reviews; the only thing I can figure out is that the people doing the product reviews are techies and can fix the problems as they happen.

You can even scan 3D objects by placing them on the scan bed, effectively getting a digital camera quality image. The only downside is speed. This scanner features a parallel port connection, which severely cripples its performance potential.

I really like the quality of the scans and the ability to scan 3-D images. The only thing I don't like about it is the amount of memory it takes to get a good quality image. I can scan a picture at 600 dpi and the picture after it is scanned takes up a ton of memory. My older computers had a very hard time handling that big of a picture. With my newest dell running windows XP, I have no problem with that anymore. I did not experience the problems getting the scanner to work with windows XP like other users have had. I just downloaded the driver from the Microtek website and use the scanner software in Windows XP.

I started the machine in safe mode and restored my registry and it still would not work. I had to reinstall my machine and the same thing happened.Know what you are getting yourself into with their technical support. Each piece of software is made by a different company so you cannot call one place. Also, each support number is a toll call and each place has very limited hours. I installed my scanner on a Saturday night and none of the companies had support lines open on Saturday night.If you are going to buy a scanner, get an HP or other higher quality vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"bum equipment","review":"I purchased a scanner from a store (best buy) in modesto, Ca.

The guitar usage in this album are sensual and really make the songs shine.Out of Tune is the one song that stands out in this album, it is my favorite trip-hop song of all time. This strange effect was featured on a cell phone commercial, which is another jem on the album. Eden is a very good song, also sung by Sarah Brightman, which I found to be better. One Way Ride sounds very simaliar to Bjork's song Come to Me from her album Debut.The new female vocalist has the most beautiful, innocent, angelic voice and she can carry more notes in a distinct clear tone.

Hooverphonic, while generally appreciated by the Trip-Hop crowd, was unable to establish a separate identity.Well, I'll admit they do sound a lot like Portishead, but there's something else going on here. The mood isn't as black as Portishead, nor is it as pop as The Sneaker Pimps. What you get on this CD is more of an orchestral sound, the richness of which you may find hints of on their debut CD.I must admit I was worried when I learned of the original female vocalist's departure, but the change seems to have loosened up the group. I detect a little more experimentalism here, a not-so-unusual thing for a sophomore effort from bands with staying power.Can you tell I've been waiting for this one? ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"among my top 10 CDs","review":"I discovered this band thanks to the tv commercial for a vw, which featured the song Renaissance Affair, as I found out on the adcritic.com website.

With this album, Clapton finally abandoned the mellow, laid-back (and often boring) country rock of the late 1970s and mastered the more electronic (and energetic) sound of '80s radio. The sound is more dense and satisfying. \\"She's Waiting\\" and \\"Forever Man\\" are Clapton's hardest - and most convincing - rockers since \\"Layla.\\" \\"Something's Happening\\" is pure pop-rock joy, and \\"See What Love Can Do\\" is uniquely beautiful.

Nevertheless, Clapton's return to the top of the charts was welcome at the time and is a worthwhile listen for fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEHIND PHIL COLLINS ...","review":"This is Clapton's lowest point in his career, the day he succumbed to the usual record company pressure for \\"GIVE ME A HIT SINGLE SOON\\", or \\"GIVE ME A HIT VIDEO FROM A HIT SINGLE SOON\\"..The album is totally commercial, what is no surprise if you check who is at the helm of production: Mr. Phil Collins, who a long time ago was a serious musician in a great band called GENESIS, but who decided to go with all his force and talent into mainstream pop music. Clapton seems lost here, the songs are inconsistent, maybe because his record company brought others producers, including Van Halen's Ted Templeman. The album is so heartless and uninspired that you can't believe it's Clapton on it. Only \\"SHE'S WAITING\\" appears in the CROSSROADS compilation..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Effort","review":"Behind The Sun was Eric Clapton's attempt to \\"modernize\\" his sound. Calling on Phil Collins to produce, the album has a contemporary 80's feel, with a slick studio production that all but stifles his blues roots. The album opens up with \\"She's Waiting\\" which is a very good song that is accentuated by the fife and drum coda. But after that, the album falters with bland music including one of his all time worst songs, the calculating \\"Forever Man\\". The album is revived for a bit by the strong \\"Just Like A Prisoner\\" in which he lets loose on the guitar. By associating with Mr. Collins, who was super hot at the time, Mr. Clapton assured himself of getting some airplay, but the collaboration fizzled in the quality end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Phil Collins obscures Clapton's rediscovery of the guitar","review":"One piece of credit I have to give to Phil Collins - he managed to get Clapton to play some of his best guitar work since his guest appearance on Roger Water's Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking LP. Unfortunately, most of this blistering guitar work is lost under a heavy blanket of overproduction and drum machines. This might be the worst collaboration since Jeff Beck picked that awful disco remixer to produce his Flash album. Save your money and just download Forever Man rather than buying the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pixar Has Done It Again","review":"Time and time again, Pixar Animation Studios does not cease to amaze America with their movies. Ever since their first movie \\"Toy Story\\", Pixar has taken America by storm with each new movie they come out with. Their newest one, \\"The Incredibles\\" is no different.A family of superheroes have been forced to live life as normally as possible due to the public demanding the \\"Golden Age of Superheroes\\" to come to an end. Bob, the main character of the story, is a married and father of two man who needs to find some satisfaction in his life. Forced into hiding, he if offered that chance and from there the movie takes off.While the movie is not Pixar's best work out of their selection of movies, it certainly does hold a candle among the movies that will be remembered for years to come. Pixar has proved time and time again they can do great work and this proves it. I can't wait to see how your \\"Cars\\" comes out!! Keep it up Pixar!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic, Great Entertainment Value","review":"This is a great family film suitable for all ages.I took my girlfriends children to see this film they absolutely loved it, so when i bought it for them on dvd the house went silent. actually it was the same with Monsters Inc too.All Pixar films are 100% good clean fun, so if you have little Jack Jack's or Boo's running around the shop, or if you enjoy a good fun movie get this.The storyline is thus, two superheros Mr Incredible and Elasti Girl retire to settle down to have a family only trying to have a normal life isn't working out, then to make things worse a super villan called Syndrome comes on the scene, so the whole family of Incredibles sorts him out.

Numerous touches, small and large, bring back the atmosphere we always imagined as kids.Additionally, this is a great movie for all ages to enjoy together. The scary scenes are tolerable for young kids and don't last overly long. There is plenty of comedy for adults, and enough 'cool factor' for everyone. You'll come to care about the family of Incredibles with their challenges and problems, and revel in the clever ways the writers have the family, and their super powers, come together.The animation is beautiful to behold.I just watched it again recently, and enjoyed it every bit as much as when I first watched it when it came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Incredibles DVD is incredible!","review":"Pixar has again released another fine piece of work for the entire family.

I don't let my kids watch many movies or television, but was intrigued by this film. I had heard all the hype and was a bit skeptical.

I love the fact every member in the family really got its own characteristic, not only because they all have special talent but they all have their own personality and here is the briliant part of the director, he managed so well to line up all the elements so well so amazing and that asemble this incredibly fast pace action journey. I cant really remember when was the last time I had such satisfactory on picture that contain so much on both action and funny elements. I watched it twice and I absolutely will buy the DVD when it come up. Go Watch It. I2 will not be this good its definite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great!","review":"I had heard that this was by far the best Pixar film. Therefore I went with my kids expecting to be enthralled for 2 hours. What I got was a movie that was good but had a lot of periods where I found myself losing concentration.Yes the movie has its moments. There is a lot of good adult intended humor thrown in. But I am sorry that this movie is not nearly as good as either Shrek film or either Toy Story film.With a villian who is probably more annoying than Lord Farquard from Shrek , the movie also seems to have ripped off the Fantastic Four to come up with their characters. Let's see the similarities Mr Incredible - Mr. Fantatic (similar name), Plastic Girl - Mr. Fantastic (same power) Invisible Girl (same powers), Mr. Incredible - the Thing (both super strong). And then the boy is the same as Quicksilver and the Samuel L Jackson character is the same as The Iceman.My kids (11 and 8) preferred the Spongebob movie to this one. I gave that film 5 stars and this one 3 and a half."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great movie!","review":"I hate cartoons. Never have liked them. So, I was somewhat hesitant to watch this one because it is just a \\"grown up\\" cartoon. Absolulely loved it! It was funny, entertaining, interesting, dramatic, etc. I was totally shocked at the plot, and found myself totally engrossed in what was happening. The characters were fantastic, and the good superhero/bad superhero plot was great. While I don't have kids, I think older kids (maybe 8 and up) will enjoy this. Just the right mix of fun, excitement, but nothing really too violent. It's a great a family movie.

Explosions, man dropping from a building to his death, superhero & supervillian being sucked into a turbine engine on a plane,& a bunch of stuff that little, little, kids might not enjoy. When I saw it we decided to get it on DVD when it comes out. I think that it is coming out in a few months. We had been seeing previews about it for the whole year! It looked so funny!

This, a unique superhero slant, has done just as well as the other Pixar movies, if not better. With five movies, they are five for five. The characters are fun to watch as the story unfolds, leaving watching and enjoying every minute.One huge extra that is included with the two disc set is small extra called Boundin'. The lyrics, the animation, everything, is just wonderful. As an adult I love watching it and don't mind watching it over and over again. As a child my niece loves it. And my nephew, as a 6 month year old baby, is captivated by it, even laughing out loud at times. No matter your age, I would recommend buying just for this little clip.

Don't make me say incredible!...oops. ;-)","review":"This movie is high-paced, fresh, and fantastic, unlike the stiff overdone superhero cartoons--and it is funny and orginal. However, I should warn against the cartoon but dramatic action violence. It is non-gory, but some parents might not like it. There are also regards to fidelity and divorce that are crude, but do not spoil the movie. This is amazing! The triumph over evil and the triumph over giant robots is at is peak in a funny way. PS I'm 15 but don't have an adult's form thingy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fast Paced","review":"In my opinion, I don't care for this movie. I don't think it's a keeper. Borrow it from the library; don't buy it. It's not worth your money.This movie is about a family of superheroes who aren't allowed to be superheroes. Yeah, it really is that bad.The family scenes show reality at its lowest- somewhere between realistic and fall-asleep boring, I would put it at the fall-asleep boring sections.There are about 3 good scenes in this movie and they aren't that long.The characters tend to speak in monotonous tones, especially Helen, which makes this movie easy to tune out.During action scenes, characters move fast! All their superpowers are in being exceptionally strong or fast or stretchy- no mind or brain powers.This DVD's only redeeming quality is \\"Jack-Jack Attack,\\" a short 4 minute sequence that is HILARIOUS and not included except on the 2-disc special edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of movie budget for such weak story","review":"Many of the people I knew seemed to applaud for the movie. I really find almost all the characters incredibly annoying. That's just about the only incredible to this movie. I give credits to those CGI specialists who spent tremendous amount of time creating such elastic characters and by no means it was an easy feat. However, computer generate special effects does not a good movie make. Sometimes I feel as the director/producer focused too much on the CGI and not merely enough on a solid story. I guess it would be a fun movie for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pixar....","review":"Finding Nimo was a big let down.And now, the Incredibles. An over-hyped movie, with nothing but a predictable, stupid storyline. Super powers are one of the most used ideas today, and yet the Pixar had to use them.This movie is the most un-original, most disgusting, most fatigue piece by Pixar. I went out to the theater and watched this movie with 6 friends, and 4 of them walked out of the theater after 30 minutes. After the movie, we all talked how the movie sucked and how Pixar was fading.First of all, the problem is the storyline.

It got great reviews and won some award, but I'm still trying to figure out why. I couldn't STAND this film.I loved Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, you know - movies like this. But THIS piece of garbage just made me want to make picket signs and protest this total waste of time and money.Everyone's saying, \\"oh, but kids liked it!\\" No - they're children.

DISTURBING & DEPRESSING","review":"The Incredibles was a horrible film for young viewers. With references to suicide, infedelity, and traumatized lifes, this is not the kind of thing I would want kids to see. I have to admit the animation is extraordinary, the story is not appropriate for Disney.It's basically a story about a superhero being stripped of his super identity after saving a man who attempts suicide. As years pass, this ex-hero works at a job he hates (and beats up his boss), constantly fights with his wife, and doesn't involve himself in any of his three disturbed children's lives.I would warn any parent of this movie. It's not as wholesome as Finding Nemo.

Nice cloth and hair and fluids simulation, nice use of lighting, very believable animation that realy brings the character to life. The plot is very original. The incredibles borders on the edge of satire, but they balance it out by showing the human side of the super heroes, something you rarely see in comic books. Although they are incredible, they don't pretend to be omnipotent like other super heroes. The dialogue, the action, the humor, the unfolding of the story... it's all brilliantly presented. I particulary like James Bond-esque theme of the movie. This movie is entertaining for kids and adults alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is \\"Incredible\\" for a Black Biography on Racism","review":"This is the best movie I have ever seen.

It was just plain dumb! Then months later, I had to watch it again at somebody's party. WHAT A NIGHTMARE! This movie is a real sleeper and it's a shame it was ever made! If there were zero stars as an opiton, I would definitely pick it! When I got home from that party, I was so mortified from having to watch that awful film, that I plugged in \\"Funny Farm,\\" to help myself forget about it. This movie should go out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"You just got in bed with the man!","review":"If you want to take down The Man, this is not the movie for you. If you want to laugh along with the rest of the johnny every-men, and then drink some crazy cool heavily advertised sody-pop and then black out and wake up the next morning In Bed With The Man...then this is your movie! Marginal cleverness in a first world country should not be applauded. This was marketed to kids and adults alike but the premise set up in the first few minutes was so weak as to put off anyone who has every been stuck in a waiting room and had to read just one copy of the American Bar Journal. We all know that a spate of joe-blows suing superheros whom the governement depends upon is ridiculous. That would get legislated so fast it would make Jack McCoy's head spin. The whole thing was a big love-fest to the conventional, couched in catchy new upholstry. It did not fool me but it probably will you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only incredible thing is how awful this film is.","review":"With Finding Nemo I thought that Pixar films couldn't get much worse. I thought that the Incredibles would finally be the one movie that redeemed the stuido. Boy was I wrong. The film is too dark for kids, yet to childish for adults. The plot is incredibly bad and poorly written, and there isn't even that match humor, unlike films such as Toy Story. It's pretty much for the most part just mindless violence throughout the entire flick. If that's what Brad Bird thinks that's what makes a good movie, then he's wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly stupid","review":"The Incredibles is a totally stupid animated film. The story is stupid, the voiceover stupid, the whole thing stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie and plenty of extras","review":"We got this DVD combo on the first day we could, and sat down to watch it this weekend, extras and all. For anyone who has seen the movie, they know how good it was, and it hadn't lost anything in the transition to DVD. Still a great, action-packed and funny movie.The additional extras on disc 2 are also well worth a look. For those who enjoy the process of making movies, there is a storyboard-like series on things they wanted to do with the story but did not. The \\"outtakes\\", which combine some computer generated goofs like messed up hair and clothes along with intentionally created gaffes, are enjoyable. There is a section on the superheroes of the story, and a special short about baby Jack-Jack that is too funny to describe.The Incredibles will find a place in the rotation of movies we watch often, and with the new features in a second dsic, we can only hope for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief comment","review":"The Incredibles is a fully-fleshed out and developed computer animated story that isn't just another summer kiddie flick. The Incredibles family members aren't cookie-cutter cartoon characters but real people who just happen to look like something out of a cartoon. :-) The intelligent and well written script won the writers a best script award and along with the amazing special effects they combine to produce the best animated film in many years. The action scenes are entertaining as well as spectacular, and after a while you hardly remember you're watching an animated film because the plot and characters seem so realistic and true to life. Overall a great effort from Pixar and they'll have to work hard to top this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but slightly damaged case","review":"This movie came with both discs, so nothing was missing.

THey probably watch less than 3 hours a week the 2 of them together.However, we love movies, and are eager to go out and see the newest family movie playing in the theater.'The Incredibles' is a great movie, that is funny, loving and teaches families to stick together. There were few 'adult' type jokes that always go over the kids head, and for a super hero type movie, there was no person to person violonce, and that was a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibles!","review":"When I forst bought this DVD, I honestly didn't know what to expect. My niece knew about them, my neighbors, many friends...I was truly amazed by this movie. It made me feel like a kid...again! The textures are true-to-life. The story is funny and so adequate for super-heroes. I loved every bit of it. I also liked the fact that you could adjust to settings to have the best picture (THX setting). I watched it once and I knew I had to watch it again, just I case I missed some of the fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Pixar Smash...","review":"Pixar has scored again with this film, about a family of superheroes living out in the 'burbs. Like the Toy Stories, A Bug's Life, and Finding Nemo before it, this is a movie that I, as an adult, found myself enjoying alot. I loved Batman and Superman as a kid, and this movie conjured up those good old memories for me. This film has enough action and humor for any kid and even for most adults to enjoy, so if you haven't seen it, then waste no time getting it on DVD. It is a pleaser from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personal Opinion.","review":"I heard so much good about this movie so I decided to rent this online.

I am very happy with my decision to buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a matter of details...","review":"If you saw the ads for this movie but not the film itself, it's not just an endless series of fat jokes.The details really make this film. Yes, it's a story about a family of superheroes, but it's also about lawsuits, family life, the dangers of capes, midlife crises, \\"feel good\\" education, and fandom. The script is so broad in its reach that this film is good for a *lot* of viewings.2004 was a dreadful year for movies. This is one of the few joys that it produced.I especially appreciate the emotional dimensions that the film evokes. Elastigirl's lecture to her children about supervillains carries a bitter punch that sounds implausible (\\"Elastigirl's lecture to her children about supervillains\\"???), but which somehow really works.I saw the Iron Giant in the theater and couldn't understand why it didn't do well. I hope that the success of The Incredibles allows people to discover Brad Bird's other masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I love this movie.

I am glad a friend of mine and warned about this movie. So a young chap wants to be a hero and save the world, but is always shunned away by Mr. Incredible. The child is frustrated and and hence resorts to becoming a villan when he grows up. Haven't we come a long way, in ways of raising children. This should be atleast PG-13."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Like It","review":"I don't like \\"The Incredibles\\". Wasn't funny or exciting, feels empty. Didn't like the trailer, didn't like the DVD. Feels like it's been done before. Surburban style and setting got me down too.

If you can get past Holly Hunter's funny s's (she has sort of an female jock lisp - you'll see what I mean), everything is perfectly done. The soundtrack demonstrates that a live orchestra is superior to any synthesized cheap garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Incredibles","review":"I can't add much more to the discussion, but this is one of those movies I could watch over and over again. They keep showing it on TV, and I keep getting sucked in. One of the reasons, besides the story, that I really enjoy this movie is that I love how they designed Elasti-Girl AKA Helen Parr. How cool is it to have a hero that has the same proportions as a real woman (well, to a degree)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Stuff","review":"I like to watch animated movies and this is a funny movie, it is pretty goofy at times as well. Another twist on the super hero life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable","review":"I love this movie. I purchased it as my husband's Christmas gift.

This one lives up to that, although it's not the best movie from Pixar. I consider the plot a little bit confusing for kids, but overall this is a fun movie for the family and with a lot of nice effects and funny jokes. Beautifully made from beginning to end. To compare this movie with Finding Nemo is not right...this is no match for Marlin, Dori and Nemo; but still a good movie to have and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Es Increible","review":"Muy bueno.. tremenda calidad de imagen.Con 2 dvd's.. en el primero trae la pelicula con audio en ingles, espa&#65533;ol y frances (5.1EX).. y en el segundo videos de como se hizo la pelicula en ingles con subtitulos en ingles para los que gusten."},{"rating":"2","title":"kids version of fantastic four","review":"everyone says the incredibles copys the fanatstic four.who cares. some kids cant watch pg-13 movies. this a simulation of fantastic four for kids. whats wrong with that?????? kids love this movie and so do i. thankyou for making a \\"fantastic four\\" that WE pre-thirteens can watch. as for the movie it rocks sooo loud and its great it is incredible and funny my parents love this movie. i even won the contest to get 4 free tickets to teathers about long time again. fantastic will not beat this version even though its not copying! if you have seen the fantastic four and incredibles you know what im talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"No zone Frozone","review":"Probably the best animated film I've ever laid eyes upon!

It was sooooooo good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Put - AWESOME","review":"Has PIXAR *ever* failed to deliver a great film? If they have, I don't recall, and they certainly delivered for The Incredibles.I won't rehash the plot because unless you've been under a rock for the last 2 months, you already know it. What continues to impress me about PIXAR's films is that they take animated entertainment to a level of such high quality that adults AND kids can enjoy the end result without either being bored.I also like how they take current events (tort reform is the biggest comically-suited underlying issue here) and make them entertaining but thought-provoking. A super-hero population forced underground by the govt because their saving people resulted in injury lawsuits is highly political but also highly entertaining.I challenge anyone to go see this movie and not be thoroughly entertained from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Otro exito de pixar","review":"esta pelicula es otra mas de las buenas que hace pixar lastima que a lo mejor se separa de disney pero ya estoy esoerando ToyStory 3, esta es muy entretenida vale la pena comprarla para verla una y otra vez la animacion es muy buena"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indeed Incredible!","review":"I bought this movie for my husband! While on vacation we had a chance to see it because my daughter brought it to the cabin. My husband watched it over and over and I bought it for him so he could have his own copy. He isn't one to get into watching movies that much so this is exceptional. Also funny is the shorts \\"Jack-Jack Attack\\" and \\"Bounding.\\" These make us giggle.

Anyone know where I can buy it? Or why it's not for sale here? Why would I need another DVD if I already own it and only need the Blu-Ray?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Incredibles - great movie not just for children","review":"The Incredibles was a fun, and entertaining movie not just for children. An adult, not just a parent, can actually sit through this movie and be entertained. I feel the movie had more to it then other computer generated films have. For one, people are the main characters, not animals or toys. Second, it has a different style to the story and plot. Granted it has your textbook happy ending, but lets face it, its a pixar film. But, the story itself had more to it. It wasn't just one of the characters being separated from the group and finding them. It had more depth. It involved struggles and hardships from hiding ones identity, twists and turns in the plot, and an actual villain. I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morally and ethically encouraging","review":"This movie did not captivate me as much as Toy Story or Monster's Inc., but did keep my interest and I did enjoy it. I have found that as I watch many movies dozens of times with my young children, I come to know and love the characters and the story line. We will purchase this movie when it comes available and I am sure I will come to love this movie too in time. What I was so pleased to see was the moral and ethical principals that exude in this film. Committment to marriage and family and celebrating the differences between people - in this case, their children. And putting your own needs aside, reaching out to help others regardless of the consequences.I took our 4 1/2 year old son and he really liked it.

It'd lose a lot. We have a cartoon family of superheroes doing what superheroes do. Damn impressive cartoon technology, but so what? They're never going to be as convincing as human actors. So what do we do with this technology? Move it to the fringes where acting isn't so important, like talking animals, science fiction, fantasy, superhero stuff. TERMINATOR II was an awesome use of the technology, but what else is it good for? This movie is good if you're too exhausted to do anything constructive, like thinking, but I doubt any adult will sit through it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD MOVIE","review":"I THINK IT IS GOOD BECAUSE THE PART WHEN EDNA SAYS NO CAPES AND I LIKE THE 2-DISC EDITION BECAUSE OF JACK-JACK ATTACK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just good plain fun.....","review":"Unlike some other \\"children\\" movies, where it takes a while to really get into - this movie picks you up immediately and takes you away into its wholesome fantasy until the end.

I would have to say that this is the best movie that I have seen for quite some time, regardless of its intended audiences. The animation was probably the best I have ever seen, and the plot was very complex, which I love. If there was anything wrong, it had some parts that were a bit predictable.

I do like the fact that you can actually drive the boat unlike Sega Bass Fishing Duel in which you only use the trolling motor.

I can't believe what this camera can do and for it to be so small and compact! Also, I am really into the way it feels in your hands, it's well balanced and just a sharp little camera. I never thought I could get excited about a simple point and shoot, but I am. Go ahead and shop around, but you won't find a better camera for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid build quality with good 28mm lens","review":"I bought this some time in the year of '99 for about [money]. It has the date imprint feature, and came with a carrying pouch. It was one of the few point and shoot that has a 28mm zoom lens(the other two I found were from Olympus and Pentax. For some reason they were all priced about 50% higher than the Minolta.) I like the date imprint on the front of picture, instead of on back like those APS cameras. So I can see the date when the picture was taken while looking at the photo album without having to rip out the picture.It takes good pictures. Panoramic pictures, printed at about 4\\"x10\\", are a real crowd pleaser. The flash is a little weak in some indoor situations. I'd wish it takes regular AA batteries like those digital cameras, so I can use rechargeable NiMH. Overall I'm very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muriel's favorite novella","review":"Who else can let you know at the start how the story's to end and yet hold your tension to the last?

Five for the amount of B.S. it contains. It never ceases to amaze me that in our modern society, the narcissistic people who are politically and socially corrupt, are hailed by themselves as hero's. Shaw confesses to having deceived his family for many years before finally writing his \\"legacy\\". What would make the reader now suddenly believe an admitted liar?

This is still a great figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended.","review":"The Silver Surfer is pretty much why I don't buy Toy Biz figures without looking at them **very** closely. What the web pictures don't show are how poorly the \\"points of articulation\\" are designed in the figure. The plastic joints, \\"rivets\\", and ball-and-socket points are very visible, making the Silver Surfer something of a metallic Frankenstein. Perhaps its the position of his head, but it seems as if his head is out of proportion to the rest of his body. Howard the Duck fared much better. Despite an oddly blank look, his clothes are well-detailed, even to the polka-dots on his tie and pattern on his coat. His trademark cigar, however, is missing.

I didn't find out tell then I was fooled. Actually, I find many 80's CD's that are like this everyday I shop. It's really a shame how people make unreal CD's and sell them to the public. The CD was made by people that sound almost as bad as the Kidz Bop people. Then, I read the CD more carefully and realized the words PERFORMED BY STARS AT STUDIO 99. A complete waste of money.

The smoldering, simmering \\"Me-And-Me-Horse-And-Me-Rum\\" grows on you after repeated listening. \\"Decadence Code\\" underscores just how smart and savvy this band could be. \\"Shotgun Messiah\\" is as good or better than any number the Rolling Stones have ever recorded, with Charlie Whitney setting down some blistering guitar.Streetwalkers, like Family, never quite made it to the big time. Blame poor management, the incursion of punk rock, or their refusal to kiss up to radio and studio moguls. But don't miss a chance to hear some pretty cool tunes that are well below the radar of the critics same old, same old \\"best of\\" blathering.

Part of it has to do, for me, with the fact that they were released almost simultaneously, some with the presence of eccentric vocalists in both bands. In any case, I heard \\"Red Card\\" in '76 with no familiarity with Familiy and found it to be an extremely unique and blistering combination of RnB, garage rock, and fiercely original music. The driving \\"Run For Cover\\" sounds like nothing I've ever heard before, pulsing and cinematic and brutal all at the same time. \\"Daddy Rolling Stone\\" shows everyone how they should cover blues classics, and \\"Me an Me Horse an Me Rum\\" nods like a junky on a street corner while maintaining its drive and energy.Again, there's probably better stuff, and my memories are colored by nostalgia for my freshman year of college, but \\"Red card' is a pretty fair release that sounds unlike anything else that came out of the year 1976..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for the Fiero enthusiast considering an engine swap or turbo.","review":"The book documents a father-son build of a very unique Fiero.

Wagoner documented every step, and includes many graphs and tables on weights, air-flow, horsepower, part sources and costs. The book also includes dozens of photos and clear wiring diagrams for mating an LS1 engine to the Fiero wiring harness. There are a lot of other tidbits of information on reducing weight and improving handling.

Investment in rechargeables has been well worth it for us. The only negative I've notices with any of these trains is that when you have ramp kits and build inclines, don't make the incline continuous or put a lot of cars on the train.

It is ELECTRICAL, and you can verify this at the Campbell Hausfeld website. My other big issue is that it is made in China.

It weighs almost as much as my old 15 gallon Campbell Hausfeld compressor (which was made in USA), but at least that thing has some wheels on it to help move it around.Spend a little extra and buy a Jenny or a Thomas compressor if you're gonna get one of these things.

The book devolves from there. The obvious sell here is the lurid sex scenes that pile one on top of the other (...) However, it comes across as extremely barren. All of the characters from Nick & Trish to ex-boyfriend Joe and abused sometime girlfriend Johnny are exceedingly trivial. None of these characters achieves any spiritual level of identification that gives a value level to the tale. Instead, the characters all have the mentality of bunnies, with my apologies to rabbits.

This is a passionate, minority view, one which looks like it could become mainstream as events unfold in the Middle East. I was charmed by its exuberance, moved by its passion, intrigued by its holistic view of the world ans surprised by its humour. Apparently Neville was something of an underground press celebrity in the sixties and this cheeky spirit shines through each page.

And while this is a good CD, it lacks the imagination and brilliance of \\"Replicas\\", and sounds a bit dated by comparison \\"It's So 1980's\\" as my little sister says.Well maybe so, but the 1980's weren't all bad: Thatcher was ending decades of socialist poverty & misery in the UK, while Reagan was laying the foundations for the greatest economic prosperity the world had ever known in America. And music was going really high tech.Gary Numan was on the vanguard of a truly new age in popular music: where software and producers ruled, and 'artists' were simply employees.THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE: A very good CD, but not a brilliant one. 'Cars': a song you simply must have and hear once in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant.","review":"This album still ranks as one of my favourite ever. Numan's first\\"solo\\" album and a follow up of sorts to the brilliant album \\"Replicas\\" by his former band \\"Tubeway Army\\". The album now sounds better than ever due to it being re-mastered and it contains an informative booklet inside the case containing very interesting info rmation about the production of the album. A great cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just 'Cars'","review":"This album, for me, is the essence of Gary Numan, cold, stark and utterley addictive. It kicks off with Airlane, not Airplane as the cd database seems to think when it is transferred to ipod. This track pounds along very nicely to launch into the album, followed by Metal, an absolute masterpiece of synth. Other outstanding tracks are Observer, followed by Conversation, my personal favourite, M.E, and the excellent Random which never made it on to the original release. There's not a bad track on this album, and if you want to start somewhere, start here. I love this album and after 30 years I'm still playing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHEN THE MACHINES ROCK !!!","review":"My least favourite of the first 4 albums but a great listen nonetheless.This album is very acomplished from a musical standpoint retaining the minimalism but lacking the agression of the 1st two (maybe it?s the total lack of guitars in it) .Anyway,some of the keyboards are distorted through guitar pedals and this creates a very unusual effect for that time.The bonus tracks are 3 nice but somewhat pointless instrumentals and 4 live tracks from the LO79 live album (which any fan owns) that serve the purpose of teasing newcomers into buying that CD and nothing else.The remastered sound is GORGEOUS and a far cry from that of the lp and even the early CD versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than Cars.","review":"It's amazing how much emotion Gary Numan was able to evoke with an album so dominated by electronic instruments. Numan produced a number of great albums in his heyday (I'm not a big fan of his recent, dark material), but the Pleasure Principle--with its Magritte take-off cover--has best withstood the test of time for me. Replicas comes close, but I think this is Gary at his best.Cars became a hit here and in the UK, but the rest of the cuts are every bit as strong. And there's a sensitivity on display behind the andriod cool that makes this music far more than the sum of its parts. Couple that with an excellent rhythm section, great keyboard textures, and first-rate arrangements, and you have an album that never seems to wear out its welcome.Gary Numan's voice can tend to become grating on some of his albums, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo! This is how to remaster!","review":"This album has always been a favorite of mine. From the hit song Cars to the lesser known tracks this album has never grown tired for me. The bonus material is absolutely awesome. I particularly am enjoying the demo version of Cars.The sonics/mastering are wonderful. I don't detect any hard limiting at all, nor do I hear any use of noise reduction or excessive EQing. Numan's vocals truly come to life in this remaster and it trounces previous CD issues. The sonics are much improved over the original CD issue of this album and I highly recommend you upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moments of musical brilliance, killed by so so lyrics","review":"Gary Numan is a far better composer that he is a lyric writer; although he does have moments of lyric brilliance (in \\"Metal\\" for example, and in some of his songs on his previous recording \\"Replicas\\").Given the limitations of electronic music in the late 70's, it's truly amazing how well his sound has aged (it still sounds as fresh as it did then). I rank him among the Godfathers of modern electronic pop music (which includes Brian Eno, Devo and Kraftwork).The repeated motifs of alienation on this record (given 20 years of distance) begin wearing out pretty fast (David Bowie did it much better with \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes\\" since he's a better lyric writer).I have to admit, even when I heard some of this stuff in the mid 80's, I thought it was so over the top (as far as lyrics) that I kept thinking of that old Ed Wood movie \\"Plan Nine From Outer Space\\" (is it supposed to be funny, or is it really serious?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jayo is the man.","review":"Positives: Jayo is a really good emerging rapper that should blow up pretty soon. His style is like no other and this album should have put him on the map. Features with Cube, Meth, Mack 10, Redman, Eightball, DMX, & E-40 should have gotten some attention even if nobody knew Jayo himself. I bought the album for the features and wasn't disappointed. Best Tracks are \\"Whatcha Gonna Do\\" with Meth and DMX, How Angry, & J.A.Y.O.Negatives: Not all the tracks are quite as good... as the ones with the big names and I know he can do better on his next one. Nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as i thought it would be","review":"This cd isnt that good, many of the songs are not worth listening. Probably the 2 worthy songs are nitty gritty and justice against yall oppressors which features e-40 & cube"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jayo Misdemeanor","review":"The album is definitely gangsta let's get that straight. Even with some eastcoast and down south guest appearances this still sounds like a straight up westcoast album. When I listen to Jayo I dont think San Diego but Los Angeles instead. But its whatever though. I think the Anita Baker remake is one of the hottest songs on the album as well as the last song on the album with Ice Cube and 40 water. But on side 2 (if you had the tape) there are like 3 songs in a row that is fast foward material. If you want to get some throw back Westcoast music then go get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jayo's got a flow like you wouldn't believe!","review":"I think what I like best about Jayo is his unique flow. His vocal style is just so unlike anybody else out there that you can't help but listen. When you combine that with the tight production on this album, you get one of the best hip hop CDs in years. For some reason, it was overlooked by both critics and heads alike.Aside from the one song that got significant radio play, WHATCHA GONNA DO with Method Man and DMX, there are several other standout songs on the album. These are HOW ANGRY, NITTY GRITTY, FINNA SHIT ON 'EM, and J.A.Y.O. - JUSTICE AGAINST Y'ALL OPPRESSORS. Another thing that makes this album good is the guest stars: E-40, Ice Cube, Eightball and MJG, Redman, W.C., and Mack 10 to name a few. The mix of east coast and west coast vocalists make for an eclectic flavor among the songs and gives the album that little extra sumthin' sumthin'.If you're a true hip hop head, you definitely need to peep this album. It's one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Jewish dog should own one","review":"My little girl just loves to hear the music because her mother sings the words to itthis toy is played with at CHANUKO and upto the end of January, then it is put away for another year"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for little dogs","review":"Mine lasted exactly 10 min before being destroyed by my dog.I have never seen him love something like that but it didnt hold up.Taree"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy","review":"My toy poodle loved this toy as wellas other talking toys.

She's funny in a gentle, whimsical style; these are comics you could enjoy yourself, and share with your 10-year-old niece. Really!Dog and Pony Show spans 8 years of Pam's comics, from 1993 to 2001. It ranges from little personal stories (like Nick's Killer Pigeons) to charming riffs on popular songs (Froggy Went a Courtin and Swing on a Star) to full-length stories (Those Kids and The Traveling Travelall).Pam's artwork is fine, and her characters (Radiation Man, Those Kids, Nahkt-Min and Katie, and all the dogs) are quirky and appealing.This is a great choice for anyone who loves comics, whether you're familiar with Pam Bliss' work or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old school martial arts film.","review":"Man I love this film.

The storyline isn't worth mentioning,but most old school kung fu films didn't have great stories. My biggest gripe is how underutilized sun Chien was in the film. He had a awesome fight scene which was one of the best in the films in my opinion.

This is a very poor man's Last Detail in a way, without good acting, stars like Nicholson, or much of a plot. Obviously, if you tend to enjoy what Booger enjoys, go for it.

But what's really worse about this pile of celuloide diarrehea is that these other films were Lawrence of Arabia compared to it, at least they SOME funny moments and launched the careers of some future stars like Phoebe Cates, Tim Robbins and Matthew Modine (and had a few nice pair of knockers thrown in as well.)Don't waste your time, eyes, ears and money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, really bad.

It is a common pitfall to bash the \\"state\\" - that is forgiven. However, to suggest that to swing to the other side of the pendulum is a silver bullten is rediculous. Most will agree that purposeful programs of character education reflective of students environmental/contextual lives is what is needed. Any program worth its weight can work within a federally-funded program to implement effective character programs. The two authors (who *are* these guys anway) seem to have an axe to grind politically rather than to present a thoughtful history and contemporary narrative. Readers are best off to explore the literature on moral development/education.

They are nothing but white people doing a terrible job at trying to rap.Songs like \\"The Bible Is Bulls**t\\" are nothing more than shock songs with no real meaning other than to [make people mad], they don't really have any knowledge to back up what they say so they sound foolish and end up making Christianity look good.

After that the watch lost its mind, with the digital and analog not syncing up. No idea what the problem is, but the watch is essentially useless.

She does a wonderful job belting out such standards as The Christmas Song, I'll Be Home for Christmas, and does a charming duet with Rosemary Clooney on White Christmas. Her rendition of Joni Mitchell's River is only so-so, sounding a bit too much like the original to really register.The biggest shock and disappointment is the way the album suddenly switches gears and becomes a series of choir pieces with Linda's voice becoming indistinguishable from everyone else's. It's almost like the musical equivalent of \\"Where's Waldo?\\" I assume she's somewhere in there, since her name is on the album, but she may just as well have decided to go home by then."},{"rating":"2","title":"sharing the spotlight","review":"This cd features beautiful singing by Linda Ronstadt throughout, but be aware that after track five, (with the exception of I Wonder As I Wander) the voice that you may be used to - warm, big and belty, disappears.

The musical selections and arrangements are inspired and the vocals are flawless, but if you're expecting Silent Night with an acoustic guitar and three part harmony you might be surprised. She does serve up some tasty \\"Nelson Riddle style\\" treats on the first half of the cd, including a gentle duet with Rosemary Clooney on \\"White Christmas\\" and a powerful version of \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\".

After my last eye exam, my doctor gave me a free sample of AMO Complete to try. I had been quite satisfied with what I was using (Alcon OptiFree Express), but decided to give AMO Complete a chance. What a difference! I immediately noticed that my lenses were more comfortable when putting them on in the morning. What surprised me, however, was that after nearly 10 hours of wear, I didn't experience the discomfort I usually get. After only two days I was hooked. I've tried all the major multi-purpose solutions (ReNu, Alcon, Boston) and AMO Complete is simply the BEST.

This book really does help me keep an open mind about my children and offers tools that help a parent cope with a problem instead of just blowing up. As parents we all have to decide how to handle each and every situation as each is different, but this book gives guidelines how to respond in alternate ways to a variety of problems encountered with children. My favorite is the \\"defiant\\" child chapter and let me tell you...the advice given there really does work with my kids! It's amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of low expectations","review":"The authors state that a C average in school is OK as most of us are around average in our abilities. Obviously (statistically) we are. The problem with this is that a C, a 2.0, is not average in school. The average GPA was 2.68 in 1990, rising to 2.94 in 2000, and to 3.0 in 2005. (National Assessment of Educational Progress) Thus if your child is getting all B's, he or she is average and maybe you can relax. A child with C's as typical grades is decidedly not average--all the more so because such a child is probably taking the most basic level of classes. Maybe such a child is doing the best he or she can, in which case fine. But don't be fooled into thinking that a C is average and is OK if your child is not working up to his or her potential. A C means that your child is way below average.I found this attitude of having very low expectations to be all too prevalent in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for parents","review":"The love and logic program is awesome!.

I'm almost 50 yrs old and had no experience with children. I started doing foster care and I can't imagine what trouble I'd have been in without all the Love and Logic techniques. They work with defiance, and with tantrums, and with controlling manipulative behavior. They make it possible to enjoy being a mom, and the major benefit is the children can relax, be respectful, accept love, and have fun instead of miring themselves in adversarial control battles with me.It does require a large amount of self-control, not taking offense at things, and being able to be loving when a kid is being very annoying, and being able to be sadly firm when the kid has gotten themselves in trouble and you would really love to rescue them instead of letting them learn.The book by itself is good, but if complimented with listening to the many audio-tapes, is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"spank your baby in a painful way?","review":"Please read what this book has to say about spanking:\\"...remember the following rules if you decide you must spank:- spank only when your child is under three years of age.- spank only if you can do it in a painful way....\\"I discovered this book when sorting out things to donate.

I was shocked, however, to find that the author advocated spanking, qualified it with an age restriction, and added rules to follow - one of which is \\"spank only if you can do it in a painful way\\". There are many ways of removing a child from a situation to teach them what is unacceptable, or dangerous, behavior. There are usually reasons for the behavior. Often they are just having trouble communicating. As a parent of an almost two year old I couldn't imagine ever hitting my own child. I can't think of anything it would teach him except that hitting is okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"The perfect parent writes a book.","review":"I couldn't even finish this book.

No real grounding in any evidence. Lame. The author is unaware of all the evidence-based parenting techniques that are known to work because of scientific research. Weirdly obsessed with moving the location of the tantrum, maybe because he knows he has no useful advice. Don't move a kid having a tantrum unless you have to. Check out the Kazdin Method book if you have behavior problems deal with.Of course, logic is a field that deals with the form of arguments independent of evidence, so at least the book lives up to it's title!One thing I liked. The author mentioned that teens often make bad choices because they are the first choices they are ever allowed to make. Good idea to let younger kids make choices, have some autonomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Baked Logic","review":"There are some good ideas in this book about how to be a coach and be consultative with children but there is an equal number of very bad ideas in this book. Some of the ideas suggest that parents will get an outcome that is totally absurd and makes me wonder if the authors truly have kids.This book will appeal to parents that want their kids to feel good about themselves even when those same kids do bad things. However, the country already has a couple generations of children that demonstrate this strategy does not result in responsible adults.Parenting is an active, participatory sport that requires parents to be ON THE FIELD playing their role.

Second book I've read from these authors...this one has practical advice that can be applied to every day interactions with all kinds of people...not just for parenting teenagers. I bought a copy for me and a copy for a friend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parenting With Love and Logic","review":"The book contained some good solutions for the problems encountered while raising children. However, some of the solutions are more idealogical rather than realistic. As is usually the case with advice given by other people, some of the advice is good and should be followed and some of the advice is not good and should be ignored. It is up to the parent to determine which of the solutions are practical and which are nonsense. For example, letting children suffer the consequences of making bad decisions without parental intervention will not always work. Letting children go to bed late one night will not cause them to always go to bed on time after that. They will continually stay up late, sleep at odd times and therefore, be constantly tired and grouchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Teaches Real Life","review":"...I am a teacher and a parent and children from the very beginning need to be able to understand their actions. That means real understanding of why they are doing, and understand that life is a matter of choices - get cold or wear a coat, eat or be really hungry for lunch later. Too often today's kids, especially those I see in the classroom, have not been taught why they are doing what they are doing, and as a result can not make reasonable acceptable choices for new situations. This books helps parents and children learn how to teach each other about new situations and life's choices. Remember new parents, if you have made all of your children's choices for them; then when a new situation arises and you are not around, they may not know how to think through the situation and come up with a logical responsible decision. Please buy this book and help your children in this irresponsible world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please remove Christianity from this book.","review":"I like the ideas behind this book and I try hard to look past the authors trying to force Christianity down the reader's throat, but sometimes it's hard. Citing God and the Garden of Eden as if it's fact and has anything to do with good parenting is offensive to me. Many times I have wanted to put the book away and never pick it up again because I do not share Christian beliefs. In today's world with all of the various religions and beliefs, I feel that the authors of this book are pushing away potential parent readers by focusing so much on a single religion. Each chapter even starts with a quote from the bible. I highly suggest that the christian element is removed from this book in the next version and I'm sure that your messages will reach more readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parenting teens","review":"Being a parent of a teen for the first time, I was looking for some insight. I had heard many good things about this book. As I first started to read it I was greatly disappointed. This book strongly advocates lying to your children and being passive aggressive. If we are trying to teach our children good values and help them be adults of good character this book is unacceptable. I expect the same values in myself that I do in my child.

The writers espouse no punishment because the child doesn't get punishment in the \\"real world.\\" The examples of handling situations with teens include, \\"What to do when the police call and have your son in jail.\\" Most teens discussed are in serious trouble and have poor relationships with their parents. The kids are in charge in these households, not the parents. (The parents never read, DARE TO DISCIPLINE!)

They should never yield power over someone smaller or weaker than themselves. Maybe the authors need to be physically bullied (ex. spanked) by someone 100+ lbs bigger than them so they can feel what a child feels when some stupid or gullible adult follows their advice.

This one does the job that well. There's a reason teachers use Love and Logic in their classrooms - because it works. You can even try this one thing today, before you even buy the book - start giving your child choices (where you are fine with either choice). Would you like to wear the blue shirt or the red shirt? Would you like to wear your coat or carry it? Would you like milk or water with lunch? I promise you will see a difference in your child immediately!! They will feel more in control, they will be happier, and when it's time for something to happen that isn't a choice (time for bed!) they will be more willing to cooperate with you. Try it!

Natural consequences should not always be trusted to teach higher principles of empathy, justice, and mercy; values I want my children to embrace. Often, good people must invervene to protect the weak and capable people must look after the disadvantaged.You will likely find a handful of good suggestions in this book but use with caution. For the detached, emotionally unhealthy parent, it could be a powder keg. Boundaries with Kids, in my view, is a more balanced approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book and the author are dangerous","review":"The American Psychological Association has issued a warning against this book and the author.

In one case, he told a 300 pound woman to sit on her toddler child as he was having a temper tantrum. The woman ended up killing the child. The book is filled with bad advice. Previous versions of the book included how to spank your children.

I found its recommendations to be punitive; e.g. suggesting spanking which must cause pain, for children under three. The suggestions of things for parents to say to their children are often sarcastic or even snide sounding.

And for me there is much too much religious content. I was appalled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great advice","review":"My daughter is way too smart for a 4 year old and has been able to manipulate us into giving in too often.

How \\"Christian\\" is that? Certainly not compassionate or loving to either the pet or the child. Yes of course the child needs to learn responsibility, but to the point of allowing the animal to starve is neglect & the parents should be charged with animal cruelty. How anyone can suggest it is beyond me.This book went right back to the library: obviously, their philosophy & mine do not meet at any crossroads by bypass one another completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Half of What We Need","review":"This is an extremely practical book that describes how to quickly resolve some of the most difficult behavioral challenges we parents face. Perhaps it is the best book of its type. However, it does not explain how to apply these techniques to especially wild/ADHD children, or how to get a child not only to behave but also to deeply respect and love his/her parents, or a number of other broad challenges that we face as parents. I did find another book that does just this. I strongly recommend getting a copy of Love and Logic along with another book, TO KINDLE A SOUL, by Lawrence Kelemen. Kelemen answers all the broader questions in the same very practical style. The two are 100% compatible, and each without the other is missing something. Together, they are the perfect package for expert parenting."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to raise quiet, manipulative christian kids","review":"- Some good points in the book but a writing style that would even make Kathy Lee Gifford gag.- Not sold as a \\"Christian\\" book but is heavily slanted that way.Overall, I feel these techniques, if taken as the absolute facts in which they are portrayed, will make your children quiet, well behaved, law abiding and brain dead. It claims to encourage thinking for yourself but if someone gives you two choices that amount to the same thing, are you thinking for yourself or just being manipulated? And you're being taught how to manipulate others. Most of their advice boils down to saying \\"You can walk to your room or I can carry you there\\" rather than \\"Go to your room.\\" All of the better advice in the book can be found in many better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"No love, no logic here!","review":"There are so many better parenting books out now that there is no need to read this one! Where is the love & logic in hitting a child under the age of 3 over & over until he complies? Where is the logic in letting a dog be gassed at the dog pound instead of feeding it? One part of the child rearing technique is called Basic German Shepherd commands (come, sit, go, no stay). The misguided authors actually seem to believe in this! It's scary! This book only got a rating of 1 because there was no choice of 0. If you need a book about firm discipline & don't want to train your children like dogs (which they most certainly are not), try a much more humane approach, such as in Jane Nelsen's \\"Positive Discipline A to Z\\" or Jerry Wyckoff's \\"Without Shouting or Spanking.\\" Please don't use this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very scared- wanting partnership instead of power over","review":"summary critique- confuses empathy and hierarchical (power over) educationI define empathy as being present for another's experiencewithout trying to fix anything.

For example, letting them make their own decisions on whether or not to be late for school. Letting them face the consequences for that. In my experience, my child doesn't care if he's late. If I didn't stay on him to get him going in the mornings he wouldn't bother to go at all. Let alone worry about being late. The only one facing a consequence there is me. Same as for the grades. He would rather face a consequence of not going or not doing homework. He sees the consequence in these situations as the lessor of the two evils. And He could care less if I get into trouble.Now the tips and techniques for parents on not losing their control has been a blessing. Just takes practice and patience. Something I have little of.

A tv channel. Thats right, she put her hand up to the tv screen and was instantly 100 pounds and had a gorgeous man. its a sci-fi romance! And I'm all for a good love scene, but that was sick filth.

Otherwise, the crystals detonate and destruction for miles and dozens/hundreds of miles will occur!!! The bomb is called, \\"ELVIS\\" and it kills anything living/organic compounds within a matter of seconds. The first few mins. of the film show what ELVIS can do, when it kills from its detonation. Quite incredible!!!!!So, the last thing is: either you will be like me-and you will LOVE this film, -or- You won't!!! But, check it out, nonetheless!! I highly recommend it. I find myself watching it once, then wanting to watch it again, the day after. $"},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL","review":"CHILL FACTOR is a combination of almost every action movie of the past ten years, but it is entertaining, fast-paced, with some really exciting action sequences. Director Hugh Johnson wisely eschews character development and focuses on the chase. Peter Firth does a good job as the villainous Bremer, an Army general who took the fall for a disastrous chemical warfare accident which killed 18 soldiers. After ten years in prison, he vows revenge by selling the deadly agent to the highest bidder. Skeet Ulrich as the badboy Mason and Cuba Gooding Jr. as the ice cream truck driver he forces to help him transport the deadly agent to an Army base in Montana do well in their buddy roles. CHILL FACTOR stretches the limits for credibility, but it moves well and entertains, that's what this kind of movie should do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TALENT","review":"IT'S AMAZING HOW A GREAT ACTOR LIKE CUBA GOODING, JR.

As stated above, this movie is an obvious ripoff of Speed. Not only is it a ripoff, but the jokes get in the way of the action. The first 20 minutes are attrocious, and in a 90 minute film that can be a bit of a problem. Predictable to the end, this movie just doesn't deserve some of the reviews I have seen for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"This film had some decent action scenes, but it was nothing beyond that. The story is a [compilation] of several movies you've already seen, the characters are dry and pointless, and Cuba Gooding Jr never seems to nail down exactly what kind of character he's portraying. I can't watch him act... I never know where he's coming from, and I can't watch him act like virtually the same character in every one of his movies. Skeet plays his part with no heart as well... in fact the entire cast does. I guess it must be hard to do a movie knowing the script is as horrible as this one.Don't waste your money.

Meanwhile, the stiff badguy, Peter Firth (Pearl Harbor) is hot on their tail to try to get the bomb from them. Supposed buddy flick doesnt hold up to it's end and the supporting cast is wasted off, Firth's badguy isnt even that great of a villain. Ulrich and Gooding, Jr. are a good team but they arent fit for their parts, though they have some funny scenes, particualarly the scene where they louge the boat down the hill, otherwise it's all throwaway.

My husband and I don't typically like the same types of games, but he was even playing this game! It was fantastic! The music, graphics, storyline and everything was great! The game really draws you in. My only issue was that I had rented the game, so I didn't have the instruction book and there was no way for me to find out what my controls were besides just experimenting (I probably could have looked online).

The gamplay was superb, if extremly difficult at times. The story one of the best in a game ever. The sequal though I cant call a game, it is a c.g. movie with game elements added in just so they could call it a game. In all this product was about 10-15 hours but you actually only have at most 2 hours of gameplay, and that was poor at best. The story however was deep and engrossing, much like a good fantasy/sci-fi book. My only complaint with the story was the ending left every story thread unresolved.

Yes, but only if you want a good story and dont care about playing a game."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess it's a game.","review":"It's not really a game. It is more of a story you 'participate' in.

Before I bought this game I read a review that said it was almost more like watching a movie than playing a video game--and in some places, this is true.This game is dialogue-intensive, with a few puzzles here and there that are mostly pretty easy. I enjoyed the various cities and worlds the main characters found themselves in, and the graphics and voice talent are amazingly good.People who like high-action video games with lots of combat probably won't like this game, but those who like exploration, sophisticated storylines, and real-seeming characters will like Dreamfall a lot. In fact, combat is clunky and obviously not meant to be a major part of the game.My only complaints: The overall story would have been even better if I'd played the first game (Dreamfall is a sequel); and the replay value is low, since I don't think you can play any different characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright...","review":"I think it is pretty good but not great. like someone else said theres not a ton of gameplay and so much talking.

This combination can occasionally work well; some authors have a knack for combining these two things into a fascinating work, but the balance is off here. There are outrageous events to be sure, battling paleontologists, a drunken blowhard of a Buffalo Bill, and of course that staple of western fiction, the Arabian prince and his harem. With this set up there are bound to be a few good laughs, but strewn throughout are also vicious killings that become discordant after awhile, not so much moving the plot along, rather they seem to be there to remind the reader that the West was a brutal place. It just doesn't mesh together well, and for me it was just too much of a bad thing spoiling a decent number of good laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bits!","review":"Freud are the best bits in the market in imho. 1/2 the price here on Amazon than at Woodcraft & Home Depot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I was really excited about this product.

The process does take a little getting used to (my husband tried it and is not a fan) but, it has helped me when I get stuffy and don't want to take medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works, no gimmicks!","review":"I'm a chronic allergy suffer that uses Allegra D and Rhinocort AQ spray. Not only does this product help with immediate congestion relief, it's so effective that using it every 2 weeks to once a month could eliminate the need to take ANY allergy medicines. I've cut back my use of meds about 75%. There's a technique to using it, just don't give up after the first or second time. Yes it will feel uncomfortable, but you have to remember to breathe through your mouth. AND you should blow your nose (one nostril at a time) immediately after using it. Within 10 minutes, you'll notice a completely clear feeling. This is a great investment for allergy suffers who would rather not take meds or who need immediate relief on bad hay fever days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design for an otherwise great item","review":"This specific design does not work well for me. I have difficulty getting the water from the container into my nose without spilling it and making a mess.You do not have to purchase any mixture to put into your water. Using a pinch of non iodized salt in the water works just as well. Iodized salt will burn terribly.I have a much easier time with the Neti pot made by the Himalayan Institute. Amazon carries those as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can breathe through my nose again!","review":"This is the best $15 you could possibly invest if, like me, you have any sort of chronic allergies or sinus troubles. From the very first use I couldn't believe what a difference it made. And (I apologize in advance for delving into the sordid details) you will be amazed at the nastiness that drains out of your head.It's easy as pie to use and takes about 2 minutes total once you get used to it. Now I use my Neti pot daily and try to get all my friends and family to buy them. How did I get by without one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good way of cleaning your sinuses","review":"I bought this because I was pregnant and thought it would be a good way of clearing my stuffy nose, since I can't take antihistamines. My husband and I have both used it and think it definitely works. It does take a while to get the right technique, but I felt better after using it and will use it in the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It","review":"This is my third Neti pot. The first one was a small one, made of ceramic, but I dropped it in the sink, and it broke instantly. The second one was made of plastic and I liked it because the nozzle went into my nose easier than the ceramic, but I worried about the plastic being unhealthy and not clean enough. This new Ancient Secrets Neti pot is a delight. I could be wrong, but it seems sturdy and probably won't break if dropped in the sink, at least not at first. It's also very easy to use, although I found I had to learn the trick for my left nostril how not to spill the water -- for some reason.It is very light and it easy to clean. I'm happy it does not have a lid -- since it's one less thing to have to clean, find, and be concerned about."},{"rating":"1","title":"neti pot","review":"This product was not as advertised.

I used the neti pot as directed, and it seemed to work great. I was able to breathe through both nostrils, so I was very hopeful. I went to sleep and woke up about 4 hours later with SEVERE congestion. I was not able to pass anything through my nostrils at this point.It was worth a shot, but I don't think this is a \\"cure-all\\" for everyone :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product","review":"This nasal cleansing pot is fantastic. It is FAR superior to the Neil Med toxic plastic bottle. It is VERY easy to use, you just have to find the right head-tilt to keep the water from running down your cheek. I highly recommend this great little pot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems like such a simple idea","review":"I bought this item thinking I would just give it a try, but not expecting it to work. I love it and now I don't know what I did without it. I don't know why to so many of us it makes more sense to pop an allergy or cold pill before trying a non-medicinal method. Just think about all the junk that your body has to deal with everyday from pollution to household dust. Just look at your windows!I find it best to use the Neti pot in the shower standing up, just as part of my daily return with warm water. I do suffer from occasional allergies, and this helps a lot. I started using the Neti before the winter and I have gone the entire winter without catching a single cold. I don't use any special salt, just non-iodized salt from the grocery store for .75 cents. Last forever. No need to spend extra money on fancy salts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathe Through Your MOUTH","review":"This is a pretty good product, but remember to take your time, slow down, and breathe through your mouth!!

The glazed finish is nice and even. I did not see any flaws on the pot whatsoever. The spot has an even circle end to it. No complaints at all. I liked it so much I even bought a backup just in case. Once you feel the fresh sensation of this you will be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to really work","review":"Ok, so I do not use the netti pot, but I do have singing students who combat allergies that now use this. They are having a lot of success at keeping their allergies down with this. I have watched how it is used and seems to work fairly easily. All of them LOVE IT, and love to talk about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Netti Pot's are a simple to use and very old idea. There really isn't too much to the item, as it is so simple, and that is what is great about it. Easy to clean, easy to use, and it REALLY DOES WORK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for allergy suffers","review":"I love this product. I use it every night and I've seen a dramatic difference in my allergies. I suffer from postnasal drip so I was constantly clearing my throat, this has substantially decreased my annoying cough!! I would highly recommend for allergy suffers. It does take a little getting used to, so give it a week or so and you'll be an old pro!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as promised","review":"This Neti Pot is easy to use, dishwasher safe and works great. You don't need to buy those expensive solutions, just a little salt and water. If you get a chance, watch the Oprah episode so you can see how its done. I think I would have struggled if I hadn't seen the episidoe. Just reading the instructions is a little confusing the first time. If it goes down your throat then you need to tilt your head forward (my husband learned the hard way)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good, better than plastic","review":"I bought the ceramic neti pot to replace the plastic one that came with nasal rinse solution. The ceramic pot looks a lot nicer on the bathroom counter. As for functionality, it's a little better than the plastic one.For those who never used a neti pot, it changed my allergy-ridden life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so much better than plastic","review":"I have an extremely good sense of smell, I could not stand to use the little blue portable plastic pots anymore. I love this ceramic one, it is definitely the way to go, why wash your nasal passages out & have any residual smells of plastics, defeats the purpose in part. It is sturdy & easy to clean, and seems so much ore sanitary than plastic. Soooo glad I spied this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveable","review":"I was very skeptical about purchasing this product but decided I had tried almost everything to clear my sinuses, so why not try this. It works, it really works and I am thrilled with it. I had heard many years ago about a pot filled with salt water to clear the sinus but I had never seen one nor did I know where to purchase one. Highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fix a flat","review":"If you can change a tire, you can plug a flat tire. These will come in handy.

I haven't used it yet, but it seems to be a good set. It appears that this is just supposed to be a temporary fix until you can get to a tire shop. So if you are looking for a set to permanently fix your tire I think you may want to find a more expensive set. After I use this product I will come and update my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is an exceptional Tire Repair Kit. I used to to fix my flat tire.

Not in the same class as a Soundblaster but not as expensive either. Good inexpensive upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Piece of Junk","review":"Installed this on a box with XP Pro, and the box wouldn't boot. It got stuck in POST startup, wouldn't even bring up the BIOS, said there was some sort of memory error.

I was disappointed to see that the Windows 7 driver was not included on the CD, but I was able to download the driver from their website. It's disappointing when manufacturers can't update their CDs in a timely manner because Windows 7 has been out for a couple of years now.

I almost forgot to tell you, it is a pain in the back to get the drivers, and when you get the drivers in startech.com you can install it but then wait until your screen turns blue... yes the blue screen we all fear...

Each time it went into an endless loop during bootup (unlike the install on PC#1, I was asked to reboot to finish the install process). Finally, it seemed to install (it didn't ask for a reboot) and ran all day. My relief was short-lived however. When I rebooted the next day,the PC went into an endless loop.

There is almost no character progression in the story or development at all in this. The entire promise story, Tokyo U and all other character plots make an abrupt stop as Kanako (you'll learn who she is) enters the story. This book is actually frustrating to read because you hate the newest addition to the cast so much. It's a worthless struggle and the best part is when she is completely overthrown temporarily. I seriously hope that Kanako doesn't stay in the story for long at all because it would be an absolute disaster that would pretty much ruin the story. There's only a few more books left in the series, let's just hope that those manage to climb up from the crater that this one blew them down into.(Oh yeah, and a talking cat? PLEASE NO MORE!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"New character ruins this book","review":"All the other books were great to read through, but this one I was just waiting for the girl to just go away.

You aint missing much with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"first bad love hina book in the series","review":"While the superb artwork is up to par with the rest of the series, this may seriously be the start of the \\"downhill\\" slope for the storyline. The lack of the main character for most of the book (and thus no interaction with Naru), plus the introduction of a irritating new character, make this the first bad Love Hina book. I hope the next books can spring back with some of the older Love Hina storyline, because this new character may be enough to ruin the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Dimension of Love Hina","review":"I know there are many people who don't want the plot to progress outside of Naru and Keitaro, but I thought that the new character added a new dimension to the series. I say, anyone who doesn't like it should stop their moaning and stop degrading the series with their whining and complaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am in complete agreement with the one other customer review that has appeared to date for this book. The information offered is interesting. However, this book was cheaply produced and apparently rushed into print to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the creation of Grant Wood's masterpiece. The illustrations hardly merit the name, so murky they completely obscure the author's points. And there doesn't seem to have been even the most cursory edit. The frequent typos, grammatical errors, jumbled words are a major distraction. Quite honestly, someone of Thomas Hoving's stature should be embarassed to have his name attached to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colt Heritage: The Official History of Colt Firearms from 1836 to present","review":"The book was in good shape but advertised as like new which was an over rating of the item I received.

If all you want is a \\"point and shoot\\", it'll do that. If you want absolute control of the camera, you can do that. In between are enough modes and settings to keep a very advanced amateur satisfied. The flash is amazing. It has a guide number of 152. It follows every movement of the lens, zooming instantly. It can also be used off the camera and is triggered by the HTsi's built-in fill flash. I was a little worried about the heavy use of plastics in the camera.

Ii read the directions, and though they were a little confusing because the pics were black and white, i figured it out in about 30 min total time from opening the box to starting the heater. I did have a little trouble starting the heater. When starting the heater, the knob is supposed to be turned to the pilot option, AND pushed in while the ignition button starts the fire.

I was especially surprised that most of the girls strip immediately without any buildup of suspense. It's as though the contest was very rushed, so you're left feeling like you've seen just short clips of strip-tease acts. Now, a video of good-looking women dancing nude can't be all bad, but it can be done a lot better than this.

Cutting around a 1\\" square I ended up with a square very close to 15/16\\" on a side. Lied to my CNC software and told it the bit was 3/32\\" in diameter, and I could then cut the 1\\" square within 5/1000\\". What does it mean? It means the blade is off-center by approximately 1/64\\".This was not a single instance of a flawed product. I have 3 of these bits, and they all cut the same square from the same file 1/16\\" small.Currently waiting on Amana and Onsrud 1/16\\" straight bits. Will update this review on their accuracy when they arrive. I've had best luck with Onsrud bits in larger sizes being exactly what they claim to be. Hopefully their 1/16\\" bit is also precise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old fashioned gentleman and his Christmas","review":"So far, I've only read the 1st of the two stories. Colonel Carter is a old fashioned gentleman from the old South. He still belives in truth and honor, something that was surely lacking in the South after the war between the states when carpetbaggers overran the South with cheating and lies. The Colonel invites a devious Northerner and his young daughter to join him and his family for Christmas. The day brings something into his life that had been lacking in the Colonel's existance and opens the eyes of the businessman showing him there is much more to life than business and money. Nice story, I really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great board book for penguin-lovers !!!","review":"Great illustrations make this another wonderful board-book for any family collection.

I highly recommend these books for every young Christian child."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS BOOK","review":"Please do not read this book as it contains utter nonsense because a lot of the quotes are translated wrongly. It makes the holy Granth sound like a book of fairy tales. The author does not even read the original Granth in Gurmukhi! Rather, he read only one translation in English. How is he to get the true meaning of the holy Granth? The translations in English are word for word and don't pay attention to the cultural and historical background at the time of the writing and this causes a lot of the translations to seem awkward. THIS IS A GRAVE INSULT TO THE SIKH FAITH and should not be read by anyone who wants to learn about the Sikhs."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to Nora's usual standards","review":"Mind Over Matter is a pure escapist reading that cannot be taken seriously or realistically. I found it difficult to get through, mostly because it wasn't believeable and the dialogue was so unnatural. I had a hard time looking at it superficially. A clairvoyant mother-daughter duo hooks up with a documentary producer who wishes to portray them in the most positive light possible. The mother is very likable, but the daughter is so prickly and hostile that it is hard to imagine the sympathetic producer becoming interested in her. I have to admit to skimming through the last half of the story because I couldn't bear reading it any further that I already had but I needed to satisfy my curiosity as to whether the story got any better and satisfy my need to know how it ended. The subject matter was interesting and unique enough that the story had great potential if only it had been better developed and was well-written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book!

They have lost plenty of that popularity lately, as many think of them as sell-outs, or other kids are just trying to be cool, saying they only like death metal and everything else sucks.Korn has gotten more experimental lately, with Issues, Untouchables, and See You On The Other Side being less heavy and trying new things. Fans have been lost, but I see Korn as one of the most important heavy bands in the history of music. They opened a lot of doors and helped to make metal popular again. And, despite what many may think, I appreciate their music in all stages of their career. It shows growth and keeps things fresh and interesting. Some albums have been better than others, sure, but none have been bad. Follow the Leader is a defining moment in their careers and features many of their best songs. It is loud, angry, catchy, and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this -1000 stars","review":"All I really want to say is that you people who say that Korn started metal are idiots. NWOBHM started metal. And to any of you who do not know what that means, it stands for New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Korn isn't even metal in the first place. They're rap with drums. In Got the Life, the only guitars are during the chorus. Korn sucks a$$. Metallica rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Gave it Away","review":"Wow, this CD just blows. Seed is probably the only passable song on the album, and even that song is lyrically trash. I can honestly say this is the worst CD I have ever owned. Good thing someone else gave it to me free... seeing a pattern here? Any CD that gets passed from person to person because no one wants it must suck bad. I couldn't bear to have something so completely horrible in my CD case.

Anyone else should stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't follow this leader,","review":"Follow the leader seems to be just summarize a bunch of suburban angst. The music seems to be angry for the sake of being angry. There really seems to be anything inovative from Korn on this album, like could be found from their first two album. They play fairly well toghether so it seems like the potential to be good but overall the album is a chore to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Korn needs to return to their roots","review":"I first heard of Korn right before Life is Peachy came out. I bought their debut album and loved it. I bought Life is Peachy and could see Korn's future. Sellout. With Follow the Leader these guys went even further into the land of seelouts accompanying Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit and Metallica. Rap is one thing. Rock is one thing. They should never be mixed together. These 5 guys need to sit down and listen to their debut and figure out where they went wrong. When the debut came out, Davis was screaming one long cry of angst at his parents, jocks, and girls. That those same people are buying Follow the Leader is the least of this bands ironies. If you want pure in-your-face-metal stick with the debut.

This album, instead of living up KORN's potential, is a kitschy, commercial, annoying nightmare with MAYBE 2 or 3 listenable songs on it, including their smash-hit song \\"Freak on a Leash\\", which itself is heartbreaking because it shows the talent that is still lying under the surface. The reasons I did not give it a one star rating are: They're not an NKOTB/Spice Girls pre-fab clone nightmare; and In honor of their talent which they (HOPEFULLY) will use in their next album should they choose to make one after this Garbage Inc."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST","review":"hey! this is probably the coolest cd they made the ideas of korn are so cool like beginning at 13 instead of ending with it, and making a hidden track where all of them switch instruments, and vocal lines. you should buy this, and issues!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New music for korn","review":"I will admit this is new for korn. It is definetely different from Korn and Life is Peachy. I'm just glad that they cut the rap on Issues...but I still think Issues is not a very good cd. In the beginning it was all about korn's heavy metal thrashing. Now they're into rap...well, I guess you have to experience things sometimes. My personal favorite on the cd is Got the Life...which shows some sympathy, but Jon just doesn't give what it takes anymore like he did in self-entitled and parts in Life is Peachy. I have all four albums and I see major differences in all of them...from self-entitled to Life is Peachy, Life is Peachy to Follow \\"...\\", The both of them compared to follow, Follow to Issues, All three to Issues...anyway, that's what I like about them.

People call this hardcore but it's not - to these ears it sounds like a hip-hop Matchbox 20. There is no aggression or punishing riffs - it's all watered down so the masses aren't offended. I'm sure this CD has found a nice spot on the shelf between Alanis Morissette and Matchbox 20 on many a trendy MTV lover's collection. This is too soft for me - buy it if you like Puff Daddy.

With Head Munky and Fieldy doing the guitars and bass beat, and David doing the drums, a little Fred Durst from limp bizkit, Ice Cube, Trevant Hardson from pharcyde, and cheech Morino from Deftones, and with alot of Jonathan Davis to lead the pack, nothing can stop this CD. I definetly recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total garbage! Don't waste your money!","review":"This is the first Korn CD I have ever bought. It will also be the last. It is total garbage! I heard Got The Life on the radio, and that is why I bought the CD. That is the only good song on the entire CD. This is not metal. This is not industrial. And this is not rap. This is a CD where Korn tried to be all three and failed miserably at everything and ended up being nothing but trash. Bottom line? This CD isn't worth the price of the plastic it was made from. Don't waste your money. At times, this CD seems to imitate Biohazard, at other times, Nine Inch Nails or Manson.. It fails miserably in all atempts though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hip-Hop Professionals","review":"These guys are so wicked talented, they practically invented both metal and hip-hop, and do a genius job together melding the two styles!!

I am a metal fan, but don't have a problem with rap, I just don't listen to it. However, this crossover sucks. The 'metal' riffs are not rock or metal, they are crap from untalented guitarists. The rap lyrics and beats are annoyning and repetive, not to mention juvenile. This is boring for everyone. If you want some good metal get some earlier Metallica, Faith No More, Sepultura, Pantera, or AC/DC. Leave this CD and others like it (Limp Bizkit, Orgy) for teenybopper freaks who think they're tough."},{"rating":"1","title":"singer screaming more than singing","review":"Metal clashing and the singer screaming more than singing, is this music?!

The first twelve tracks have nothing on them, which makes no sense. Then they start of well with the catchy song \\"It's On!,\\" but \\"Freak on a Leash\\" is just weird, with the singer in the background making sounds like he's having a seizure. \\"Got the Life\\" is OK, but \\"Dead Bodies Everyhwhere\\" is just plain disturbing, with dark, eerie music playing in the background and what appears to be children's music playing in the foreground. It sounds like music for \\"Village of the Damned.\\" \\"Children of the KoRn\\" is awful, and so is every song after this.

Maybe then you will understand what I am saying... Got The Life is about as hardcore as MMMbop and Freak on a Leash is a poor attempt by Jon Davis to prove he didn't sell out with his notorious incoherent babblings...too bad even the babbling are watered down just like the rest of this recording...In other words if you like this release I recommend you go out and buy the Hanson cd along with the Backstreet Boys cause KoRn is now officially gone pop.

These songs were more hard rock then metal, not as intense, and just not as fun. Oh and KoRn does sounds good with ICE CUBE and FRED DURST but just think KoRn should stay away from hip hop.

This time out there are new twists in the formula, because Peachy was a lot like their debut. Both albums were good, it just seemed that Peachy was the first album revisited. Good hooks, great guest mc-ing. A prime example is the \\"battle rap\\" old school style diss song with Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit ragging on Jon Davis, which is quite comical and inventive. As well as Ice Cube's guest stint in the hardcore Children of the Korn to name two.

This CD is full of rap and hip-hop, and I'm not into that kind of music. Songs like \\"Children Of The KoRn\\", \\"All In The Family\\", and \\"Cameltosis\\" are almost totally rap.The only good songs on this CD are \\"It's On\\", and \\"Seed\\".

This album just makes me wanna mosh.I love all the songs on the album, especially Freak On A Leash being a bass player. I think the callaboration with Fred Durst on All In The Family is superb, and I think that the drive, energy and sheer rawness of this album is sorely lacking from Limp Bizkit's new album 'Chocolate Starfish..'This album is A MUST BUY, the only reason it does not get 5 stars is because that is reserved for my absolute golden mantlepiece albums.

A bassist myself, I'm offended by Fieldy's style. I wonder if Bootsy imagined that this would happen to slap bass some day. And explain to me this.. why do you need 2 guitarists playing the same guitars playing the same riff at the same time? One must have been a freind from the AV club in high school. Slow drummer. Gravely, weak vocals. 7 string guitars playing 6 string progressions. And Cliff Burton from Metallica played more notes in his solo than Fieldy has played in his entire career. Utterly usless.

Yeah, well, if they want to try something different, let them. Changing prevents a little thing called *stagnating*, so get over it, get a job. Korn still rocks, they rocked before and they shall rock forevermore. If you ask me, the *true* fans are the ones who accept these five awesome musicians for who they are and what they do, no matter how they change. Those who call them sellouts are just mad 'cause Korn really do have a wider range of talent than was previously exposed, and now they're choosing to show it. So go ahead and buy the album. You just might like it, and guess what - that's no crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as their first","review":"This has already been said, but let me emphasize it for the zillionth time....KORN DID NOT START THIS RAP-ROCK TREND! BEASTIE BOYS & RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE DID, SO GIVE THEM SOME CREDIT! Anyway, about this cd, like I said...just NOT as good as their first...couple of cool songs, like \\"Freak on a Leash\\" (esp. the video) & \\"Got the Life\\". But they should've thought twice about hooking up with Ice Cube...& although I like some of their songs, I gotta agree with a previous review...to sum it up, this band just has MEDIOCRE, if ANY musical talent...maybe if they just brushed up on their musical skills, they'd be worth all the hype their getting, but there's just not enuff talent here! If yer a musician, you should know that already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn??? I'm hungary but I don't see any korn!","review":"I think this album is pretty good, but too much rapping!

This album rocks and anyone that likes metal or likes their older stuff then buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not their debut good","review":"This is a good album,not average,not great,just good. The best song on this album is \\"B.B.K.\\".Everyone credits KoRn for being the best at everything they do.Jon is a good singer but Chino Moreno of the Deftones is better.Fieldy is a good bass player but Les \\"The God of bass\\" Claypool is a million times better,and he sure as hell ain't better looking than Melissa of Hole. Head and Munky kick *** but seem to be getting slower on their guitars.David is an amazing drummer but for some reason he doesn't get a chance to display it as much as the first two albums.\\"Life is Peachy\\" is still my favorite, even though it lacks \\"Blind\\". One last thing is Jonathon's song writing is getting worse. He is trying to be sarcastic and cool but Kurt Cobain was the only one to ever pull that off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, totally Horrible","review":"This has to be the worst album (besides Metallica's loads and covers) that has ever been born into existence!!

I thought they were a good band... defintely different. I bought their second album and I was dissapointed but I still liked the band. When I heard the first couple of tracks on the album I thought it was an incredible improvement over their previous albums. They seemed to have grown into their instruments. I was impressed to say the least and then I listened on. How many times can you play the same song over and over and over? The album went downhill... fast. And whats with this \\"Parents just don't understand\\" B.S? Didn't Will Smith cover this a couple of years ago? I think they need to get off that \\"Parents Hate Us\\" kick and pay more attention to the quality of their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty","review":"This is the worst music I have ever listened to.

If you liked the first two, then you will love this one. Follow the Leader shows all of Korn's talent and then some.

My guess is that the people who are giving only one star just don't like Korn's style of music and would be better off picking up a Spice Girls or N'sync CD (if they don't already have them) and leaving Korn to those of us who fully appreciate them. \\"Life is Peachy\\" was kind of a rip-off, but Korn has come back strong with their latest and greatest in \\"Follow the Leader\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This Record has almost no energy, its clear that Johnathon Davis has become drunk with his stardom... its like when the Doors released the Soft Parade.

I think it was Kurt Cobain who put it best, \\"Any rock music is good just as long as it has a good beat and it has passion.\\" This cd has neither. All it is are a bunch of posers hopping a ride on the bandwagon because they think Korn are real killer dudes that really know how to rock a house.

I doubt anybody even listens to these lousy guys anymore. This CD sounds ancient and dated only a few years after its release. Korn almost makes me embarrased to admit that I grew up in the 90s. What will future generations think of us 90s teenagers in the future? I bet we'll all hang our heads in shame whenever somebody mentions Korn.

I am not saying KoRn is not a good band, I honestly think they could have an awsome next album. Until then, buy their first cd AND NOT THIS ONE!

Unchanging hip-hop beats, a wall of stompboxes, and at times whiny, at others bloodthroaty vocals make up the bulk of Korn's Follow the Leader. The lyrics are by far the worst part of the album, being meaningless blither-blather, with the word \\"hate\\" and profanity sprinkled liberally to make it oh-so-hardcore. A prime example is the track \\"All in the Family,\\" a bitchfest between Jonathon Davis of Korn and Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit which is so embarrassing, I'm left to wonder why both aren't laughed offstage at any of their concerts.

C'mon!),from the lyrics(surely after selling all those records Jonathan's anguish tastes far less real) to the sounds (every time I hear the record I feel it is more and more computerized) makes this a real disappointment.If you liked the first two albums prepare for an ugly surprise,if you love hip-hop without heavy guitars this is the korn you always wanted.Is one good song,the high-tension RECLAIM MY PLACE,enough to save a whole record?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you spell corporate? With a capital K and a backward R","review":"Here is deep, thoughtful music that gave the teenagers of the late 90's music they could relate to, with heartfelt songs about hating your parents 'Dead Bodies Everywhere', bashing your girlfriend 'Pretty', or even being more extreme with her 'My gift to you'. And yet, in amongst all that is a nice song called 'BBK' which is a genuinely touching song about loneliness, even the guitars are crying in this one!And let's face it, nobody plays guitars better than Korn. Well, that is if repeating the same few power chords over and over and over and... mean playing guitar then yes, no one plays guitars better than Korn (such a technique is a way to hook people quickly). There are a couple of redeemable moments (aside from the credible BBK); under the wails of woes, 'Pretty' has some nice jazz influences, 'Justin' has an interesting sci-fi feeling to it. But there is really no point wasting your time with this. Rating 1/10, or 0.5/5.0"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse then Issues","review":"This CD is truly a disgrace for Korn. They use screams, distorted junk, simple grunge guitars, and terrible bass. David on the drums really isn't so bad, but everything else is lacking in talent.

Korn's newest, Follow the Leader, doesn't have anything that is already been done to death. Any half-wit with a guitar can play Freak on a Leash. Korn is in no way heavy. And they were surely not the first to use 7-strings. If you want something heavy pick up some Carcass, Bolt Thrower, or Kreator. Unfortunenatly, I liked Korn at on point. When they first came out. They once had an original sound, but now, they just keep doing the same damn thing over and over again. It's All in the Family will give you a migrain headache listening to it.

What this album is, is a group of not-very-talented guys banging around on their seven-string guitars (gasps of awe from the kiddies here)shouting obscenities with all of the subtlety of a jackhammer. I mean, if this is the best band ever, we're in trouble. If you want real Heavy Metal, try classic groups like Black Sabbath and Judas Priest. If you want rank amatuers that will be forgotten in 5 years, then by all means \\"Follow the Leader\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD serves better as a coaster","review":"I think KoRn is the worst excuse for a band ever.

A nice mix of music.","review":"I was a little skeptical on buying this c.d. because I heard they had gone into some rap on \\"Follow The Leader\\". But I bought, listened to it, and loved it. There are 3 rap songs on here (they also are the three with guests on them), \\"Children Of The Korn\\" (feat. Ice Cube, a rap artit), \\"All In The Family\\" (feat. Fred Durst), and \\"Cameltosis\\" (feat. Tre Hardson, a rap artist). Surprisingly, I like every rap song except \\"Children Of The Korn\\", which is the only bad song on here (hence the reason I gave it four stars.) And \\"All In The Family\\" is the best song on here! I suggest you buy the first c.d. before buying this. But buy this anyway! I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Rocks!","review":"This is one of the best CD's I've ever heard. I have the tape and I listen to it a lot. I also like Limp Bizkit.

This band went from ground breaking to pathetic all within a 5 year period. What is Follow the Leader? Is this a rap album, or are they crossover's? Korn's first album is amazing and it's truly sad how far they have fallen. The only reason I even give this 1 star is because of Dead Bodies Everywhere which echos old Korn. Family Values will suffer the same fate as lolapolooza, and contain nothing more than wanna be underground bands on a major label (do i see a contradiction here?)playing to overpriviledged white teenagers.

Really, if you're over 14 and you still like this music, that's absolutely shameful.This music isn't heavy. It's just catchy, like a bad commercial jingle catchy.

From Jonathan Davis' shout of \\"Come on!\\" at the beggining of \\"It's On!\\" this album totally rocks. David Siveria and Fieldy are an amazing rythm section, and they make this record what it is. Their bass and drum riffs are the best part of this album. The two singles \\"Freak On A Leash\\" and \\"Got The Life\\" do not (in my opinion) show Korn's immense talent to the radio listening public. The best songs on this album will probably never be heard on the radio because of the profane lyrics.

At first I hated it. But because it was so weird, I just had to listen to it again. And agian. And before I knew it, I liked it. The songs on this CD take multiple hearings to thier full potential. I used to hate \\"Freak On A Leash\\" and \\"Dead Bodies Everywhere,\\" but now they are some of my favorite songs.

Soft, watered down guitar riffs, dumb lyrics and Jonathan Davis' weak voice (more singing and rapping than yelling this time) combine to create an unlistenable mess on par with the Backstreet Boys. Unlike BSB, they do have talent, but obviously they want to make money and play their awful Matchbox 20-style pop, and who's gonna stop them?Anyone who like Korn's self-titled album should stay away from this, as it is a totally different band, completely motivated by money.

But the remaining ten tracks are pure filth! Often drudgingly slow, they also have no melody, annoying \\"singing\\" or \\"rapping\\", lackluster riffs, practically no percussion, and the \\"dum da dee da\\" growls are just nauseating. And on top of it all, there are 25 tracks on here, and the first twelve are blank! What a mockery! If you must listen to Korn, try their s/t, which is much better.

If you want to see a Star Trek crew back in action where the books read so clearly that you can actually see the story as if it were an episode, go get the DS9 relaunch.I pray that the other authors in this series show me the TNG crew, because this author couldn't find them.Oh, one last thing: It is not 'witty' or 'inventive' to rehash dialogue directly from episodes or movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written.","review":"This book is well-written, has a good mix of action, drama, and characterization, and does a good job of finishing the plot started in \\"A Time To Be Born\\", without seeming TOO incomplete on its own. For anybody who actually LIKES the character of Wesley Crusher, consider this a five-star review; the main reason that I docked it a star is because Wes is the main character, and I've never liked that particular character. He WAS handled well, though, and if I didn't have an established antipathy for the character, I wouldn't have developed one from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"On-line Data does not currently exist.","review":"Overall this is an excellent text for understanding and conducting mulitlevel analysis.

(2) It's a car cassette-to-CD converter. That's great if it works as both products.But for me, it hasn't worked. On the first one I got, the volume control didn't work, so it was no good as product (1): discman. On the second one, the volume control works, but it sounds horrible in the car on anything that has electric guitar on it (ie most of what I listen to). So this second one fails as product (2).At the time of writing this review, I'm not sure whether or not I will again send back an unsatisfactory product to Amazon. I suspect that the discman part of it is fine, and that a decent car cassette-to-CD conversion thingy would set things right.But as far as quality goes, I have to score this product as an unacceptable zero for two.

Second, the Anti-skip eats the batteries real quick. And the player will beep only when there's just five or six minutes left in the batteries. Not cool. And to make things worse, the one I bought lasted only two months before it wouldn't play anything.One thing that really works well is the skip protection. Even \\"washboard\\" dirt roads couldn't make it jump around while playing. And with Koss TD-60 headphones, the extra bass was really something else.

All in all though I think koss has built a great product even though there are some minor flaws with the design.

However the car kit that came with it only worked one time when I hit PLAY, and it only made output in the left ear. Good thing I brought batteries! The AC Adapter is included as well and is a nice touch. The headphones included are high quality. Finally, I haven't tried the cassette adapter, for I have no use for it when I could have CD quality =) Why four stars then, and not five? Well, perhaps for the poor car kit, but also for looks.

We also purchased the adapter to use at home to save on batteries. In retrospect, I wish we had purchased the rechargeable batteries instead and not had to deal with plugging in a cord, but the adapter works well. I can't tell the difference between the resolution on super high quality and high quality. They are both superb and as good as I've seen on more expensive cameras.

Of course many stories in this collection are good, a few great (e.g., Lorrie Moore's story), but many ramble on, seem too much like life as we know it on boring days.

Also, the host for this show is Lauren Hayes, really nice girl uh, but you only see her talking nonsense, introducing the girls and wearing a bikini (no nudity, sorry).The other girls are beautiful but there is nothing sexy about the scenes, the play between them is really dull when there is some play. Don't expect a party (people having fun and doing exciting things), in this case party means just a bunch of girls together. They are posing sometimes in bikini, sometimes topless and very few times all nude, but the pace is so slow and the music is so dinner-like, that you can have a nap every 5 minutes and don't miss a thing.Save your money, don't buy BabeWatch: Mild Pool Bunch of Girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different map","review":"This map was so cluttered, it was not worth using in Amsterdam.The freebie maps we got at the airport and at the TI in Amsterdam were ten times more useful.

However, I gave up on page 33. Maybe it's just me, but if the author doesn't care enough to check spelling, capitalization and punctuation, I feel like I'm being abused.

She has a very special gift of telling stories of experiences in her life and the life of others that have hidden within them profound spiritual truths. I was completely captivated by this book and couldn't put it down. For the past 10 years I have confined my reading to spiritual books, books authored by some of the great Christian writers of the past and those of modern times. In my opinion, Colors of the Spirit is one of the very best spiritual books I have read in recent years. It's message is simple and at the same time profound.

It was alright but it was missing something. The stories could have been touching but she didn't really write them meaningfully.

She wrote although she were talking, not as a formal piece of writing, which was refreshing, but not totally appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dub & Beyond","review":"This release is an essential example of the future of dub and its hybrid counterparts.

He celebrates the nobility of this people at the same time exposing the specter of modern civilization and its potential impact on them. Mr. Stephenson's immersion into the very soul of the Hadzabe makes for excellent reading. His descriptions are vivid and his perceptions poetic. His friends and guides became my friends, his fear mine. I could smell the blood of freshly slaughtered game; feel the second wind of survival. His experience not only took him into the day-to-day existence of the Hadzabe but also their spirit world and ultimatley a journey into his own Mythology.

Only the uninformed read Spence, and certainly not any Chinese. His histories of pre and eraly modern China lack detail, substance, and any evidence he has kept up with recent scholarship of, say, the last 20 years. And, worse yet, he has little to say about modern/Communist China, except for the same crap you can read in any newspaper/wire service.A much,much better book on China (modern), and one better respected within the profession/education establishment, is/are Maurice Meisner's books and the Mao and Deng eras. He writes lucidly too, and unlike Spence, is capable of sustaining an argument and not lt\\\\etting his own self/ego get in the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of class","review":"This book is a best-seller for one very good reason: it makes modern China interesting for people who might otherwise be appauled by the place. It's the best general introduction to the subjects, is very well written, and good enough to serve as a reference for non-Sinologists.So why the recent spate of negative reviews? Young Sini-cle Yalies just got your poor grades back? Lesser-known China experts jealous of the doyen's popularity with the English-speaking masses? That some reviewers have gone down to one star on a generally respected title should be a hint that there's something amiss, and its not with the book itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Textbook","review":"I am a college senior and this is a required textbook for a class associated with my minor area of study.

It is the best single volume I've read dealing with the last 500 years of China's history.You can safely ignore the reviewers who have given scathing reviews of the book without offering any justification for their attacks. When dealing with the subject of China it is not uncommon to run into people who are willing to trash scholarship only to expose a big chip on their shoulder."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is to long for college classes","review":"This book provides a great deal of indepth information. It was required reading in Chinese History Studies At Oklahoma State University Under Dr. Park, who completely tried to destroy every reasonable rational the book provided and used certian passages to distort history to fit his idea of it.

Quick shipping and no hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice introduction","review":"The book makes a good impression. It is an eloquently written, absorbing narrative, attentive to detail and yet broad in scope. The book nicely integrates discussion of political history with discourse on society and culture of modern China.It is ostensibly weaker towards the end - barely a fraction of the book deals with post-1949 China. The PRC's foreign policy during the Cold War unfortunately receives scant attention; the Cultural Revolution is addressed as if in passing. Sino-US rapprochement is barely mentioned (with a questionable assertion that it was mainly a product of pressure on the part of the Chinese oil lobby).The part on the democratic movement in China was an interesting read, but it overshadowed other important issues in the last 20-30 years of China's political and economic development.Overall, excellent book, certainly one of the best introductions to modern history of China out there, highly recommended for new students of Chinese history as a starting point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost like I remembered it.","review":"The Battle arena is a little smaller than it used to be.

Unfortunately, because of his difficulty winding the string, this game was more than a disappointment for us. I also tried and failed more than half the time to get them spinning. I went looking for wind-up tops to use on the stage area that works much better (at a dollar a piece, they saved the day!) If your child has any kind of motor planning problem, fine motor difficulty, or is under 9 years old, I wouldn't waste the money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A far cry from the original","review":"I think the guy who said any adult with motor skills and five minutes of patience should have no problem making the tops spin, is remembering the ease of spinning the tops on the original game when we were kids. I guess my motor skills are at least average, and as a fisherman, I have loads of patience, but, I don't think I could get one of these tops, in the new version of this game, to spin if my very life depended on it! Maybe it's just me? I was really looking forward to playing this game with my daughter, but I think it would just frustrate her the same way it has her old man. I had no problem spinning the tops as a kid in the 70's, maybe my motor skills have eroded, I don't know.

All of the songs I heard are completely unmemorable and the best ones remind me of the worst of Gilbert O'Sullivan. To make things still worse, the recording quality of this CD is simply terrible, it is so highly compressed.

At times, the book 'drags' a bit, particularly through the 30s. Explanations of New Deal politics perhaps don't lend themselves to the kind of exciting story-telling that wartime meetings at places such as Tehran and Yalta do. In fact, I sometimes felt the book lapsed into an economics textbook, but it is still mostly quite readable. Freidel does not editorialize much about his subject and so (fortunately) one is left to draw one's own conclusions about FDR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, Boring Prose","review":"When I read the other reviews I wondered if we had read the same book. Unlike the other reviewers, I thought the prose was dry and the details lacking. I don't really mind that the author has a pro-Roosevelt bias, but he breezes over the highlights of Roosevelt's life without giving out any juicy details.

If you are thinking about trying Cash out, this disc might be his most accessible to non-converts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I and III","review":"1. What is the text about? An album by Cash, backed most of the time by Tom Petty and many Heartbreakers (I think). Popular songs countrified and Cash's own work.2. What is good about it? The songs are great, and Cash's voice has a power that often transcends the work. Petty's backing, particularly on \\"Sea of Heartbreak,\\" is great. Also fantastic is Cash's cover of Beck's \\"Rowboat,\\" and \\"Country Boy.\\"3. What is not so good about it? Well, you might not like it if you hate country music, but then again, you might.4. Who might like it? Those fans who like myself dabble in genres other than rock music (e.g. fans of Lyle Lovett, De La Soul, Dwight Yoakum) will like it. Classic country fans of people Willie Nelson will also dig it.5. Personal bias: I think Cash is almost as important to the history of popular music in America as Elvis Presley."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"American II\\" album","review":"Though lacking this monicker, \\"Unchained\\" was the second collaboration of Cash and Rick Rubin in the American series. Much different from \\"American Recordings,\\" \\"Unchained\\" features musical accompaniment by the likes of Tom Petty and Flea (from the Red Hot Chili Peppers), and an overall more upbeat sound.Folks have differing opinions on the reinterpretations of more modern tunes like Beck's \\"Rowboat\\" and Soundgarden's \\"Rusty Cage.\\" Personally, they feel a little forced, but they're still decent efforts.There are some great classic country tunes here, including an extended version of Cash's own \\"Mean Eyed Cat.\\" And of course, there's \\"I've Been Everywhere\\"--infamously used (and abused) on a certain motel chain's ad campaign.For those who bought \\"American IV\\" for the darker tunes like \\"Hurt\\" and \\"I Hung My Head,\\" this album might not match your taste, but I would still recommend it if only to hear the other side of Cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Recordings #1","review":"I consider the American Recording by Cash to be the best set of recordings ever, and this is the best of the lot.

This author really helps the reader understand what goes through the mind of someone who truly loves this wilderness called Alaska.

It's a pleasure to read, and it helps explain the makeup of people who find that wilderness inspiring and nurturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty slow reading","review":"Even though I love Alaska and most books about it, I found this book pretty slow.

The appendix is essentially unreadable: citations, data & notes are presented in the most illogical & unintuitive format possible. Plus there are plenty of typos scattered throughout, making you question the publisher's editing skills.

I say that it is possibly the best because HTHR is very good but TTGG is a cd I heard at the right place/time and it stuck. The lyrics are as touching as any I have ever heard and they just contiue to grow on you. I can say that the songs I enjoy the most now are certainly not the ones that initially grabbed my ear.

But I cant think of many albums that I've played more often than this one, over a longer period of time. I often hear the Jayhawks compared to the Beatles. and in many ways the songs on this album remind me of \\"Rubber Soul\\". However, I find this album to be more soulful, especially the lead guitar playing. I'll also take \\"I'd Run Away\\" and \\"Bad Time\\" over any two songs off Rubber Soul. The bottom line is that there is not a single bad song on \\"Tomorrow the Green Grass\\", and is worth checking out if you havnt discovered this band yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"What An Album Not Enough Stars Available!!","review":"I own about 500 CD's and this is definitely the best one that I own. Tremendous harmony vocals, beautiful sounding guitars wrapped around a brilliant set of songs. The opening track \\"Blue\\" starts as a pretty acoustic number, and the harmonies of Gary Louris and Mark Olson with the string arrangements take it to new heights. The following track \\"I'd Run Away\\" takes the Jayhawks in a more rocking direction with sharp guitar parts, violin and a rollicking piano. In both cases the music is greatly satisfying, and sets the tone and pace that the rest of \\"Tomorrow The Green Grass\\" lives up to. This album changed the way I think about music from the perspective of somebody listening to or playing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome!","review":"I'll make this short.

While I could analyze the appropriateness of the genre and all that jazz, and I am just going to suffice it to say that it is an entertaining movie with humor right up the alley of those seeking humor slightly off the beaten path.

Compared to ink-jet printers, it's clearly less versitile, but you don't have to remember to load special paper or make special settings, and you won't run out of ink in the middle of a print job, as each paper pack comes with a print cartridge that runs out when the paper does."},{"rating":"1","title":"No driver for Windows NT. Picture quality is poor.","review":"The setup was relatively easy until I tried to hook it up to my PC. There is no driver available for Windows NT workstation. I tried to install it under Windows 95. Spent most of my Saturday with downloading drivers from their website. Finally called tech support and got email back that someone will call me in 2-3 days and also to be patient. Color quality is ok. I could print from my Sony Digital camcorder. It takes about 2 minutes to print a 4-5 in. picture. Save your money and get something else. This printer is not ready for any prime time yet. At least they should include a driver that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the ink?","review":"You will never hear me complain about the fantastic quality of the Olympus P330 pictures. But good luck finding the paper/ink packets for sale. This is a dye sublimation printer so it is a real four-color process print like the professionals use. But before you buy be sure you can find a seller who will sell you 60 photo pack ink refills for under $75. Check the other feedback dates. This is an old printer circa 1998."},{"rating":"1","title":"P-330/Sony Digital Camera","review":"There are suggestioons, including on Amazon.com that the P-330 and a Sony Digital Camera that uses 3.5\\" floppy disks are compatible. To a limited extemt this may be true, but direct use is not possible as the P-330 only takes the smaller Smart Media disk. It would appear one would be well advised to use a Sony printer that can directly receive the 3.5\\" floppy disk; otherwise one of the feature attractions of a printer is defeated. The one star rating is only in connection with a Sony digital camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great new experience for me","review":"We had the opportunity to see Bill Hudson live on New Years Eve 2000. He played in Annapolis MD. It happened by chance that we stumbled across his appearance. We were looking for face-painting for our 7 yr. old son and the line was too long. We sat down and watched his set. We fell in love with his singing and stories. Our 7 yr. old loves him as well. We bought his CD \\"Liberty Street\\". Now, we can't wait to play in when we get into the car. I say it was a new experience for me because I was not into folk music too much. After seeing Bill, I will try to follow him as much as I can. He's a great person to get to speak to as well. We certainly wish him the best of luck in his musical career.

It's for readers who want to get the nitty-gritty on the matter and it can even be a bit of a slog for them. As scholarly books go, however, it is not extremely long nor particularly dry; but it's not a book for casual reading, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first, but literally fell apart after light use","review":"Bought this on another site for my 1 year old Christmas 2009. He loved it the first dozen times he used it and the train held up nicely. Then after almost a year, the train literally fell apart when we picked it up. Shocking, since it was only used every once and again-definitely not heavy, or even moderate use. Engine came apart, wheels fell off, front piece too.

However, Sakamoto provides a broad detail between the interpersonal relationships between the people. The novel should center on the historical aspects of Japan than characterization. For this reason, I give \\"The Electrical Field\\" a \\"good\\" rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prose diappoints, reader gives up","review":"I'd just finished reading Haruki Murakami's finely written \\"South of the Border, West of the Sun,\\" when I picked up \\"The Electrical Field.\\" Kerri Sakamoto's book did not survive the inevitable comparison. I found the prose uninspired (\\"She shook her head like a child does, flinging her hair all about.\\") and the pacing uneven, so that I couldn't find the flow. Certainly there was nothing compelling about the narrator. After 25 pages, I put the book down. I doubt that I'll pick it up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album.....Mixed Feelings!","review":"Many fans of The Eagles probably has mixed feelings about this album. Thus, 1979 was a strange year for them when they released this album mainly there was lots of pressure to at least duplicate the major success of \\"Hotel California\\". I place \\"The Long Run\\" along the same vein of \\"Spirits Having Flown\\" by The Bee Gees and \\"Tusk\\" by Fleetwood Mac who were having similar problems.Question: What can we do after having such a mammoth album? Answer: Let's do something different, something experimental so maybe we can discover new horizons.That's how I view \\"The Long Run\\". If you are not sure about buying this album, then borrow this album from a friend before deciding. Otherwise, just buy their \\"Greatest Hits: Volume 2\\" or their recent \\"Best Of...\\". In my opinion, you will ONLY need the hits \\"Heartache Tonight\\", the title track, and \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classics are Forever","review":"This album was great in the 80's....... and still retains its appeal. If you love listening to the Eagles... you'll love this one also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but catchy songs","review":"The Eagles must have been in a strange place mentally and emotionally when writing these songs and yet when I listen to them I enjoy the entire CD. \\"The Long Run\\" is reminiscent of previous Eagles work and \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\" is one of the best ballads I've ever heard. \\"In the City\\" is actually a pretty normal song for having been written by Joe Walsh. \\"Disco Strangler\\" has a cool, repetitive guitar hook but is odd subject matter. \\"King of Hollywood\\" and \\"Teenage Jail\\" are also good musically but weird lyrically. \\"Those Shoes\\" is my favorite song. Dark in tone, strange again in subject matter and killer guitar work. \\"Greeks Don't Want No Freaks\\" is short and catchy but I don't understand the point of it. \\"Sad Cafe\\" is an ok ballad, but a little pretentious. Odd intent with many of these songs, but when I listen I sing along. Strange combination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Singles but unfocused","review":"The Long Run should've been the Eagles largest album to exit the 70's with, but it sort of falls short of it's goal. The album is not a very cohesive and it arrived 3 years after it's predacessor, Hotel California.Regardless, The Long Run's spawned 4 huge hit. The Eagles were always a better singles band. I'm not sure why the Eagles struggled to record this album but it likely was about discrepency in money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is 5 star but remastering job a farce at ZERO stars","review":"Let me start by saying that I have known this recording intimately since it was first released. I still have a mint LP copy and the first release of this on CD from 1984 (solid puuple Elektra silkscreen CD label). So like any audio enthusiast I bought this \\"remastered\\" edition (I also bought the Dec 2005 remastered Japan version in the mini-LP...read that review as well). In a word: disappointment.Credit Bill Szmyczyk for creating a great (if somewhat muffled...and maybe that was the intent) recording to begin with. The ONLY thing this new incarnation brings to the table is a much louder volume. There is NO sonic revelation, there is NOT a replication of the original complete artwork, there is NO indication on the actual inserts that this is a remastered edition. The only indication is a black sticker on the shrinkwrap. So if you have any of the CD versions out there, DO NOT PITCH THEM TO BUY THIS ONE...you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad buy","review":"I should have known better at the price offered.

The cover is very nice and classic with just the name of the band and the title on a black background. We get all the lyrics in a very easy to read font. 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no longer The Eagles...","review":"Let's face it: this rendition of \\"the Eagles\\" contains only 50% of the original group. To be honest this group should be called the Henley-Frey Band. They're pretty good, but they're not the Eagles. Without Randy Meisner and Bernie Leadon this band is sort of like the Beatles without George and Ringo. Sure, Don and Glen can make this group re-create some of the Eagles great songs, just like John Lennon and Paul McCartney could make a Beatles-sounding group with nameless-but-competent backup musicians. But they wouldn't be the Beatles, and the group that hammered together this recording isn't the Eagles. To hear the Eagles get their first three recordings. To hear some great Don Henley and Glen Frey songs get the \\"Eagle\\" recordings that came afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"The magic was fading","review":"The Eagles were itching to move on with their solo careers, and that is quite visible from this album. It seems like a pile of songs just thrown together without too much thought. There are some real disappointments on this album such as 'These Shoes' (incredibly boring), and 'Greeks dont want no freaks'. 'In the City' is okay but perhaps misplaced. The album's highlights include 'I Can't Tell you Why' and 'King of Hollywood'. Naturally it is hard to follow up a masterpiece such as 'Hotel California'. The fact that I hardly play this album anymore proves that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"The Long Run is probably Eagles second best album behind Hotel California. This album has several great tracks, and \\"I can't tell you why\\" is arguably the best ballad ever recorded by a Rock band....Simply beautiful, worth the price of the album all by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Musical Genius","review":"Although this album does have a dark element to it, it is easy to listen to and contains a wealth of melodies that are hard to forget. The darkness just adds to the genius. I like every song on the album. I have read over the years that the band was not getting along well at the time this album was recorded and they were tired and needed a rest, hence, the breakup. Hey, everyone needs a vacation. The fact that these songs turned out as well as they did is a tribute to the band's musical genius. I'm glad they're getting along again and are playing together at times. It's great to hear these songs, and all their others, performed live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional and slick.","review":"By 1979 the Eagles had nearly imploded amidst animosity and professional jealousies, and it is amazing that they were able to record such an incredibly professional and accomplished LP as 'The Long Run' during this time in their careers. In some ways it is their 'Abbey Road': the musicianship and production are impeccable, the personal differences not at all visible. Maybe not the greatest Eagles album, but certainly one that deserves respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eagles worst album","review":"For an album that took so long to make, The Long Run is a lousy album, easily the Eagles worst. There are some quality songs here like In The City, I Can't Tell You Why and the Long Run, but most of the songs are throwaways. There are some particularly bad songs such as The King of Hollywood, The Greeks Don't Want No Freaks, and Teenage Jail. Not what I'd call a good reflection on the music of the Eagles. If you've just dicovered this fabulous band and are looking to hear Eagles material, look to On the Border or Hotel California."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMES UP SHORT","review":"Timothy B. Schmidts' \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\" justies the two stars for this album. Most of the songs are in the mediocre to poor range. You don't get the feeling that they were trying something new after Hotel California, you just get the feeling that they weren't trying. There's just not a whole lot to like and \\"Disco Strangler\\" and \\"The Greeks Don't Want No Freaks\\" are as bad as their titles suggest. \\"Heartache Tonight\\" was a big hit during its original release so if that's your cup of tea this might be worth investing in. I like their other albums and I love the \\"When Hell Freezes Over\\" DVD, but this album is only for hardcore Eagles fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls Rule!","review":"I had this book recommended to me by a friend from school and I enjoyed it thoroughly, I did not regret for a moment having borrowed it. I liked this book because in it Echo Sackett could actually do things for herself.

When I first heard\\"DON'T STOP 'TIL YOU GET ENOUGH\\" I thought the Jacksons was on the verge of musical dominates, and when I found out it was only Michael, I was truly amazed. Rock with you at first, I thought it was a female singing, but I always wondered why the artist kept saying\\"Girl close your eyes\\" found out again it was Michael, from working day and night, to off the wall and girlfriend, to burn this disco out this album saw the arrival of Michael Jackson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off The Wall Is Off The Chain","review":"Music you can't help but love. \\"Off the Wall\\" is a perfect example of why Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones are legends in music. Before their revolution with \\"Thriller\\", they cut this solid R&B/disco album, an album that still sounds fresh today and can set fire to any dance floor. From driving, hypnotic dance epics to lush, tender ballads, \\"Off the Wall\\" features amazing vocals from Jackson, on-point production from Q, and an array of some of the best session musicians to grace a studio: Greg Phillinganes, Paulinho DaCosta, John Robinson, the list goes on.

My mom bought the album. I remember just admiring Micheal's beautiful smile. My exact word was \\"wow\\" as I held the album cover in my hands. I wanted to have the same feeling again when I received my CD of \\"Off the wall.\\" What a disappointment. The cd has quite a few photos of Michael with a Jheri curl, not his textured fro and no smile. I wanted the CD just for cover pic of his smiling face.The sound is good on the cd.

The music, as I've previously stated, is a wonder and set the tone for black pop and Michael's solo career for the next decade and a half.If you haven't listened to \\"Off The Wall\\" in a great while, or like me, you've been wearing out your old vinyl and cassette copies for years, give this special edition a spin, you'll be truly amazed at the improved sound quality!A Classic that deserves the \\"royal treatment\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one started his mega star rise...","review":"You could already tell that this dude was gonna be BIG.

You have hits like \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\", \\"Rock With You\\", and \\"Off The Wall\\", but in my opinion, \\"I Can't Help It\\" is definately the best song on there. It's Michael's best slow jam. You can tell it's a Stevie Wonder song, but it has a Michael Jackson rhythm, which is why it's in my \\"top 10 favorite songs of all-time\\". \\"Off The Wall\\" is definitely Michael's best and one the greatest r&b/pop albums of all-time because it wasn't just a solo album, it was the beginning a starting point of a musical icon that will never be surpassed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, except for a few songs.","review":"Michael Jackson's first solo album, \\"Off The Wall\\" features some of his best work.

I have a serious issue with the remastering -- it's way too bright on my high-end (and otherwise very flat with no tone controls) stereo system. Who the heck maintained the boosted treble? I'm sure this would sound great equalized on an AM radio station, but it's hurting my ears. The sound quality of the original album is remarkably crisp...stinging, in fact.So, this is just a warning for those expecting the remastering to have corrected the riding-the-treble-gain problem.

The album has many hits including \\"Don't stop till you get enough\\", \\"Rock with you\\", \\"She's out of my life\\" \\"Of the wall\\" and \\"Girlfriend\\". In my opinion this release is just as good as his masterwork Thriller. This special edition also contains demo versions of \\"Don't stop till you get enough\\" \\"Workin' Day and Night\\".

What makes it stand out is how really fresh it is and shows how much potential Michael had. Its greatness really shos how far he has fallen. Imagine if he began now instead of then! He would not have the fans he does now if not for this album and Thriller and his work with the Jackson Five. Worth buying, especially in the remastered expanded form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, one of MJ's best!!!!!","review":"All the songs on this CD are fantastic, especially the title track, \\"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,\\" \\"Working Day and Night,\\" and \\"She's Out of My Life.\\" Also of interest are the two home demo recordings of \\"Don't Stop till You Get Enough\\" and \\"Working Day and Night.\\" Anyone who is an MJ fan simply MUST have this CD.

I was extremely disappointed to discover the complete lack of quality in the author's writing. The book is riddled with grammatical errors and misspellings. The narrative is aimless. It appears that not one single person ever copyedited this manuscript at any point during the publishing process.My advice: don't waste your dollars or your sense on this amateurish and overpriced book.Try \\"Stricken\\" by Peggy Munson, \\"Facing and Fighting Fatigue\\" by Benjamin Natelson, or \\"Beyond Chaos\\" by Gregg Piburn.

The lead off single isnt great but its a decent song. Banner keeps his gritty style giving us hard beats followed by hard lyrics. If you like David Banner this is a must have. Some of the highlights on the album are:Eternal, Talk to Me feat. Lil Flip, Like A Pimp Remix, Pretty Pink feat. T.I.--(my favorite), The Game feat Scarface, OOH AHHAll of people are saying that this album is not as good as the first but I like them both. So if you are a David Banner fan buy the album (dont bootleg) and see for yourself. Its worth the money and Banner deserves more credit for what he does."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars","review":"David Banner is a great producer but he is no rap artist.

I have heard David Banner as a guest on so many records and his lyrics and style is hot. I heard the song cadillac on 22's and was like \\"oh no dude is the truth\\" so i got this cd. i hate it. A lot of unnecessary cursing and lyrics that don't make sense. Talking about God and in the same breath cursing up a storm a severe waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst...","review":"David Banner is even worse then Chingy, 50 Cent, Nelly, and Cash Money.

I don't remember the first one being that bad but it definitely fell short of the collective effort of Crooked Lettaz Grey Skies (David Banner's former group) Banner definitely has some heat on this lp, I been bangin it nonstop since I purchased it (somethin I did not do with the first Mississippi lp) but the best song to me is a introspective joint he got with the king of the south, Scarface. This album is in the top 10 of hip hop albums to come out this year, but I strongly recommend everyone pick up the Grey Skies lp as well cause it's best hiphop albums ever to come out the south, period!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

This vieo is one of favorite video for Japanese children. My friend's kid would ask to show it on video at least once a week. I have watched it more than 10 times, but I am never bored. Whenever I watch it, my heart feel warm feeling. I wish Totoro is living my neighbour. This video includes adventure, dream, family love, nighbour love, which we forget in busy life. The landscapes of the video is like 1960's Japanese countryside altough I have never seen Totoro and other cute monsters. Hayao Miyazaki made almost 10 movies, but \\"Totoro\\" is one of best one. What is other best one? It's \\"Nausica\\" although it has not released in English. \\"Totoro\\" is not only for children but for adults who are tired for their busy life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful video for kids -both boys and girls.","review":"My children - boys aged 12 and 8 - watched this video so often that it wore out!!

All three of us were nothing less then devastated by Disney's new sound track - for all intents and purposes it is not the same film at all. The opening song is different and worse.

DISNEY - SHAME ON YOU!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Dub Un-Listenable","review":"I have to agree with just about every other reviewer of this DVD. My brothers and I grew up watching the original Totoro dub by Fox and we still love and enjoy it. However when we watched the new Disney dub none of us could sit through it, the voice cast was extremly uninspired and monotone--only the two parent voice overs Lea Solanga and Tim Daly did an admirable job. It is really unfortunate that Disney could not improve on the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get past the new voice actors.","review":"This review is for the disney (re-dubbed) version. The movie itself is and always will be a five star film for me. This version though left me really cold.Totoro was my favorite movie growing up. I have seen it literally more than any other movie, and I know it almost line for line. So it was really disconcerting to watch this version. It's just... wrong. I suppose that they didn't do a BAD job dubbing it, but its just not the same. My boyfriend got this for me as a gift and did not know about the change, so it was just really disapointing. I'm going to have to spring for the original version one of these days. :-/"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened!?!","review":"I grew up watching this movie in several formats. Starting with the original Japanese tapes followed by the American tapes and finally both versions of the American DVD. I loved them all until this one.what happened?!!! The first dub was amazing, full of genuine feelings and portrayals, with a very close translation! This new version is just trash in comparison. watch them side by side and you will see how much it's been ripped apart. The only reason I would buy this set would be for the Japanese version, I don't care how \\"lively\\" Dakota fanning and her sister are, they are not suited for this.If you can find the original dub, buy it; it still has all the magic that makes this movie what it is. It's an amazing movie, just a terrible DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the original dub","review":"This redubbed is horrible... It's just not the same... They even renamed the characters which is ridiculous!!

It is simply marvelous!I was first introduced to Totoro in about the fourth grade, when we watched this movie at Japanese School. I remember wishing that I could live at the house that Mei and Satsuki live in so that I could see real dust bunnies and follow acorn trails to little Totoros. Some years later, I am still enchanted by Totoro's huge smile, the flying cat bus, and the amazing trees in the girls' backyard.Although there are some dramatic moments in \\"Totoro\\" (i.e. visiting Mother in the hospital, Mei running away, etc.), it is still a movie that you will want to watch time and time again. This is family entertainment at its very best!If you're looking for more great Japanese animated movies, try \\"Castle in the Sky\\" by Hayao Miyazaki. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant family classic","review":"My children and I have watched this movie literally a hundred times and we absolutely love it.

Not being sure if it was as good as I'd remembered, or if I'd enhanced it in my imagination, I got a used copy. It's still wonderful! The detail in the graphics is supurb, the storyline is captivating, and the insight into Japanese lifestyle of that era is fascinating. We got the DVD version for our great granddaughter who is seven. Her mother said that they both were glued to the TV during the entire viewing, and it's definitely going to be one they'll be enjoying again and again. All the positives that the other reviewers mentioned are accurate. I'd recommend it for all ages...and so would my retired husband!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming anime but plot a bit too simple","review":"A very charming anime for young children. Two sisters move to the country with their father to be closer to their mother who is sick in a hospital. They meet and befriend the local spirits who ultimately help them. The only gripe that I have about this movie is the plot seems overly-simplistic and the movie ends rather abruptly. It would have been much better if the movie were longer and there is more plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totoro, where are you?","review":"Let me start out by saying I LOVE My Neighbor Totoro! That being said, I HATE this version of it!! I'm sure this is great for those who've never seen the older(original?) version, but for those of us who have, I'm sure I speak for most when I say \\"What the hell?\\". No offense to the Fanning sisters, but I prefer the original actors voices better. Also, the dialog is not completely the same. This is by far my daughter's favorite Miyazaki film, but we wish we would have known this wasn't the original BEFORE we wasted our money. Do yourself a favor and try to get the old version, it's much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a version I could recommend","review":"I'm afraid I could never recommend the Disney release of this film.After seeing an earlier release before the girls' parts were rendered by the Fanning sisters, my wife and I found _their_ rendering VERY disappointing.I'm afraid we both believe the characters were not at all captured well and the Fannings' rendering simply ruined Totoro for us.Fortunately, although I had already given away an earlier copy, I was able to find another through Amazon's third party offerings.If you can obtain the older version: DO SO!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a PERFECT movie; this DVD release is NOT","review":"If you are a fan of Totoro (and what right thinking individual isn't!) then you may want to leave this DVD release on the shelf come December 3...In Japan, Totoro was graced with a spectacular DVD release featuing multiple dialog and subtitled options, as well as featurettes, artwork, and options for both full screen and letterbox versions...i the meantime, I would recommend this version ONLY to friends with small children who have not seen the film before. The print quality of the VHS version was quite good and the dubbing job is excellent, considering the shabby treatment that most Japanese animated films recieve. This is, first and foremost, a film of remarkable beauty and warmth. It is precious and timeless. By all means take advantage of the low price and share it with children. But for your own collection, you will most certainly want to wait for the (cross your fingers and send those letters now) Disney Edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this version","review":"As promised, this DVD contains contents that exactly match the previous VHS release by this studio; namely Pan & Scan only, English dub only, no extras. The film is wonderful, and surely deserves to be presented as Miyazaki intended it to be seen, not cut up. Those of us who want to see that will be disappointed with this disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for the DVD of a 5-star film","review":"My short review is not about the film itself (which is absolutely brilliant and highly recommended), but about this DVD:Please be aware that:1) The DVD has been transferred from video and not from the original film, and thus lacks the possible DVD-quality (when played one picture at the time the video-source becomes perfectly clear, rendering fuzzy and double pictures)2) The dubbing is ENGLISH and there is NO option for to play the original Japanese, nor are there any subtitles (not even for the hard of hearing).3) There are NO extras whatsoever.This should not discourage parents to buy this DVD as an excellent film for their (English speaking) children, but animation film lovers who buy this DVD will be utterly dissapointed that they cannot enjoy this film in its original glory (at least I was)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also Very Disappointed","review":"I agree with the reviewer below. I was holding out on purchasing this film on VHS, wanting it on DVD instead. I was excited when Amazon.com alerted me to this release. I expected it to be the same as the marvelous 2DVD, Region 2 release with full-screen presentation, bi-lingual audio and subtitles and an extra DVD full of special features. I was extremely disappointed in receiving this full-screen, pan-and-scan version with only an English audio voice track! No special features! The folks who released this should be ashamed. Miyazaki deserves better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original is better - the new dub sucks!","review":"The only thing i really hated about this movie was the new english dub, i mean come on, why do they need Dakota Fanning and her little sister totally ruining the movie. Those who have seen the original and love it, don't even bother buying the dvd because the voices suck and the script has even been changed alot. The only good thing i have to say is that Miyazaki is awesome and the graphics are great, newcomers to Totoro who have not seen the original by all means try this new one out, but those that have seen the original don't waste your money buying this becuase it is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I made the mistake of removing the wrapping before looking at the details on this DVD, so I can't return it even though I haven't watched it and won't. I also made the mistake of buying this without checking out the reviews. This is not the original version of the film. It's dubbed (no original audio) and equally bad, it's been violated with the completely unnecessary pan and scan. Come on, America, even on my 9-inch TV, I'd rather see a film in its original aspect ratio. This goes into my white elephant heap."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Children's Movies","review":"This was my second delving into Miyazaki after Spirited Away, and while Spirited Away was the superior film, this was still a very enjoyable movie. This film excels most as a story for small children, one of the best children's movies I have ever seen, in fact. As a parent, one element I love about this movie is that are no typical American clichés to be found. There are no villains, fight scenes, and no disbelieving parent or malicious siblings. While the plot may be to simple for adults, it's still charming, and absolutely perfect for children. My only complaint about this DVD has nothing whatsoever to do with the film. FOX has really treated this badly as it's only in pan and scan, there are absolutely no extras, and the sound could use some work. Don't be put off by the cover art either, that's another FOX blunder. The actual film is very visually apealling and doesn't have the garish, cartoony look of the cover art."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING FULL SCREEN VERSION","review":"Although it is not listed, Fox has released a \\"full screen\\" version of Miyizaki's masterpiece. This is an abomination and without excuse, since the original is a mere 1:85 if I remember correctly.My Neighbor Totoro is possibly my favorite animated film and it deserves better than this.I am returning my copy and I hope that one day Fox will get their act together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and Beautiful","review":"A favorite video of both adults and children I know. There is little action, but the story is charming and the animation extremely beautiful. All of Miyazaki's works are very high quality, putting American animation to shame. Totoro is his most child-oriented story. It has a very different pace and feeling than most children's animation these days, but still seems to please children. I have given this video as a gift to three different children and all of them loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My mother's childhood Japan","review":"Gorgeous backround art, adults who don't ridicule children and their magical perspectives, and a story which touches on yet resolves a common childhood fear...my children and I all loved My Neighbor Totoro. We saw it playing by chance at a local video store, were immediately entranced by its beauty, and kept watching because of the story and characters. The main characters are two young sisters and their father coping with the prolonged illness of the mother. Through the magic of a wondrous and kind creature, they gain the courage to hope. My mother, who was raised in Japan, said this animated movie depicts the countryside as she remembers it: Green, ancient, and with room to play and imagine.

I have the vhs version with the original english dub and its fantastic. Because they changed the voice acting in the new dvd version its extremely hard to enjoy a movie where an 4 year old has the voice that sounds like a 13 year old.

Why did Disney have to change something that was so charming and elegant in the first place. New voiceovers by Dakota Fanning and Elle Fanning aren't going to sell any more units. I'm not sure if I wanted to cry or puke when I started to play this...True Totoro fans should steer clear of this Disney make-over mess.

Shoot, back to the old VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie for kids","review":"I am always looking for movies for my 2 1/2 year old to watch that are non-violent and entertaining for all of us. This movie certainly fits all of my criteria.

The characters are very engaging and the kids actually act like real kids. It's a sweet movie that parents and young children will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Film! But DVD presentation upsetting...","review":"I love this film, and the english dub is actually quite good. If you have not seen the film, watch it! BUT.. I believe Fox has misjudged its audience and created a DVD that I find lacking. Sure, its animated and made mostly for children but I do not have any children and could not wait to get this DVD.

The movie easily gets 5 stars. The main concern here is the DVD. 20th Century Fox had very little to work with when they did this DVD. For those who don't already know, Disney has owned all of Studio Ghibli's movies since 1996. This includes My Neighbor Totoro in widescreen, Japanese, and anything they could hope to call an extra. That's why Disney is redubbing the movie and that's why this DVD has almost nothing on it and why they couldn't even remaster it. They worked with what they had and did the best they could. Of course, when Disney releases their version, it will have many more features(thought I don't think they will ever top this flawless dub unless they work their magic like they did with Spirited Away.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I am extremely disappointed that there is not even a Japanese language soundtrack.

They absolutely love it! The storyline is not too frightening for very little ones, with no villains. They are a little scared when Totoro roars, but he is ultimately discovered to be a benevolent, helpful and friendly character. My boys learn not to be scared along with the characters of Satsuki and Mei. To me this movie hits the balance of dark and light just perfectly; and also explores sibling relationships and tensions, which my boys can relate to. The movie is beautiful and imaginative. Highly recommended for very little ones (and imaginative adults too). I like that this is a kids movie I don't mind watching with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will bring you to a different world...","review":"The world of totoro is such a magical place.

You're not getting the full experience of this movie if you watch a version in which they remove and replace ALL the sound... just realize that, please. I'm not even going to BRING UP the topic of the music...."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Neighbor Totoro","review":"HI, I've never done this before but for this movie I just have to. When my daughter was 4 I got her this movie and she was scared of the \\"big scary cat\\". It took several months but she finally watched from behind the door, after that, it was her all time favorite movie. For that matter it kinda still is. She now has a 2 year old that just loves the movie too. She got her old VHS out and let her watch before she was old enough to really know \\"scared\\".Anyway, it was 16 years ago when I first got it for my daughter and she has guarded that movie more than jewelry and other special things. She still loves watching it, now with her daughter. Soooo, over look the different style of this movie and let your kids feel it. Instead of judging it through adult eyes, let the little ones feel it in their heart. Out of all the Disney movies and others that she has had, this one will always be her favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Neighbor Totoro","review":"I have this movie on VHS and recently purchased the DVD. It's a great movie except that when I recieved the DVD and watched it, it was different from the original. I noticed the voices were different from the original, and dialoge was changed. I was very disappointed because the original was so much more exciting and so much more fun. It was more dramatic in the original than in this Version of Totoro. So if your looking for the original, this isn't it. Voices were played by recent actors such as Dakota fanning and others, which were not the voices of the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 'Fanning corn children' redub ruins this for me.","review":"Disney always takes a good thing and poops all over it.

She's always loved it, so i got it for her for christmas. The only thing I didn't realize is that they changed the characters voices. Also, they redid some of the parts in the movie, which I thought was completely unnessary. I hate the people they picked to re-do the voices, Dakota Fanning for example. They didn't need to do this, I wish that they still sold the original on amazon. It's not what I first saw and that sucks that they rereleased this movie for no reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong version!!!! Buyer beware!","review":"My Neighbor Totoro is a favorite in my family, and my daughter wanted her own copy for her birthday. I had no idea that Disney had redubbed the original English version with new actors - why? The original version was so charming - it DIDN'T NEED \\"IMPROVING\\" with famous actors! This new version is stupid and unwatchable. I feel seriously misled and tricked into purchasing the wrong version of a favorite movie. Thanks for nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE ORIGINAL","review":"I was so mad when I started this movie for my kids. I have the VHS of the original, and had no idea there was a remake.

I just wished I would've looked more closely because this was a huge disappointment in our family. My kids insisted at the opening credits it wasn't the same and the differences of detail, voice (accent!)and music just became distracting. What was supposed to be a great nostalgic event turned into a downer, even if you tried to separate the two and appreciate this one on its own merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell disney?","review":"This was my favorite movie of all time when i was a little kid. Since those Disney has taken the movie and completely screwed it by re-doing the voices. If you're a true fan of the original, then do not buy this movie. It is the disney version.

A lot of the dialogue had been substantially changed, or dumbed down, and the movie lost a lot of its original charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Disney dub, but missing some important stuff","review":"The voices and sound effects are better than the modern Disney dub (those Fanning kids just make my ears bleed with their accents, it doesn't make sense!), and thus I recommend the 20th Century Fox english dub over the Disney one. A side note, Totoro's voice was changed from the original Miyazaki film, but in my opinion it's better as it sounds more like a creature than just a guy moaning into a mic.Because the DVD lacks the extras, Japanese audio track and crisp film quality one would expect from an imported foreign film DVD, it loses a star and a half. ***1/2 of 5Of course, the film itself gets a 5 out of 5 ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Friend Totoro","review":"What an amazing heart felt story.

Apparently, like the fable goes, once they had it they didn't want it anymore and sold it to Fox to do with what they would.What they have done, and this won't be news if you've read some of the other reviews here, is to release a very inexpensive product, but you get what you pay for.Specifically, pan and scan instead of widescreen and English dub only.If you are looking for a nice movie for children, and you are not familiar with Miyazaki's work, this version should be OK.To most adults my advice is to get yourself to your nearest search engine and find yourself a widescreen version with a Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film, HORRIBLE DVD","review":"Unfortunately, this DVD is a poor-quality pan-and-scan release. Needs to be indicated on the product description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Movie, poor DVD","review":"I must concur with the other reviewers of this DVD... I love this movies, and indeed bought a DVD player that could play the Original Japanese DVD release. This 'Fox' release is a poor substitute for the original film. In specific this production is Pan & Scan, and while you might be able to follow the plot, the beauty of the Miyazaki film is lost. Indeed the trimming of the picture often makes the color composition off. Also the DVD seems to be a bit over saturated, and a little off to the red side. Other basic things lacking: captions (of any form - even English!), other languages (Spanish, French would have been nice - this is a region 1 DVD after all, likewise it would have been nice to have the Japanese - some kids out there are learning this language), and indeed any extras. Given all of this the DVD is quite poor, but the story is wonderful... So get the best copy you can afford and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animee masterpiece...Terrible DVD, buy the video.","review":"I couldn't wait for My Neighbor Totoro to be released on DVD. When I finally received the DVD, what a disappointment. Its full screen (pan&scan) and the audio is sub par. Fox rushed this out only to capitalize off of Spirited Away's success. Its basically the Videotape edition transfered to disc. Anyone who appreciates the advantages of viewing DVDs and the artistic genius of Miyazaki will be greatly let down. Disney has done a beautiful job on Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service and Castle in the Sky. I only hope Fox will rerelease a better edition of this masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie; but don't buy it (yet)!","review":"This is one of the most heartwarming films of director Hayao Miyazaki's collection. I have seen practically all of Miyazaki's movies, and I love every one of them. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone. However, if you want to experience this movie as it was intended to be seen, please wait for a better DVD release. This DVD, by Fox, is missing the Japanese language track (in order to watch it subtitled), and it is full-screen only, meaning the image has been cropped. Disney is set to re-release this movie, perhaps in 2005, so do yourself a favor and wait until then. In the meantime, there's nothing wrong with renting this version of Totoro!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY PERFECT (FOR ANY AGE)","review":"And to think I almost missed this treasure. It is an absolutely beautiful tale for children of all ages and those of us who still have the ability to lose ourselves in fantasy worlds. What I really appreciate is the story's ability to let me forget our times, to some extent. When the little girl was playing in the backyard by herself while her father worked inside, I found myself worrying whether it was safe. When she crawled into the brush following one of the creatures, I fretted that someone might be waiting to do her harm. The more I watched, the more I relaxed. In this world, nothing bad was going to happen. It actually makes you shift your everyday gears and enjoy the moment. It is as sweet and gentle as it appears to be. If for no other reason than to be able to relax and forget your cares, you should purchase My Neighbor Totoro, for yourself as well as your children. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Masters Masterpiece","review":"Even in this badly presented tape (mono,fullsreen and new recorded opnening and ending song), the true quality of Tonari no Totoro shines bright, surpasing easily everything made by Disney.Totoro needs no big epic story, it has characters you will care for, with well developed backgrounds and the best dubbing i've ever heared. He needs no violence, there is none in it. Totoro tells you funny, charming and a few sad situations in the japanese countryside of the 50's. There so many loving details of the life and living in that period. So many scenes of the children simply experiencing natur and the wonders of Totoro. The music (including the original songs) is a masterpiece. Jo Hisaishi composed for most of Miyazaki works and as usual did a magnificent work of art. For Hayao Miyazaki himself, its my favorit Film of the best Director in the Animation business. This is a major treat for children and grownups of all ages.Buy this one. See it. Experience it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Film! But DVD presentation upsetting...","review":"I love this film, and the english dub is actually quite good. If you have not seen the film, watch it! BUT.. I believe Fox has misjudged its audience and created a DVD that I find lacking. Sure, its animated and made for children but I'm in my mid 20's and do not have any children and could not wait to get this DVD. I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that there was no original Japanese language track on this DVD.I know this sounds like previous reviews but I was so disappointed about the missing Japanese track that I had to add my voice here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful! This is not the classic version!","review":"Read the cover of the CD, click on it to get the bigger picture. Dakota and Elle Fanning? Disney has re-dubbed the disk which is highly inappropriate.

I don't know what you can do to make sure you get the right version."},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT buy the Disney version!","review":"Our video version finally snapped. We bought the Disney version -- BIG mistake!! Disney animators sticker sketched in cheap clutter, I guess to americanize-dumb-down the film. What is totally criminal was their background sounds and trashed soundtrack. The voices are whining, too loud, and the timing is off. Yes it gets worse! the voices are 'read' not acted or matched to the film. They are one, always too loud, tone. No depth, no silence. When I watched it all I could think of was the cheapest american animation at its worse!The Fox version is 5 stars, but Amazon displays the same reviews on both versions and most of the versions do not specify if the review is Fox or Disney. If you cannot find the original Fox version borrow it from your local library, from a friend, or wait. Do not get the Disney version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney Flubs the Dub","review":"Totoro is a treasured part of our Miyazaki collection. On VHS.I saw the premiere of this dvd version on TCM recently, and was appalled at the quality of the dubbed voices.

To newcomers the choice may be easier, but my 5 year old daughter made me change the channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Neighbor Totoro is the best movie for little kids","review":"My two year old daughter LOVES this movie. Satsuki and Mei are two adorable little girls in Japan and they meet Totoro. He is a forest spirit that helps the little girls on their journeys.

Voices dubbed over.","review":"There's not much to say other than Disney rubbing their hands all over this one.The original DVD and VHS tapes had better and more talented voice overs than this Disney version. In particular the little girl, Mei. Also the title song vocals have been redone. (I guess Disney felt they could get a better singer)It looses a lot of the \\"feel\\" of the original DVD and VHS tapes. I have to rate this very low as I was very disappointed and expected to find the original version intact when I bought it. I have not used this DVD at all and have not even bothered selling it. Simply forgot about it.Again, HORRIBLE job on the voice dubs otherwise the movie itself has been left intact."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Neighbor Totoro","review":"In my opinion the best Hayao Miyazaki film ever.

Once I heard it was directed by the guy (Hayao Miyazaki) who did Princess Mononoke, I went straight to the video store to rent it! I went home and popped it into the VHS player. I turned it on, and was shocked with amazement! It was so good and all this time I was passing right by it! Well now I regret that.

The Cat Bus was creepy and I cannot beleive that it was aimed at little kids! It didn't really have a moral either, just these kids running around in the woods finding Totoros.

I love it. Another masterpiece from Hayao Miyazaki. This is a children's movie made for children. No adult jokes that children won't get, but still a wonderful movie that deals with adult themes like being responsible for someone else's safety. The 2 sisters in this movie are loving and fun. A very visually beautiful and happy film.I do not like this edition from Disney.

If you're interested in that aspect I would say buy another version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same voices.","review":"I wanted to replace my VHS copy of Totoro.

Why re-do something so perfect?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The unfortunate and unexpected","review":"What a disappointment this DVD was when I shoved itin my player. The facade of this movie was a favourite from my childhood, but what a rude awakening I received. They may have remastered the animation, but they also had the gall to redo the voices which was an absolutely horrific choice. Not only was it a major disappointment because it's not what I expected to hear, but I felt the voices failed to capture the intent of Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki or connect to the characters themselves in their American ways. Do not be fooled by the cover and think this is the original. It's not. That was my mistake. Don't let it be yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the product details ...","review":"This is a great movie like all Gibli anime filmes, perfect for both child and adult alike. What I can't understand is why there is no Japanese on the DVD. All the Japanese released Gibli movies have both along with lots of extra stuff like original drawings and documentaries. As long as you have subtitles the original Japanese is much better and fits in with Gibli's characters better than the English. Of course it is good to have the dubbed version for kids. I think Disney have got this totally wrong. What is more annoying is that there is no product information with the ... write up that tells you this. Buyers should know they are not getting the original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original version is amazing, but Disney is crap.","review":"I loved the Fox version of this film; it was absolutely amazing. I always watched it as a kid, and I still do. When I bought the Disney version, I didn't know there was a difference. As I watched it, I noticed something was wrong; the voice actors were completely different. Disney completely ruined the movie by doing this. The sisters sound exactly the same (the idiots chose twins to revoice-over the movie) and the father sounds plain. In fact, most of the voices sound as though they threw together a bunch of random people with no experience, handed them scripts, and told them to voice their parts without any practice. The Disney version was very poorly done; I highly recommend the Fox version of this movie for the full experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Original!","review":"While this is a wonderful story in its original form (the original english adaption), this version is awful! There are no sound effects for the cat bus, the actors' parts are wooden and all of the magic has been leached out by Disney. I am relieved I kept my vhs copy of this movie because I will not watch the Disney release again. If I had perhaps looked more carefully, I would have noticed that it was a remake. I simply did not imagine anyone would change something that was wonderful in the first place. Shame on Disney for butchering such a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"The best animated movie I've ever seen. Wonderful storyline and delightful characters.

Being a Studio Ghibli fan, I had preordered thisfrom Amazon as there are few of the Studio Ghibli filmsavailable on DVD.Unfortunately, what the Amazon listing doesn't makeclear is just how technically bad this DVD release is.It is a hacked-down 4:3 version, with only a 2-channelEnglish audio track (no Japanese or other audio). Thereisn't even a subtitle track (not even english for thehard of hearing).The video and sound quality isn't good either. Also, don'texpect any extras relevant to the film.As the other reviews (obviously from other editions)say, this is a great film. However, this is not a DVDto get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie - Terrible DVD - Shame on FOX","review":"Under the less-than-knowledgable assumption on the part of FOX Home Video that this is a less-than-average kids flick, they have taken a monumental family movie and reduced it to the shelf space of Barney (the purple dinosaur). One has to ask why?I'm not necessarily asking for deleted scenes or any of the nice attributes that the Japanese release had, but don't we (the American consumer) at least deserve the widescreen version as an option? Come on FOX get with the times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a cute film!","review":"I just love this movie, and I think that Disney did a great job dubbing it in English. For those who are debating between this version and the older Fox dub, I think that this one is just fine. I really like the fact that the two young sisters were voiced by... two young sisters. A very cute film indeed. Any Studio Ghibli fan definitely needs this in their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly Miyazaki's best work","review":"Hayao Miyazaki is a master in the field of anime. My Neighbor Totoro was his pet project for quite a while, and it is quite possibly still his best work.I'm not a fan of calling a film \\"magical,\\" but it fits here. Everything about this movie makes you feel like a kid again. The animation is gorgeous, and imagination oozes from every frame. There isn't a whole lot of conflict here, but that's perfectly okay. This film is just fun and fantastic from beginning to end. It's like Miyazaki opened up his imagination and invited us all inside.Watching My Neighbor Totoro, you are in for something weird and wonderful. This film is a treat that is guaranteed to leave you with a smile on your face. It doesn't matter what age you are or even if you are an anime fan - this movie is something special that everybody should see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute story ---children and anime fans will love it","review":"This is not your standard Japanese anime. Clearly aimed at a younger audience, the video also provides an interesting insight into some of the customs and family life of rural Japan. Children will enjoy and sympathize with the antics of the main character as she attempts to take the place of her ailing mother when they set up the household. Older folk and Japanese anime fans will appreciate the beautifully rendered artistry and blending of scenes and character."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful, Kawaii Japanese Anime!","review":"I first saw this movie in like 1993 or something when my daddy rented it for us. Years later, when asked what I wanted for my 15th b-day, I asked for this movie. I had only seen it that one time, but I remembered it and wanted it. So now I have it and it is proudly displayed with my other animes! We have a young neighbor that comes over and watches it with us (she's 4) and eats Japanese snack foods with us. So now I have her addicted to Totoro and Pocky! The Neko Basu (Cat Bus) is the most kawaii thing in the world! The bus stop scene is the best anime scene (besides the Third Impact...)! I have tons of Totoro things-- the Japanese themes, a Totoro doll... it is the cutest anime made by the best anime company (Studio Ghibli- they also made Koufu no Hotaru, Mononoke-hime, Kiki's Delivery Service...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Neighbor Totoro","review":"The product I purchased was a remake. I did not realize this until I received and watched the film. I was hoping for an older version of the movie before the wording was fixed.

However, I saw the old version first so my opinion may be biased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Disney Release","review":"We have the VHS version and have almost wore it out watching it ourselves and with the our 2 kids. We purchased the Disney release of the 2 disk set as a replacement. It has lots of extras, but what happened to the original English voice-overs? We were very disappointed that Disney choose to change the voice-overs from that were on the VHS. The actors voices have little emotion and do not fit the character's action well. At some points is sounds like they are just reading dialog. We still watch our old wore out 20th Century Fox VHS version and put the Disney version away.I give the story and animation 5 stars as well as the 20th Century Fox version. But the Disney version only gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totoro loves any people of all over the world.","review":"We think Totoro is very cute, and maybe he also think us cute. I want to meet him to say he is quite hilarious and ride on him. In Japan, there're many good Anime which has no violence and has a lot of kindness more than one on violence. But little good Anime has been sold on abroad and many bad one always has been bought there. I'm very sad the fact. So I'd like you to know Totoro is just one of many good Child Anime. By the way I love Disney too. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rediscover the Magic of childhood","review":"I first saw this movie before I had children (In Japanese, no less, with someone translating on the fly), and I knew I would have to get it for my children someday. My two daughters (now 4 and 8) absolutely adore it. It harkens back to an earlier era, before children were battered with the sound bytes and fast pace of TV, when a child might laze away a sunny afternoon and perhaps discover the hidden magic in the world around them. It touches beautifully, profoundly and sincerely on the themes of family togetherness in the face of everyday events in a rural area, troubles (the mother's illness), and a connectedness with the spirits of nature. Adult reviewers raised on TV instead of books may be too jaded to appreciate its seeming leasure, but its magic unfolds at at a pace just perfect for the understanding of one who can still see with the eyes of a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Voice and Sound Tracks!","review":"I was very displeased with the newest version of Totoro. With Dakota and Elle Fannings voices, as well as all the other new voices, made the movie sound horrible and very unlike the original version of Totoro!

I couldn't even get through the first disc, without hearing the new annoying voice sound tracts! VERY DISSAPOINTING! What a waste of money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't replace your old VHS with this Disney version...","review":"Let me start by saying my family loves this movie and our original VHS is very worn out. I was hoping to replace the tape with the Disney DVD release. I was so disappointed. They changed Satsuki's name - and pronounce it Satski - yuck!! They added unnecessary dialogue - one of the things I love about the original is that it doesn't try to explain everything, it makes you think. If you are trying to replace your old VHS - this is not the one to buy. It's probably fine, for anyone who hasn't seen the original...My Neighbor Totoro"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why ruin it?","review":"I bought the DVD version for my dad for christmas. This has been our entire family's favorite movie ever. As soon as the new song with different voices came on were all devastated.I'm not exaggerating; we stopped it immediately. I was so upset and disappointed that they messed with such a great movie. My Neighbor Totoro is well worth the money/time to see it. But see the original (english version). I'm sorry Dakota; it's not personal against you... but bad choice to re-do it at all.If you've seen the original one you'd understand... my movie! what happened to my movie!! :'("},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"My neighbor totoro is a wonderful story but if your going to buy it DO NOT get the one with dakota fanning and her sister in it. the dialogue in the first american version by fox is alot more captivating. having the fanning sisters voice as May and her sister and altering the dialogue is a spit in the face to Hayao Miyazaki"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a magical and fantastical movie for young children","review":"My children ages 3 and 4 enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The 4 year old is a boy and has been tackling the idea of big scary monsters for the past month. This movie helped him realize that big isn't always scary and that he and his sister could enjoy something together. It is a magical movie and I recommend it for young children everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King of the Forest, reighs.","review":"My Neighbor Totoro is quite simply one of my favorite films of all time. It's beautifully animated, and has a storyline that reaches out to the heart.It's truly captivating to watch! I once took it with me to a family gathering on Thanksgiving, and at the children's insistence we ended up watching it six times in a row. But not one adult complained. In fact, they watched it over and over again with almost as much enthusiasm as the kids!That night, we all went to a store, and each family bought copies for themselves.It's not Miyazaki's masterpiece - that title has to go to \\"Spirited Away\\", but it's still one of my all time favorite films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this film","review":"My son and I are huge Studio Ghibli fans. My son is 20 months old and \\"totoro\\" was one of his first words. We watch My Neighbor Totoro in both Japanese and English (he doesn't seem to care which language). I love the original film but I think that the Disney dubbing is wonderfuly done as well. I love the opportunity to share well made movies with well thought out plots and characterization with the children in my life. I am glad Disney is releasing wonderful English versions of these films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Dubbed Version is Great","review":"This is a review for the Disney dubbed version of My Neighbor Totoro (Two-Disc Special Edition), with Dakota and Elle Fanning providing the voices for Satsuki and Mei.It was great, the whole family loved it adults and kids alike. Nobody dies in this movie so you won't have kids bawling over a dead deer like in Bambi or such. The Special Features and Editorial Reviews sections from Amazon tell you probably all you need to know about the story and what you'll find on the bonus disc, but I will add that you can watch/listen to the movie with the original Japanese sound track/voices, which may be important to some people. I enjoyed the English dub and then I watched it again with the original Japanese soundtrack, with English subtitles. There is also a French dub option.I don't have the other versions, so I can't compare them- but I can say that this is a great version and all the actors did a great job with the voice acting. Totally worth the $19.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"new version dumbed down...","review":"I have loved this movie for quite a long time. I don't know if they were forced to add new voices,if not, it was a very sad mistake. I admit that even dumbed down, it is better than most of the stories out there.But the point of these movies is that they were not dumbed down, and they were very much loved.The visuals are wonderful. I feel bad for the children that don't ever see the real version wherethe story is told as if to someone who is intelligent.The first sign that something was terribly wrong is the horrible thing that they did to the simple and fun opening song, and it just goes downhill from there.I am sorry if there was some dispute or something that forced them to make this change. I wish it had been done more respectfully for the wonderful artwork that it was intended to be. If you are looking to buy this, most certainly get a used DVD of the original. You will be very pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Butchered Version","review":"The movie wasn't meant for 4:3. If you want to buy a[n inexpensive] DVD for your kids, and if you only have a 4:3 analog TV set, this US region 1 release is absolutely fine. (The English dub is excellent.) Otherwise, stay away from it. Anamorphic widescreen versions, with English dub and/or sub, are available in other regions."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're a Totoro family","review":"We had this movie back when my boys were little - lost track of it - had let others borrow it for their kids - and havn't seen it since. When watching 'Toy Story 3' and Totoro makes an appearance my 18-year old son was hitting me up for a copy. My 13-year old daughter had never seen it (gasp!) so we had to get a copy. Its such a different-kind of movie. The characters are amazing - the imagination is astounding and yet, with the family with a sick mom in a far-away hospital, new house, new neighbors kids can relate. Very fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joy to behold","review":"Simply put, one of the most unique films I have ever seen.Magical, charming, and at times breathtaking.

It's a movie for the whole family. Although it's rated \\"G\\", older children and parents will enjoy it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entirely charming.","review":"I got this video for my daughter with no regrets. She enjoys playing her videos over and over again so I appreciate a movie like \\"Totoro\\" that does not get on my nerves.It is a charming tale of two young girls that dwell in the beauty of youth while coping with the absence of their hospitalized mother.I highly recommend this title for anyone with a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'mon Disney, we need this movie on DVD!","review":"\\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" is one of the most beautifully animated movies I have ever seen. Kids of all ages will enjoy it, for the wonderful story and for the exquisite animated scenery. Miyazaki is truly a master of anime. Unfortunately, Studio Ghibli of Japan sold the U.S. rights of this movie to Disney, and that is why we have yet to see an English subtitled version out on DVD. I was fortunate enough to watch the original version in Japanese on LaserDisc. The voice characterization is MUCH better than the dubbed English version! C'mon Disney, us Totoro fans are waiting for this on DVD, in original Japanese with English subtitles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"number 919 in DVD's on Amazon","review":"This video is #919 in DVD's on Amazon. This alone should tell you how popular the film is, and not all viewers are idiots.A wonderful film for (cliche coming) children and adults alike. I own less than 40 movies, and this is one of them. Miyazaki is a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the youngsters","review":"The Japanese origin of this film gives it a refreshing look compared to American animation. The story is delightful, and for a change a girl has the lead role. Kids will love the landscapes and the characters. Good, clean fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film you should not miss","review":"This is one of those films that makes people belive that the world is not just what you can see. If you want to spend a magical time, you should watch this wonderful movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Neighbor Totoro","review":"My family loves My Neighbor Totoro. There are some cultural differences in it--it can come off as a little strange to people in the US. But I like that about it. I've heard it said that Totoro is as popular a character in Japan as Winnie the Pooh is here. If you've seen and liked other Studio Ghibli movies, you've got to see this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totoro","review":"This DVD is an instant classic. Living in japan, it is a very interesting movie. We can watch this one with the kids and stay entertained!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical story!","review":"I first saw this movie almost 20 years ago, and have never tired of it. It's a magical, mystical story set in post-war Japan, where two girls have moved to the country with their father, who must commute to the big city for his job. The girls learn the story of a mystical creature called a \\"totoro\\", which lives in the nearby forest. They meet and befriend the creature and other related creatures, and have adventures with them. Great animation and music add to the story, as well as a rescue mission that has a happy ending. This is a classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it to Disney to screw up another great Anime","review":"I purchased this version (from Disney) because I thought they might have made a genuinely fantastic film even better... they certainly have the resources to do so... However, aside from a really nice new package, they unfortunately slaughtered it. The \\"English\\" translation from the original '80's version is the one you want, but good luck finding a copy on DVD. The \\"new\\" voices used by Disney are much inferior to the English-speaking voices used in the original translation. As usual, Disney took over the rights of this masterpiece for financial gain. In the process, they proceeded to destroy the aesthetic value of the delightful intent of the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop holding out on the people Disney!!!!","review":"I can't believe this is being released in 2010! The people want it now!!! Disney - I want to give you money for this today!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Under par with previous work from Miyazaki.","review":"Having seen Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle, both breath-taking in all senses, Totoro comes way under par both in the plot and in the graphics, both of which I found over-simplified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Boring movie Hayao Miyazaki ever made","review":"This movie has lovely visuals and is great to watch if you are feeling depressed. However I think this movie is terrible. Why? It's boring and seems to be about nothing for the most part. I prefer Kiki's Delivery Service over this film. Great if you just want to see a serene countryside but if you are looking for entertainment I'll have to say this is the wrong kind of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a MUST SEE video!I have watched in in Japanese & English, and it is a classic. So much fun, the whole family really enjoys it! It is so much fun to sit with my kids and watch it.One comment to the Japanese person who wrote another review about stereotypes, lighten up! How many times have you seen the non-Japanese (Gaijin) depicted in your TV shows/Movies/Anime as \\"large, loud, out of control, big nosed, rude, shall I go on? Lighten up!I found that the characters were very Japanese, and so lovable.Rant over.See this movie, you will not regret it, I promise!Cheers!Stuart Ablett Tokyo Japan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful with changed voices and dialogues","review":"Bad and Dumb decision to change voices and dialgues. It's not the same movie anymore.This was my kids favorite movie, but now it's the worst one. They notice the voices've been changed.They don't like it. CHANGE IT BACK! We had to return the movie. I'm looking for the old version."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment","review":"we love the original totoro and did not realize that this new version had been so disney-fied. it borders on sacrelige for those of us that love totoro. the voices are too harsh and loud, the music and singing at the beginning is harsh and loud. we could only watch about ten minutes of it and are currently looking for a copy of the original movie. it was a very dissapointing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Voice Actors is a big mistake","review":"I first learned of this movie in 1998 from a group of friends. Since it has been a favorite animated movie of mine and we spent a long time finding it on VHS at the time and then rented it recently on DVD. I purchased this Special Edition DVD when I bought Ponyo (another great movie).I watched this DVD the other day and something felt off right away. I finally grabbed the case and saw that the voice actors are not the same as the ones I was used to in the prior versions of the film. They also changed certain words and things that made it feel odd. It felt like the entire movie had been turned down in volume and the voices just didn't fit the movie. I was very disappointed and will now have to buy a used version with the classic voices. Just a warning for anyone that is a fan of this movie that you may be disappointed in the change like I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackjob, didn't even deserve one star.","review":"I am so grossed out by the voiceovers on this new version that I wanted to return it to the video store before I had listened to five minutes of it. I love the intro song on the fox version and have sung it to my children for years. I was shocked to hear the new gruffness in all of the voices in the entire video. I will never purchase Disney's version with the new voice-overs, preferring to stick to the good fox version instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Massively overrated","review":"I heard such glowing things about this but when I finally rented and watched it, I was bored out of my mind. Perhaps it means something in the context of Japanese folklore that I missed, but for its own sake it's not particularly clever (reminds me of _Through the Looking Glass_ only far less complex). I don't care about the dubbing; it could be silent and the story would still be uninteresting.I'm not a dedicated anime fan--I don't care who does the animation or in what style as long as the story is there--but I agree that the animation is really lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie for the entire family","review":"My Neighbor Totoro is an imaginative cartoon that is aimed at all age ranges. The animation and story are both engaging, and the characters are lovable. My Neighbor Totoro isn't like other movies in that there is no villain or bad guy. The story centers on two girls whose family has just moved out into the country. While they're exploring places around their house, they meet an interesting neighbor. A totoro! Interesting things start to happen but you'll have to see the movie yourself to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical animation that glues our 4- and 2-yr olds","review":"I normally do not buy Japanese movie videos mainly because unfortunately they are mostly not entertaining (There are some good ones, I admit.). But, when I happened to see this animation shown at Kinokuniya Bookstore in NYC, I was glued to the video screen for a while. The picture was so detailed and beautiful. So, I bought one. My kids have been watching it a couple of times a day since I bought it four months ago. My 4-year old daughter indentifies herself with \\"Mei\\" (or May?).The things that appear on Totoro are clearly from 50s and early 60s in rural Japan. They must appeal to Japanese people in my generation or older. \\"Auto Sanrin\\" (three-wheel truck), for example.I cannot wait to see his other works. We just saw Kiki's Delivery Service this weekend. I like KDS better than Totoro because KDS has a better story structure and exciting scenes in it. I hear \\"Castle in the Sky\\" will be released some time this year. Does anyone know when?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me the old charm","review":"I am returning the DVD and ordering the VHS. I wanted widesceen and vivid color, but the new version of the dubbing had my son in tears.

Wrong! The story was contrived and boring! Plus, it seemed as almost every other man had a \\"fat ... that wobbled as he walked out the door.\\" I felt compelled to finish the book as I paid for it but I won't be buying the next two! Save your time and read about Kleopatra in the encyclopedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum...","review":"I had a hard time getting into this one. I almost gave up on it a couple of times within the first 100 pages. I did get more involved at that point, but I never was able to stay invested in the story line for any significant amount of time. Just when I was starting to enjoy a section, the author would lose me again. It could be that I am just not all that interested in ancient Egypt. Perhaps if I were, I might have cared more about these characters. Not bad, just not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"I just finished this and I am absolutly stunned. What starts out to be a normal YA fiction, with its perfectly normal narrator, a well-adjusted kid named Ginny - just blows up to reveal the disturbing fact that beneath all this normalcy, the indifference of people not caring enough can hide the suffering of the vulnerable. Abuse is a very prickly topic and has been dealt with sensitively and with great compassion in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"\\"The Only Alien on the Planet\\" was a wonderful book! Do not hesitate to pick this one up. It is about a girl who moves to a new town and becomes friends with someone very unlikely - a boy who does not speak. She and her friend Caulder begin a mission to find out if this 'alien' has emotion and is in fact human. This book was brillantly written and it kept me guessing what Ginny would do, who she would end up with, and if Smitty, the 'alien', would end up speaking at all! I don't want to give away anything but I was kind of surprised by the ending. I picked up this book and didn't put it down! Cute story with very real characters. I could really relate to each one of them. You'll want to read this one - so try it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You should give this book more then five stars!","review":"In this book A girl named Ginny moves to a new town and she meets a boy that hasn't talked in 13 years, they call him \\"the alien\\" because of this. Then she starts getting tudering from him and she starts to like him, which brings them closer and they fall in love. Then he gradually starts to talk again and he becomes just like another teenager.This book is a great book because even though this may never really happen it still teaches you about things that could, like when Ginny and Michael (the \\"alien\\") fall in love, and he recovers from not talking anymore and she is the reason that he talks again. I think that someone could really over come something because of someone else. Ginny is a very independent person and when she wants something done she will do anything to get there. I think it just takes someone like her to do something what she did, she could be a romodel to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an excellent book!","review":"I was not expecting such a good piece of writing from an unknown author, but I was deeply moved by the book. It was extremely well written and had well-drawn characters. You will be swept up in the powerful emotions of the book, laughing and crying with the characters. For a storyline that has all the potential of a tragedy, the ending is remarkably beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"If this were a movie you'd say it's a good story but...","review":"... but the events described in the journals actually happened, and they are fascinating! Their means of travel, of survival, of communicating with the Indians, of hunting game and chasing and being chased by bears -- all described in such detail that you can easily picture it. In addition to being adventurers, these men were romantics and intellectuals. It is no wonder that once their journals reached the east, people started coming west in droves to see the beautiful lands and abundant game they described. The CDs are great for a long drive or the daily commute."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Distilled Essence","review":"Landon Y. Jones has managed to condense the journal entries of the members of the expedition of 'the Corps of Volunteers for North Western Discovery' [the Lewis & Clark Expedition] into a small volume which belongs on the shelves of anyone interested in the journey from Camp Wood River to the Pacific. Having participated in numerous living history programs from 2001 through the Bicentennial, and up to the present, I can honestly say that I refer to THE ESSENTIAL LEWIS AND CLARK each and everytime I prepare to travel to an event! I recently listened to the unabridged CD version of the book on my way to Oregon to take part in the L&C Saltmakers' Encampment in Seaside [a first person salt making adventure which runs from Friday through Sunday]. I recommend this book to any individual seeking a short, but thorough version of the captains journals during their party's passage across the unexplored reaches of the West! A fine little book in every regard!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is GREAT!","review":"I am just now starting to get into researching about Lewis And Clark and was reccomended this book at the local library.

Very easy for do it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The God Among Us","review":"I enjoyed Mr. Kempton's first work. The story makes the book hard to put down, I read it in one sitting. It is a Pat Conroy-esque story, probing a man's discovery of hidden family secrets and the discovery of secrets he has long held within himself. I enjoyed the development of the Atlanta characters, Mr. Kempton makes the reader care about what happens to them, and I actually thought about the characters for a while after I finished the book which is rare for me in a fiction work. I would have liked to learn a little more about Charles' pre-Atlanta life -- a more in depth examination of what made him flee his pulpit. I look forward to Mr. Kempton's next novel and his continued growth as a storyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great production","review":"Great recording with great production values for it's time. My first full Britten opera so I think it will take some time for me to get a better appreciation of the score, but it is interesting how sympathetically Peter Pears plays Grimes. The Emroidery aria is amazing, with Claire Watson singing it brilliantly. Naturally she goes crazy with her rolled 'Rs' but, then again, this recording is from the 1950s. I would thoroughly recommend it, especially with Benjamin Britten doing the conducting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy harmonica case","review":"This is a high quality, rugged case: heavy duty zipper, canvas-like outer, soft liner, inside pocket for set lists or notes, and wide elastic straps to hold your harps.

It does what it says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice cheap case for carrying 7 harmonicas","review":"This is a nice case for storing and carrying 7 harmonicas. It's not crush proof so if your carrying high end custom harps looks for something else. If you want an easy to use storage for you cheaper backup harps it works great. It also has a single pocket on the inside for notes or polishing cloth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and Over priced","review":"This is a very cheap case, hard canvas material that will do nothing to protect your harps if someone sits on the case. The tight elastic bands that hold the harps make it difficult to put them/out w/o concern for damaging your plates or comb; I ordered the solid Hohner case, holds more harps and although costs more will protect my investments much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total BS","review":"Wow, if I wanted to know what noise sounded like, I would have bought this album. You can't even hear what the frickin' guy is singing. All the songs sound the same. And they all equally suck for that matter. Death Metal is the trashiest, sorriest excuse for a music genre I've ever heard of. For starters, no I am not Christian, I am atheist. So I am not complaining about the religious aspects. I am complaining about how it doesn't even sound like music to begin with. Sounds like a bunch of drunken monkeys that have an IQ of 12 and have no coordination.Slayer is probably the worst band ever, and is the biggest embarassment to hit the stereo.

When it was released it was, but a lot of bands have gone past it. For pure headbanging fun, it can't be beat, but if you're really into heavy, check out Strapping Young Lad's \\"City\\" or anything by Meshuggah. They're not Death Metal, which is usually so garbled that it loses its edge. Also get Earth AD by the Misfits. It's so poorly produced it's laughable, but it's pure agression. And it was put out years before Reign in Blood, Master of Puppets, or any of the other defining metal albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaviest album of all time!!!!","review":"Hea y be tby name. Slayer proves why they are the heaviest band of all time with this thrash classic. The album is just under 30 minutes but it kills! Angel of Death.

This album has many themes related to death, war, horror, and the shadow side of man. And all done with a bit of tongue and cheek."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original Slayer","review":"This cd is not the best Slayer cd in my opinion but dont get me wrong it is truly a classic. 28 minutes of a brutal metal assault delievered by none other than the best in metal. Songs like Raining blood and Criminally Insane are the best on this Cd. Raining Blood is the Slayer trademark. It defines what Slayer fans know as the best in metal. The begining of this song into the opening riffs makes you want to yell SLAYER. This cd falls in with Slayer's best like Seasons and South of Heaven. The reason for the four stars is it ranks 3rd amongst the 3. If you like true heavy metal done by the best then buy this cd. Some think this was the standard Slayer set for everybody else. I dont agree fully but it comes close."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album defined the term \\"KICKASS!\\"","review":"Slayer kick so, so, so much ass with this album. If you don't have this album, please go buy it...All the other metal albums I've heard (which is a lot)pale in comparison. Metallica's Ride the Lightning comes close, but what's really admirable about this album is how they perfectly combine all the best aspect of hardcore punk and metal to create something that is so beautiful...if you don't like it at first, try listening to it a few more times, and remember to play it very LOUD! This music is delivered with so much energy and it sounds vital and alive. I would also recommend Hell Awaits. To my ears, this the greatest, most perfect thrash album ever recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Albums EVER!","review":"Slayer are without a doubt the greatest thrash metal band of all time and along with Iron Maiden and Metallica the greatest metal band of the 80's. Reign in Blood along with Metallica's Master of Puppets is the very pinnacle of thrash metal. This is a completely flawless album: the production, the riffs, the arrangments, everything works incredibly well. The tracks function as small parts of a whole and not as loosely connected songs. The album is very short (just under 30 minutes) with all of the ten songs as being under three minutes except for Angel of Death and Raining Blood. The brevity of the album is one of the things that make this album work so well, were it longer the subject matter would just seem too ridiculous but as it is the lyrics come off as very effective (Angel of Death in particular is quite horrific). This is an album I recommend to any fan of metal or anyone who is even remotely interested in metal. Mandatory Slayer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second to none!","review":"One of the best if not the best thrash metal albums of all time. If you are a metal fan and dont have this already, get it the next time you are in a record store, no metal collection is complete without this alltime, legendary classic from the metal gods who are Slayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music never was, and never will be this brutal","review":"With over 3 hundred reviews, I'm sure everything has already been said. But I feel the need to give praise to one of the most deserving albums in metal history.Slayer went over the top in every possible way and produced the most uncompromising, aggressive, evil, brutal record on Earth. Since then, many bands tried to claim the brutality throne, but this is not possible, since the first one to get there will forever be the first. And the first were Slayer.Revved up to 200+ beats per minute, filled with aggressive screams of Tom Araya, fueled by highly technical, purposely dissonant guitar solos of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, with genious drumming of Dave Lombardo to base on, this record rushes through your head like a series of machine-gun shots, and ends after 27 minutes, leaving you breathless, trying to grasp the experience you've just had.I can't recommend this CD enough. Get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic Slayer album - a must have.","review":"While my personal favorite Slayer is Divine Intervention, no one can call themselves a fan without knowing every syllable of Reign in Blood. It's the first \\"must have\\" album for a myriad of reasons. You can skip (but really shouldn't) Show No Mercy, and Hell Awaits and go right to Reign in Blood and understand what this band is all about musically (though, if you're a fan at all you'd better have Seasons in the Abyss).The combination of violent speed metal with riffs that are the aural equivalent of a ton has seldom been done better than here - even by Slayer themselves. Angel of Death, Necrophobic, and the delightful Jesus Saves are reasons enough to listen to this reckless joyride. Get on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album from the 80s","review":"You will enjoy this album if: you have fond memories of when it came out in the 80s. If you are too young to remember Slayer in their greatness but pick this album up now, you have to listen to it in the context of knowing it is 80s speed metal. A few recent reviews haven't been very fair, but they also appear to be very young listeners. This album was very powerful when it was released.ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full throttle","review":"Have you ever tried to go full throttle with a bike not being scared by the idea of crash into the first wall? Going full throttle for the only sake of feeling the highest speed you can reach, the blood running through your veins and your brain pumping the adrenaline? This album gives me this kind of fantastic emotion. Energy, pure energy, speed, brutality without compromises, without the limits that everyday world put in front of you again and again. This is something that a lot of people don't comprehend when they judge this album as repetitive or boring or stupid. This album is incredible adrenalinic and that's it. No more, no less. I treasure it since I bought in 1986, almost twenty year ago (and REALLY I listen usually to very different kinds of music!!!). It is pure energy, with a lot of unforgettable riffs. Pure gold. Who cares about satan anyway? That's [nonsense]. The music is what's important here. A brutal, fast, terrifying music. To me this album is unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayer supreme","review":"What more can I say about this album that hasn't been said before? It's simply a conrnerstone in metal music, a sonic abomination that came out in 1986 and destroyed everything else in the market. Of course it's been surpassed in terms of raw aggression and speed, but it remains a mandatory reference for fans of extreme music. This is the album, and the band, that influenced the ensuing death metal scene more than any other. All the elements are present in this album: tight, angry riffs that jump at you and engulf you, fast and furious drumming, short, power-packed songs that hardly give you any breathing space at all, and Tom Araya's vocals, spitting out lyrics that could make your local nuns have a collective heart attack.In short, if you like metal, get this album ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrash fan","review":"This album is one of their best, if not the best...this was the second album i bought.Ok the first album i bought was god hates us all that album is a 5 star to, as u see i'm new about slayer no im not, iv seen them live i have al their albums and i have learnd their songs perfect..man i love them i could merry them:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"holy s*** get it","review":"i love this band and this is the best work they have ever created so if you like to hear what the music of hell sound like go out and get it. it is speed metal and lets face it kerry king is the guitar god"},{"rating":"2","title":"STEPPING STONE FOR METAL FANS!!!","review":"I'd rate it 10/5...100/5...is that allowed?

There's no weak tune in the playlist and the album includes at least 5 classic songs out of 10! Someone would point is money wasted for such a short album...no way, I do hate \\"filler songs\\" (sorry, dunno how to explain better)...haven't listened to it yet get...tha hell you're waiting for...get it now! ANGEL OF DEATH and PIECE BY PIECE, the 2 openers, typical pogo/massacre tracks...but also musically and technically unexceptionable!

Other than that Slayer has their own style and if you like their style you will like it but i dont see how anyone could every say that Kerry King is good musician.....thats a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the talent?","review":"First of all, the only reason this CD gets 2 stars is because 1 star rating is reserved for Limp Bizkit-type bands. This CD is nothing more than pounding, pounding, and more pounding. Lyrics sound like 6th grader wrote them. If musical assault means beating drums as fast as you can and yelling \\"Hell, Suffering, Evil..\\" as many time as possible, and for guitar player to try to play as fast as he can not carrying about how melodic the riffs are, than this is the CD for you. This can't even begin to compare to most Panthera's work, let alone to old Metallica's masterpieces \\"Ride the Lightning\\" and \\"Master of Puppets\\".[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Every song sounds the same, no different beats or nothing, just screaming and the same drum beat everytime. This album is terrible. I give it 2 stars just for reign in blood, because that song rulez!!!!! If you want REAL metal, go buy Metallicas Ride The Lightning"},{"rating":"1","title":"When image matters most over musical ability.","review":"Behind all the spooky satanism , Slayer is nothing but a typical 80s metal band. Not concerned with song structure or emotion. Slayer basically plays power chords as fast as possible and combines them with solos that go nowhere. Is that what people find talented? Playing until your fingers bleed? If so, then Slayer, nor their fans know anything about what metal is really about. After listening to this album, It's no wonder thrash metal didn't even make it past 1991."},{"rating":"1","title":"umm...","review":"This album is a joke, right? Could this band be anymore overrated than it actually is? The sound of someone throwing up for 36 minutes straight would have made a better album than this. This garbage ranks right down there at the bottom of the crap pile as those death metal bands that do nothing but growl/burp/vomit into a microphone like a bunch of champs. A \\"hardcore\\" band name doesn't make a band good...the quality of the music does. Regardless of whether or not they pioneered thrash metal, this is just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Congratulations on being the #1 overated album of all time.","review":"Over the years I have been able to listen to a good number of Slayer songs here and there. A lot of songs from Show No Mercy and Seasons in the Abyss I thought were pretty good. After reading on just about every heavy metal page that Reign in Blood was one of the best heavy metal albums ever, I thought that I would go ahead and try it out. Let me start off by saying that Reign in Blood does contain some pretty good rythm riffs, but other than that I don't see what all the hype is about. First off, the vocals suck. Never thought that the lead singer for Slayer was that great, but on this album he really sucks. 2nd, the Lead guitar work sucks, nothing but random spurts of noise. Not one of the solos seemed to have any soul put into it at all. 3rd the lyrics are way too korny and childish. I will admit that several of the main riffs caught my attention, but after the last song was over I was glad the album was only about 30 minutes long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reign in Monotony","review":"One speed, one volume, one beat, one riff, one lyric (death, mayhem, suicide ooh la la la....). Another gem for the noise-starved teenagers. It would be cheaper to stand next to a Harley."},{"rating":"1","title":"kerry king and Hanneman can't kid everyone","review":"This album is really comical, Hell Awaits was respactable even interesting but this always has been a joke. The guitarists clearly needed a good dose of Johnny Marr."},{"rating":"1","title":"reign in crap","review":"oh man, what is this? Every song sounds exactly the smae, dededededede blah blah blah, the smae speed everything. The vocals are bad, and so are the lyrics. Fine, ok, its admirable that they can play fast and well, and have talented solos, but that doesn't sasve this from being a piece of crap. I'm sick of you people comparing this to slipknot, different genres and those who say this is better, maybe faster but less aggressive. Less of a punc, less creativity, (slipknot dj, sampler, rapping, singing, and screaming.) Yes, I know slayer is such an influence and a pioneer I guess, but this just sounds like garbage, most important, every song sounds the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable..","review":"Perhaps I'm spoiled by my Metallica collection, but this still sounds like a joke to me. Thin production, grating, buzzsaw guitars and some of the fakest, hilarious and downright awful lyrics I've ever heard. This is not a classic, it's childs play and sounds like it was thrown together by a bunch of 9 year olds in their bedroom.If anything, this is an insult to 9 year olds! Barking lyrics about Satan doesn't make you a metal band or scary, but I rate \\"Reign In Blood\\" 1 star for comedic value.And this is considered their best work? Wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Metal Album Ever!","review":"This album is amazing. It's a half hour of pure adrenaline rush! Song after song, these guys pound on you with the highest quality speed metal in existence. Even after 15 years no one has come close to this album, not even Slayer themselves! They must have made a deal with the devil when they hit the recording studio for this one. Best songs on here are Angel of Death, Jesus Saves, and Raining Blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic thrash monumental record","review":"A great album. I got this initally in 1988 i think on vinyl. That copy has gone to history, but it is a potent album that like someone else said has a timeless quality to it. The meter changes, ambitious chord progressions & good to great song structures give this album a quality that few have. The violence of Raining Blood. The potency of Angel of death and postmortem,can make anyone with a likingness to this genre of music to sit down, pay good attention and really enjoy this record.Now a days after I stopped listening to slayer around 1991, have discovered them again; 12 years later. They say the chinese calendar rotates every 12 years, and similar patterns of life follow. Well, Slayer is back in my life. Purchased SOuth of ehaven last year, and Reign in blood brings me excellent memories.To the newer folks getting into Slayer. Hands down, the most violent band on record and live. I enjoyed them (Clash of the titans '91).Peace out.= )"},{"rating":"2","title":"GO BIG OR GO HOME!!","review":"This album is not for the weak. For anyone that likes insane guitar solos, and a drummer that sounds like he has six arms and at times is shooting a machine gun at his bass drum this is for you.

When will all of these retard fans realize that they are paying money for noise,horrible noise and lousy lyrics from a band that ripped off a much supierior one, Venom. Thats all these guys are, a bunch of Venom ripoff's who write the most god awful songs on the face of the planet. If you want to listen to fast/heavy/evil music, then listen to the band that started it all, Venom and not this crap excuse of a band slayer or any other poser [...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, that's right. A one star review.","review":"Even when I was a huge thrash fan when I was in my late teens, I never found Slayer's music to be particularly interesting or inventive. Sure they're fast and heavy...but so what? Almost every single song on here is interchangeable and has no life of its own. The strongest aspect of the album is Rick Rubin's impeccable production.There are three basic types of Slayer songs on their albums: death, insanity, and murder. That's it. That wouldn't be so bad if there was some DEPTH to their lyrics. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no depth to be found here.My recommendation is to download Angel of Death. Once you've heard it, you've heard the whole album. Hell you've heard Slayer's whole career."},{"rating":"1","title":".....And I can tell you why....","review":"First off, I'n not giving this album 2 stars because they're not talented. They are all great musicians, and I respect them for that.It's the lyrics. All Slayer does is yack and yack about their Anti-Christ beliefs alum after album, and that makes me sick. I mean, they even ha ve an album titled \\"God Hates Us All\\" (How did they get away with that?) I can only take so much of that. People may think it's fun to listen to, but people like me take it seriously. That goes for other bands as well, such as: Goatwhore, Cannibal Corpse, Exhumed, Cradle of Filth, Mortician etc. ...; there's still good stuff out there that doesn't focus on Satanism.P.S. Don't get me wrong, I am not a big religious person, but an music that have lyrics like this are ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh....","review":"First off, let me say I love metal. Sabbath, Pantera, Iron Maiden, (old i.e. pre-Black Album)Metallica, Megadeth, it's all good. But this....what is this? It's just noise, that's it. Yeah, there are some VERY good riffs (Angel of Death and Raining Blood come to mind), but everything else.....it's just noise. Seriously, I'd listen to St. Anger before I'd listen to this.* I dunno. Personally, I do not like it. But there are a lot of people out there who do, and that's fine I guess. It is without a doubt one of the msot influential and (in)famous albums of all time however.*Ok, a bit of an exaggeration, but still..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this god awful crap?","review":"Ive listened to Master Of Puppets by Metallica since it first came out and someone told me this is even better.They couldnt be more wrong.This crap isnt even music.Its auditory garbage.The guitars sound like nothing but static and the singer is even worse.Is it cool to have no talent? Is that why people call him one of the great vocalists?God its like the same two notes over and over again and I thought Hootie And The Blowfish had a terrible singer.These people sound like a bunch of morons who got fired for sleeping on their day jobs and decided to sing about Satan,sing the same two notes and pound on the same three chords.This might sound like music if youre a crack head but if not its just worthless noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. people like to show off; slayer no good.","review":"the krunch of the guitar would not be there-in this album by this band titled slayer. todays metal bands (2001) from norway do deliver a punch a strong set of punches when it deals with music in all aspects. the keyboard has been implemented along with the wizards on the guitars who have flourished with their compostions. the band slayer has really lucked out because their stuff has really no meaning when it deals in playing great guitar music. they have no keyboard music at all. and their crunch rhythms are just too slow. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"What can I say?

This was as far (as history has proven) the Thrash metal experiment could go-after this, there is only noise (which sounds good sometimes, but ain't metal). Hardcore punk fans loved this (and afterall, Hardcore was always more metal than punk anyway). 28 minutes, the lyrics are throwbacks to Led Zep and kingdom Come I guess, but mainly to Black Sabbath (very visual and depressing/occult lyrics).

Kerry King, Jeff Hemermen, and Tom Aryia have had their share of drummers, but I think that they put out some of thier best work with Dave Lambardo (or as I call him master of the skins!)

You can have 'Master of Puppets'(although I do like it a lot) and 'Rust in Peace', this is where it's at. From the shredding, insanely fast solos of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, to the great drum work of Dave Lombardo and perfect singing from Tom Araya, this is the mold that everyone has been following for the past 20 years. Without Reign in Blood, there would be no death metal or metalcore or anything else like that. I have been listening to thrash for a couple months, and this is the best I've heard.

Listening to \\"Reign in Blood\\" is like having an atomic bomb blow out your eardrums. The album is speed,brutality,power and insanity at its best. \\"Reign in Blood\\" makes no apologies and takes no prisoners. Fourteen years after its original release it's still as fresh and on the cutting edge as it was in '86. The album is the influence of many of today's Death Metal bands. \\"Reign in Blood\\" is a must have album for any serious metal maniac.

What follows is the quintessential metal album that all others should be measured against. The first song \\"Angel of Death\\" is a barrage of super fast tempo, shredding guitars and lyrics about.......,you guessed it, satan and death. Really, when it comes to speed metal, what else is there. In the bridge to the guitar solo in \\"Necrophobic\\" you hear Tom Araya growl \\"Enter to the realm of Satan!!!!\\" before a squealing, lightning fast guitar blasts you to pieces. Now that's quality music! This all leads up to the last and best song \\"Raining Blood\\". This song covers all the metal bases. It's slow, it's fast, it's got blistering solos and lyrics about death, blood , evil and of course, Satan. All in all the best damn heavy meatal album ever released."},{"rating":"1","title":"reign in what?","review":"Yes, Reign in Idiocy! Or at best Reign in Boredom. All songs sound the same.

Another 5 star review","review":"Well, it's not really a review. I would just like to say that anyone that considers this just noise, and not music, must have a very slow mind. I'm not trying to insult anyone specifically, but for such a great thrash record, it sure has a lot of 1 star ratings from some of the worlds biggest boneheads. Every song sounds the same? Sounds like something a metal virgin would say!! It's a classic, regardless of what some 12 year-olds say."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST METAL ALBUM EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is BY FAR the greatest heavy metal album of all time!!!! Everything about this album rules...from the chainsaw-like guitar riffing from Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, the evil/psychotic vocals of Tom Araya, to the blasting drum beats of Dave Lombardo, not to mention the superb, crisp production of the album...what more can one ask for? This is exactly what METAL music should be and more. This album makes the first three Metallica albums sound like Brittany Spears (of course...I'm not going to mention what I think of the newer Metallica stuff! puke!!!! LOL!!!!!!)! If you don't like this album, you're a poser, bottom line!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a big waste-o-time","review":"First of all, I wish that I had the option of giving this album zero stars, because that is what it deserves. The problem with this album is that it simply isn't evil enough. Admittedly, some of the music from this album is decent, namely, the entertaing angel of death, on which Kerry King's harmonious guitar work really shines. However, its corny lyrics are a weak attempt at being evil. Mr. King and Company should have taken a few lessons from the masters of evildom, like Rush, Neil Young, and Pink Floyd, which could have helped make this album halfway tolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I listening to the same song?","review":"I love metal. Especially thrash and speed metal, but this is the most overated album of all time. On this piece of turd, all of Slayer's songs sound the same.

Oh and Kerry King is the worst guitatest EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"what ?????????","review":"ok, i'll say a few words. what exactly is this? i guess if you want NOISE, buy it. traditional speed metal is not what this cd is about, this cd is about nothing. bad all around. deathrow inmates would love it, the average metal head? NOT. if you want \\"doom metal of sorts\\" spend your money on a lesser known chicago band named trouble. their self titled 1990 release, if you can find it is definitely worth whatever you pay. slayer just missed the boat trying to outdo megadeth & metallica. if they slowed the tempo of this cd way down, i guess i could call it worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"want thrash with talent - try Rust In Peace","review":"This is one of talent-less bands, nothing but a wall of noise.How do they know one song from another I just cannot fathom.Megadeth and early Metallica are thrash with mucisianship.Slayer and Kreator are all else."},{"rating":"1","title":"oi vey reviewers are stupid as hell...","review":"normally I don't review things but I will in exception here. Alot of Slayer talk has been tied in here with Children of Bodom, Metallica, and Linkin Park.What the hell kids? Metallica is a whole different world from slayer...a MUCH better world. Linkin Park is an entire different genre that doesn't belong in any conversation with metal. And yes Slayer paved the way for bands like Children of Bodom...and sadly we have to live with bands like COB.you can listen to good hard metal without having to listen to slayers bs. Listen to Metallica, Megadeth, Dream Theater, Iced Earth, Deamons and Wizards. Want to hear a band that plays music 4 times the speed of slayer and plays it better?...DragonForce. ALL OF THESE BANDS CAN BE FOUND ON THIS SITE!!!

Keep in mind that members of Slayer have stated they were never just a metal band, they were a metal/punk/hardcore crossover, as evidenced in Undisputed Attitude. My common response to people who criticize music for 'just being fast' is \\"why is your music all slow\\"? Analyze many bands and you'll find most play within their own comfortable range of BPMs but don't exceed on either end of the spectrum."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am reviewing this again....","review":"ok,i'm changing my old review, i know i gave this cd 2 stars before, but i just can't stop listening to it now. This is probably the fastest and heaviest(but not the best) thing you will ever hear. I love their speed, and I know they're one of the most important metal bands ever, but I don't think they are as good as Megadeth or Metallica. This album does sound a little repetitive. It lacks the diversity of any album by Metallica, but I can still listen to this cd sometimes. It gets 4 stars because it doesn't have as much diversity as I would like."},{"rating":"1","title":"BELONGS IN THE GARBAGE! THIS IS NOT GOOD THRASH METAL!","review":"THIS ALBUM GOES BEYOND MONOTONOUS AND BORING!

IF YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO SOME GREAT THRASH METAL CHECKOUT SOME OF THE STUFF BY BANDS LIKE ANNIHILATOR, OVERKILL, VICIOUS RUMORS, HELLOWEEN, TESTAMENT, DELIVERANCE, ANTHRAX, ARMORED SAINT, SOME OF MEGADETH'S STUFF, OLD FATE'S WARNING (LIKE \\"NO EXIT\\" AND \\"AWAKEN THE GUARDIAN\\") AND OLD (AND I STRESS OLD) METALLICA (\\"AND JUSTICE FOR ALL\\" AND PRIOR)."},{"rating":"1","title":"all the songs sound the same!","review":"exept for the lerics all of the tracks could be switched around and no one would know the difference"},{"rating":"1","title":"It must be a white thing becuase I don't understand","review":"This is a classic album please lololol. I listen to a variety of music from Soul,Funk to Punk, Nu Wave and Thrash and the dreaded Disco, but I laughed my head off on this album the only thing scary when my friend played this album for me was when the dogs would stop howling.The only cut worth listening to on this so-called \\"masterpiece\\" (as if talking about satan, nercophillia and murder is such a big thrill)was \\"raining blood\\". The musicianship and lyrics are poor and the singing is even worse. If anybody is blown away by this so-called band listen to Megadeth, Bad Brains or early Metallica.

This band is nothing but a bunch of guys that aren't smart enough to do anything besides band instruments and sing the same voice over and over again.Just because they are old doesnt make them good. I gave them an extra star because without the vocals there is some nice background music here.If you want a band that grows into something better with each Cd, then try Slipknot or Otep."},{"rating":"1","title":"all sounds the same","review":"all the songs sound the same plus they are pretty evil of a band(just look at that album names) plus the songs just have fast beats and fast guitar and thats it... and it has some singer growling really instead of singing. dont buy this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want those 35 minutes of my life back","review":"I'm going to be frank in my review. I don't doubt that the members of this band have talent, undoubtedly more than myself. It's just a shame that they have to waste that perfectly good talent playing antimusic (death metal). I know rock, I've listened to my share, but this was a waste of 35 minutes. It needs some concrete music theory behind it, or it has no direction. And yes, most rock music does have theory behind it, believe it or not. Playing random chords as loud as you can and having someone attempt to destroy a drum set somewhat rhythmically does not constitute any kind of music. Please people, come to your senses and listen to some real music! If you like metal, listen to Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, Van Halen, KISS, and if you like some classic stuff, Led Zeppelin or Deep Purple. Save your money, and buy music by the aforementioned artists instead. Your eardrums will thank you later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok please, somebody tell me what this is","review":"What the hell is this crap??? I am a true metalhead, i love my metal (Judas Priest, Pantera, Metallica, Megadeth, Ozzy, Black Label Society) I use to go into metal chat rooms and forums and crap and everyone would say how kick @$$ and great slayer is. The only thing Slayer does great is write songs with the same guitar riff. The lyrics, wow...my 6 year old christian cousin could write better darker lyrics than these guys. Every song sounds the exact same, all they do is change the lame @$$ lyrics. There is absolutely no singing and no effort put into these guys' music. Slayer scars the face of metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Slayer's Best","review":"This album is a non-stop heavy album. It was the first Slayer album I ever got and led me to keep buying.

An absolute must have, ranking in my all-time top ten metal discs. Non stop action. Personal faves-Angel of Death and Raining Blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 Thrash Album of All Time","review":"The title says it all. This is coming from someone who was a thrash fan back when this came out. This release blew everything away and still does. In my opinion, it is the very definition of what thrash metal should be. Even Slayer can't top this release and they knew it...so they followed it up with a slowed down masterpiece in 'South of Heaven'. If you want virtuoso technicality then look elsewhere. If you want raw aggression and insane riffs with blood-curling vocals, then this is the release for you.The only other release that comes close to the number of riffs that give me goosebumps is S.O.D.'s 'Speak English or Die'."},{"rating":"2","title":"This goes out to hydonymous","review":"I haven't listened to the full CD yet. I'm sure it's pretty good, even if it is violent. This particular review is directed at \\"hydonymous\\". Please don't review that genre if u don't like it. Help others who read these reviews to make an educated decision on whether or not to buy this CD. If u don't like metal, that's cool with me. But NO ONE wants to hear about it when u type the exact same review for different CDs. I read ur other reviews. You freaking copied and pasted them! Please don't review metal anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not as great as some suggest.","review":"While this isn't a bad CD, it's just not that great. I would have give it 2.5 stars if I could have. Of course Lombardo is drumming incredibly fast and powerful, and the guitars are blisteringly fast and heavy. Tom Araya's vocals are not all that great, just shouting. Of course as brutal as these songs are I can't really picture the vocals being any other way. But it's too much of the same thing, not a whole lot to set each track apart from the others. I think Seasons blows this one away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the PASSION?","review":"That's great and all that every \\"metal head\\" known to man loves this band. I don't see what's so special. They're music is fast and furious, but who cares? I look for PASSION in music and I just don't feel it from these guys. They have NO PASSION! It's just stupid lyrics with no raw emotion or unbridled energy behind it. Take Korn's first album or Machine Head or Max cavalera from Soulfly and Sepultura fame. Those guys have PASSION and you can feel it when they play. Slayer is just a lot of repetitive noise with no feeling. Even Celine Dion has more PASSION than these guys. They just play loud, speedy metal. Impressive, but it doesn't touch my soul!"},{"rating":"1","title":"at best mediocre","review":"I bought this cd, then I was disappointed. That's all. This is very short and very boring. Why? Because all songs sound the same. With brutality? Yes. With speed? Sure. And with Idiocy? ABSOLUTELY! I always liked Old(yes, old) Metallica, ACDC, Black Sabbath. But this cd is just full of fast noise. (Maybe drumming is the only part worthy of listening) If you are starting to like metal, just avoid this cd. There are many other ecommendable cds. Don't be e-fooled by reviews from their blindly addicted fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"only one good song.","review":"Only one good song, Raining blood.

Slayer is just horrible in general, i used to have \\"reing in blood\\" when i was a freshmen in highschool but when i lent it to a freind he broke it by accident. In retrospect, i'm glad he did, for its all noise anyway and the sounds you hear at a construction site have more musicality then this album, (being at less then 30 minutes, how can you really call this an album?) that bearded dude with the jack hammer could pull off better riffs then king and hanneman could. in conclusion, this is just overrated juvinile noise for 8th graders who think their \\"tough\\" and satanic, thinking that soceity rejects them but embrace it by shoping at Hot Topic and [...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"LA posers","review":"Slayer is a bunch of party-guys who have trained hard at playing their thrashy guitars. They are as fast on this album as they probably are on their feet chasing around after girls on the beach. And the singer delivers the dark lyrics with a soft voice, probably calculated to reach a wider audience. Not much of personality in the music; and they have stolen parts from other records, like Death's Leprosy and Megadeth's Peace Sells for example, records with real artistic value.If you want good metal try Symbolic, Sound of Perseverance, and Human by Death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant...","review":"(Not a kid, just don't have an account).Something tells me that Metallica, Megadeth, the loathsome Slayer, and the rest of the genre could have achieved as much musicality if they were playing jackhammers and chainsaws as opposed to musical instruments.

This pool is fun although my second one. The first one I had for a summer and a half before it got a rip in the seam. It was because it was filled too full, I think. This review is off the second one I had all this last summer. It's more difficult to set up than videos I looked at seemed. Getting the ground leveled so the pool doesn't lean is hard work. When filling the pool, it may look like it isn't level. Wait until the sides are completely up before checking whether its leaning or not. If the ground is level, the pool will be level after filling. Once filled, you'll have a great time. It's 2 ft deep, so for adults it's a great way to cool off in the summer, by sitting in the pool. 10 ft round is great for small backyards. It's a pretty inexpensive way to have a pool without having to dig up the backyard for a pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pool cover it is, heater? - not so much","review":"I had high expectations for this pool cover that it would, in fact, use the power of the sun to keep my pool warm. It is a great pool cover, but, in my opinion, a not so good pool warmer. It seemed that the science was good: small, interconnected bubble-wrap-type, clear magnifiers slowly using the power of the sun to harness and transfer heat to the waters below. Unfortunately, the first 6 inches got only a few degrees warmer than the deeper water. I was generous in giving it only 2 stars.On a more positive note, the cover seems to be quite durable, does not tear easily, is flexible and easy to pull across the top of the pool without having to walk around and around the pool fine tuning its coverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a 8' not a 10' in size","review":"I purchased this cover for our 10 foot round pool and it was more like a 8 foot round pool cover.

I try not to keep it on for more than 2 days at a time. One time I left it on for a week and uncovered it and my pool was neon GREEN! My suggestion is leave the filter running while its covered and always uncover a small area for your floating pool chlorinator to move around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Product!!","review":"We have had this cover for a month now. I am very impressed with how well it works! It makes a drastic difference in the water temperature. Our water got up to 90 degrees. The kids are able to swim and truly enjoy it now. It doesn't heat the water all the way through to the bottom of the pool, but it heats up the top half.

We fill it and wanted the water to last about 3 days, but until getting this thing it just got colder and colder.But this solar cover did the trick! I have to wrap the extra plastic under (could probably cut it off if I felt like it), but the water actually got a little too warm one day and we had to put more cool water in! Of course, we live in a sunny state, but the outdoor temps linger around 70. So this little pool warmer really turned things around for us! Now to get the hose vacuum thingie and we'll be set. Oh yeah, the cover does help keep bugs out (like mosquitoes laying eggs), but there are holes in the cover where I guess in an area with a lot of bugs they could still get in. We just don't have that many bugs here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even last one summer.","review":"This \\"cover\\" is nothing more than a cirle-shaped sheet of bubble wrap.

The bubbles disintingrated leaving small round pieces of blue plastic throughout the pool. Now when I try to pick it up, my fingers poke right through what is left of the cover. I gave it two stars because it did what it was supposed to do in heating the water, but it failed miserably in durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's bubblewrap!","review":"Yep, it covers the pool. Barely. This is really just a big piece of blue bubblewrap, cut in a circle, with a few holes in it. I don't expect it to last more than a season.

It will only really warm it up right up to about 4 inches off the bottom. this was no probelm because once we got in, started moving the water around, the temperature only dropped about 2 degrees.It is bubble wrap but was well worth the $$$ and defiantly a clever idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Floats on water but doesn't block many leaves or bugs getting in pool","review":"Product does help warm the water through the power of the sun, but doesn't do a great job of blocking out debris, such as bugs, leaves etc. Product would work much better if it wrapped around the rim of the pool, however this so-called cover doesn't cover the edges of the size of the pool it claims to cover.

And althought the initial flip-flop of fast song-slow song suggests that it will continue throughout the album (with the soul-dredging \\"Million Miles\\" followed by the cool and bright \\"Europa\\"), the album slows down considerably. Scalde channels Freddie Mercury in his delivery of mysteriously poetic lyrics for \\"Your Inner Kiss,\\" as his voice turns into a chorus of ghosts. Meanwhile, on the dirge-like \\"Edenbridge,\\" Peter Murphy channels... well, Peter Murphy. Princess Superstar brings her own sleazy stylings to the sci-fi electro of \\"Lips on Fire.\\" And \\"Les Violons Ivres\\" finally brings back the kick drums, drenched, appropriately enough, in strings.

Adjectives fail to capture how wonderful and remarkable the original book is, which makes it particularly loathsome that someone has managed to make a film that is at once boring and distasteful out of it.

This book is all about following the precise directions and creating in the end a product that looks like the one in the book. It is not a book that encourages creativity. Also, I found that the activities involve a lot of steps and materials.

Southern Harmony was great in its own right, but the line up(i.e. Ford and Harsch) was just warming up. Marc Ford is at his best, long bending notes that leave you hanging on for your life, incredible jams with rich and the gang. You can't go wrong, this is one of the great albums of the past 20 years if not all time.

Yes they are blues-based, but that's because they're from Georgia. However, they still rocked with Stones and Faces influences. I mean after being used to hearing songs like \\"Twice As Hard\\" \\"Jealous Again\\", \\"Remedy\\", and my personal favorite \\"Sometimes Salvation\\" I was appalled at what I heard here. For starters this doesn't rock at all with the exception of \\"A Conspiracy\\", and the music is just blah. I am really disappointed with the Crowes for this one. I just have to ask why they released this album? I mean the cover was bad enough making the American Flag into a g-string, or thong is disrespectful. I happen to love this country despite it's issues right now, and feel that this ranks up with burning the flag. I also feel that they abandoned their roots with this album. Why oh why oh why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great after all these years","review":"I'm a huge Crowes fan and loved their first two records, the second one especially (Southern Harmony), which is a masterpiece, one of the best albums of the 90s. When a first heard Amorica, I was disappointed. For whatever reason, I couldn't get into it. Maybe there weren't enough catchy tunes. Who knows. After listening to the album a couple more times, I began to like it a bit more...and more...and more. Roughly a decade later, I've long since discovered that Amorica is an absolute gem, full of rich layers, every bit as masterful as Southern Harmony. I'll be listening to this album until the day I die."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crowes Best Album! A Treasure...","review":"The band members are wearing their hearts on their sleeves. The playing and singing on this record is truly magical. The \\"Eat A Peach\\" for the 90's. It is just too bad that their last 2 records (Snakes, Side) are horrible. It doesn't make sense.

But man, am I glad I listened to it again? What year was it? Ninety-four? So, how did it take 10 years for this album to reveal itself to me?! In hindsight, I think Alice In Chains were very underrated from that time also, but nothing like this album... truly wonderful... Cursed Diamond is one of the greatest love songs ever written.

Time has honed their style and let them produce their best album to date. Sonya Aurora Madan's angelic voice sweeps you through her songs, with her dazzling lyrics and captivating ideas, until you are singing at the top of your lungs and even accompanying Glenn Johansson on his flying guitar riffs. This album has everything, from the unbelievably catchy \\"Iris Art\\", \\"Everyone Knows Better\\" and \\"I'm Not A Saint\\", to the soulfull accoustics of \\"Bleed\\" and \\"Falling Flame\\"; from the frantic ( you better not drive while playing this ) pace of \\"Drive Myself Distracted\\", \\"Holding The Wire\\" and the unparalleled \\"Mouth Almighty\\" to the majesty of the orchestra that accompanies in \\"Wired On.\\" I warn everyone now not to play this album before taking a shower as your voice ( and you will be singing ) could travel for miles through the pipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the reviews this album had in the press.","review":"This album is still a joy to listen to. Its more accomplished than 'On' though perhaps not as guitar pop driven. The only let down with the album was the artwork as it really doesnt reflect what a great sound this album makes. Its a pity that more bands dont have as good a singer as echobelly do. Sonia really can belt them out and make you feel inside on the lyrics, this album shows it best by far. This album deserved to do much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of a let down.","review":"But definitley not a major one. I have to admit, waiting 3 years to get this in America, I was expecting more.

Although there was much material on this section I was not impressed because we all knew then that D-Day or \\"fortress euoropa\\" was fought on a vast region and there were lots of battles here. Maybe the majority of film on this part was on black and white. 2nd reason I was dissapointed was how each footage was presented, I hated the way they introduced each topic using that awful blue background. Lastly I was dissapointed because I wanted to see more but this title didn't satisfy my cravings. Hmmmm, maybe it was my fault, I expected too much.

And when the overpowered characters DO get an item, look out!Here's why they suck:I'm happy they pumped the Clerics, Paladins, etc ... but if you buy the D&D; game, you're looking at hundreds of dollars of books.The whole system needs to be revamped. A roleplaying game shouldn't cost players, GM's, or fans hundreds of dollars.Players & GM's, go find a cheaper yet also good RPG like Call of Cthulhu, Amber Diceless, Paranoia, Hackmaster, ShadowRun, etc. Or just DON'T buy all the expansions!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Book","review":"This book is pretty much a rehash of stuff already out.

Where are the interesting prestige classes from the Masters of the Wild like Verdant Lord, Animal Lord, Shifter, and Tamer of Beasts?

This is not going to be the racetrack our son (or daughter) is still going to have when he/she goes off to college. Our track lasted approximately four weeks. This timeframe is without trying to take it apart and building another set-up. We just left the original set-up because the plastic prongs on the bottom of the tracks are too hard to loosen. After about 4 weeks (of heavy use I might add), the tracks kept disconnecting, the cars weren't staying on anymore, or the connectors of the cars had to be constantly readjusted to work.I can't say I regret buying it because my son had a lot of fun with this toy while it lasted.

You can talk about his staying power, his songwriting, his straddling of various genres.But this CD reveals the secret at the heart of Cash's power.

Nothing fancy, nothing that you'd even call \\"skilled\\" in the ordinary sense of the word.But lie on the floor and close your eyes. Listen to that voice, booming out of the darkness. So powerful. So honest. So straight.It's the kind of voice you can imagine saying \\"let there be light,\\" and the light obeying.It's not a wide range, or tricky notes, or vibrato.Just charisma.

Sparse in instrumentation (mostly just Johnny's Guitar) and with Cash's voice ragged with age, they are stark but powerful. Cash tries everything from heavy metal to spirituals to old standards. All are just amazing. His voice, though fragile and weathered, is still very recognizable. The songs are very pointed, many focusing on his end of life views. On this CD, try out \\"Why Me Lord\\" - which contains the lyric - \\"Why Me Lord, what have I ever done to deserve even one of the blessings I have known.\\" Other great cuts are \\"Bird On A Wire,\\" \\"Redemption\\" and \\"Like a Soldier\\" and several train songs (one of Johnny's favorite themes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This disc is essential","review":"The other reviewers on this site have done a good job of delineating the contents of this cd, so I will just add my comments.

However, Johnny Cash is another story. He is what country music should be. It's a great testament that American Recordings was made while Johnny Cash was in his sixties. Listen to American Recordings and then listen to Tina Turner's Twenty Four Seven. Johnny Cash blows Tina out of the water. I suppose Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits are the only other musicians that could match Johnny Cash. American recordings is an intimate portrait of country/folk songs. Even though Cash didn't write the majority of songs, he sounds like he did. This is a must have for any rock collector. Mr. Cash turns in a brilliantly subtle recording here."},{"rating":"2","title":"brings back old memories","review":"My parents always listened to music by Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Patsy Cline, David Allan Coe, and Waylon Jennings and when I hear their music it always brings back memories. Johnny's older songs like Boy Named Sue are my favorites because I grew up on them and now my kids know them by heart, but there are good songs on this CD too like Bird On A Wire and Why Me Lord. It isn't going to be the same without Johnny Cash, but we still have his music and now he's with June."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Recordings is a Must Have:GREAT New Cash Ballads!!!","review":"This is absolutely one of the finest cd's that we have ever heard.This is a must have if:1) You Like/Love Johnny Cash2) You Like/Love Ballads3) You Like/Love unplugged accoustic guitar4) You Like/Love Music as ArtWE are seriously considering purchasing a quantity of these cd's and giving one to everyone that we care about . . . it's that good- and not a bad cut of the bunch.Best,Bill & Sharon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"I love Johnny Cash, I love every edition of the American Recordings series, but this is the weakest of the series. Don't get me wrong, this is a good CD, I enjoy every minute of it, but if your're a Cash rookie, get the Essential Johnny Cash, this is for hardcore Cash fans like myself, but the Essential is awesome as well.

You pray that Johhny's tongue is firmly in his cheek during the misogynistic \\"Delia\\", and his turn on \\"Bird on a Wire\\" makes you wonder how anyone else could legitimately talk about being a drunk in a midnight choir. He can bring it like few other artists, and his voice reveals the the years and the gravel. This is transcendent native American music."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 year old son loves his Mondo","review":"We were looking all over for this toy. Decided to take a chance and order without seeing it (and no reviews). It is a good quality and size. He recd Orange and green. Played with it for quite awhile now and no tips have broken off, so it is durable. Gets dirty, but easy to wash. Not sure about the educational value, but I can see where the texture would be helpful for some kids in therapy. For my son it is just a toy, but he has a surprising amount of fun goofing around with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this camera.","review":"This camera will cause more headaches than it's worth. Overall the camera's great and that's part of the problem. The picture qualities pretty good (except in dark areas where it's horrible.) The problem is the lack of digital output. If you start learning about video editing and the benefits of the MiniDV format, you'll become excited only to realize that your camcorder doesn't support it. It's the most disheartening thing in the world. What's the point of a digital camera, without the digital output. Did I mention that it's useless in low light situations?"},{"rating":"1","title":"JVC has a lot to answer for here...","review":"First, the positives. This is a solid, stable machine. The optics are decent; it seems to have the right amount of 'bells and whistles' while not being overly cluttered with features that are beyond the need of the average user. It does, however, have one glaring problem...the camcorder's output is analog, not digital. The only place JVC makes note of this fact is in the front of the instruction manual, where they state that while the camera records digitally, the output of the machine is, in fact, analog. I called JVC and was told that only the DVM5 and similar high-end machines would offer digital output. Even with S-video to my Mac, I'm still editing analog video...and I might as well have stuck with VHS-C!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but a trumped-up VHS-C camcorder","review":"We were highly disappointed at this camcorder's inability to present digital output on our TV. Turns out this product is not even MADE to. In fact, since it does not produce digital output, you can't connect it to your PC either. What you're left with is a virtual analog camcorder whose digital output is only viewable on a miniscule LCD screen. In other words, it's nothing but a trumped-up VHS-C camcorder with an price tag that runs $200-$300 more. Noteworthy: this camcorder is a discontinued JVC model. What's disappointing is JVC's lack of mention about the analog output. It's only written in small print deep within the owner's manual. Other things: the light is useless (about as strong as a match), the Power On/Off switch is difficult to use with only your thumb, and it doesn't come with the cable necessary to connect to your TV (per the manual, JVC considers it to be an \\"optional\\" item!). Bottom line: we sent it back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wondful cameracorder","review":"I liked the JVC GR-DVF10's automatic lens cover and basic remote control for VCR or remote recording applications. Its 2.5-inch LCD screen swivels 180 degrees, allowing you to record above your head, put yourself in the video, or let our subjects see themselves as you record. The JVC GR-DVF10 provides a 16x optical and 160x digital zoom--great for getting closeups and recording faraway events.I believe you would like it! It is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This unit was even better than I expected","review":"I purchased my Digital Camcorder while visiting the baseball spring training in Florida. I hadn't really done a lot of research but was an owner on an Hitachi Camcorder and had numerous electronic problems with it. I found this unit easy to use with one review of the instruction manual. I agree with the person from Orlando that the off/on switch is cumbersome but it is something you have to adjust to. The snap shot feature is great as it gives you a great still picture and breaks up the traditional viewing of a long recording. The clarity of digital is superior as I have my old VHS cassettes to compare it to. I'm in the market for JVC's JLIP unit which allows you to interface the camcorder and computer for downloading pictures. I paid 1/2 the price for this unit vs. the Hitachi and would totally recommend it to the everyday family movie taker."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was a little bit to affordable","review":"it did not have the software i wanted it had good picture it was hard to work with too i recomend not getting this but for amatuers it might be an ok choice after all it is affordable but there are better camcorders so dont get in a rush just because of the price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash Point","review":"This was, by far his best novel. The characters were well fleshed out, descriptions of locations were easily visualized and he brought complete closure to all characters and subplots, which he hasn't done before. Lot's of technical jargon, which is lost on this lady, but the guys will love it.Lt. Woods, the lead character was definitely a \\"jock\\" who thought he was above reproach and he was humbled through the set of events he put in motion. The plot was clearly one that could happen (and in some cases SHOULD happen) and he has set the stage for what the U.S. could most probably expect in the future - his word of caution?I have to chuckle at his blatant dislike for the Air Force - but then, this all came from a Navy man!

He's sat at the controlls of an FA-18 Hornet, and slouched in a chair in the Ready Room on the 03 level of a carrier. He's been there, done that and it shows in a gripping tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many trips to the well","review":"Huston's first two books were exciting, however, the concept of using the Constitution as a way to justify military action is being over done. The plot line in this third book is so far out that it might be possible. Frankly if I thought that our Navy pilots were as irresponsible & inept as Huston depicts them, I would petition my Senators & Congressmen to have the Commander In Chief recall all our carriers to the US, discharge all the pilots & their direct commanders & start with a fresh batch! The story rambles so that I found myself skimming a lot of the pages. This would probably been a better 'novella' than a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maggody and the Moonbeams","review":"Did Joan Hess die and it didn't make the news? This book is just not up to her usual hilarious standards. It's as if some one else was writing this book. The Maggody series is one of my favorites, with zany characters and wit on every page. Her writing has always been so cleverly done, but this one leaves so much to be desired. There is not very much that's funny at the beginning of the book, but once Arly leaves Maggody it's downhill from there. Once the characters reach the church camp, this book resembles a not very well written average murder mystery. The segues back to Maggody from time to time are disjointed and not well developed. I really don't know why Ms. Hess even bothers with these little side trips to Maggody. From now on Joan, keep your stories in Maggody with all the old familiar, absured, crazy folks that inhabit this little town. We love you Joan! Come back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonbeams in crises","review":"Chief of Police Arly Hanks is manipulated into serving what amounts to a community service sentence, chaperoning teenagers on what could be the worst assignment of her career.

Included in the party are \\"Mrs. Mayor\\" (the mayor's wife Mrs. Jim Bob), the preacher Brother Verber, and teacher Larry Joe Lambertino.The action really starts when one of the teenages literally stumbles over a corpse, one of the Moonbeam cult, who refuse to cooperate in the investigation. In addition, Arly is being pressured to marry a local law enforcement person, and there are segues back to Maggody to keep us apprised of what Jim Bob is up to in Mrs. Jim Bob's absence.A laugh a minute, if a bit predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder at the Pearly Gates","review":"Sometimes it is hard to keep a long running series feeling fresh and fun, but Joan Hess manages to bring a bit of revitalization to her Maggody series by sending Police Chief Arley Hanks off with some hormone laden teens, the good Brother and Mrs. Jim Bob to Camp Pearly Gates.While Arley tries to ride herd on the cosmetic mad girls' bodies, Mrs. Jim Bob works on their souls and the good Brother works on a bottle of sacramental wine.Meanwhile back in Maggody, Mr. Jim Bob is enjoying his new found freedom with some friends he has made over the internet.Then one of the girls at Camp Pearly Gates stumbles over a body of a local cult member and things begin to get complicated, as Arley says.A fun romp in the woods with the Maggody crew. Actually I have to note that the description of Camp Pearly Gates raised certain childhood memories of church camp-- laced with the scent of mildewed towels and sweaty sneakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting more high falutin'","review":"I have always come to the Maggody stories for light entertainment rather than edification. The jokes were often corny and the characterization crude but the mixture worked. In this one there are a number of highbrow references and Brother Verber reveals a childhood trauma that may account for his character flaws. Even the relatioship between Raz and Marjory is getting more psychologically complex. Where is all this leading? I'll keep reading to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maggody and the Moonbeams","review":"Another Winner! As with all the other books in the Maggody series, I laughed out loud and couldn't stop turning the pages. All the characters are up to their usual antics with some bizarre element, in this case, the Moonbeams. Most of the story takes place at Camp Pearly Gates with the Moonbeam cult and Joan creates a fantastic mental image. The flash backs to the characters in Maggody were disjointed but still funny. I've lived in Northwest Arkansas all my life and I know these Maggody people and places, really!

There is a pervasive meloncholy country vibe throughout however a couple mellow rock tunes thrown in to round out a very solid melodic batch of tunes.

Eagles, etc. etc. with sproadic revivals by REM and Wilco?And aren't the echoes reverberating every single night in half the bars in Boulder and Santa Cruz?Yes. But...Nadine offers such a fresh and sincere serving, with subtle updates and crafty songwriting, that even these tired ears perked up.They keep it midtempo, mostly mellow. Neil Young meets Coldplay, say. Transparent production, honest & uncomplicated arrangements. Simple songs with sly modernisms tucked away, and hooks that catch on the second, not the first, listening.This is a joy, even if you think you've heard it all before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophisticated production, excellent songwriting","review":"Nadine are post-rock in the best sense, mixing elements of all the genres, rock and roll, country, even hip-hop and arriving at something completely unique and compelling. I was reminded of Neil Young, but not just for the high, emotional tenor of adam reichmann's voice, but also for the ambitious and restless energy in this record, searching and yearning for complex answers to complex questions. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Deceptive Title","review":"The content of this book is a series of articles published in various magazines. A true writer's notebook, in my opinion, like a diary, is essentially the writer talking to himself about his ideas and the work that he does to realize his vision into a tangible work.

Brilliant - literally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare but delightful","review":"Okay, Friedrich von Flotow's opera, ALESSANDRO STRADELLA, will never displace the works of Wagner, Weber, or even Otto Nicolai, but it has its distinctive and appealing charms, as evidenced by this delightful air check issued by Gala at an extremely favorable price. Flotow, of course, is much better known though his opera MARTHA, which still holds the stage, if barely (it once was a major repertoire item at the MET).This production, dating from 1977 (Bayerische Rundfunk), features some fine singing by Werner Hollweg in the title roll, and Helen Donath as Leonore. The easy arias, ensembles, and choruses fall nicely on the ear---much of the music is quite hummable, and indeed, Alessandro's famous aria, \\"Jungfrau Maria,\\" continues to be a favorite of lyric tenors. Right now, I must confess, I can't get it out of my mind!In sum, a nice addition to the catalog, well worth the pittance to be charged.

This particular edition is a photographic reproduction of 1558 English language edition of a book first published in Italian in 1551.

I absolutely do not agree with people who say that he WAS Slayer, because he obviously wasn't. True, he was one of the best metal drummers ever, but he wasn't the band. I think of this CD of more of an adjustment period for Slayer. They were still trying to find their sound after a change of band members. DIVINE INTERVENTION kind of reminds me of early Slayer, where they weren't as together sounding as say REIGN IN BLOOD. This is a great CD tho. Highlights are \\"Serenity In Murder\\", \\"Dittohead\\", and \\"Divine Intervention\\". Slayer regained their sound with DIABOLUS IN MUSICA. I would highly recommend that, and this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayer reigns at the hardest","review":"This album proves what I have been trying to tell people for years. Slayer is the only band to take you to the edge and still have enough honor to push you a little more. Since 1986, Slayer has been like an itch you just couldn't stratch. But when you do, ooooh, does that feel good. Many fear and dispise heavy metal (death) music because they think it's evil. But listening and owning all the Slayer albums, I know that they are just four kick ass people you love to express themselves in a way that makes us all say, \\"Damnit. I want more in my life than just the same old shit.\\" Well here you go. But this album because if you don't, you won't know what it's like to experiance the true power of heavy metal music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divinely Intervent","review":"Divine Intervention's production seems dusty, raw, and gritty with merky guitars, rumbling bass, and hammering drums. Slayer take on a different approach writing \\"Divine Intervention\\". The chug guitar deliverance of King and Hanneman, waltzy at times, bring mid-tempo grooving, and shorter, well-stuctured songs.Paul Bostaph filling in for the departed drummer, Dave Lombardo, supplies a new vision in thrash drumming techniques. Bostaph features a different style of playing utilizing more fills and cymbal techniques. Gravitating polyrhythmic drum patterns hold Hanneman, King, and Araya, in a sea of texture and layers. Araya has sincerity and clarity oozing for his vocals. Artwork features a poster-esque fold out, beholding photos of the band, and lyrics: Violence vs. Music.*Killing Fields*Sex.Murder.Art*Fictional Reality*Divine Intervention*SS-3*Serenity in Murder*213"},{"rating":"2","title":"STANDING IN MY KILLIN FIELD!!","review":"cd is FAST thats what people expect from slayer. #1 and 8 are the highlights of the cd but thats hard to say because its all good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ongoing repeatable several times","review":"This album goes so fast that when it starts over you didn't know it because you're still thrashing to it. Reign in Blood really isn't that great to me. It's too short. By the time it starts over on repeat you know you've just heard that song or that song and you're soon sick of it. Show No Mercy is utterly bad to me. Seasons isn't very fast but it's enjoyable like reign in blood and longer. Divine's Fictional reality is hard to not skip but I think that's because late night radio thrash shows play it too much. Must Buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayer Get Heavier.","review":"While not as consistent as Seasons, Divine Intervention is still a great album and very underrated. It's when their music gets heavier and more in the groove metal genre, however DI still has some thrash metal in it but it isn't nu-metal either. It's more of groove metal with a very heavy edge to it. DI is a very fast album with a lot of edge like \\"Dittohead\\" (one of my personal favorites), yet a few parts are slower. Some people consider it a throwback to Reign In Blood which isn't too far off but with more diversity. Dave Lombardo left the band and was replaced by Paul Bostaph, he has a lot of potential considering he's replacing a legend. The drumming skills he has aren't quite as technical but he brings a new sound to Slayer. Lyrically, it's some of their best work to date. Dark but no corny satanic lyrics either. My overall view on Divine Intervention is positive and it's one of the most underrated metal albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayer's finest hour","review":"This is Slayer's most mature work to date. Slowed down interludes and melodic passages balance the faster sections of the album, which are just as fast as their earlier work and much heavier sounding. The riffs here are more varied in style than elsewhere in their discography, and erupt in organic fashion (i.e. growing out of the overrall sound of the songs, rather than coming out of nowhere).Much has been made of Paul Bostaph taking up the drumming duties on this album, replacing the legendary Dave Lombardo. I'm a huge fan of both; if you like Lombardo's work on Reign In Blood, you'll be pleasantly surprised with the drumming on this effort, from the opening percussive assault on Killing Fields to the more subtle(!) later songs such as 213 and Serenity In Murder.If you like your music fast, heavy, AND technically brilliant, you cannot go wrong with this album. A perfect album from the all-time masters of speed. 10 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW YOUR'E STANDING IN MY KILLING FIELD!!!","review":"Right when I listened to Divine Intervention it just punched me in the face, This album kicked my butt. Tom Araya's vocals and Bass Playing just threw me through the wall. Same with King's and Hanneman guitar playing. There was just one thing missing, Lombaro wasn't playing drums, but Bostaph fills that gap greatly. My favorites on this album would have to be Killing Feilds, Dittohead, SS-3, Serenity in Murder and 213."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slayer's downside","review":"This Cd to me just seems bland for some reason. I get bored listening to it. There seems to be nothing that really stands out on it like other Slayer CDs do. Some say Diablous was not their best but i disagree i think this one was not their best effort. There was nothing to get your attention on this one. If all Slayer CDS were like this one i would not listen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slayer at the top of their game!","review":"Despite all the criticism, I must disagree. I think this to be one of Slayer's best works. It is my third favorite Slayer album, next to Reign and South. On this album, the soundwriting is magnifique, and I actually prefer Bostaph to Lombardo, although both are awesome in their own right. Songs like \\"213\\" stray from conventional Slayer, an eerie cut about Jeffrey Dahmer, while \\"Sex. Murder. Art.\\" and \\"Dittohead\\" rock out like the old Slayer thrash, making you look for the mosh pit. People have criticized this one mostly because Bostaph is on it, and the poor production, but if you listen with an open mind, there's great music here. The second most technical Slayer album next to Hell Awaits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best part was intro on first track","review":"I owned a number of Slayer CDs that I'd grown quite fond of, already (Seasons in the Abyss, Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Hell Awaits, Decade of Aggression, etc.) and ran out to buy Divine Intervention as soon as I heard that intro to the first track, at my friend's house. Such a pity that it was the best part of the whole CD!!! I was really let down with this one. I regard it as Metallica's Black album or Sepultura's Chaos A.D. - a sell-out. From those albums on, I have not been interested in any of those bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in thier arena- Metallica whimpers in thier shadow","review":"This alblum represents a new level of Dementia. If you could pick an alblum -and band- to represent heavy-metal in a permanate archive, This is it! Very literate band. Divine Intervention is a turning point for Slayer. From young chasers of evil spirits, These men may have become Evil in the time leading up to this CD.Musicaly tight and drivin by a new drummer they do a clinic on hard core and the EXPLICID LYRICS on this one are so forward you live each scene they paint in your head. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old geezers playing the part","review":"Really nothing more pathetic than watching or listening to 40-something or 50-something geezers playing the same s--t they played when they were 20. Only not as good. Saw old pictures of the Beatles back in 1960 dressed in leather when they played a stripper bar in Germany. Can you picture McCartney and the other 3 staying in leather and rocking out in their 40s or 50s playing the same s--t? Metal should have a retirement age too. The songs are mediocre, sounds OK, but this ain't Reign in blood. Give it up slayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"This is the first Slayer record I ever heard and even though its not as good as their previous 3 cds, this is still reall good music. My biggest gripe is the weird sounding production and inconsistent guitar tone. I read a quote from KK saying that they were moved to 4 different studios or something during the recording process so when it came time for mixing, it was tough to get everything sounding right. Still, the sound is not too bad and the songs are as good as ever. This is probably the bands most technical album as well. Best track is Dittohead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very awsome!","review":"This was one of the first \\"real\\" books that I read. It is a little bit confusing at first, because there are so many characters, but after the first couple of chapters you won't want to put it down!

This is a terrific album and is a great contrast to the big hits of the earlier Southern Harmony... Whats wrong with a band changing up their sound a little. Anyway the album opens with a great song in Under a Mountain. My favorite on the cd is Girl from a Pawnshop. Overall, a great cd and really shows how creative musically the Black Crowes really are. I recommend this to all Black Crowes fans that need something different from the Crowes or just any classic rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"musical genius","review":"For a long time, I thought rock and true good music was gone. This album has restored my faith in music. A must have for any music fan who likes to lay back and enjoy a cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy and annoying!","review":"Hmmm, Black Crowes...well...To me, and obviously to a lot of other people, Black Crowes music is very influenced by Rolling Stones but Stones have something that Black Crowes lack - it takes more than pot, attitude and a slobby approach to be a rock and roll band. Of course they managed to perform one or two great numbers every once in a while, but mostly it's rather boring and the vocals can really annoy you. This release includes NO great tune at all, the only decent one is \\"Just say you're sorry\\". The rest is awful!Once I had four Black Crowes albums. First I sold \\"Amorica\\", and now is this one \\"Three snakes...\\" in the pile for cd's to be sold. That leaves me with \\"The southern harmony...\\" and \\"By your side\\"...for the moment..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add a half when it grows on you.","review":"Still with their ultimate lineup (C. Robinson, R. Robinson, Marc Ford, Steve Gorman, Eddie Harsch and Johnny Colt) intact after making two masterpieces, the Black Crowes made Three Snakes. As such, the playing on the album is top notch again. The feel of the album is a little less aggressive than Amorica, but there are plenty of rockin tunes.This seems to be the \\"grower\\" in the Crowes catalog, where it takes a while for songs to assert themselves. While that's often a more rewarding thing than the opposite (an album that feels immediately familiar, but lacks longevity), the songs do suffer slightly from a lack of strong hooks and come off a little dry at times. The ballads, such as the pretty Girl From a Pawnshop and odd How Much For Your Wings? break away from the pack easiest and all the songs become rewarding in time. This was the third and last album from the band with this lineup, and during that time noone else in rock and roll was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish the Crowes were more respected","review":"The Black Crowes are one of just a handful of true rock and roll bands today. Although a strange album, Three Snakes has a good assortment of songs . A personal highlight is How Much For Your Wings. I would recomend Amorica or Southern Harmony over Three Snakes, but if you have those you have to get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing Effort","review":"Black Crowes are nothing without decent songs. The swagger and feel is there but not the songs. Get \\"Shake\\" and \\"Southern Harmony\\" and end it there. This one and \\"Amorica\\" are downright boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"Kipper's books are excellent, and this one is no exception. It is really cute and my baby has a lot of fun with touching the various creatures and things. The book is full of touch and feel entertainment and nice colorful drawings. It's on par with the Touch and Feel series (Baby Animals, Wild Animals, Farm, etc.) Highly recommended along with all the Kipper books. You simply can not beat a cute puppy for a baby or toddler!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"These covers are well-made, but become a real nuisance in use. I bought them to help protect my graphite shafts during the jostling they endure during a round of golf. If you have steel shafts, covers are unnecessary. Even given my graphite set, the covers were hard to get on and off of the oversized heads (Mizuno) and easy to misplace or lose.I tied them (strings included) in pairs, so I wouldn't have to worry about leaving them all over the course, but they were still a pain to use.I finally removed them altogether and they now occupy my box of golf gadgets that clutter up my garage. I figure if the shafts get too banged up through frequent use (no sweat so far), I'll have an excuse to get new ones or talk my wife into a new set of irons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album","review":"If the lyrics actually meant anything, I'd have to give this album 5 stars. The music is bursting with feeling from the beginning of track one right until the closing piece. This is the peak of a band that really shows off their roots in Southern rock, R and B and other homegrown American styles. The only thing that baffles me is why they didn't let somebody else write the words for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down classic.","review":"I bought this album when it was released in 92'. I find myself putting it in my cd player at least once a week. To think that this album was made in like 2 weeks is mind boggling. They claim that a few of the tracks were first takes!! This is a must buy, you will not be dissapointed. From start to finish. . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE CROWES","review":"This album solidified my love for the Black Crowes. In the past I had been hesitant to get into them too much. But, I think that was because I was basing my judgement on 'Lions', which I didn't care for at the time. This album, however, is 100% solid. There isn't a track I don't like. It works great in a playlist with a lot of Black Keyes, too. I highly recommend it if you're looking to get into the Black Crowes, or if you already have a few of their albums and are looking for another good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bow Down Before The SH&MC","review":"This is simply the best pure rock 'n roll album produced in the last 25 years or so. I cannot recommend this album enough. I had an out of body experience during \\"Thorn In My Pride\\" and I haven't been the same since. You must own this album no matter what kind of music you dig."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Overall Album of the 90's -- Hands Down.","review":"After the 80's ended its decade of nearly 100% trash, I thought I would have to listen to 60's & 70's music forever to get that fist clenching \\"pump\\" of true classic rock. Then this album came around in '92 -- a \\"classic\\" in its own right -- and I don't use this term lightly. While I love the Crowes, I feel that this album is their finest by far. In the context of classic rock overall, I feel that Southern Harmony is the best album (chronologically speaking) since Pink Floyd's, \\"The Wall\\" in 1979, and there has been no album since to touch it. \\"Sometimes Salvation\\" is intense -- or \\"heavy\\" (as the Crowes might describe it) and \\"My Morning Song\\"are two standouts -- but all songs on the album are fantastic. Last two Crowes albums are fair -- I hope they can duplicate the genius of Southern Harmony once again. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This is as close as it comes to perfection. Sound being received that can do so much. Nobody should not want to have listened to these songs millions of times before they go."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CDs of all time!","review":"The Robinson brothers' music is timeless, unique, and absolutely phenomenal!!! I love all The Black Crowes CDs - every single one of them - but this one is at the top of my list. If I had to use only one word to describe this CD, I'd have to say evocative!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another modern Classic","review":"This cd has some of my favorite Crowes tunes on it. I love sometimes salvation. I love the guitar work on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Desert Island Album","review":"If I had to pick one, this would be it. Bought it on a whim and it is AMAZING! These guys put out one of the greatest pure rock n' roll albums of all time in 1992! In the midst of a music scene dominated by Pearl Jam, John Secada, and Mariah Carey, these guys created a true work of rock art. \\"My Morning Song\\" will bring a tear to your eye, as will Sometimes Salvation, and Thorn in My Pride...there isnt a weak spot. Buy It, Buy It, Buy It!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Intro to (and Album Of) the Crowes.","review":"This really isn't much better than \\"Shake Your Money Maker\\", but since sophomore efforts are usually worse than originals, you have to give it credit. Not only does it have a lack of horrid songs (a record for this band), it's also the most soul-oriented album by the Crowes.The album gets high marks for such precious songs as \\"Stng Me\\" \\"Remedy\\" \\"Black Moon Creeping\\" and the Crowes best moment since \\"She Talks to Angels\\", \\"Sometimes Salvation\\". Few low marks come from persistant gospel choir, the urge to end each song with a five second fool-around-with-the-instruments-like-an-orchestra thing, and the usual Crowe flaws. If the band never comes up with a five-star effort, this will remain its triumph.Overall, I'd give it a 92, with an extra 7 points for \\"Sometimes Salvation\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"Great follow up to a great debut.

An interesting find if you can get it for a few dollars (the \\"radio\\" version of \\"Cop Killer\\" is unintentionally hysterical) but not worth collectors prices unless you really believe that early 90's rap/metal crossover is a collectible market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"I bought this in 1999 and am just getting around to reviewing it. It didn't work well in low light so I returned it and bought a different model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly perfect camera","review":"This is my first digital camera and I am very impressed! The picture quality is incredible. I compared images online with several more expensive models and the D620 came out on top. The camera is easy to use and fast, only a tiny delay between shots. I do wish the low-light capability was better. You can't focus or shoot below a certain light level. The other positives far outweigh this shortcoming however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yoga Mat","review":"This yoga mat is nice if you are looking for a larger than average size mat.

I started buying books for my new granddaughter in April. Lots of books, not too many good ones. Fortunately, I found this book. The bright colors, hardboard construction and simple, straightforward style make keeping my grandbaby interested a breeze. She settles right down when I open the pages and let her feel the ribbons - with each page another colored ribbon appears -- teaching her about cause and effect, color and texture. This is one of her favorite books and I only wish there were more books like it.Wanting to read to your child is great, keeping them interested can be a challenge. For babies, books with pages that don't rip, pop-ups that don't tear and bright colors to excite them helps them stay focused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"Adorable and unique!!

The ribbons inside are a very neat effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Show me a rainbow, please","review":"I was first introduced to this book by a Christian preschool teacher who said I would love this book. She was right. This book is awesome! It catches the attention of preschool children because the ribbons on each page build a rainbow by the end of the story! The children were totally engaged in this short, sweet story."},{"rating":"1","title":"More to it than colors","review":"My daughter likes this book, though I change the words when I read it to her. I give the female characters a title (Ms.) to show the respect that the male characters get (they're all referred to as Mr.). I also change the end to make it true; water droplets and sunshine make a rainbow, not colors. The ribbons are a cute idea, but little hands are very tempted to pull them. I prefer other books to teach children colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Makes a Rainbow?","review":"Love the bright colors! My three-year-old nephew wanted to turn the pages to see the rainbow over and over. In fact, the concept is so original I had to run through it myself a few times before even showing it to him.There are many board books on the market, but this one is different and just plain fun. A truly happy book, and sturdy. It will get a lot wear. I would like to see others in a series by the same authors. Let's hope we'll see more by these people."},{"rating":"1","title":"The more I read it, the more it bugs me that....","review":"the male 'friends' are addressed as Mr. ('Mr. Fox') while the female 'friends' in the book are addressed without any similar formality but simply by their 'first' name(Bluebird). It is easy enough for me to change the words as I read it to my children and I DO really love the concept of the ribbons (and am not too bothered by the technical inaccuracies) but my goodness does the sexism make me angry! This is actually the first review I have ever written... perhaps not the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION- RIBBONS ARE HAZARDOUS!!","review":"I loved this book until yesterday- my 19 month-old daughter was looking at books in the same room I was in.. She started crying and ran to me with the book hanging off of her wrist. Two of the ribbons were tightly wrapped around her wrist.. so tightly that I couldn't get my own finger under them or figure out how to unwind them. Luckily I had scissors nearby.. I had to cut the book off of her! I have noticed a discrepancy in the age range for this book on various websites.. Some say appropriate for age one.. I believe the book lists age 3. Regardless, I think it is a potential hazard for any child- toddler or 3 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea but bad science!","review":"This book is a delight for young children to read as the rainbow appears. But it ignores the science of rainbows by merging two distinct colors -- indigo and violet -- into a single purple ribbon. There was no need to do this, and the result is that children learn about rainbows but learn the wrong thing. Why wasn't it made with the correct seven colors versus only six?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Every Child","review":"I teach a class of 2-3 year olds at a preschool, and this book is definately a favorite of my students.

The main characters - Charlotte and Parker and their daughter Gracey - were certainly unusual and likeable at first. I was about a hundred pages in before I realized that this was a very silly book. The emotions of Charlotte and Parker became very contrived, and their relationship was just not worth reading about. The daughter receded more into her make believe world as the book plodded along, and her insanity did not make her a likeable or interesting character, just a schizoid nuisance. I've got about a hundred more pages to go, so I think I'll just have to tough it out.I have now (almost) read all of James W. Hall's books, and all the others merit five stars.

This book made me fall in love with her. Yes, it's long, but once you start, you simply can not stop reading. He tells the events of her life beautifully, speaking as Sieur Louis de Conte, her lifelong friend and companion. Everything from the Fairy Tree to her death is enthralling, and he draws medieval France as it was. France was falling, and Joan saved it. Her intelligance beat that of fifty scholars, yet she never learned to read. She could outwit the priest when she was a young child. She overcame all odds, and led France's army to victory.

As another reviewer said, it is also Dated. It is mostly vehicles the majority of us do not build. Yes the same principles apply, but it does not show anything directly relevant to todays technology or electronics like, for example, DashboardDevices.com sells.To AMAZON's Ad writers: I would have wanted to know, in advance, it was a \\"How To\\" book.

What, exactly, is there to congratulate him for? Writing an utterly pointless, sickening book? Depicting a world full of hate and cruelty, obsessions with destroying beauty and inflicting pain for sexual gratification? Wow, let's give this guy a pat on the back. He deserves a star. I implore anyone not to read this book. The only reason one might want to read it is to explore the furthest extremes of human cruelty.

The ban on Pasolini's film was only lifted in NZ earlier this year (I haven't seen it because none of my local video stores have it). THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM is the most depraved book I have ever read. It's undeniably fascinating though, and incredibly pretentious and poorly written. If you want S&M, coprophagia, necrophilia, bestialily, pedophilia, blasphemy, oozing abscesses, deformity you name it, it's here.

I was interested in the man and the tribulations that he went through in his unusual life. I had heard rumors about his work and decided to read it for myself. This book is a disjointed collection of repetitive depravity and reading it is work rather than enjoyment. If you are into self-flagellation you may enjoy slogging through this book.

A rebel against religious tyranny? Hardly! De Sade didn't care about religion! He wasn't some rebel trying to make the world more free for the masses. He was simply putting his own disturbed fantasies to paper. Half of them people we call insane and are in institutions right now are no where near as mad as this man whom we call a is understood genius! This book is actually written in the form of a list, detailing the daily (repetative) events taken on by a group of perverse people. I do however give him credit for being origional with this mess of a plot. Each time, he does think of some disgusting obsenities no one else would have thought of. But, is that a good thing?

Fine. Just track it down in a bookstore (Boarders sells it), and read a few pages and see for yourself. You won't soon forget the words or the images your imagination conjures up.

He speaks a deep Truth, which is extremely challenging. This book is not for lightweights or those who are looking to become a Christian. It is a book for those people who are fearless in the pursuit of Truth. You must value freedom from deceit more than anything else to fully benefit from this book. Those who are under deceit, and wish to remain that way, should not read this book. This book will tear apart deceit and reveal the demons who rest inside of it.

The only bad thing about this book is the authors need to display his extensive vocabulary, but after a few chapters he relaxes and you don't need a dictionary to read it(Although it might help).

This episode, \\"Destination Royston Vasey\\", is your introduction to this notorious monster. If you like conventional American sitcom humor, this series ain't for you.

The production, sound quality and lighting are top notch. Charlie's playing really smokes, and his guitar sounds great. I also have his other live DVD with the full band, and I'm glad I bought this as well. There are some solo guitar performances on the other DVD, but these are improvised in new way that makes it quite educational when he performs a song again, such as \\"Stars Fell on Alabama\\". Most of the tunes are new, and they are all inspiring. Charlie varies his sound throughout, sometimes using guitar effects, and other times using a mechanical mute on the strings, always coming up with great sounds and improvisations.

It was only :30 seconds of music that was recorded and they asked Oleta to sing on it. I think we need to start a writing/email campaign to FlyteTyme Productions and have them release this song.

Diner Dash came out with two other games after the first one because of its success. This game, Roller Rush was not a success, that is why MSN Games is offering it for $9.99 and not $19.99 like all the other games.

Normally I buy 3 or 4 of the biggest Costco sized bags but this time I just go a normal sized organic bag. This is not good potting soil. It has a really high percentage of shredded wood in it. Wood eats nitrogen from the soil as it composts to become soil. This potting soil will sacrifice my plants while it transforms into GARDEN SOIL (too much compost and not light enough to be potting soil even after all the wood degrades).

Tried buying at a different location - SAME PROBLEM! I love the idea of an organic soil. But if that includes infestation of bugs in the house, it's a terrible idea! It seems others are having the same issue - perhaps they can fix this problem someday. What a waste of money, though. I'm disappointed I bought it.

Double stitched seams with several rivets to add strength. My favorite feature is the metal clip - you can clip it pretty much anywhere (I keep it clipped to my Bucket Boss tool organizer, but it also clips easily to a pocket, belt, etc.). Makes it much easier to use.It's stiff, so it takes a while for the leather to stretch out to accommodate the knife.

The movie was written by Matthew Bright, who wrote \\"Freeway\\" a few years earlier, so he has talent as well. Included are Drew Barrymore, Ione Skye and a couple other notable names, however, they display no real talents here.I guess the dialog is the weakest link.

Jon Sconadatto's vocals soar on some great songs like the lead-off track, \\"Blew\\" - and you really get thrown right into the passion and emotion of the lyrics countered with a great melody in songs like \\"More Than This\\" and \\"Delicious Sunshine\\".

It doesn't help that she begins the first chapter by giving us a detailed description of the daily activities of her cat. After tolerating about two and a half minutes of this, I skipped to the next track. That was about 9/11. I don't have any fear or anxieties about terrorism so I skipped to the next track.

Many of the reviewers complain that the author's advice was \\"bad\\". I think it's fair to keep in mind the book was published in the UK so standards are going to be different. Just read up for the latest guidelines. I found it refreshing to have a positive spin on formula fed babies. Why is that when it comes to breastfed vs formula fed, this is where parents draw the line on being understanding, compasionate or plain minding their own business?Back to the book, \\"Days out cakes\\" are great. Pasta sauce with a carrot base is also good. This is a cook book not a parenting bible!I can see that it might be over the top cooking for kids but cooking is our thing so that's why we liked it so much.

She has a mushroom cream sauce that contains no salt! Of course toddlers don't need a lot of salt but it does add to the taste of a recipe by bringing out the flavors of the other ingredients. The fish cakes fall apart and are also bland bland bland. She seems to think potatoes in every dish make it quite grand.You can find a better overnight oatmeal recipe in Ruth Yabon's book.And the quantities she has things in. who cooks something in 2 T of water? Who serves 1 tablespoon of pasta to a 15 month old? What 15 month old eats that little amount of food?It's as if she randomly decides, hey, I can write a cookbook.

While that is certainly a valid option, the option of expressing breastmilk while at work should have also been presented in equal light.I am so dissapointed in this book, that I am returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes!","review":"First let me say that there are MANY great sections on nutrition and how to feed your baby/toddler well with wonderful organic foods. Also, the recipes are excellent and my son has enjoyed almost all of the dishes I have made from this book. In some cases the portion sizes and methods are a bit impractical, but she includes prep/cook times and serving suggestions.The first recipe I decided to make for my son was a pasta dish (I bought this book when he was over a year old), and when I looked at the ingredients I realized it was for a SINGLE serving (for a 10 month old). So,I have just decided to make larger portions and freeze some of the leftovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but disapointing","review":"I was excited to get this book and try the recipes.

Within six months it refused to acknowledge ink in the cartridges - after buying three new cartridges. Canon's tech support was essentially useless, although he did admit it was a problem that had come up before.So, my printer is useless, the one for our office did the same thing two months later, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that my friend doesn't show up at my door with another broken printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon?

It would go through all the motions, and even replacing the ink tank and print head did not fix it. Canon's advice was to take it to a service center, which led me to the \\"it's cheaper to buy a new one than to fix it\\" situation.

Now it has several gaps or spaces between the characters that make blank lines across the page, with both the color and black ink.

I've replaced the print head twice at $50.00 a head hoping that's all that was wrong, but with no change.

So of course I bought her second album straightway.This album features some really good tracks, like 'That Thing' and 'Can't Have You' and of course 'Imagine' with a new, funk sound. But some of the slower songs really let Shola down - songs like 'Superficial Fantasy' don't possess any kind of sparkle to make them really memorable. Shola's voice is up to scratch, but the production of this album isn't. However, for some nice background music this album is great. Just a few songs on the album let it down, with a boring tune and frankly terrible music. Shola's voice is sweet as always.In conclusion - an album that was obviously rushed, and you can hear it. A good CD - but not a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for new therapists","review":"I bought three other guides to starting a private practice and this one outshines them all.

There are lots of missteps on here, Mariah Carey over Mobb Deep's Shook Ones Pt. 2 beat, Missy Elliot's freestyle over Wu-Tang's Triumph completely ruins the beat, DMX's freestyle ruins the Give up the Goods beat by Mobb Deep. Ice Cube doesn't even drop a verse on the Mack 10 freestyle, he just talks in the beginning of the freestyle. Funkmaster Flex gathered all of these big hip hop stars and didn't milk them for his worth, he also cuts [bad] hip hop and r&b songs together in between.

And as for the programmable buttons-this is one of my biggest gripes-two of the four programmable buttons (specifically R1 and L1) are already supposed to be important buttons in gameplay-R1 is Force Push and L1 is Saber Block.

The sound is terribly edited, the image is very bad and the performance is very bad as well!Everything looks like Papa Wemba didn't see the video before being released, otherwise I bet he had done something better. There is no subtitles... I think Papa Wemba missed a great opportunity to show to the international community his great talent as singer and performer.

We are sending this humidifier back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for about 2 years","review":"It worked great for about 2 years and then stopped working... it still turns on but wont kick anything out. Overall, not satisfied. Who want's to deal with returning it? I tossed it in the trash, I'll be buying another Humidifier NOT of the Sunpentown name brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is so unreliable","review":"Today, is the third time I went to Sunpentown Product Support Center in the city of industry for the replacement of the nebulizer in two years.Although they only charged me $15.00 but the quality sucks.The golden plating on the nebulizer starts to have bubbles underneath. This means just about two to three days, it will malfunction. Do they perform life cycle test during design stage?Bad design, bad plating.I only use purified water so there is no deposit in the unit but it doesn't help.This unit has been discontinued.Shame on Sunpentown."},{"rating":"1","title":"First device great, second one not so much. Bad customer service.","review":"This cold mist humidifier is one of the best humidifiers we purchased. No filters to clean, straight-forward use, and generally super-quiet. We have the first one since about 5 years, and no problems whatsoever. The second unit we purchased last fall. About 4 weeks into the operation, the fan started to make a louder noise, typical for a failing bearing. Any attempt of contacting Sunpentown's service department was unsuccessful. One of the 4 service numbers printed on the device connects to a private phone number, it seems, and the other numbers are either not picked up, or when leaving a message, the call is not returned. I have never reached a live person. So make sure you have good warranty where you don't have to contact Sunpentown for service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humidifier","review":"Unit performs well, We had a problem after about 15 days with LOW output. After contacting the manufacturer, the base unit was replaced. The customer service experience with Sunpentown was very good. Recommendation is positive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working and was hard to clean","review":"Started out great for the money(no humidistat but nice-sized tank, simple controls etc.). Was able to maintain a comfortable humidity level with a fill up every 1-2 days depending on the outside temperature. Difficult to reach all the nooks and crannies to clean and gasket on filler kept falling into tank during fill. Now, after 1/2 a heating season of use, it is barely working at all(unfortunately I tossed the box). I would spend more and get a different unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Humidifier","review":"This is a good humidifier. It runs very silently so that you hardly notice it's even on. It was able to improve the humidity level in my room considerably, from less than 20% to over 40%. Low maintenance is a big Plus! There is no filter, so all you need to worry about is cleaning the machine once in a while, especially before storing it.The only negative comment I have is that the opening of the Tanks is at the bottom. You have to unscrew a seal, fill in water, then screw the seal back on. This might cause trouble once the seal starts leaking. (It might be better if the tank had its opening at the top, instead of the bottom)Other than that, this is a very good product and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alarm is a killer","review":"The low water alarm sounds like a fire alarm, it wakes you from sleep in an extreme panic! It is terrible and you cannot disable it. I of course did disable the alarm by turning off the low water sensor (with glue). Then, of course, the machine got low and now isn't working at all (burned out). That of course is my fault for disabling it but it was also not usable with the alarm because it honestly would wake my neighbors and make my cats incontinent with fear. Now I am out $50 because of a stupid alarm feature. Without this feature, the machine would be good as it is very quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a year","review":"This unit started out working fine. It was quiet and sent out an adequate amount of moisture ... although you NEVER want this thing to run dry. The alarm is a true pain in the neck. After a few months, the gasket around the refill opening on the bottom worked loose and started to leak. After one winter's use, the unit started to become noisy and produce less moisture, even after regular, gentle cleaning. I cleaned and stored it for the Summer months, and it worked for about a month this Winter after coming out of storage. Then it completely stopped working. For this amount of money, I expect much better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Worked well for the first 6 months, then stopped working entirely.Not worth the $50+ I spent.This is the second Sunpentown product I purchased that broke soon after purchase.Made in China; breaks in USA.Stay away from Sunpentown products."},{"rating":"1","title":"keeping dry","review":"I purchased this product that ultrasonicaly vaporizes water it is suppose to be completely quite, however it isn't. It sounds like a fan out of balance. Save your money, look for something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Humidifier but our first one had faulty switch.","review":"We noticed the difference in air quality, my boyfriend's snoring, my nose bleeds and dry skin right away. The tank is large and lasts for several days depending what level you run it on. Haven't noticed any of the \\"white dust\\" that I read about in some reviews, which supposedly is produced because there is no filter. I personally love that there is no filter to clean or replace.HOWEVER, couldn't give this 5 stars because after about 6 weeks of use the on/off switch would no longer remained pushed in so it wouldn't run. I had to send back to Amazon, who was fabulously helpful and got a new one to me right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troublesome humidifier","review":"Output good and just a little noisier than my last ultrasonic which was a refurbished Bionare. Water gets slimy within a week, though, and cleaning thoroughly is difficult due to nooks and crannies on unit. Now unit has stopped working after only 3 months. It DID keep the room, 12 x 18, well humidified while it worked, though,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving","review":"Initially I thought the SU-2000 was great, except for filling. After a few days of use, I had white dust all over the room, plus adjacent rooms. I know it says I can use distilled water, however this increases my operating cost and makes filling a two person job (one to hold the tank and one to pour in the distilled water. Even without the distilled water, filling is a difficult job. A balancing act to fill the inverted tank and keep level until securely capped. There must be better humidifiers without these drawbacks. Certainly not the appliance for a little old lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well for 2 months then got VERY noisy","review":"Like several other reviews here, I experienced a problem with the fan. The unit worked like a charm for a couple of months, was silent, very easy to clean and refill. But then, the fan started rattling. I didn't keep the box due to a move so I can't do anything as far as a return. I opened the unit to see how I could quiet the fan but the mechanism itself is rattling. Basically, it is now useless because at night, all you can hear is something that sounds like a loose rattle. In fact it's so loud, I am sure the neighbor can hear something through the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing sucks!!!","review":"1) Sound level doesn't compare to my warm mist humidifier which broke when it fell off the table. It's pretty loud with the fan and the constant bubbling of water splashing about.2) It will get your floor/carpet wet. For one thing, no steam/moisture comes out if you set it on the lower levels. But, if you turn up the power, your floor is going to be soaking wet. So, I had to put it high off the floor to minimize that problem.3) The stupid fan broke after one season!!! I have to toss it in the trash now, completely useless.4) I thought \\"ultrasonic\\" meant it didn't need a fan like the regular cool mist humidifiers. They never mention that it has a constant loud fan in there to push out the little water droplets made by the ultrasonic generator. This is nothing but a gimmick. Stick to the warm mist humidifier. They are whisper silent and keep the room nice a warm because of the heat. Ultrasonic leaves the room feeling cold and drafty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than several others.....","review":"After burning through three other humidifiers, we tried the Sunpentown. So far, so good - in fact, we ran it for over a month - every night - in our bedroom, and not only was it very quiet, but it didn't leak, sputter, spit or die. High praise indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off Beat!","review":"Tony never goes to the beat of the music when counting. Like the music was added after taping. Very annoying. When doing leg lifts, he works one leg for 120 seconds then the other for 150 seconds. It is like no one proofed this video! The real killer is during the cool down/stretch when he looks right in the camera and says, \\"Do you feel pretty? You should\\". Cracked me up! Try another tape for legs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Owned BJC-80 since 1997 and still going!!!!","review":"Just had to order a new cartridge holder for the color ink, but it is still going strong.

Would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"works just fine","review":"I read a couple of the reviews here, and was honestly a little doubtful, if I should really purchase this printer. I did anyway, because I couldn't resist the bargain. I have to say, it works perfectly. Didn't make strange noises, or give up on me. I am very happy with it. The print quality is not excellent, as to be expected from a tiny little machine like this, so I don't print my resumes with it, but for stuff on the go, it's perfect.

Last year I purchased two of these and both stopped functioning within a month. In both cases was a mechanical problem where motor and drive mechanism which moved print head stopped functioning properly....would try to print but print head stayed stuck in start up position.Like most people who travel enough to need a portable printer I am too busy to stay on hold for 20 minutes on help line or argue with someone at Staples why I no longer have box on something I want to return or exchange.I would steer clear of this one....however for what little time it did work it does print very good quality. It is light, very compact and frankly I thought print speed was more than acceptable. Only problem was occasional jam on feed ....if it would actually work would be a fantastic piece of equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I bought this printer because I travel a lot. The first time I used it, it printed only half a page. After repeated requests for help, I got it to print --- quit working almost exactly to the date that the warranty ran out. Canon not helpful at all. I am looking for another portable printer but it will not be a Canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sade should not release live CD's","review":"Even though she is one of my favorites, a live CD does her injustice. Can't really get the true feeling of her voice and songs with all of the clapping and misc noise in the background. I was very, very disappointed. Gave it away to the first person who would take it and went back to all of my Sade studio CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy effort - waste of time","review":"What a shocking recording. Having seen Sade in concert once, and watched a couple of video recordings I know her bands (in the past) can really play. But this is a few years on now, and its really stale. Live recordings need to be recorded really well to make them worthwhile and this is flat as a pancake. The audience sound levels are so annoying - it wrecks the CD for me. If you wanna try a live album worth the purchase, try Eryka Badu ... now we are talking.Sade records next to nothing. When she does release something expectations are high. This is pure lazyness, and cashing in on the past.Bin it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOUND ENGINEER MISSING IN ACTION","review":"I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM WIYH CROWD NOISE ON LIVE CD'S. ITS EITHER WAY TOO MUCH,AS IN THIS CASE , OR NON EXISTANT ON OTHER CD'S. IT SEEMS AS IF THE SOUND ENGINEER AND THE PRODUCER CANT FIND A MIDDLE GROUND. THE CHEERS ON THIS CD ARE, IN MY OPINION, ARE WAY OVER THE TOP. I THINK SADE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SERVED RECORDING IN A SMALLER VENUE.IT SOUNDS AS IF SHE WAS THE SECOND COMING OF THE BEATLES LIVE.THE RECORDING ITSELF IS VERY GOOD HOWEVER IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CROWD NOISE WAS ADDED LATER. IVE BEEN TO OVER 300 CONCERTS AND HAVE NEVER HEARD THE CROWD FADE IN AND OUT ON CUE. BUY THE DVD IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHY THE CROWD MAKES NOISE.TO HEAR THE CROWD ERUPT IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONG MAKES NO SENSE ON THE CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely 'live', live CD ..... yawn","review":"Sade has done some nice stuff, and I saw her play live 10 years ago, the band really cooked. This live album is a real let down. The recording is dire quality, and the crowd noise at the start of each song is impossibly irritating and loud. The playlist is very down beat, with only a few lively tracks. All in all, possibly the worst live CD I have ever heard. For someone who only releases new recordings infrequently this should have been a lot more special. 'Must try harder' Sade."},{"rating":"2","title":"An experience not to be forgotten","review":"Sade's Lover's Rock tour was nearly a religious experience. Never before at a concert had I felt such comraderie between concert-goers. We laughed and joked with our neighbors, were tolerant of exhuberent fans, and sang along with every nuance and subtle melody that Sade gave us. Her rendition of 'Is It a Crime' was indescribable, except that at its end my girlfriend was nearly in tears (as was I). I said at that moment that if someone had offered me a CD of her live version of that song alone, I would have bought for everything in my checking account at the time. Who knew that Sade was listening? This CD is excellent, it helps me recreate the moment, and it reaffirms my belief that Sade is one of the greatest vocalists of our time. I appreciate her giving us (those who attended and those who did not) a front-row seat on this tour. If ten stars were available, I would give it eleven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try...","review":"This is an unfortunate attempt to stage the beautiful studio recordings of Sade and her collaborators on a \\"live\\" stage. Never a strong live singer and a rather shy performer, there is no reason for anybody to go to a live concert or buy this album, as most of the tracks are perfect copies of the studio originals (incl. soundeffects) and add nothing new. This does not mean that this is not beautiful music, on the contrary, but just not suitable for a live concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIVE reaffirms the subtle power of Sade","review":"After an eight year absence, Sade returned in 2000 with one of that years' true musical triumphs and arguably her best effort yet, LOVERS ROCK. Now comes this live disc culled from her recent concert tour, and with it the affirmation that Sade remains one of the most sublime and original artists to surface in the last two decades. Possessing one of the most exquisite vocal instruments in today's musical landscape, she glides gorgeously through this too short thirteen song cycle, punctuated by a rock-tinged take on 'Paradise' and first-rate readings of such classics as 'Kiss of Life' and 'No Ordinary Love'. Those fawning over current it-girl Alicia Keys will question what the fuss is all about once they give this record a spin. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Sade release. Get 'Best of' Instead","review":"I listened to most of this once. It's awful. There are two minutes of audience cheering for most songs, then the drummer starts the beat for 90 seconds. Then they play the song, and it's recorded in an acoustically-poor arena. I bought this because all the great Sade songs are on it. But these versions aren't good. Get 'Best of Sade'. It's much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful performance, RUINED!!!","review":"Let me first preface this by saying that I adore Sade's music. When I purchased the live CD, I certainly expected there to be some crowd noise, but this CD is ruined by an audience that will not shut up. Rather than a respectful, appreciative audience these morons scream, hoot and holler through entire songs...often right over the quietest parts of songs. Sade cannot take a breath without some idiot screaming. While listening, you literally cannot count to 10 without loud hoots, and screams. To make matters worse, these sounds were intentionally mixed in through the house microphones. That's why they are so loud and intrusive. Beautiful performances ruined by Rednecks who thought they were at the tractor pull. Save your money, The label should remix and re-release this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sade: smooth operator onstage.","review":"Not too many folks would think that Sade has a commanding presence in concert, but this pretty good live disc shows that she can hold her own in front of the mike. The track listing is rather similar to the show I attended in Chicago last year, and the bulk of the songs are from her last CD, \\"Lover's Rock.\\" The most compelling of these songs is her rendition of \\"Somebody Already Broke My Heart,\\" in which she warns a new partner not to mistreat her the way her prior lovers did. Of course, there are also the requisite singles: \\"Smooth Operator,\\" \\"Your Love is King,\\" and \\"Sweetest Taboo.\\" Live discs don't always appeal to me, but \\"Lovers Live\\" is a solid release that comes with my recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovers Live...","review":"Normally, I don't enjoy \\"live\\" albums due to the fact that the audience \\"gets in the way\\" of the music. But, still, I was pleased with the effort that Sade and her band put out. A very well done, well crafted album. Obviously, she gave the audience their money's worth, and they appreciated her effort. So do I!! The only reason why I didn't give this album five stars was the fact that she left out some very key hits from her early work that should have been included: \\"Hang on to your love, Your love is King(among others)\\" Still, it gets Four Stars!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's On!!!!","review":"If you're not a Sade fan, you will be once you listen to this scintillating digest of the west coast chapter of their 2001 tour. If you happened to see her performance, as I did at Madison Square Garden, relive that opening drum beat that ushers the plaintive cry of Stuart Matthewman's guitar serving as the intro to \\"Cherish the Day\\". It goes on like this. Crisp musical presentation, with the crowd energy oozing through, enough to hear and feel but not disturb -- you're there! Even though you've heard the songs before, you hear them anew. You immediately identify that songs sound - not different - but tweaked to perfection. Hey catch, the end of \\"Somebody Already Broke My Heart\\". Pleasant little treat, there. And when they play \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\", listen to the crowd. They improvise a cool little chorus of their own.You have got to pick this up!!!! Can't wait 'til the DVD drops. Sade, always en vogue. Timeless. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Sade, Hate the Live CD","review":"The whole point of seeing an artist live is to go beyond the studio recording. If you want to hear it exactly as it is on the CD, then just stay at home and listen to the CD. I was very disappointed to hear very little that was new or different from the original recordings. Plus, the crowd noise does seem excessive. I could have done without this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lover's Live First Listen","review":"This is another example of the great talent of this artist. Just as she did during the Lover's Live tour she gives her all on this recording. Although one does not get the thrill of being present, this is a great effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful; truly a gift to the ages.","review":"This recording of centurie old music wonderfully recreates the respect and awe the orginal composers must have felt when they wrote. Truly a meeting of old and new."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD sounds ancient and beautiful.","review":"When I listen to this CD I can just picture the native people of Mexico, Mexican and Indian, sitting in the church hearing this music without the \\"background noise\\" we have as a constant in our lives today. I enjoyed the mixing of Mexican and Indian tonalities on this recording. The music is well done technically by the San Antoino Vocal Arts Ensemble (SAVAE). They have recreated instruments similar to those used at the time of the original writing of this music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inauthentic voices, language dispappoint","review":"SAVAE is to be recognized for its valuable work in attempting to bring back to life the lost art of the newly converted Indians of mesoamerica. I had expected to love this recording, but I must report that my hope has turned to disappointment. My first disappointment came with being unable to get past the embarrassingly awkward Anglo pronunciation of the performers. My second disappointment was with the dispassionate voices. I had hoped to get a glimpse of the spiritual passion of indigenous persons who, even today, walk kneeling 2 miles up a mountainside to worship the Virgin of Guadalupe. I wanted to hear from the people who voluntarily sacrificed themselves on pyramids to Huitzilipochtli, the hummingbird god. The delicately meditative and polished voices of SAVAE have much to offer, but they failed to convince me that this was the music of the indiginous people I have come to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a shame...","review":"Que pena! This could have been a triumph, were it not for the unbelievably poor pronunciation of the Spanish and Nahuatl languages. Though I agree somewhat with other reviewers about the lack of passion, frankly, this is so trumped by the pronunciation issue that I really couldn't get past it. The voices are good but not outstanding (the arrangements are great)and so it really needs/needed authenticity. Linda Rondstadt's Canciones de mi Padres is one of my favorite recordings of all time, and she does not speak Spanish (though she was certainly familiar with the rhythms and culture, as you would think these folks from Texas are.) Anyway, close but no cigar."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST ROCK BAND -- EVER!","review":"Words cannot describe how awesome BON JOVI is!!!

I thought this CD was great. I've been a fan of the boys from Jersey since the 80s, and enjoyed this cd as much or more as any of their past work. If you're not a fan, you probably won't change you mind, because their sound is still true to its roots. But if you are a fan, crank it up, rock on, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have A Nice Day","review":"Overall this is a pretty good album from Bon Jovi.

They have re-found their sound and they are back on the path to hit after hit. \\"Have a nice day\\" and the two versions of \\"You can't go back\\" are true chart busters. Buy this one now because it will be a classic in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wee bit dissapointing","review":"If you're looking for a bunch of Bon Jovi rock songs, then this album is for you. Unfortunately, their creativity has been waning since Crush and the most original song on the album is 'Who Says You Can't Go Home,' which I enjoed, but it is not great.As has been mentioned before, one of the band's greatest strengths is Richie Sambora. This album does best to under-utilize him, and it hurts the album.For pretty much every song on the album, you can find an older song that is very similar, and better done. Crush had a handful of unique songs, It's My Life at the time, Next 100 years, etc. Bounce less so, and this to the extreme. It's worth getting if you really love Bon Jovi, but it is nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT REALLY A NICE DAY","review":"SI QUIERES CAER EN EL ABURRIMIENTO TOTAL O DORMIR UNA SERPIENTE COBRA COMPRA YA ESTE ALBUM.

You know this album will deliver as soon as you see their mischievous red \\"smirk\\" on the cover ...And you will not be disappointed! \\"Have a Nice Day\\" combines Bon Jovi's signature style of catchy pop-metal rockers and power ballads with an attitude that makes the typical alt-rock band of today seem polite.

This CD sucks. Real bad.\\"Have a Nice Day,\\" is the same song as \\"It's My Life\\" with different lyrics. And I'm glad they give a nod to Dylan on this album because Bob Jovi's songwriting talent is about as good as Britney Spears. (Yes, Britney did try to write a song once.) This album did get a good review from Rolling Stone, however, but that should come as no suprise because Jon Bon Jovi's a serious Bush hater. Rolling Stone has a habit of giving mediocre actors and musicians far more artistic credit than they desereve because of their leftist politics. I'm sure if they ever compile a list of the greatest actors of all time Mike Farrell will be in the top ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happend?","review":"I am a huge fan of a lot Bon Jovi's earlier albums like slippery when wet, but when I heard this album I was wondering how once a really decent band that had great songs like 'livin on a prayer' could make something like this. The only reason I bought this was for the song 'Have A Nice Day' once I heard them preform it on Oprah. Nothing on this album is catchy or enjoyable except for the one song 'Have A Nice Day'. This album absolutly is junk, and I dont understand why people are giving it good reviews, they must be a hard-core Bon Jovi fan and be loyal to everything they do because this is absolute trash!! Dont waste your hard earned cash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I really like the song \\"Have A Nice Day\\" which is quite catchy but no other songs on the album really stand out in my opinion.

Anyone who awards this album 5 stars must be a Bon Jovi fanboy or more likely a fangirl. 'Nuff said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love it!","review":"This album is awesome and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone. I mean, this album is just great, from Have a nice Day to Welcome to whereever you are to who says you cant go home, and all the way to story of my life, it keeps you listening because jon and the boys really connect with you by recognizing situations that people may be in that they arent, they really do a good job at reaching everybody in someway with every single song.

But somehow, if u listen to their older, pre-90's stuff, u'll see the difference.for me personally, i just think that this album is too much like everything else on the radios today. every song in it sounds the same to my ears i don't know if its just me or what...but actually i'm a little disappointed in this album.what i recommend is, go buy \\"slippery went wet\\" and \\"new jersey\\" first. borrow this \\"have a nice day\\" cd from library or a friend and download a few songs from it. Not every song on this album is worth the money. actually about 1/4 of it doesn't. but don't get me wrong, bon jovi is a fantastic group and deserves all the credits but this is just not their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy!!","review":"Bon Jovi's new cd \\"Have A Nice Day\\" is a premiere cd for the New Jersey rockers.All the songs fit together on the cd and help it to flow along. When you put it in and start with the lead single \\"Have A Nice Day\\" before you know it, you're at the 13th song of \\"Who Says You Can't Go Home\\", the duet with Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland. When that happens, you'll push play again.Bon Jovi do not disappoint their fans with this latest cd. The songs are all upbeat and not a ballad to slow down the pace. A nice change.Songs that standout are: Complicated, Last Man Standing & Welcome to Where Ever You Are.Of course, all fans are different....so those songs will vary.To the Bon Jovi fans or the non-Bon Jovi fans on the fence about this cd...BUY IT. It will not disappoint and you will find yourself listening to it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Much....","review":"For any long time fan of Bon Jovi that enjoyed their anthem style rock, this album will surely disappoint. Not that Bon Jovi was ever really hard rock, but Ritchie sure knew how to play the guitar! Now it seems that they want to cover up his playing. Like someone else said, any studio player could play this stuff. There is very little riffness here. Have A Nice Day is a good song on it's own merit, but still does not rate with the many classics that fans of their original music will appreciate. Most of these songs sound like they belong to Oasis or the Backstreet Boys, not one of the greatest ROCK bands of the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lullaby","review":"My 2 year old son loves Bon Jovi especially the song with Jennifer Nettles. It is his lullaby every night. (not Barney or Sesame Street) He listens to Bon Jovi for hours on the CD and DVD Crush, in the house and in the car. I do not know any other two year old who enjoys Bon Jovi like he does. He is his #1 FAN!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi is TIMELESS","review":"I loved Bon Jovi as a teenager, and now I have teenage daughters who love Bon Jovi too. It's amazing that a band can stretch across generations. Bon Jovi is Bon Jovi. If you are expecting something else, don't buy this cd, but if you are a true Bon Jovi fan, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interesting at all...","review":"With the exception of the title track, \\"Have a Nice Day\\", this CD is very disappointing. After multiple listenings, each song tends to sounds the same and offers nothing memorable. After hearing the first song on the radio, I became excited that this album was going to rock. It even gave credence to some the pre-release comments I read about the album. About six months ago, I read a comment on a web site that quoted Jon Bon Jovi as saying this album was a throw back to the guitar days of old...a really heavy guitar album. It is quite the contrary. Richie Sambora's guitar work is uninteresting and does not showcase his talents in any way. I admit, I have a bias to guitar-oriented rock that was prevalent in the late 80's. Bon Jovi's prior album, Bounce, was a much better offering, song wise and guitar wise. If you are a guitar player looking for something along the lines of an updated Slippery When Wet or New Jersey, then this is not for you. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"I have been a BON JOVI fan since I first got into music. I have been in LOVE with them for decades. I have all their albums, some I have enjoyed more than others. I have been to all their concerts, since I was allowed.This CD is one of their bests. All but two songs are really amazing. The two I don't personally like are Last Cigarette and Bells of Freedom, I haven't gotten quite into them yet. Have a Nice Day, Welcome to wherever you are are 2 of my faves.This band has stood the test of time, and this CD proves they are only getting better with time. Amazing.Listen to the words, enjoy the music and dance.You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled Riffs and Hooks maketh not an album","review":"If there's one thing I've noticed about Bon Jovi is that their songwriting has suffered big time since Keep the Faith. They seem to be recycling their riffs and vocal melodies since the These Days album onwards. Crush seemed like the nadir of Bon Jovi compositions when it first came out, but I must say now, Have a Nice Day contains the worst songs Bon Jovi ever penned. I think it's time for Bon Jovi to hangs up their boots and bid the music industry \\"good day\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeeeeeeek!","review":"Well...where do I start.My favourite track has to be \\"Unbreakable\\" for its crunching guitar riff and the lyrics are reasonable.\\"Who says you can't go home\\" It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. It's alright. It does well for all intended purposes...selling the album. Nice song.\\"Have a nice day\\" Meh. Not very interesting to be honest.\\"Last Man Standing\\" Oh dear oh dear. How hypocritical. \\"Stuff your digital downloads\\". So cliché. Also, a bit hypocritical of Jon Bon Jovi, who told us to \\"Download our latest song and make it number one for only 1.50\\". This song sucks. Really, really badly.Two stars for the fantastic guitar solos. The music is bad. The lyrics are bad. If you want descriptive, delicious music, get \\"Cross Road\\" and listen to \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\". That is an example of Bon Jovi's potential. Compare this album with that song, and you will see which one rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to retire","review":"I can't believe this band is still together because their music was never any good in the first place. I know so many people who are such huge fans of this band, and I can't figure out why anybody would want to listen to these guys because their music is so dull. Bon Jovi stunk from Day 1, their music was NEVER worth a dam. They stunk in the 80s, they stunk in the 90s, and they stink now. Bon Jovi is the kind of band where you can just take their record and throw it in the garbage.The only reason these guys got back together is because they just needed the quick cash to help pay off their debts. To their credit, at least they still have some fans left who would pay top dollars to see them perform live."},{"rating":"1","title":"No much to like here","review":"If you like Bon Jovi this is a must for you. However, for most of us we can live without it. 15 years ago this would have been less than progressive. Now, it will not make a dent in the music scene. Check out the song with Jennifer Nettles of Sugarland. That would be the best song."},{"rating":"1","title":"C-Sides at best...","review":"Last Man Standing would have had hope except they reworked the song. The better version was on the box set. Last Cigarette, Novocaine, Bells of Freedom, Who Says You Can't Go Home, all very psuedo-pop tunes. This sounds more like Tom Petty or the Wall Flowers. No punch at all. Have a Nice Day is a 3rd rate anthem. This album is just as lousy as This Left Feels Right. Bounce & Crush had better songs on them than this effort. Since Crush, their album sales have been slipping. It's great that this album is number 1 in Scandinavia & Japan, but when was the last time either place cranked out a great band of their own? It's still ok to do straight-forward rock & roll. Don't let today's radio tell you differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"bon jovi attempt pop-punk","review":"if \\"the all american rejects\\" decided to make a pop-punk record for the over 30 crowd, it would probably sound like \\"have a nice day\\". hell, one of the songs even sounds excatly like \\"dirty little secret\\" by TAAR. I know that with the success of crap bands like good charlotte and green day, and solo artists like avril lavine, everyone wants to do pop-punk, but that just isn't bon jovi. Have a nice day makes you wonder if Bon jovi will ever rock out again like they used to. meanwhile, i'd suggest passing on \\"have a nice day\\" unless you're a wannabe mall goth who thinks hot topic, fye and good charlotte are, like, \\"so totally cool\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"BON JOVI MAILS ANOTHER ONE IN","review":"What can you say, this band knows exactly what their strengths are , and play to them.

A REAL return to their roots? Ahh, wishful thinking....."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much sap - not enough zap","review":"have a nice day is the only catchy tune on this album. bon jovi may be branching out musically but overall I thought this album was full of filler. just to many songs that try to sound sad and such but really cannot deliver any feeling of sadness, its just a soft, moping mess that to me is not even worth sharing the shadow of all the albums by this band that came before it."},{"rating":"2","title":"have a nice day - bon jovi","review":"I bought my copy of hand on the day it came out and it has'nt left my cd player yet, i think its the best ablum they have ever written,as much as i love bounce the boys have surpassed themselves with this one. even my two teenage girls who where not into bon jovi are now huge fans and cannot wait to see them live. there is'nt one track on the ablum that i dont like , welcome to where ever you are if only we could all take those words to heart the world would be a better place. also i want to be loved i think we have all felt that at some point our lives. i am i think is my favorite when i heard it the first thing that came to mind where my daughters as I AM the one that will always be there for them .

But with all those objections there comes an equal measure of clever reworking and new discoveries of themes you thought had been done to death. For every bone headed cliche there is a cool non-cliche or interesting turn of a phrase or some neat little lyric that sticks in your head.\\"Welcome To Wherever You Are\\" and \\"Bells Of Freedom\\" are every bit as bathetic as you might be inclined to think. However, \\"Novocaine\\" and \\"Last Man Standing\\" may surprise you with their irony and lyricism.And to the reviewer who lamented the lack of connection to the old days and wanted to know how Tommy and Gina are doing, well maybe not so good:I guess there'll be no happy endingsWhen \\"once upon\\" is doing timeThere's a different kind of meaning nowTo livin' on a prayerSome don't seem to noticeAnd the rest don't seem to care"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"Well... I can't say I like ALL the songs in this cd, yet there are great ones like I am, welcome to wherever you are, Bells of freedom and Last man standing.

But please, no part 4.But what can I say about people who has released so many great cds, anyways? I'll just shut up and keep the faith ^_-"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Jersey boys...New album","review":"I have been a fan of this bands music for awhile, it's always had that heartland feel to it. This album is better than their last 3 efforts but not as good as \\"Keep the Faith\\" \\"New Jersey\\" or \\"Slippery When Wet\\" and here is why, the band as good as they sound at some point stopped taking chances and their music these days seems to produced or \\"perfect\\". Most of the songs on the new album stay at almost the same tempo. Not to slow or light and not to heavy or fast. Most of the songs have a positive feel to them, which is OK but they are not of the \\"wanted dead or alive\\" or \\"Lay your hands on me\\" variety. With that said they can still deliver the hometown, heartland, workin mans songs like they always have. Most of the bands from their generation have long been gone or are stuck singing the songs of yesterday at State Fairs. Advise: Go buy the record you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running on empty.","review":"I never thought it would come the day when I just wouldn't care to buy the new album of Bon Jovi. But this band is finally running on fumes. The band's secret weapon is running silent. Richie is nowhere to be found on this album and without Sambora this band is doomed.Have a nice day is the same recipe, it is just recycled material. A carbon-copy of Bounce and Crush. Bon Jovi has become a parody of itself and it is running on empty. Either Bon Jovi re-invents itselfs, charge up the battery with something similar to the masterpiece of These Days or it will implode.

There have always been overtures towards country music from JBJ from Wanted: Dead or Alive, to The Blaze of Glory soundtrack. You knew, however, that they would be followed up with a Bad Medicine or 99 In The Shade. It is becoming apparent, as they age, that they will rock less and croon more..... Sad but true. JBJ's Slippery When Wet voice abandoned him years ago. He's learned to pick his spots, like an aging fastball pitcher. But....he is from Jersey so...I like him....I'll just listen to SWW and NJ more!

I've heard everything from opera to gansta rap to death metal, and I can say with absolute certainty that Jon Bon Jovi is the most talentless singer EVER. He can't sing and sounds like he has I frog in his throat. Hearing Jon wheeze and croak his way through the dreadful \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" like some dimented frog mightbe good for sheer comedic value, but musical talent? NONE WHAT SO EVER! Jon Bon Jovi is the most untalented singer ever. It sounds like he has the flu! NO TALENT WHAT SO EVER!

Manfred's style, as in all his books, is crude and lowbrow on purpose, and will not be to everyone's taste (I'm not very fond of it myself).

Still, what I would expect from an introductory text is less divagation, and a deeper focus on the actual concepts.Now, I'm going forSocial Network Analysis: A Handbook.

Overall, a very weak effort aimed to sensationalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Aliens","review":"This series is excellent. It is interesting how then made connections between religion, art, and other historical accounts with ufology.I would definitely check this out. I definitely believe in ancient astronaut theory because A) I do not think God stopped with earth and B) Since I believe in God and His son, angels, and demons I believe in aliens given the fact that these entities do not originate from our world. I truly do not believe that disclosure will discount all religions on the planet and throw everything into chaos. We really need to get out of this 1950's mentality.Check it out. The DVD is worth the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a joke out of ufology","review":"It's shows like this, and countless others, that make a joke out of the whole ufo phenomenon. It's no wonder most people view believers as wackos, and I am a believer!! Almost all of the guests on the show seem to believe any magical / fantastic story no matter how ridiculous and then tell you how it's due to ancient aliens on top of that. Maybe there is something to the ancient alien theory at it's basic core, but the only thing you'll learn on this show is how over the top people become in their zest to believe in ufos and aliens. And how far people will reach into the land of fantasy to try to make something fit into what they want to believe in."},{"rating":"1","title":"ancient aliens","review":"Don't wast you time on this stuff.It's proven to be a total lie.Look at ancientaliensdebunked.com here you will learn the truth about this series.I have many dvd's on this series.Throwing them all away.Lies,the people that are interviewed are lieing.I watch alot of the history channel and love it.But after i went to ancientaliensdebunked.com i will not watch ancient aliens anymore.Do not wast you money on this series.Watch it on youtube if you have to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Aliens Season 1","review":"The world is not as we have been told.

With settings and persepctives from many corners of the world and storeis from many different cultures, this set examines ancient alien legands and ideas up through future possabilities. A must for Alien enthusiests. Episodes are LONG, but can easily be broken into multiple sessions. Opposing viewpoints are a bit short, but the supplied viewpoints are from credible sources.

The concept that everything on earth related to the history of mankind, religion, culture, discoveries, grandiose ancient structures, etc., happened because of ancient aliens is ridiculous. It's comedic to see fiction and speculation excruciatingly made to look like fact. The pure hokum science throughout the episodes would have made for good science fiction entertainment, except that it repeats itself nauseatingly. Hey, with a canard presented many times over, the gullible will buy the story hook line and sinker, and come back for more.

No archaeologists or credible scientists are properly interviewed and its full of converts - people with a vested interest in selling their books or magazines. For each issue there are more plausible alternative explanations. Look at the notion that its too much work to carve rock so ancient Egyptians had magical alien technology.

I know this kind of anti-science and anti-history woo draws an audience, but it's sad that there's so much bandwidth provided for the tinfoil hat and UFO demographic.

Tsoukalos. This guy has his hair wildly pushed up and out, an orange-toned tan, and spews some of the wildest, nonsensical, ridiculous statements of the program.

Later seasons jumped the shark with a couple of exceptions (Puma Punka S04E06 and the Da Vinci Conspiracy episode S04E08 were, imo, as good if not better than any season 1 episode).

The layout of the material is well organized and concise which we liked. However, we found the anatomy art to be difficult to relate to. Much of it was to small or the color was not appropriate to distinguish between the anatomy. For example, the anatomy on page 104 is done poorly. Radiography students need much more detail than is shown in this text. We also feel that the students need to be exposed to more than just the basic projections. The radiographs are average and we feel that students need more quality. We are returning to Merrill's for all of our courses because it is comprehensive and is the best value overall for the students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Scot McKnight is one of those rare \\"out-of-the-box\\" thinkers.

Using intense historical, religious, and personality background, Scot shows that Jesus central concern was for his disciples to live the kingdom life of loving God and loving others daily. He doesn't skirt around the fact that this kind of life is messy, and complicated. But he shows that Jesus lived that life for us, that it wasn't just his death, but his very life that was a sacrifice for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.","review":"This is a great read and an excellent book for every Christ follower to not only read but to keep in their library. McKnight makes reading some tough subjects very understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"The thing I respected the most about Scott McKnight's book was that he showed respect to the Torah of the Jews. Taking the Shema, Mr. McKnight showed how that Jesus respectfully expanded this time-honored prayer to include the love of others as well.I may not agree with everything he says as it relates to his interpretation of the ways of the Jews, but this book is truly a good read. I believe that everyone can get a better glimpse on what it truly means to love the Father as Jesus loved.

I didn't expect the print to actually have a printed frame around it, but thought it was simply an illustration.

The only thing that really sounds decent on this system is classical music...because it very seldom involves the subwoofer!If you're patient, Logitech will probably offer a rebate on its 2300 system just as it did for my 2200, which after rebate ended up costing a mere ten dollars more than this sorry Z-3e \\"Premium\\" (gag! chortle! choke!) system does with its current rebate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!","review":"I wanted something more than the stock speakers that came with my comp, and I got it.

As I listened to each song they just kept pulling me in. The overall texture and melody of each one was rather refreshing. A majority of material out there today is fairly one-dimensional. It definitely sounds like this band has progressed from the prior release. I purchased that CD (Counting Blue Cars)after this one. It just didn't grab me the way this one did.

The lead singer has an incredible voice, and the band has a very pure sound throughout. My complaint is that rest of the album is hardly listenable, unless you are in the mood for background music.

Go Forth embraced their more artsy-indie side while incorperating the punk-ness (superficial! I shudder at the word \\"punk\\") and Go Forth is more or less the artsy-indie minus the (shudder) punk.

I could not believe how different the music sounded compared to most of what's on the radio right now- but how it also sounded modern...it's hard to describe...it's like the music just envelopes you and you feel like you are actually inside the heart or soul of the singer or music. My favorite songs are Carry Me To Love and Loving You Kissing You. I also like some of the jazzy stuff also...Jay Thompson & OFS has put together a romantic jam masterpice in my opinion! They sing great and know how to entertain a crowd (they actually sang Carry Me To Love at the party!)

I told the teacher about the book but told her I couldn't give it to her as a gift because if her mother caught her with it, I'd be mortified!!!It is very entertaining and an easy read.

As other reviews have said it repeats itself a lot and comes across so amateurish it's questionable any sort of editorial process happened. That the author pursued writing for TV sitcoms is not surprising. It's simplistic like a sitcom, most of the jokes are flat (and many not so much a joke but a cliche) and it's so disjointed it'd have been better structured as a series of essays. There are some good core stories here with the potential to be funny but it consistently fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"No One's Even Bleeding","review":"New age vision of the public school system.

Castellaneta has taken a big risk telling his story with such honesty. His sense of humor sustans the reader's interest in what would otherwise be a painful expose of a crippled systemin need of major repairs.I highly recommend this book for anyone who has the guts to face the truth about what has happened to our schools.

They all have some soul searching to do, and Castellenta gives the vision they need to find their way."},{"rating":"1","title":"No One's Even Bleeding? How About the Reader?","review":"Based on the positive reviews on this site, I bought this book. I suspect someone is cramming the mailbox. It's hard to believe anyone but an oversexed fifteen year old would find it interesting. I read it but more out of shock and disbelief than genuine interests. The wisecracks are not funny; the author has no idea of how to write dialogue and interior monologues; his paragraphing is awful, and his use of offensive language, excessive. How the publisher overlooked these problems is astounding! A first year creative writing student could have done a better editing job. Did I mention it was overpriced?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No One's Even Bleeding","review":"This book is not as bad as some of the reviewers have claimed. But it isn't nearly as good either. There are some funny moments to it. But the story goes nowhere. By the third or fourth chapter, the author repeats himself aimlessly. It's hard to feel any sense of compassion for the main character. I'm not a prude, but the sex in the story seems irrelevant. My biggest complaint is that it is way over priced, and to be honest, there are better things on television. And that's a sad comment on any book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This tape player doesn't have a rewind button, and flipping the tape so you can fast-forward it instead is a pain in the middle of a workout.

If you already have a background in the area, I doubt it will add anything new to your understanding. This isn't a negative, it is merely my opinion that the book's rigid adherence to chronology precludes a decent provocative synthesis of the work of the period. The last section covers Quine's contributions and, apart from berating Grice and Strawson's attempted rebuttal of Quine's positions on language, is a little bit too uncritical. For a final year undergraduate or a aspirng postgraduate, this book (and its companion volume) is very useful. However, there are other histories of philosophy around that covere the same period with more panache. It is a personal opinion at the end of the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensuous, Earthy, and Heavenly","review":"With the common thread of love songs to the soul, this collection of global, world beat sounds acknowledges every level and every chakra in unabashed celebration. Sensuous, earthy, and heavenly, in a breathtaking mood of wonder and awe, these love-based pieces resonate deeply through body and mind, kissing the soul with un apologetic affection. I was surprised at the wide range of moods. Rich with bass tones and interwoven percussion alongside astounding vocals, this album will find a variety of uses, from wooing a potential mate to comfort in times of distress to energetic housecleaning. It conveys a feeling of knowing the listener to a depth that can be disconcerting, and is sure to be popular with both young and - well, those not quite so young."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal BP Monitoring Product for Small Children","review":"After hours of searching for a BP monitor that would accurately take my seven year old's BP, I stumbled into this product on Amazon.

Canadians have had to content themselves with a LOUSY CD reissue of HERO & HEROINE that sounds like it was mastered from someone's beat-up-old-garage-sale copy and a single CD anthology that was hardly up to the challenge. HALCYON DAYS (U.K.) was a great anthology for fans, seeing as how it contained U.K. single versions and B-sides/rarities, but I wish I'd purchased the U.S. edition.

This book, in typical Gann fashion, punches through the veneer of the Tech series of books.On the surface, the series as a whole, promises much. In reality, they are at best inconsistant in presentation and information.In this book, Gann's genius is visible beneath the framework.Of the 8 books of this series which I own, this is the most comprehensive and direct presentation of the subject aircraft. Unlike others of the series, this book focuses on the topic at hand. The diversions into the minutia and one-offs are focussed and appropriate. If you want to know the history of the DC6 and DC7, you can't find a better starting point than this book.The point of this particular volumn is that it is hard to hold a good writer down.

A simple story of perfect children, with a perfect mother and a slightly less than perfect father who goes to jail - uprooted from their perfect London town house with its' maids and opulent interiors - to end up in a small Yorkshire village in a simple country cottage (although having seen Panorama on TV the previous evening, about people losing their homes in London - most of us would nowadays give their eye teeth to live in aforementioned country cottage - with or without electricity and running water), the story revolves around the little station and the comings and goings of the trains and the part they play in the childrens' lives.

It wasn't much of a sales success for him, but I really enjoyed it.This novel is a straightforward crime thriller -- someone is trying to kill the main character, a psychologist, and he's trying to figure out who the killer is before he becomes the victim. Is it one of his patients? Is it someone involved with the police? I was surprised by some of the twists in this book.THE NAKED FACE isn't a masterpiece, but it's a fun cat and mouse story that you can read in a few hours. The pacing is pretty fast, and I found THE NAKED FACE more exciting overall than a lot of the contemporary thrillers I read these days.This novel was written over 30 years ago and it admittedly has a dated feel. But overall it's worth your time, especially if you like Sheldon's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheldon Has Improved","review":"Ok, this was the Master's very first novel. I might have given him a higher mark if I had not read Bloodlines,Master of the Game,The Sands of Time and the Memory novels first. Though this novel is not as exquisite as his others, it does show how MUCH Sheldon has improved! Since I am such a die-hard Sheldon fan, it breaks my heart to say this but if you are new to Sheldon, I would not recommend The Naked Face as your first pick (or any pick for that matter).

For example, the book does not tell you that R, the gas constant, is equal to .0821 L*atm/mol*k. The book also does not tell you that there are 22.4 L/mol at STP. Unless these are just hidden carefully away in some secret forest of Chemistry values, this is plainly unacceptable.

It spends more time being looked for (on the floor of my car, etc) than it does being written with.

I also ordered a fine point refill as I typically use the finest point pens I can find. After using both the fine point refill and the medium point that came with the pen, I prefer the medium point. I typically used disposable pens with gel ink and after receiving my space pen I am very pleased with the way it writes compared to the gel pens. While not a 100% replacement for my gel pens, I do find myself using this pen more and more as it is always with me and writes well. I especially like the small form factor in my pocket and good sized when the cap is put on the back end for writing. The significant weight of the pen provides a very positive feel when writing. I typically write on a variety of mediums from standard note pads and printer paper, to my various Moleskine notebooks. I definitely recommend trying out the fisher space pen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent pen but Unsatisfied","review":"Was excited for the pen, loved the size and writing but somehow cap got stuck on the back.

Compelling in terms of subject (the life and times of Charles M.) but agonizing in terms of \\"kicking back\\" with a comfortable tome. The \\"narrative\\" consists of facts, statements and opinions being thrown at the reader without (generally) any context or follow-up. Characters and scenarios are brought up one moment and abruptly dropped the next. The book will occasionally read like a parody of Larry King's USA Today column! I highly recommend Brian Priestley's Mingus: A Critical Biography over this sophomoric effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"His self, though he's none too real","review":"Mingus was mighty. And though Santoro introduces him with great praise and passion, he almost portrays him as a buffoon through his many contradictory phases. And for a music critic, his descriptions of the music and compositions is pretty awful (awkwardly described, incorrect or minus any true appreciation). A few more details about Mingus' personal life than Priestley's musical biography, but otherwise, Priestley's book is infinitely better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boogie Stop Santoro","review":"This book was a major disappointment. I am a huge Charles Mingus fan and looked forward to this book with great anticipation. To give Santoro his due, he does do a great job situating Mingus in a broader context, not just of the jazz world but of the contemporary avant-garde arts scene. And one certainly does get a good feel for the personality and life of Mingus here. But the writing style is sophmoric, full of throw-away phrases and juvenile attempts to be hip. How many times does he conclude a paragraph with (I can't remember the exact words) something like, \\"He felt the zeitgesist working again.\\" Santoro also shies away from discussing Mingus's music--rarely does he venture an opinion on a particular concert or recording. He also gives short shrift to Mingus's sidemen. I would recommend this as a pretty good read, but start with Brian Priestly's bio and be prepared for an extrememly annowing prose style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let my children read competent prose","review":"Mingus, for all his many hideous transgressions depicted herein, deserves far better than to have this amateurish draft pass for a definitive biography. In short, this is a poorly conceived and written book, and I'm frankly shocked that Oxford would implement such low standards for any publication. I only added a second star because occasionally through the repetitive muck, superfluous attempts to link Mingus' exploits with banal depictions of broader cultural events, utterly failed stylizations, and absurd irrelevancies that clutter much of Santoro's text, I was able to glean further dimension of just how monumental an a-hole Mingus allowed himself to be. Since the predominant focus is on Mingus' personal life rather than his music, you almost can't help but come away with a sense more of disgust than reverie, regardless of the way Santoro consents to explain the eccentricities away by lapping up the bassist's transparently insecure claims to genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Research every opinion","review":"This book chronologically tells the story of the legendary bassist's life but this is no narrative. Santoro employs testimony from Mingus' bandmembers, ex-wives, kids and various folks in the know but I doubt any of these folks would dig how much of the book is based on Santoro's own opinions on Mingus' career choices and experiences which shaped his music. For example, the author wastes too many pages ruminating on interracial love, a topic he seems mildly disturbed by. I gave this book one extra star for the thorough discography to the rear of the book, but the book itself is utterly disposable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"Extensive reporting but so poorly written! Given such an inspirational subject, the language fails miserably to rise to the occasion. This was surely a tough subject to tackle, but I think the author stopped a draft or two too soon.

When we got her as a rescue dog 11 years ago, the vet's estimate was 13-15 years as a life span for her.

Also, the dimensions are throwing me off a bit, I know some people said it didn't fit their table, is there another size kidkraft train table? I guess I'll measure again but the product dimensions seem too big to be just a single drawer...I gave it a high rating since its exactly what I need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, lowsy audio","review":"The negative comment I have is the audio which was very low and not crisp. I ended up watching the game on the Mardi Gras Miracle Special on the DVD where the video and audio were great. The radio broadcast was a nice addition to the DVD release and probably will remain as the greatest comback ever. Even to be down 9 points with only 2:30 minutes in the game was incredible in iteself. But when you shoot the threes like that, you always have a chance.

It is hard to write a negative review as this is actually written by her. However I felt that her time in China was almost downplayed even though it was 20 years!

It is the same story as \\"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness,\\" but told modestly. Other biographies tell details missing in this book which the author apparently was reluctant to mention. (The 'Inn of the Sixth happiness' movie fictionalizes her story to some degree, and Gladys herself was unhappy about that). Overall, I consider it a very good book.

The book is a quick read and quite transparent in Gladys assessment of her faith and thoughts on when her faith was waning.

I read quite clearly that all the Lord needs is my willingness and He will provide my needs....not my wants always, but always my needs.LJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"a woman to admire","review":"I so admire the courage, faith & hard work of this wonderful woman--and her God!

The mystery was tedious, the romance was lukewarm, and the outcome was predictable. The worst part, however, is the fact that we're supposed to believe that the male protagonist, who was a good cop before he became a successful crime writer, knew the killer intimately for several years and never once considered that she was a suspect simply because she was female. Very asinine..If you're still interested in reading the story, I suggest you save your money and get it at the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but too short","review":"I saw all the 12 original episodes on TV and I love this serie very much! It is the first time that a TV team/photographer was allowed to go into the deep inside of this palace and for most of the treasures which have been collected by generations of royal families from different dynasties(Song,Ming,Qing), this is also the first time that they have been shown to the world. But the most interesting part is how this program tells the story of this palace by putting it in China's history, especially the history after the Opium War, and how people have been trying to protect it and protect the culture this palace stands for during the war time. I get to know that the government has been sponsoring the forbidden City Museum to buy back the treasures lost during the Opium War and war with Japanese, however, little has been told about it. Well, better not to be too greedy, right? If you can, get the original 12 episodes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I ordered this item on Dec. 13.

I don't think there is another book in my collection that comes close. From outer front cover to outer back cover, every page is a visual feast. I can't believe they forgot to include a map.

Keep it far away from pets and drinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Addition","review":"Perhaps I'm not as well-rounded (or jaded) as some other reviewers, but I think the Eberron setting is the most original thing to come along since the old-school Realms stuff. The dragon marks are a clever plot device, and I like the idea of orcs as druidic woodstock holistic hippies. the artificer class is interesting, the warforged likewise...the shifter and...what's the other race, the half-dopplegangers? Regardless, yeah they are pretty much filler.This is the happiest I've been with a Wizards product in quite some time.Only four stars because some people are just:1. Married to the Realms2. Deep into their own campaign.3. Don't care, just let me dungeon crawl.and the price is stiff for any of the above three."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Beginning","review":"Though, like any other new campaign, this book lacks detail in some areas it gives a great introduction to the world of Eberron. I've just started running this campaign and my players are loving the new flavor. It's also nice to finally see a campaign written exclusively in 3E come from Wizards. Greyhawk is extremely dated and Forgotten Realms has gotten awfully stale after nearly 20 years. I personally can't wait to watch this product line develop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dungeon's and Dragon's Eberron Campagn Setting","review":"This is a great expansion of the D&D rules for creating your own campaigns within the Eberron setting.

Everything fits nicely and I can see it is protected well while in this case. Although many websites say it has a combonation lock on it, but it doesnt. It just has a regular lock.

The design of the launch case is as follows: a half-ball (rubber?) sealed to a hard plastic flat base. The base cracked, so the air now leaks out of the crack instead of pushing up the rocket. Also, the advertisement that the rockets go \\"300 feet\\" is NOT 300 feet in height. Perhaps 300 feet in total distance travelled - 140 up and 140 down and 20 across (which I still doubt)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coordination toy!","review":"Bought this toy for my grandson who is 4.

An unfortunate choice: the second punch had the same misalignment problem & couldn't cut a round hole in even one sheet of paper; it cut a partial hole, which got caught in the metal reservoir and caused the paper to rip.

She might get attracted by some marginal artist or personality that seems to shine and glow with an unforeseeable life. But this attraction is only superficial and it gets boring in its turn by the total unpredictability of the new man and the film implies woman wants some stability and regularity.

That was when Europeans knew little about true philanthropy and nothing about major donor relations. They were mostly wedded to direct mail and low-end funders. The author was a significant force in lower-end donor direct mail fundraising. Thus, little was ever of true significance for US and Canadian professionals.

However, it goes down hill and does so at an agonizingly slow and unremarkable pace. As has been pointed out in other reviews, everything about the movie is cheezy.

Some of my favourites tracks are \\"Hang Tyme\\", \\"Can I Get A Witness\\", \\"Crazy\\" etc. Her vocals are slightly better this time. I also enjoyed the appearances by Dr. Dre. This is a good album overall.

It makes my teeth hurt to think it is a rip off. But from the looks of it I can almost guarantee it is a fake. The last I heard Ted Turner was in the process of gathering votes to reissue it. Thinking this was the reissue I bought it. This is not a Ted Turner release. Or any other studio release. Don't buy this as the quality is no good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"Mark out did himself with Sailing to Philadelphia, I would highly recommend purchasing it.Lee....Long Beach CA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"Wow, I'm in love! I've only had one Dire Straits CD up till now but then I heard this solo effort by the great Mark himself while visiting a friend. This is one gal who made a mad dash to buy her own copy of it. \\"What it is' is the absolute best, rollicking and lyrical. I also love, \\"Sailing...\\", \\"Silvertown Blues\\" and \\"Prairie Wedding\\", a haunting ballad sung in a most genteel manner. Mark has won my heart completely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music you enjoy anytime of the day","review":"I bought this album being a huge Dire Straits/Knopfler fan and I didn't get disappointed. It didn't contain any immediate addiction hits like \\"Sultans Of Swing\\" or \\"Brothers In Arms\\" but gave me an hour of pure listening enjoyment. My favourite songs are \\"Baloney Again\\", \\"El Macho\\" and \\"Who's Your Baby Now?\\", the last one, I think, could as well be a Lennon/McCartney song. The title song is a beautiful one, too. I strongly recommend this CD to everybody who enjoys easy music, fancy guitarplaying and Mark's fantastic voice. It's a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revists some of the past Knopfler guitar style","review":"This album is a mix of Knopfler's earlier recordings with Dire Straits and his newer leanings towards country and bluegrass. Some of the tracks are catchy and well written(Do America, and Baloney again) and hard core Knopfler fans (like me) will want the album. At the same time, it's nothing we haven't heard from him before and it doesn't approach the beautiful simplicity of the first and second Dire Straits albums. The guitar work is also less orchestral. I'm still hoping Knopfler will come out with another Brothers in Arms or Making Movies - An album which takes his guitar mastery to new levels with tracks that are well written, mature, catchy and soulful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not awful, just undistinguished","review":"To date, Mark Knopfler's work is the only music that I felt comfortable buying sight unseen. No more. Unlike \\"Golden Heart\\", \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" is boring. The songs aren't bad, but they're like tepid watercolors in a hotel room. They don't offend, but ten minutes after hearing them, they're hard to recall. The best tracks are \\"What it is\\" and \\"Speedway at Nazareth\\", but two good songs aren't reason enough to buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"While on the Road to ...","review":"Deep in the bowels of Germany, I found myself without any tolerable distractions for my four hour ride. I stopped at a gas station and picked up Mark Knopfler's new cassette(it was a rental car, OK!!) By the second time around I was a \\"Junkie doll\\" I've not followed Dire Straits too closely, but have enjoyed some of their work. I also bought U2's new cassette, since they won best album of the year... What a joke! This is the best I've heard in a long time. The music really is stirring, but I'm more intrigued by the lyrics. It's really touching. The images of \\"One More Matinee\\" are absolutely rich and deeply moving. All of the songs are impacting in one way or another. I certainly got my money's worth. In fact, I'll search back on his other releases.... Yes... It's that good!Thanks Mark!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is an excellent CD. I bought it because of \\"What it is\\", but soon found that every song on this CD was great. Mark Knopfler has done himself proud. If you liked Dire Straits (or just appreciate well written lyrics and great music), don't hesitate to buy this CD. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"As perfect as Tim Ramey","review":"I had every reason to expect good work. I was overwhelmed by the excellence of this project, which knocked me out from the first track onwards. There's about no reason why this couldn't be called a Dire Straits CD, in my humble opinion. Not only is Knopfler not resting on his laurels as most of his peers (Clapton, Gilmour, Buckingham) are, but one rarely finds good lyrics such as these. Let me quickly add that I was surprised at how good James Taylor sounded in his role on the title track, and that this is debatably the second \\"country\\" album I've ever liked. [The first was Stevie Nicks' Belladonna] Incidentally, Nazareth Speedway has me in awe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good rootsy country/blues album","review":"This is a very good album from the ex-frontman of Dire Straits. Away from the commercial concerns of his band, Mark gets back to his acoustic roots, as this album is largely a collection of country / blues numbers, played with panache and mostly focusing on Knopfler's plucky guitar and deep gravelly voice. At times he dosen't sound like himself, like on the title track where he sounds like Evan Dando; and others where the ensemble playing reminds me of an alt.country act, or the Jayhawks. James Taylor and Van Morrison join in on vocals and have some fun.The only bad thing about this album, and it really takes that 5th star away, is Guy Fletcher's keyboards. He drowns certain songs in 80's synth washes, ruining otherwise perfect rootsy-acoustic blues songs. And his backing vocals are truely awful. If he wasn't on this album it would be perfect, but he's there, and he does his damage.One piece of advice to Mark Knopfler: keep making albums like this but lose Fletcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining in a subdued way","review":"I always admired Dire Straits, although to be honest, I never owned any of their albums. I was intrigued to read about this solo effort from 2000 by Mark Knopfler, and decided to order it here. The album is a mixed bag at best, the best tunes being the title tune, sung by Knopfler and James Taylor, and a ditty featuring Van Morrison singing alternate verses. There also are two cuts featuring a well-known bluegrass duo singing in the background. The rest is Knopfler alone, with limited instrumental backing, and frankly these songs sound pretty much the same as Knopfler only knows one way to sing. He's not terribly expressive. Harry Chapin or Jim Croce he ain't. On the other hand, you can put this CD on in your car and listen to it more than once as the miles fly by. It has a slightly hypnotic effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arriving in Philly","review":"When Mark Knopfler arrived in circa late 70s, maybe 80, I thought his breakout album extraordinary. This album contains what is arguably his best single, \\"What it is\\". Haunting, lyrical, beautiful, inviting. Alone, this one cut is worth purchasing.But, there is James Taylor's melodic voice on Sailing to Philly, and later Van Morrison helping out.Twenty some years after Dire Straits burst on the scene, this is one of the best albums to listen to when the mood is low key, the snow is falling at a rate of one inch an hour or you are in need of solace."},{"rating":"2","title":"song missing","review":"Once again, Mark Knopler spellbounds us with his magic guitar work and strong texts. But this edition of the album (US release?) only deserves 4 stars, because a song is missing! I would suggest all Mark Knopler fans to buy the UK edition of this album (available on www.amazon.co.uk) where you get song number 14: \\"One more matinee\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz","review":"I think back to the days when I was trying to convince people to listen to this great new band, Dire Straits. Now I'm embarrassed to associate myself with this cowboy. Get his stuff out of the \\"rock\\" category and into \\"country\\" where it belongs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"When I first heard...","review":"When I first heard Van Morrison butchering beautiful Irish songs with the Chieftans I was driving. I ejected the tape and in a safe manner threw it out the window. I never litter, I felt bad about it. Luckily I listened to Sailing to Philadelphia in my office in Philadelphia and only had to put it back into the box and throw it in the trash can. It was that awful. I cannot believe all the 5 star reviews. Could anyone involved in this album have broken a sweat while making it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 good MK songs without Dire Straits","review":"Shangri La had some great songs but this I'm pretty sure theonly good song is What It Is.

Every song on this album is good (My personal favourite being \\"What It Is\\", which has the best guitar on the album), and Knopfler can still tell a heck of a story with his music. Any fan of Dire Straits should sample this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new gem in the esoteric portfolio of racer music","review":"Without reiterating the accolades of other reviewers, let me add that the cut \\"Speedway in Nazereth\\" is a rare treat for us hardcore auto racing fans. The narrater is not a NASCAR driver, as others have surmised. He is describing a year on the Champ Car circuit, the so-called \\"CART\\" series. These are open wheel Indy-type cars, running mostly on road courses, not ovals. It is the connoisseur's form of racing, and an unusual choice for Mark given that as a Brit you'd expect him to chronicle Formulae One. It is a treat because the writer really knows the sport, it is full of oblique insider references (Portland Speedway's race sponser is a local army surplus giant: GI Joe) that speak to the race fan. But we've come to expect this from Knopfler: he has an integrity other artists don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knopfler's awsome style","review":"This man can make music. In my opinion the goal of music is to pull you out of this world and into another. Mark Knopfler has mastered this technique all so well in this cd (as it has been mastered in his previous cd's). His stories captivate my mind, the song sailing to philadelphia is one of these songs.Many self-proclaimed \\"artists\\" put out a lot of crap. Knopfler isn't one of these people. He is truely a great musician and This cd is truley worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"If you like JT, you will like him even more combined with Knopfler. The better the bang! Very soothing and mellow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straits Fans Will Be Disappointed","review":"Don't be fooled by the first track, the bulk of this release is far from the energetic sounds Knopfler belted out with Dire Straits. While technically impressive, most of the songs on this release are plodding and moody, and the few up-tempo cuts seem gratuitous and lacking in any real creativity. Cameos by James Taylor and Van Morrison bring some temporary light to the darkness, but sound a bit out of place overall. Afterwards, Knopfler returns to an overly somber set, which wouldn't be bad except that he tries too hard to be poetic, while the music takes a back seat. The resulting sounds are just background to the obscure lyrics. Zzzzzzzzzzz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-meaning, great guitar, sometimes silly lyrics","review":"Too much of a good thing. The splendid guitar playing can't distract from painfully un-poetic lyrics. Perhaps an instrumental cd would have fared better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"Although Mark still strums his distinctive style throughout the disc the songwriting would be better termed ghostwriting. The wit, emotion and just plain fun that I have come to expect from Mr. Knopfler are missing this go-around. The album seems forced and unprepared as if filling in the blanks was the only concern, giving you listener just that, filler. Hopefully this is just a vacation for Mark and he will give us another true work of art such as Golden Heart with his next effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark Knopfler's now is a Counry singer","review":"If you are buing this CD expecting Mark Knopfler's performance based on his Dire Straits background - DON'T make a mistake. This is not a rock music anymore - what he is trying to do - I think to get into the American Country top charts. Dire Straits is one of my favorite rock groups and Mark Knopfler's \\"the real one\\" is great - but I cannot listen to his Country ballads anymore.Hope it helps some of you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the guitar?","review":"After being excited to see a new release from this English guitar hero I couldn't believe my ears when I played this disc. What a waste of time. The opening track, \\"what it is\\" and the title track with James Taylor are wonderful but after that the remaining 11 tracks will send you to sleep. His previous solo effort is one of my all time favorites, it was a well constructed listening experience with varied tempos and tongue in cheek lyrics. This whole effort lacks passion and direction and the songs are very weak, you will need a full pot of coffee to get through this one. Mark, you need to turn it up to eleven!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"If you have come looking for some cool guitar sounds, go elsewhere. There is absolutely NO resemblance or hint of Dire Straits - like sounds here. Very disappointed, and feel the album is heavily over-rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"this is a must have for all MK fans and one of those desert island disks...it is awesome whichever way you look at it, lyrically, musically and recording wise. The guest vocalists, especially JT on the title track are all awesome and MK's playing is still there not as understated as in the later albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is wonderful stuff!","review":"I'm not going to write a review as a rock critic does. I'm also not a journalist.However, as a Mark Knopfler fan, I will say this...this is probably the best work he's ever done as a solo artist.I probably could get into each individual song and tear it apart, but I won't. Each song stands on it's own merit, and I leave it to you to enjoy each song in your own way.The song \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" is a marvel, and \\"The Last Laugh\\" (with Van Morrison), are the gems of this work.Despite the prevalance of \\"boy bands\\" and faux \\"Barbie dolls\\" prancing around, this has actually been a good year for \\"adult music\\". We have the new Mark Knopfler CD, new Paul Simon, the Steely Dan CD...new Doobie Brothers...what really sucks is that we are *such* a small listening audience.Cheers, mates!Dee"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soaring","review":"The guitar work on this album -- especially on the cuts What It Is, Silvertown, and Speedway at Nazareth -- is the most achingly melodic, powerful, blues-inspired take-off-and-soar lyricism that exists anywhere in popular music. An effortless mastery that leaves you breathless. Believe it: his blues-oriented cry on the axe truly IS a thing of beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Etherial guitarist!","review":"Of course, the first two cuts are great, and most of the songs are derivative, but in today's crowded music scene, what tunes aren't in some way or another? But this man is gifted, no doubt. He may not possess the technical wizardry of Clapton, but his guitar work remains the most haunting and soul-searching of any I have ever heard. 100 years from now, music students will be listening to \\"Speedway At Nazareth\\" just to hear, over and over again, the closing 3 minute soaring guitar masterwork. Go---and listen to it---with headphones. You will not hear any better closing segment in any song by any artist. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make Up The Story As You Go Along","review":"This wordless book is just precious and perfect for little boys. My sons and I made up the words to it over and over and enjoyed it for years. They are grown now, but it was certainly one of their favorites. I'm a grandma who will read it to my grandkids and great-grandkids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Values, Good Fun","review":"With a peep into the past, it's also the best of good old-fashioned values. A really warm, sweet, and simple story of just having fun - as a family, intergenerationally and without electronic noise. And the book is not heavy-handed, but the story sends a message about fun - and how we can all create fun without props and just our own voices and body and each other - is a good, and needed, one for both children and adults. I bought it for my 28-month-old and highly recommend this book - it leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside and is just a good, clean, nice story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book.","review":"We liked the Song and Dance Man. We liked how it sounds when you read it. We liked all the different colors in the pictures. They made the book nice. We liked how Grandpa did all of the dancing. We thought the jokes were funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children enjoying their grandfather","review":"This children's book by Karen Ackerman is focused on the grandfather of three children. He is a retired vaudevillian entertainer who puts on a show for the kids. The book was illustrated by Stephen Gammell and it won the 1989 Caldecott Medal for best illustration in a children's book. It is based in part on the author's own childhood. It demonstrates how much a child can learn from one's grandparents and the lives they have led."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Story, Doesn't Ring True","review":"This is a beautifully illustrated story about three children and their grandfather who, whenever they come to visit, takes them into the attic, where he opens an old Vaudeville trunk, takes out his tap shoes, hat, cane, and other objects, and proceeds to entertain them with dance and magic tricks. The children clap and enjoy the show, and the book shows that there is a special bond between children and grandparents, who take the time to play with them, entertain them, and tell them about the past.Where the story doesn't ring true for me is when the children say things like: \\"But as he turns off the attic light, Grandpa glances back up the stairs, and we wonder how much he really misses that time on the vaudeville stage, when he was a song and dance man.\\" This seems like a very adult observation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful pictures","review":"I always enjoy books that involve grandparents. This is such a colorful and fun picture book, but the fact that it shows children interacting with grandparents is the best. A great Caldecott winner"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half of a good book","review":"I'd give this 2 1/2 stars if I could; this is -half- of a good book. Plot and background - fine. (Several reviewers have mentioned they felt there was too much 'gemology' in this novel, but frankly, it's the only interesting thing here.) Character development and characterization - completely absent.If the author had spent HALF the time developing her characters as she did presenting the stone details, this would have been a good book. It reads as if she was following one-two word descriptions of each character - Kate, beautiful and talented; Sam, rebellious and honorable, etc.A good editor (or even a half-way literate and disinterested reader) could have told her this.Wait for the paperback or get this from the library if you must read it. Not particularly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING.... (yawn)","review":"When I first starting reading Elizabeth Lowell, her characters were sexy and smoldering. Now she writes treatises on gem cutting, art collecting, etc. with a tiny bit of sexy and smoldering thrown in to the mix. Well, it's not enough for me or for many of her former fans (read the other reviews). Too bad - she used to be one of my favourites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritatingly repetitive","review":"I just finished \\"Die In Plain Sight\\" and thought it was terrific! It was the first book I'd read by this author, and I was so excited to have found a new (for me) author. I was lucky enough to find \\"The Color of Death\\" at the library, but I was sorely disappointed. It seemed to me like the same book as \\"Die In Plain Sight\\", the characters just had different names. The male protagonists use the same term of endearment -\\"darling\\"- and the author keeps using the same annoying turn of phrase - \\"his/her smile was all teeth\\". And there was much more, as some of the previous reviewers have mentioned. Maybe I wouldn't have noticed all the similarities if I hadn't read these books so close together, but that's not really my fault is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite painful","review":"I'm usually an Elizabeth Lowell fan, however this was a quite painful read. There was way too much dry textbook information about gems and sadly, the characters were flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I won't bore you with a synopsis of this book, since there are several before me, however, I will tell you it's one of the most annoying books I have ever read. The heroine is a cookie-cutter gorgeous, perfect, smart, sassy (oh come ON NOW, and she's single???)....if the author had spent as much time on character development as she did dwelling on the main character's hair clip (what was THAT all about?), I may have enjoyed this book. It just all seemed a little too familiar and neat for me. The romantic tension was predictable (I was screaming, \\"Just do IT already), and the rogue cop schtick was very \\"been there, done that\\". I don't think I'll be combing the shelves for any more Elizabeth Lowell books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deadly Sapphires","review":"Kate Chandler cuts the \\"Seven Sins\\". Her half brother Lee Mandell, is suppose to deliver them in Florida. But he never shows up. Authorities beleive that him and his buxom girlfriend, pawn the sapphires and leaves the country.

However, the cutesy sexual foreplay was WAY overdone. It seemed pretty unbelievable that the FBI agent Sam Groves could be so thoroughly disliked by his bosses and still be working. It's also pretty unbelievable that all the information that Sam puts together for his seemingly stupid bosses gets totally ignored.Sam and Kate's rolls in the hay detract from the story line. It seems as if the author can't decide whether she wants to be a mystery writer or a tawdry romance writer.I doubt whether I'll ever read another one of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This novel is not one of her best.

I have found this to be true of several of her recent books. I really liked the Donovan family and the four books related to them, but since then, she has failed to pull me in with either character and especially with them together. In the Color of Death, I found myself skipping over pages and pages of tutorial about semi precious stones and the specifics of the cutting world and trade. Why do i need to know so much about the work? I am not planning to actually finish the novel and then go and perfectly cut a diamond or saffire. I thought the ending was flat and didn't answer all the questions brought up in the book. I think this will be my last Elizabeth Lowell book until she delves back into the Donovan family."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was lost","review":"I've enjoyed the Donavan series that Elizabeth Lowell wrote. I must confess that on this book, I was completely lost with the characters. I found myself flipping back to see who the characters were and what their job was. The story line was good, the gem information was interesting and I enjoyed the relationship building between the two main characters. I was glad that I was not able to figure out who the killer was until the last few pages. The suspense was very good. I suggest to anyone reading this book to start a list of the characters and use that as a book mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Biased Hagiography","review":"This book purports to be a biography of the prophet, however being written by a follower of his Bahai faction, it is anything but impartial. It's just about worth reading, if you're interested... but you have to look between the lines, where there are some obviously unsavoury things lurking... what was the real story between Baha'u'llah and his brother and the rival Bahai sects? I doubt it was as told here... hagiographies are usually this way... also Bahais have been attacked by the Iranian authorities, but did they in fact provoke some of this and threaten a coup? The Bahais are a much more peaceful and internationalist religion now, but a read of this hints of their bloody origins.

The viewer in my experience tends to take films that the producers of a TV series do and associate them with that point of origin, the way any David Spade, Wil Ferrell or Mike Myers and Dana Carvey vehicle is seen as an SNL big-screen spinoff. Also if they'd waited a few years until the turn of the new century brought us such classics as the Flintstones feature starring John Goodman, they would have benefitted from the creation of that new sub-genre; live action movies based on animated cartoons. And the choices for the starring roles might have been more believable. Like Cher as Natasha (she already has the looks and the voice, all she would have had to do is learn the East Bloc accent). And maybe Danny DeVito as Boris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Rossini Gem","review":"Composed in the same year as \\"The Barber of Seville,\\" this comic opera is a delight, from the clever-silly plot to the sparkling ensembles.

Cattle farms also have a huge impact on water quality world-wide.(Read the recent United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report, if you want to learn more.)If Gore truly believed his own theories, he would be a militant vegan.

However, that's a very complex matter. The climatology is a young science with a huge ammount of data that needs better tools to be processed, like supercomputers not yet built. Global warming effects are not so predictable as Al Gore tells in this film, ignoring how scientific data must be presented. The graphical data by the end of the film with increasing temperatures are gross fake. And above all, the film is egocentric on Mr.Gore, who's is not a SCIENTIST.Good point if you start thinking on man affecting the enviroment in an uncontrollable way.

He also shows how people in power are doing to try to debuke scientific data. It seems like those who choose not to believe are those who elect to cause chaos (i.e. G.O.P. Presidents Reagan, Bush I & II, Christian Leaders.). Like it or not, Global Warming does exists! Everything we do effects the planet's future.

Nothing, the old industries would be transformed into new, cleaner ones. Worst case? We get cleaner air and water.If the right wingers are wrong, we may loose everything. If the arctic shelf collapses and 100million die, it will be a little too late to worry about blaming them for being wrong *again*.So, the simple truth is who cares if in the end which side is \\"right\\" we simply can't afford to take the chance.On the movie, the presentation is exceptional but I do agree that it would have been better without the Al Gore biography thrown in (even though I'm a big Gore supporter)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inconvenient Truth","review":"This is truly a must-see movie!

He does it in a way that keeps you interested, even entertained.The show concludes with possibly the most important message anyone could give. In essence, 'An Inconvenient Truth' is a call to action to fight against global warming.I first saw this movie at the cinema with some friends. The show's message was driven so deeply into me, I was paranoid when we drove home, that the fumes from our vehicle was contributing to global warming.This is one of those documentaries you should watch with the whole family.

Behind this very serious politically driven environmental campaign are some extremely sinister motives defined by supporters of dictatorship and oppression.

It was a very sad day when the election was stolen from Mr. Gore, but this movie gave me a new realization. That being in office would have held this man back. His talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious. This is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do. Mr. Gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes. He gives a website climatecrisis.net for more ideas and info.

Let's face it... the world has been changing for years with or without us. Has anyone ever heard of the ice age? How many cars did it take to warm that one up! Remember the Polar bears?

Just like the old days, this elixir will cure lumbago, gout, and any of a hundred aliments. Place a fancy package on it, and folks still eat it up... go figure.I had long been suspect of the Academy Awards process and selections, as well as the Nobel, now I'm convinced, it's all a huge joke... and the joke is on you.But ole Al is sure comfy in his multi-million dollar home on the coast, you know the one that was supposed to be destroyed by rising oceans.. remember?.

It was not an \\"in your face show you all the environmental disasters til you can't take anymore and are left feeling helpless and so you need to have a drink just to fall asleep that night\\" kind of movie.

An Inconvenient truth is not a doomsday view of the destruction of the world, but an eye opener for those that are still in denial about what is happening to the planet as a result of deforestation and excessive greenhouse gas emissions.

They haven't a chance in hell of getting their views out there with the kind of backing that Al Gore had for this film. It's not even the film that irks me as much as the man got a Nobel Peace Prize for it.

It does its job in enlightening people on the basics of the problems out there and gives ideas on what can be done to help. Not all of us are environmentalists or scientists so this Dvd is a great way to inform the mass public of a very serious concern. Al Gore does an incredible job in his presentation and the integration of his history helps to connect you to him as a speaker instead of just being subjected to a lecture. We see the path that brought him to where he is today and we understand his dedication and know that it is not just a paycheck. It would not have been as believable to just watch a paid celebrity present this same material. This most defintiely comes from his heart. I highly recommend this to everyone.

The Glaciers in Skandinavia and British Columbia are vanishing. Hey, a few years back, they found the body of George (Because It's There) Mallory near the top of Mount Everest. He'd been buried in snbow ever since he died. And we still get these dofusses saying Global Warming is all in our head.I live on a Tropical Island.

Al gives one heck of a strong sermon, but as a scientist is a complete flop. He offers anecdotal evidence aplenty that the world is warming-- but it's not proof. He offers no compelling evidence that CO2 is causing this warming and, in fact, the only evidence he DOES offer on that shows exactly the opposite-- that global warming causes CO2. Finally, he offers no evidence at all that humans are creating the CO2 increase in an amount equal to the problem. Finally, he says that we only have ten years to save the planet.

We also saw what is happening to the polar bears. They are drowning. They say we can still turn this around and I believe we can. I worry about the future of my grandchildren and their children.

Please be careful where you get information on this. A prime example is Al Gore's interview-onboard his PRIVATE jet. That is called a limosine liberal.

This has occurred many times in the past. Alarmist include Al Gore doesn't take in account the history of climate change over decades instead of just a few years from the 1970's. This year was suppose to the be worst hurricane season ever, what happened. The Gulf and Atlantic oceans were warmer than usual but the Pacific Ocean was colder. That equals balance. Sure man has changed the climate a bit but not as bad as Al Gore wants you to believe. The polar ice caps have melted but warmer temperatures cause more rain over these regions which replace the ice cap. This is anothe cycle of earth.

It ignores any fact which does not fit the theory. Failure to address contadictory evidence brings the whole theory into question as well as the motivations of it's proponents. The only thing that this movie proves is the extent to which people will go to further their political goals.Yes, the planet is going through a warming cycle just as it has gone through warming and cooling cycles throughout it's existence. However, what we rarely hear is that there are several other theories for the reason this occurs. The most credible is the fact that the sun goes through warming and cooling cycles and is currently in a warming cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Al Gore sucks...

What really astounds me is that I purchased a vehical that runs on Ethanol and due to the greed of the oil companies, I can't buy it here in California. This is further proof of the greed of the powers that be at any cost regardless of the consequences. The bible says that \\"unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved.\\" (Matt 24:22) It also says that God will destroy those destroying the Earth.

First off, I really don't care that he lost the presidency, yeah so it was a \\"big blow\\" to him, what does that have to do with global warming?

The film is very well done, seamless enough that I forgot I was watching a film. He makes it personal enough for the viewer to relate to, yet it isn't about him or his agenda at all. The most significant thing this film delivers is the message that every individual can change how they live to help the environment. He doesn't even necessarily have to go into specifics of how to live; rather, it's the way he encourages his audience that every person counts, ever action counts. Break out of the patterning and act. In fact, one of the most memorable bits of it is not in the film at all, but at the end in the credits. The animation of the credits recycles the letters into new phrases and names, and one of them re-arranges itself to say, \\"If you believe in prayer, pray that people will find the strength to change.\\" Impressive, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies","review":"There is absolutely no science to this movie, most of it proved to be false and computer generated.

He falls short of claiming to have invented Global Warming in his spare time at Harvard, but other than that, there is no solid science, no scientific rebuttal, and an over-abundance of political bravado and blustering posturing. To start a \\"documentary\\" with a statement like, \\"We are killing ourselves...\\", is not only ludicrous, but silly.

Ok, yes, CO2 has a higher absorptivity than Nitrogen, but just like the color black, it has a higher emissivity. I.e. additional CO2 in the atmosphere provides no net gain. Mr. Gore neglects to mention that CO2 will emit more heat to space at night, approximately equal to the additional heat absorbed during the day.

You don't have to be a scientist to figure out that there are no humans on Mars so the warming must be natural. The earth's climate has ALWAYS been changing and goes through warming and cooling periods naturally. Most of the warming during this cycle started way before 1940 before the industrial revolution. In fact from about 1940-1980 the hype was about Global COOLING and the fear was that we were headed for another ice age!

The problem here is that it is completely one sided, thus making this not a documentary at all, but rather propaganda. True documentaries are non-biased.As for the subject matter, there are flaws throughout the film when concerned with accuracy. And given that this is a man who does NOT practice what he preaches, then it's very difficult to take what he's saying seriously. Plus there are way too many conflicting scientists who debate the validity of Human caused global warming. Gore just writes the opponents off and boldly states that his info is \\"fact\\".

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rameau: Les Indes Galantes Suite","review":"Rameau: Les Indes Galantes Suite is a 1994 Phillips Classics Productions recording under direction of Frans Bruggen who leads the Orchestra of the 18th Century. Mary Cyr has written a splendid essay entitled \\"Exoticism, Spectacle and Dance\\". Being a huge fan of Baroque music I absolutely loved this incredible recording. Highly recommended. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good tool","review":"This is an easy tool to follow the rules for problem solving. It has helped to reduce the time of response in hard difficult working situations. To maintain the level of usage, the students read it for present information in class in other ways, in more understandble way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed More of Everything","review":"I got this book because I wanted to learn more about problem-solving. Most people overcomplicate problems, so problem-solving with Post-Its is a great way to force people to start at the most basic issue. What I got was a book that focused primarily on what to do with the Post Its after you came up with the problem.What the book lacked was an in-depth look at how to get to the point where the problem in defined. I was frustrated because I wanted to see this part of the process, and the book didn't give it to me. I also wanted examples of how using Post-Its helped people, and there's only one example near the end of the book. While the illustration examples of Post-It use in various kinds of charts were great and helped me understand how each chart worked, the explanations became very repetition without examples.The book just needed more of everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple but very practical book","review":"Be frank I just read this book one time few years ago and never used the methods mentioned. One of the reasons is that I packed the book somewhere...But I assure all buyers that you will find the tools are simple and can be used quickly. There are no difficult mathematic (or should be very few computations are needed) but almost work as 'common sense' approach. Since post-it or similar products can be acquired almost in all offices, so you can try it out by yourself, or with your colleague (friends and family) almost immediately. I believe its power is that you can use the tools to communicate with others. After all, to solve a problem needs good thinking and also consensus. Buy and use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review: Rapid Problem Solving with Post-It Notes by David Straker","review":"Rapid Problem Solving with Post-It Notes by David Straker is one of the those books that had been on my wishlist for quite a while.The book is quite handy, very concise and so easy to understand.The author presents six simple ways to approach problem solving using Post-it Note. What I like about the book most is that it is very clear on what the tools are, how they are used and when to use them. The examples used are also very clear and appropriate.As someone who leads innovation teams, product improvement teams, product development and cost engineering teams, these tools are very helpful.Highly recommended for those who work in teams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Light Reading","review":"I'm a big fan of using rapid prototyping in a variety of ways - from everything from designing software products to building consensus in meetings and setting priorities. There was nothing new in this book that a smart person with the general idea wouldn't be able to come up with on their own. There is a lot of white space in the book and many rudimentary ideas are explained in painful detail. No case studies and really only one application (building consensus and prioritization in meetings). The contents of the book might be better contained in a five page pamphlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"The table of contents is everything.","review":"What is with offering the \\"look inside\\" feature but then blocking out all the actual content?If your book has so little real content that allowing me to see the table of contents feels too threatening, then it can't have much real value inside. Maybe if I saw the TOC I'd see the whole book, minus a few pictures (and probably a lot of padding)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rapid Problem Solving with Post-It Notes","review":"Looks ok, but the book had a binding error -- the first chapters were repeated, and the middle section was missing. Sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inquire about colors","review":"The product was exactly the size and quality that I expected it to be. But if you're like me and you are purchasing this product for appearance just as much as function, you may want to inquire as to the actual colors of the product. I purchased this product thinking it was pink, brown, and pale yellow. When I received the actual laptop sleeve it had teals, lime green, and several other colors that aren't in the picture. Beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This sleeve fits the 12\\" Macbook perfectly. It has a little padding to it to protect the laptop in case you drop it. The colors are beautiful and it fits very snug, not loose. The fabric feels like its of very good quality as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great imagery!","review":"This was my first time reading Boyle and I was thoroughly entertained. His use of imagery is absolutely amazing. While reading this story you are hearing the sounds, smelling the scents, and viewing the scenery just as if you are part of the story. It is a wonderful book and I am anxious to read some of his other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I'm finished!","review":"I have never been so glad to finish a book. Boyles begins with a gripping narrative of a woman whose identity has been stolen. The image of an innocent, educated and disabled woman huddled on the floor of a prison cell will stay with me a long time. But the book lost its effectiveness for me 1/2 the way through even though I did complete it. Boyle's writing is hard to follow at times, and he definitely propelled my dictionary use as he employed some rather obscure semantics in his prose.The ending to the book was a huge disappointment, and if a sequel is written I won't waste any time reading it.This is my first Boyle book, and unfortunately I have purchased 2 additional works of his. I guess I will read them......but this was enough torture to last me a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boyle's Folly","review":"I found this book to be completely pointless and uninteresting. The characters were poorly drawn and the plot was somewhat of a snooze."},{"rating":"1","title":"come on you guys be honest!","review":"I am a HUGE TC Boyle fan but this book was just not up to snuff. Formulaic! Hated it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"I can't understand why so many people liked this book. It starts out kind of interesting as we are introduced to Dana and she goes through the process of being arrested. That's about 1/3 of the book. The rest is an incredibly boring description of Peck Wilson's life and psychology (He's a bad guy. I get it already) and the deterioration of Dana and Bridger's relationship as they attempt to find him. They come across as whiny and selfish, so I never cared enough about either of them to care if they 1) found Peck; 2) stayed together or broke up. If you're looking for a good story and/or an intellectually challenging novel that actually has something to say, there are much better options out there. In fact, if you randomly selected a book off amazon you'd probably do better than Talk Talk."},{"rating":"2","title":"When does he sleep?","review":"TC Boyle never disappoints. His latest is a departure for him in that while his previous books have been \\"unputdownable,\\" they could not be classified as thrillers. And this one definitely is. I've read all of his previous books (my favorite was Tortilla Curtain), and his specialty seems to include a protagonist who is out of his/her depth in some way and ultimately prevails. But despite a fairly weak conclusion, the meat of the novel holds together with enough contemporary references and sensuous detailing to put the reader smack into the scene. His characters are complex, even the villain comes across as a believable person. I can't wait for his next book and since he is so prolific, won't have to wait too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but still great","review":"T.C. Boyle's best work, IMHO, was Tortilla Curtain, but anything this man writes is a delight to readers who enjoy top-flight literary fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I am a long-time TC Boyle fan, especially of his novels Riven Rock, Budding Prospects, and The Road to Wellville (his best novel IMO).However, I found Talk Talk a bit slow and uninspiring. The plot bumped along without much excitement, and the characters are not very well developed or beliveable. The story never got going for me, and I couldn't find a solid connection to the main characters (especially Dana). I bailed about 3/4 of the way through it, and would have quit earlier if it hadn't been written by Boyle.I'm looking forward to reading The Women, and will continue to read everything from Boyle who is one of my favs!"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],B={key:0},x={key:1};function H(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-9c4b0f7a"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/59.md","filePath":"glossary/59.md"}'),j={name:"glossary/59.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{W as __pageData,G as default};
