The characters in this book are not well developed and the story (the part that I did read) was unbelievable. At the beginning, the \\"heroine\\" keeps quoting scripture about how she'll make it, then tries to kill herself a few pages later?? I found a lot of the dialogue to be quite corny. Maybe someday when I have nothing else to do, I'll finish the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOTTA READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is my favorite fiction book of all times. I read it in one day.

Moore keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I couldn't relate to these characters. They were so dry and lacked substance. Zoe was too needy and just couldn't seem to get it together for more than half of the book. I didn't finish this book since I reached 3/4 of the way through and it still did not take off. Not this author's best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Annointed Author and Work of God","review":"A Lova' Like No Otha' is a page turner if I've ever seen one! I was captivated from page one and couldn't put the book down until I had read every word. This book ministered to my soul. It gave me encouragement and hope that I to could be strong in the Lord even in this world that we live in. I thank God for Stepanie Perry Moore. The characters were honest and believable, and often times I thought she was writing about ME!! I cried with Zoe, the main character, through her ups an downs; in near fatal situatons I held my breath. And in breathtaking moments, I felt like I was right there with her; crying tears of hapiness. I couldn't believe the way in wich this story was woven to flow so nicely and include so much action, so much love, but most of all...so much faith. God was all up in this book!! If you are searching for a nice and easy profound blessing to read, look no further...A LOVA' LIKE NO OTHA' is it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting in touch with your FIRST love!","review":"I loved this book!

There is going to be a part two?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is very much like otha's...","review":"Reading this one was a challenge---the author's intent is well-received, but she missed it on this one. The story was missing much of what makes a novel in the Christian fiction genre--depth, reality, and inspiration. I felt like I was reading a book written for very young girls, for which Ms. Moore typically writes. Aside from that, the author's attempt to write a great love story took a sad turn toward the romance novel direction and got VERY dramatic.I wish I could say this one was good, but it didn't move my spirit at all. If you want a quick read that will have you scratching your head at the end wondering \\"what just happened?\\", then this one is for you. For Christian fiction with more depth and integrity, check out \\"JOY\\" by Victoria Christopher Murray, \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" by Jacquelin Thomas, or \\"Forgiving Hour\\" by Robin Lee Hatcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Word of Encouragement","review":"Stephanie Perry Moore created a book that prompted you to feel every emotion under the sun. I cried, laughed and prayed for these characters. I could not believe that I finished this book in 6 hours and reread it the next day. I just could not put it down. I still go back and read a chapter here and there. I needed to remind myself that it was just fiction, but my faith in God reminded me that He is able.

The characters at times were too one dimensional and the author's writing style was utilitarian to say the least.

Ayer","review":"I know this logical positivist approach to life and thinking is supposed to be out of date, generally considered false, but still, it has its attractive side, it has a common-sense feeling to it, it has a kind of clear sharp-edge quality, it is sort of seductive. It's like something I could use in daily life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I'm in the middle of reading this book now, and I find it very interesting. It asks questions and delves into topics dealing with philosophy that should have been dealt with a long time ago. It was hard to believe that Ayer was 25 when he wrote this. I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed","review":"This book has totally changed my life! The first thing to say is that it is very long and I only read the first two chapters. But I think Language Truth and Logic definitely has the potential to become a best seller. Ayer has a great talent for creating memorable charachterizations and the action is non-stop. My critisisms of this book is that there is that there is to many spelling mistakes. Also it may be worth waiting for the film version. Also Ayer critisizes other writers like Heidegger and Shakespere but maybe he is jelous of there talent! Also if Ayer wants to sell books in this country he should try to make his stories more realistic! Also the book is overated. Overall I would say that this book is very poor in places and I would not recommend it unless you are into books in which case I would rate it as excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't replace history of philosophy!","review":"I saw the reviews and I think you may be miss-lead. This book does not replaces a good introduction to history of philosophy. It is certain that this books lacks of originality, but he gives the idea that everything is well-established, and he puts everything within his range of classification, which ir really doubtful for someone trying to begin with philosophy.I don't see anything particularly new in this book. He has a scheme to classify others' philosophy. It can be dangerous appealing, in the sense that it tries to remove some of disputes of the philosophers.I would say that is a good protection from the problems of the philosophy, not a good philosophy book. He does not solve the problems, he does not say where is the origin of the problem, or the miss use of the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss the Preview Song by Nina Gordon!","review":"I thought the music was beautiful, but I really wanted the CD for the song \\"Tonight and the Rest of My Life.\\" Was pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing trailer","review":"Also believe the trailer is misleading, but in all the soundtrack is befitting of the film and setting.

This is very urgent information and it matters to all of us. Though some of the content is repetitive, it is needed to make the point. We have been mis-lead. We need HIV testing and reporting and Cary shows us why.This Book has changed the way I think about this infection and will change what I do. I will use gloves more consistently, and I will test more of my patients for HIV. My wife and I will have an HIV test as soon as we can. Now I understand why we all need to know our HIV status to help us stop the spread of this deadly virus.this book will change the way you think about HIV. It is entertaining and yet sobering.

As Cary says,\\"One Mistake and you are dead.\\" Daniel J Bibelheimer, MD Nevada City, CA"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE TREE IT TOOK TO PRINT!","review":"This book is a yet another paranoid effort to exploit the fear around HIV. The author's facts are often not cited, and absurd \\"the average life span for gay men is 42 yrs old\\". Anyone with half a brain knows that there is no way to make that statement, no way to build a study (how do you identify those men who have sex with men and don't identify as gay)which would give this statistic. Yet another attempt to exploit HIV for financial gain! ugh! don't waist your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and pretentious","review":"The first several chapters of the novel are delightful and historically interesting. This covers Desiree's meeting the Buonapartes. From then on, the novel becomes a piece of sentimental, pretentious, boring schmalzy soap opera as Desiree has nothing to do but hang out on the periphery of Napoleon's court and act important and self-righteous. Her husband has an exceptionally successful career as a French marshall and eventually king of Sweden, but Desiree herself, at least in the novel, becomes progressively sillier and more neurotic. For example, she refuses to live with her husband (until she is in her forties) except in Paris (she doesn't like the clicking of spurs on the floors of palaces abroad, or palaces abroad are too cold for her, or have ghosts). She doesn't even attend her own husband's coronation. The whole thing is too silly for words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I expected SO much more out if this book.

However, I will never purchase this flavor for my Senseo again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Quality Is Average At Best","review":"The Hamilton Beach Single cup machine works great, as advertised. Unfortunately, the Senseo Coffee Pods taste like average cheap diner coffee. The coffee tastes stale and old, only gets worse since there are 18 pods in a bag. Everytime the bag is opened and is exposed to air, it makes the next cup taste even more stale.With that said, I love the concept and especially the price of the machine so I will continue to use it and try the re-usable filter with a better coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievable price","review":"Subscribe and save, you won't be sorry.

For a stronger coffee blend, take the pod out and steep for a minute, I am going to try different variety packs to get the most out of the deal, the dark roast is good, but I think I can do better.

Its on the Starbuck-type bitter side, but not as strong. None of these single serving coffee machines will taste like fresh ground. That is why you get some one star reviews for the Senseo.I keep the Senseo in my office for hassle-free single servings and it is great for that. Even the dark roast is really not strong enough to qualify as espresso, so I suggest you just use the double packets and make a large cup.Here is a further hint. Use a 10 oz cup, not a standard 8. Then put your milk in the cup and microwave for 30 seconds BEFORE you make the coffee. After coffee is make make sure to stir with a stirrer. Stirring is important and is actually recomended by Philips.As long as your expectations are down to earth you should enjoy this product.

The DE pods make good crema but the coffee is a lot like instant. The dark is especially bad when making two cups at a time. Make two four ounce cups if you want a large cup. Other pods do fit in the Senseo including Archer farms and others available online. I wouldn't go making your own pods but definitely try some other brands. If you do insist on sticking with DE, do your best to keep them fresh.

It brews very well in the Senseo coffee maker. The reason I can not give this 5 stars is the high price."},{"rating":"2","title":"senseo coffee pods","review":"We really enjoy the dark roast of these coffee pods, however, the only drawback is you always have to use 2 pods because one does not make enough coffee so in that respect they need to make larger bags of pods as they do go pretty fast and are quite expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody framed the A-Team, they are that damn good...","review":"A-Team is FRESH. The beats are very original, and the lyrics can't be faded. This unbelievable team of legendary underground mc's can't be dealt with as they will easily take a mic and rip it from the get-go. \\"Who Framed the A-Team?\\" is a very good album and even though it hasn't gotten any exposure, maybe it's good because the people who listen to commercial probably wouldn't appreciate \\"real hip-hop\\" anyway. Maybe they just don't deserve to hear good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"WCW Slamboree 1996 review","review":"Big Lipped Alligator Moment? Try Big Lipped Alligator PPV. You think with a tournament like this something would be accompliced but no. The wrestling was second to third rate with only the Cruiserweight & US title matches bring good solid matches but still not enough to save the PPV. The stinker of the tournament was the match between the team of Booker T & Road Warrior Animal against the team of Lex luger & Road Warrior Hawk. The Lord of the Ring battle royal was a rip-off becuase the winner of the battle royal(DDP) was stripped of the his title shot over the fact that despite not bring elimated and only ONE of his feet hitting the floor. STUPID!!! The main event match for the WCW world heavyweight championship between Sting & The Giant was just as bad as the Bret Hart-Yokozuna match at Wrestlemania 9. I give this PPV a 1 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent matches, but lacked...","review":"The show lacked. Nothing big happend like in most pay per views. ddp, who no one expected to, won the battlebowl. the final battle bowl match was filled with mid carders . they shoudlve put eddie and arn in there, that couldve been cool. konnan vs. liger was decent as was the cw title match. I really liked the main event though."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"Battle bowl was very disappointing. There were too many jobbers. If it could've had Luger, Arn Anderson, Eddy Guerrero, and Chris Benoit, the battle royal would've stolen the show. The main event was great, especially if you're a fan of the history of WCW in the mid 90s. Luger, Sting's friend, was a member of the Dungeon of Doom until Jimmy Hart betrayed him and sided with the Giant. Sting vs. Giant was the main event, and Jimmy Hart had to be handcuffed with Lex Luger. It was a great look back at the dungeon of doom and what happened with them. Dean Malenko vs. Brad Armstrong was good if you're a fan of the iceman and his classic submission style. However, if you're one of those people who chants \\"boring\\" during Lance Storm matches, then this isn't for you. The US title match was good. Lots of unique Mexican style. Overall, good ppv. I recommend to rent it. If you really wanna know what's worth buying from 1996, go with Bash at the Beach, World War 3, or the Great American Bash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very exciting","review":"great main event between giant and sting.

It was very disappointing! Definitely not worth buying. It did not help me in any way to decide whether adoption is for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written/Lacks the Erotic","review":"This book attempts to write erotic stories about real people, however not only are the story not at all erotic or even close to sensual they are better descrided as a collection of stories about unhealthy lesbian relationships (one about a women who cheats on a lover with a friend who is a manic, sex crazed manic and cant come). That story like a few others begin and end without ever having anything erotic happen (such as two people getting together in a doing things to and for each other for longer then 2 sentences). Other stories are long and boring. Most of the main character are annoying and perdictable. Not recommend even to readers who are easy to please in terms of erotica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Remarkable Erotica","review":"What makes this a fine collection of stories is that the people in them are wholly human. While that which drives us is quite often the erotic, it is within the context of a real life, and that is how these stories are told. For me that just makes them all the more compelling. Woof. Also, the fact that this is a remarkable writer, stylewise, is another reason to try this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music, Horribly Produced","review":"The songs on this album are all outstanding, but any Specials or Desmond Dekker fans out there are in for a disappointment. The producers decided to run all the instruments and vocals through a reverb effect in an apparent attempt to replicate Phil Spector's Wall Of Sound. In addition, most of the tracks are overrun by sustained synthesizer chords. Ska's catchiest attribute is its sharp rhythms, but the morons in the booth ruined it by drowning out the quality. What's their motivation? Lord knows, but I've always detested producers who try to become part of the act themselves by manipulating the message instead of fine-tuning it. Close your eyes, and you'll think you're trapped in some horrible karaoke bar. These two classic acts deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"have owned for over 5 years","review":"We purchased an earlier version of this item and it started right up and worked fine out of the box. Then some time passed -- by the time it was two years old the rubber components were crumbling and cracking. I put gas in and it leaked back out. The gas lines had cracked and needed replacing. After replacing all the lines and putting in a new spark plug it started right up. However after a couple tanks of gas the plug would need replacing again.

Fixed that, now it runs but no voltage.Brought it back to the same authorized repair store, Owner refused to fix due to the last payment dispute with Kipor factory.Emailed to Kipor authorized distributor, their reply was to bring back to the same authorized repair store.

It ran for another 3 hours. Has quit again New oil is dirty, afraid to look farther.Even when running, it's very noisy, the sound being unacceptable even 100 yards away, it's hard on fuel. And it fails. One gets these generators for power when all else fails.

Had to buy another one, can't figure it out..Also, it's not as quiet as the Honda of the same size.. it is significantly louder for the first hour or so..Had it for one year and one months, used once per week, a total of probably 300 to 400 hours.. if you get lucky and get one without this mystery-problem, I would say it's an okay unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kipor Bad Service..DO NOT BUY","review":"The 1000 Watt Sinemaster will blow the $200 circuit board if you approach 800 Watts...not even the 1000 Watt.

It is great for powering our tv, dish receiver, and stereo. We even plug in a crockpot every once a while. We replaced a Coleman powermate and the noise difference is night and day. We can usually make it about 6 hours on a tank of gas, so it is very efficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent? Seriously?","review":"Would have liked to purchase this book, but I would have needed to liquidate at least an oz. of Gold to do so. I would normally expect a price like this for a college text book, but this is a software users guide. I guess the model here is give the software away, then use extortion to get a manual to figure out how to use it. Very disappointing.

You can't really judge them on these few songs but this is definitely a good start. A-M-Y-(That Spells Amy) is worth the purchase price all by itself"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Single!","review":"This single is great. Even though the songs sound almost the same, that is what you expect from a single right? The problem is that the \\"Album Version\\" is not the album version. The real album version is the \\"Rap Version\\". It's just that they released this single before they planned out the album. But this is a great single!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no talent","review":"I tried to listen and appreciate some talent, but I just can't see it. If your standards are high, say Brandy, Monica, Destiny's Child then this kind of music just won't be sufficient. It's not all about the beat; their needs to be some talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great add to your library","review":"This is one of the most-thumbed books on my shelves (a little less so than \\"medium Rudin\\"). I look here for facts about metric spaces, topological spaces, and the other \\"basic\\" topics that make up the beginning of the book.Because it's Russian, it's probably only suitable for advanced undergraduates and above. Even though the price has gone up by half since I bought it ten years ago, I'd still recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"seems ok at first glance...","review":"..but has inadmissable lapses in rigor. The first shock came when this book \\"proved\\" that every infinite set has a countable subset, without even mentioning that the axiom of choice is necessary for this. In another place, a theorem proof took a set satisfying certain assumptions, removed elements from it according to some procedure, and went on assuming that the reduced set still satisfied the assumptions. This is the general attitude of this text. It's clear and fresh, but the proofs just aren't up to standard. We are dealing with a subject here whose sole purpose is precise aximatization, and painstaikingly rigorous proofs...but this book seems to ignore this attention to detail.Get the text only as a light reading supplement....but don't read it for it's rigor, because there isn't any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Siverman spoiled Kolmogorv","review":"This is one of many Dover's book where the editor Silverma tryed to ''improve'' the original version of a book.Not having the stature of the authors, the editor failed to understand that no one should try to mess with other's people book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Motivated","review":"This is a most beautiful exposition of Analysis going upto graduate level! The wonderful thing about the book is the examples, examples, examples! Every definition and many of the theorems are followed by concrete examples, many of them closely related to familiar notions such as the real line or R^n. He begins measure theory by constrution of measures on plane sets, then proceeds to generalize, one example of the conrcrete approach in the book. Kolmogorov also provided us with the axiomatics of Functional Analysis in 3 clear chapters.I heartily recommend this book as a stop-over before ,say, a study of Rudin's Real and Complex whose expostion (especially of measure theory) is as abstract as it is beautiful.And then of course, enough cannot be said about the price.....!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy \\"Elements of the Theory of Functions and Functional Analysis\\"","review":"I speak Russian and read it so-so - this is not the original work of Kolmogorov and Fomin but is a \\"freely\\" translated version. Unfortunately, \\"free\\" is not always \\"correct\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One good title for this book would be: Foundations of Functional Analysis","review":"This book is written in the style Theorem-proof-theorem-proof-...It has hundreds of theorems, hundreds of problems, dozens of lemmas, dozens of examples and remarks.The proofs are informal and easy to follow. The problems are theoretical but are not difficult. Some of them have hints that are true solutions.I enjoyed the chapters about Theory of sets, Linear Operators, Measure, Integration, Differenciability, and the pages about Generalized Functions.I think that the chapters about Topological Spaces and Linear Functions could be more intuitive. Also, the Weak Topology is presented very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"95% as good as Big Rudin, but 0.001% of the price","review":"This book is exceptionally well written and planned out. I rate it as around 95% as good as Big Rudin, which means it's probably better than most Real Analysis books out there.You will actually \\"understand\\" the motivation and purpose of the theories as you read through the book. It's rigorous, yet still inspiring and has sufficient examples to hammer ideas home. It's one of those rare books that is rigorous but still captures your interest enough to prevent you from walking away every 10 min. of reading.For the price Dover charges for this one, I seriously think it's a steal. I'd even buy it for $50, which is still a bargain because the quality of the book is much better than those $100 books table props out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T buy this book!","review":"This is not the original work. Just like Emily Dickinson's poems, sometimes you get an \\"edited\\" version of a beautiful mathematical work. I am SO sorry that I bought this book. Besides the problem with messing with a finished work, there are serious errors in proofs all over the book.GetElements of the Theory of Functions and Functional Analysisinstead (also by Dover)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Bad Book","review":"I didn't like this book at first because it wasn't what I expected. I think the word \\"introductory\\" should be removed from the title. It's actually not an introductory book. I would recommend this book for graduate studies. Most real analysis courses at the graduate level focus on the measure theory and integration. However, I appreciate this book more now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"I thought this author's interesting style was better than the other biographies on Darrow in the library.When Darrow found that the McNamaras were responsible for destroying bridges: \\"He felt like a man with a rumbling volcano in his pocket, trying to hold back the eruption with his naked hand.\\" (p. 278)Does this quote sound odd to anyone else?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biography of a myth","review":"Clarence Darrow is highly over-rated as a trial attorney. Many of his verdicts in Cook County were the result of his bribes to selected jurors. He lost his most famous cases- Loeb and Leopold, and Scopes. Darrow was driven by a hardline socialist dogma, but he still represented corporations when he needed the money. Irving Stone, the author, has been revealed as a Soviet agent in the Venona transcripts. His views about Darrow are biased with his twisted view of American society. If you read this book,realize that it is not an objective biography about Darrow, but a propaganda piece instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"a reader\\" is highly biased reviewer","review":"A quick search shows that \\"a reader\\" appears again and again in reviews of books about Darrow, and makes repeated, unsubstantiated and biting attacks on the great trial lawyer. These are obvious vendettas, not reviews worth considering. The reviewer neither identifies himself or herself properly (i.e., doesn't have the courtesy to take ownership of the criticisms); nor is any substantial evidence offered - only thin opinions that appear to be more slander than thoughtful evaluation. Darrow, for all his faults, deserves better treatment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relive the mood of this classic film","review":"For anyone affected by the atmosphere of Hitchcock's sorely underrated film, this CD is a necessity. It is one of Herrmann's subtlest, yet most effective, scores, and the opportunity to listen to it again cannot be passed up. It is customary, for fans of the film, to refer to the autumnal New England scenery, but rightly so. It was Hitchcock's choice of location that makes the film, in my opinion, and relistening to Herrmann's music paints the picture all over again, conjuring up (for those who know the film, of course), sumptous images of luscious green meadows, rusty-coloured arbers, and reds, yellows and browns of every description. I cannot get enough of this CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE SAME HELIX","review":"I don't like when hard rockers \\"Tone it down\\". I really loved this band up until this album. It is way too slow for me and not enough energy. If you really want to hear how this band rocks your ass off, get some of their earlier material and \\"CRANK IT UP\\". I think after the passing of guitarist Paul Hackman they lost their ability to produce hard rock. Sorry guys, I'm still a long time Helix fan just not of this effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good album for Helix fans.","review":"It's A Business Doing Pleasure is a really good album for true Helix fans. The opening song \\"That Day Is Gonna Come\\", dedicated to guitarist Paul Hackman, is the best track on the album.

This collection may be the best intro to the GREATEST 20th Century Author..(OK, you may not agree.) Much of Mann is difficult and dense,even for me, a longtime devotee. In this collection, start off with MARIO, a superior look at the sacred and profane. We find a German tourist and his young family in Italy going into a seemingly harmless carnival-type show. The author's portrait of the innocent young is itself worth the entire book,their enchantment at the acts,until an ugly mesmorist makes his appearance performing seemingly impossible tricks on members of the crowd. Slowly, the innocent crowd has been hooked, the children awed by the whole thing, until the final,inevitable end. Reading this,I thought,\\"Are there really people out there who can perform such acts?\\" Who knows, but this story is surely a classic,along with the six others, mainly described in other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to learn Border Manager","review":"This is a great introduction to Novell's Border Manager.

Of course, I may like them more because I try to look at my own dreams for the odd concrete element like the tooth that the priest kept or the car lighter that glowed and brought the family together.

I'm less insulted by any monetary cost than the timethat I spent reading almost a third of the 300 pages presented here, thinking that the reviews couldn't have been that\\"off\\". Antecedents are crossed, mixed up, or nonexistent. There is no poetic merit in the awkward sentence constructions.The story lines lose impact when the language of each story is so disorganized. I can not recommend this book and wonder atthe other favorable reviews. I do not agree, and would never recommend this book to a friend.Note that: this book was originally published in French, so I can not see whether (a) the backwards constructions existed in French,or (b) the translation into English lost original meaning and morphed the book into something awkward and uncomfortable to read.Perhaps the original French doesn't have all the problems.

And the kit is missing T1-T7 and T9 Torx bits, which is exactly what I needed to deconstruct some old hard drives.To be fair, the product description clearly states which Torx bits come with the kit. I just wish they had replaced some of the larger flat-head and Phillips bits with the smaller Torx bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned It","review":"I ordered this kit because I needed the T5 to fix a cell phone. When it arrived the only piece that was defective was the T5! Ugh! Luckily Amazon makes returns easy but unfortunately I'll have to buy from a different vendor.It was as if the bit never got molded and was a solid blank piece and was bigger than the T7. I'll order a different set that's on Amazon and I should be good.I gave it an extra star since it was actually a decent looking kit if I had use for the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"We saw this movie (in VHS) with my daughter long time ago, now we saw it again with my grandaughter.

I would probably give it 4 stars if a widescreen option was include. It is ashame that this classic had to be cut up like this.

Also some supplements of some kind should be included also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"I've never felt the need to write a product review before, however, this one is so bad, I had to. I am by no means a person that is worried about HD quality and such, but this DVD's quality is so terrible, the picture is grainy, it was never digitally remastered and its hard to watch, its just horrible. Plus, this movie was bought for a toddler and I think a lot of the scenes are completely inappropriate for children that young. This is a terrible DVD, for the quality and the movie itself, speaking as the mom of a toddler, for older children it might be more tolerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The land before time","review":"My son loves this movie it is an amazing childrens short film that is sure to capture their attention if they are in to dinosaurs.

I know it's pretty hard to do with a sealed DVD, but make sure you're working with a seller who will refund your purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary for small children; contains name-calling and teasing","review":"This series of videos is scary for young children. Do not let the G rating fool you. I watched the video with my three year old son who loves dinosaurs and he was scared during several of the scenes. Also there is a lot of name-calling and teasing in the videos. Not something I want my child learning. Very poorly done story lines. Pick Dinosaur Train or Dino Dan instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save yourself the trouble...","review":"This is by far my least favorite in the Land Before Time series.

I had the VHS saved for my little one when he was old enough to see it...then I put the VHS in and BOOM, the darn player ate the movie I had for 15yrs! So I purchased this DVD, and I was so surprised when the quality really was that of a VHS. I have many DVD's and this one is 'almost' as bad as when we do play a VHS tape (yes I still have those as I have 35 Disney movies I dont have the money to get DVD's of). The dvde only includes the movie and chapter selections.Being and 'Anniversary Edition' you would think the quality would be better. Its very grainy, dark and doesnt look very good. Not impressed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, TERRIBLE DVD quality","review":"This is a great movie I recall from my childhood, but upon buying it to share with my family, I was appalled at how poor the DVD quality is. Aside from the lack of widescreen, the video is very grainy, to a point that had you not known you might think this movie was animated in the 1960s. It's a shame at the price and for an \\"Anniversary Edition\\" more care wasn't taken to provide a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Land Before Time- Anniversary Edition","review":"I wouldn't recommend this movie until it gets remastered. It was of very poor quality. I can't wait until they remaster this movie, I loved it as a child and would love to watch it again.

Don't settle for such terrible quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Widescreen Anamorphic?","review":"One more day 'til it hits the street... God I hope it's in anamorphic widescreen!~~~~~~~~~~~Edited: It is NOT widescreen anamorphic!!! What a truck load waste of time and energy I spent stretching my neck waiting for this one! Shows very little care went into this DVD release by the studio. Evidently all they did was reprinting the material they already had from the VHS days and made DVDs out of it. Guess it wouldn't be as profitable to actually do some work and restore the original film for theatrical release before selling the DVDs for money. I'd give ZERO star if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect movie, but a t horrible DVD","review":"Don Bluth's masterpiece, as if it hadn't had enough assualt with the endless terrible sequels, is now forced to endure another indignity: this DVD release. The original fans of this movie are grown up now, and the publishers should realize this and release a version with actual extras. Widescreen, commentary, and storyboards, to name just a few, would be wonderful. It would help if they cleaned up the picture, too; my 15+ year old VHS copy has better images."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My two year old grandson loves this movie. The only complaint he has is that there are not more sharp tooth dinosaurs in this movie.

This is a great movie for children of all ages, and for families to enjoy a wholesome film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Land Before Time Review DVD","review":"Love, Love LOVE this movie! its just like i remembered from my childhood. The narrator's voice bring back warm fuzzy feelings! And DVD version was fine. definitely not high definition. but at least as good as it aways was on VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original is the best","review":"This is, and probably always will be, my all time foremost favorite film from my childhood. The sequals are cute, charming, and spell no negative influences that other cartoons seem to be, but they could never be as beautifully animated and scripted as the original. Even if Don Bluth hasn't grasped this \\"Disney Machine\\" as you've put it, it doesn't mean it's less honorable; some people actually like traditional animation, thank you very much.This certainly deserves five stars; If I could I'd give it ten, but I don't have that option I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This movie is basically about several dino friends who are on a journey to the Great Valley. The movie has several touching parts, but I thought the cutest part was when Littelfoot was born. This movie is not scary for kids, and teaches good lessons on several subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching story with good animation","review":"This is the best film I've seen from Don Bluth (and my 4-year-old daughter loves it). The story is really moving -- all about love, death, faith, and courage. The humor works (unlike in other Bluth movies), the landscape (inspired by the dinosaur sequence in \\"Fantasia\\") is striking, and the symphonic score is good, with themes for each character. Speaking of characters, the dinosaurs really have personalities. A good experience for kids and parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my girls can't get enough of Little Foot!","review":"My (almost)3 and 5 yr old girls love these movies. this is the favorite of course, being the first one. I don't mind watching it again and again with them. good lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"god-awful","review":"This was a real disappointment. It has the look of a made-for-TV film and perhaps it was. I don't care to find out. But the small numbers of soldiers in the \\"battles\\" and the small and cheaply made sets remind me of that terrible cyclops in Rome made-for-TV show with poor old Eric Roberts looking as out of his element in that one as Powers Boothe looks in Attila. Boothe looked so wrong for the part he might as well have been wearing a leisure suit in Brooklyn instead of Roman leather and metal and I was surprised at how bad his acting was. And other casting was terrible right down to warm, loving, sensitive, blue-eyed Huns. Nearly the entire show is about the personal animosities of various individuals. More of a soap opera than an epic. There's even a character who uses sympathetic magic to suffer the wounds of Attila at a distance! Garbage is the best word for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attila the Rock Star","review":"I didn't know Attila was tall blue eyed sexy and had rock star hair. I thought he was short, squat, ugly, sadistic, cruel and very shrewd. Well, I guess if this was historically accurate no one would watch it. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adaptation!","review":"Attila is one of the greatest history movies ever made like Braveheart. It has love, compassion, action, great costumes, and a magnificent plot. A great movie and a must see for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first encounter with Attilla","review":"I was watching tv one Sunday night in 2001 when this new mini series came on. I saw that it was going to be a historical and most likely bloody movie but my husband seemed to be interested so I just picked up my puzzle book and sat back to tax my brain. Well that lasted about ten minutes or so because when Attilla (Gerard Butler) came on the scene I couldn't take my eyes off of him. As time went by I found myself loving this movie and now it wasn't just because of Attilla GB but the movie itself was riviting. The scenes in Rome were incredible especially if you get the DVD and watch the making of this truly magnificant mini series. Yes, it is a bit long but well worth your time. I've read that most of the reviewers were complaining about the fact that it wasn't true to form as far as the history books go. This was not based on truth. It was based on entertainment and finally in my long winded opinion anyone who buys the DVD will be thoroughly entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"mildly entertaining, having Scottish Huns!","review":"As a student of history, I was curious to see how \\"the Scourge of God\\" was going to be handled. I went in there realizing that it would not be the exact story, but all the same I was disappointed. I would not recommend that anyone who wants to know about the real Attila gets this filem, because you will not do well on the history quiz. Case in point: In the film Attila bravely kills his older brother Bleda in a duel and then takes the throne himself. In real life the two ruled jointly until Attila had Bleda murdered. Personally, I gravitated towards Bleda in this film. It's not easy being in someone's shadow!That being said, it was actually rather fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous and silly","review":"I rented this movie because of Gerry Butler, and even though I think he's a terrific actor, this film is so silly. His scottish accent pops in and out. The story doesn't make a whole of sense. It comes off like a soap opera with over acting, and drags through most of it. Guess that's what you get with made for tv. Despite all this, if you're a Gerard Butler fan you should definitely see it because he's beyond gorgeous as Atilla. The man's sex appeal is never ending - even in a terrible film such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attila","review":"I liked this movie. I didn't realize that it was a mini series so 4 hours is a long movie. I still was very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATILLA","review":"WOW...I can't believe how bad this film was...Roman Emperor referring to his mother as \\"mummy\\" was beyond silly...bad set design, uninteresting fight scenes (blood on swords, but never on bodies), awful accents...am flabbergasted that anyone gave this film five stars...not only was it terribly inaccurate, it was terribly boring...I bought it, watched it and donated it to the laundry room the next day! Can you give -1 star?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good actors make history interesting","review":"This was a beautifully filmed movie. The battle scenes are exciting to watch. There are some well known actors in this movie about the Romans and the great Attila the Hun. Although I am not a fan of historical dramas, I enjoyed watching this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attila","review":"good movie, but very long. I think it was originally a mini-series. Hard to sit through all in one sitting, it works better to break it into a couple of sittings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismayed","review":"I bought this movie mainly because the reviews I read on Amazon, good God people, are you from Mars or someplace? Anyone who rated this movie a good picture has an incredible insane sense of good. This is possibly the worst picture ever made. Terrible directing, mostly pitiful acting, the graphic scenery is beyond exceptionaly poor. We are talking about Rome people, not Pittsburg, what was supposed to be one of the spectaculars of all time was made to look no greater than Hoboken. The warriors and soldiers that are supposed to be impressive, imposing war like hard men, look like a bunch of knock kneed old men from nursing homes. No wonder the U S of A is having such problems, A large percentage of our people do not know up from down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attila never looked this good.","review":"OK if this was about a hot guy doing a fashion show with an Atilla theme I'd say yep you are watching the right film. As for historical accuracy and realism, you can throw this right out the window. Half the film you saw the main character riding his horse looking all too good looking for a man that was really a killer. The movie was uneventful and I could see it as a less than B film. Butlers acting was just ok. Didn't do anything for me and he certainly was not meant for this role, 300 yes, Attila no. Considering he was filming Dracula 2000 at the same time, maybe he did two bombs at once. Both films were the pits."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of Attila - janietee","review":"Anyone who is a Gerard Butler fan must see and own this film. He is simply superb and it is a fast-paced action film. When this was released on A&E;, I was already enthralled by Phantom of the Opera (POTO), and didn't realize Mr. Butler was in this movie. I decided not to watch it on tv because I figured it would be violent and bloody. Well, it is pretty violent, but it depicts a violent time in world history. And with Butler in it, the decision was made. I ordered the DVD and it is wonderful. Lots of action, sweeping vistas, battles and political intrigue. I think that with the advent of POTO, people in the US will be clamoring for more of Gerard Butler. When you look at both these films -- POTO and Attila -- you see the range of which Butler is capable.He does not disappoint and the film is exciting and entertaining.As I said, quite a lot of violence in battles and personal attacks and a good deal of sexual nuance but both are within plot lines and not gratuitous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Causes interest, but is flawed","review":"Attila the Hun, greatest of all Hun warriors, man who brought the Roman Empire to its knees. Driven by a force beyond his own, a profesy to conquer the world, a man of principles and ideals... well,... not quite...The DVD portrayal of Attila is far from the historic truth about this man. The Huns were a barbarian people, they fought and won by performing terrible atrocities which would make Hitler look like a mere, petty criminal. The Huns were cruel and savage, and Attila was no exception.The movie gives us a \\"BraveHeart\\" like portrayal of Attila. And eventhough the movie does arouse curiosity and bring one of the most influential figures of his time to light, this movie must be balanced by historical truth..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attila Remembered","review":"I'm sure most people only know Attila by describing someone destructive as Attila the Hun - but thanks to this former TV mini-series the viewer is treated to an overview of the man and his times.Although not completely historically accurate, Attila presents a sweeping view of Hun society as well as the beginning of the decline of the Roman empire. The actors are excellent, especially Gerard Butler who brings Attila to life. While I question whether Attila was quite as handsome and sexy as Butler, I think it's a nice compliment to a man who's noterity has lasted over 1500 years.Thoroughly enjoyable for those who like history, costume drama and action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attila Review","review":"This movie is a very sweeping story of Attila. I never realized Attila went to Rome, but I know now. I don't know how historically correct this movie is, but it is very entertaining.

All in all, I would say a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good mini-series!","review":"An entertaining well acted mini-series.

The rest is just Hollywood stuff. The movie has a horrible plot, and the ending is just as worse. I wasted a whole afternoon whatching this movie when I could've been doing something else. Parts in this movie are really gross and disgusting. Out of all the action films I've seen, this has got to be the worst. I've studied Attila the Hun before, and the way he is in this movie is not the way he's suppose to be.

He is a great guitar player but should certainly stay away from singing. I own many of his CDs but I can never listen to them more than once. His voice is weak, and he sounds like he is singing through his nose. The tone of his voice can sometimes make you feel like you are listening to something totally out of tune. I particularly do not like his rendition of \\"John-Da Vinci's Eyes\\" in which he sounds like a reject from American idol.

That's my opinion and advice.And one other point I'd like to make is that in review number 47 the author disputes the previous review by saying that it was written a day before the book was distributed, but the review before THAT one--the very first review--was written ten days before the one Mr. Adams disputes.

I am very happy and recommend these guys with their books."},{"rating":"1","title":"not formated for kindle","review":"this book is completely jumbled. where to begin? a huge graphic is chopped up and presented page after page in the beginning. there is no decernable beginning to this . . . i can't really call it a book. the text, when you finally find it, is itself jumbled, apostrophes are goofey special characters. there is no clear chaptering. we do get an initial bio of the 'publisher', complete with picture, which could only be gotten around if you knew the kindle 'location' number where the text begins to unravel from around the 'reviews', graphics, introduction, etc.forget this sloppy, shoddy kindle 'publication'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Unknown Album of the 80's","review":"Book of Love has to be one of the all-time, best, relatively unknown groups of the 80's. I discovered them while in college, they were big on lots of college campuses here in the midwest. The first song I ever heard was Witchcraft and I was hooked!!. I bought Lullaby and their first album and eagerly awaited the other two albums to be released. Their music is fun and doesn't take it self to seriously. Great music to get you going and to keep you going!This is a must for any cd collection!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I always think I don't like this album because, musically, it's just a hair too far that side of pop, but then I always find myself reaching for it first when I want to listen to U2. It really does have an exceptional percentage of really good songs. So, I guess I'm lying to myself and I should just admit it's one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you hate rock listen to this album!!!","review":"U2 is one of the first rock bands that turned me onto rock when I pretty much only listened to rap (I still like rap). I listen to this cd like everyday! It's full of energy and emotion that we can all relate to!, listen to this cd beginning to end! no matter if you're a hip hop fan or a classical music fan!, it's full of the energy we all need once and awhile! I'm telling you you need to hear this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best rock and roll album ever recorded","review":"Perfect. From begining to end its perfect. Each song stands as its own achievement and the whole cd washes over you as a complete piece. Bono's lyrics have never been better, and his voice fits each song like a glove. The Edge pushes far beyond his trademark sound, and Larry Mullen and Adam Clayton keep the whole thing charging forward right from the start. More than a decade after its release it still crackles with freshness. With Achtung Baby, U2 looks at the world with weary eyes, aches with real-raw emotions, and hopes for something maybe just alittle bit better. That it was recorded from the vantage of superstardom is amazing. There is no posturing and preening, and they took a true career risk with it. Definitely their crowning achievement...and that's saying alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"An experience...","review":"I own a boatload of albums, but Achtung Baby is one of the most vivid albums in my collection. It's amazing how friesh it still sounds to this day. It's the perfect balance of rock and industrial. There's nothing I can really say that hasn't already been said about this great work of art. Get it!!!(I will say however that this is better than The Joshua Tree, and thats saying something. Joshua tree is great, but this one is much more consistent, which is astonishing considering that the range of sounds on this album is very wide.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uber Bad Condition","review":"Wow, what a disappointment. Don't get me wrong; I'm sure the Uber Edition is Uber Excellent, but the condition of the one I received was shameful. It had clearly been opened and had someone try and look at it as they had ripped the box that the set comes in. When you're paying over 400 bucks for a collectors edition (supposedly) you expect to get it in collectable condition; no? Not from Amazon I'm afraid. So my options are to deal with it - not likely, or send it back - which I'm doing. So who now has to pay to send a damaged item back to the US from Australia despite it clearly being Amazon's problem? Yep, good guess, me. What a joke. I have bought from Amazon for a very long time, but am starting to question it as more and more goods are damaged when they get here and it is clear they are damaged from the way they are packed. Lift your game Amazon. Just because you're number one doesn't mean you get to treat customers with contempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD Solid Disc","review":"I really enjoyed this disc alot when i got it back in 91.One is a Great song.The Fly is a catchy cut.Kinda Reminds me of Jesus Jones song around the same time.Bono SOunds Good Vocally through out.Mysterious Ways is a Solid Song.this is a Good Disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"One\\" plus 11 other songs","review":"Give yourself a lift...\\"One\\" is the only GREAT song here. The rest of the album is pretty forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MOST OVERRATED ALBUM OF ALL TIME?","review":"OK. Maybe not. There's some OK stuff here. No songs though. It's probably better than Pop. It's certainly better than Enya. Bono chooses not to sing this time out, and the rest of the band tries to compensate with effects. It doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece, Must have for your collection!","review":"This is one of the best albums of the 90's. As my favorite bands are the police and u2, I have to say this is my favorite u2 CD of all time, although I love the others such as \\"Joshua\\" and \\"War,\\" as well as the new ATYCLB. It seems to mix everything together to make a perfect album for every music listener.The first word I think of about this album, ofcourse, is ONE. I think this is one of the most moving songs I've ever heard, I still think I hear it every day. Then the album has the smash hits such as \\"mysterious ways\\" and \\"better than the real thing.\\" Then songs like \\"Wild your Wild Horses\\" and \\"end of the world\\" also were hits on the album. But all the other tracks are all amazing, and there are no skip-throughs on this CD.Hidden amongst the more \\"popular\\" songs are also great tracks like \\"the fly\\" and \\"light my way,\\" with great rhythm, and then the more mellow \\"so cruel.\\"This is a must have, no just for u2 fan, but for any MUSIC fan. A masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 IS THE REAL THING...","review":"Waiting for the laughing gas? :) Kings of reinventing themselves and progressing with the times and music of the present period without compromising artistic integrity, alienating former fans, or offending critics. This is U2, who is arguably one of the best bands of all time. Prolific, experimental, and even chameleonic at times. I say this confidently, although I have distanced myself from my adolescent obsessive-U2-fan years (must have been over a decade ago), and I can appreciate the music as an adult. This album is a carefully constructed, vivid portrait with excruciatingly good songs like \\"One\\", \\"Until the End of the World\\", \\"Mysterious Ways\\", and \\"Love is Blindness\\". Lyrics are typically brilliant, meaningful, and fitting, and of course, the music, although driven in a new direction, is still the biting, pressing, and ever-wonderful U2 we all know and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must own this CD","review":"This CD is one of the all-time-greats. Going on 10 years, it still sounds brand new. The U2 atmosphere (sound doesn't quite suffice) is entrancing, hard to escape, eventually one succumbs to the groove. Many, many remarkable lines ... \\"Love is blindness, I don't wanna see\\"...\\"You gave me nothing now that's all I got\\". There's a certain morose quality to it that is genuinely european (after the USA homage \\"Rattle and Hum\\") without being euro trash. I was an onstage security guy at the U2 Achtung Baby tour (ah, sweet college days!) and I can report that up to 80,000 people per concert were absolutely enthused by that tour. U2 is an excellent live act as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"the evolution continues","review":"What makes a successful band. Personally I believe it has to do with their ability to evolve into something new. U2 proved their ability to do just that with this album. This is the first U2 album I bought. Everything about this album shines, the guitar is graceful and to the point. Adam Clayton and Larry Mullin Jr. have proven that they can have just as much impact on the songs as Bono's liricsare second only to those done for POP. This album was in my mind the best of 1991 and not REM's Out of Time(though that is a good album too) but if you're looking for an album that you can play over and over again without getting sick of the songs, or, you want something to listen to while doing your homework, or need something to get the blood flowing, This album is for YOU."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't like u2 but ths album is ok","review":"u2 is kind of annoying to me, but this album is one i had when i was younger so i bought it used. i listen to it occasionally and like the song \\"one\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't get it","review":"Why do the dvds not work in my dvd player. this is bull s***.

We usually never agree on anyhting, but we both firmly agreed that the winner of THE MOST OVERRATED ROCK BAND OF ALL TIME went straight to U2. Sure theyve got a couple of good songs, but that hardly puts them on the summit of great artists. We asked a few customers who walked in the store for thier opinions on the subject, and I was shocked that every single customer ages 15 to 45 thought we were right.

Boo, you suck. If Bonehead wasn't hob-nobbing with the pope or leaders you wouldn't have this MTV hype driven nonsense top polls and fool people into thinking they matter.I leave you with an excellent commentary by the ever wise, George Harrison: \\"You know what irritates me about modern music, it's all based on ego. Look at a group like U2. BONO and his band are so egocentric... The more you jump around, the bigger your hat is, the more people listen to your music... The only important thing is to sell, and make money. It's nothing to do with talent. Today there are groups who sell a lot of records and then disappear immediately. Will we remember U2 in 30 years? I doubt it.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This was the end of U2 that I loved - and I was a fanatic - and still am a fanatic of the 'early U2' (ie. I still own and enjoy everything - and I mean everything - before Actung Baby). It was obviously a business decision (and a very successful one) for the band to go in this direction but what a musical disappointment. The story for U2 pretty much ended here ('Vertigo' is the main exception). 'One' is the only great song (up there with the best U2 songs) and the only reason I still keep Achtung Baby. The rest is boring dance crap or just plain boring. I can't think of another rock album in history which is so massively overrated. Then again why bother trying - I'd rather get another beer and put on 'I Will Follow', 'Streets Have No Name' or even 'Another Day'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome U2 collection","review":"The Super Deluxe version of Achtung Baby is well worth the money. All the dvd's and cd's are well done. The hardback book and lithographs are a must for any U2 fan.I love this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"my very favorite u2 album","review":"well i'm not a huge fan of this band, i don't really like any of their other recordings but damn this is just so good. layers of sound fill every song, every listen uncovers something new. which is precisely what the other u2 albums lack, and why they bore after repeated listens. considering there are 265 reviews here w/ a 5-star average there's probably not too much i can add that hasn't been said by someone else. so i will just say this: all the praise is deserved, if you don't have this album buy it right now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest CDs of all time","review":"Along with Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Exile on Main Street, Achtung Baby stands as one of the three greatest rock albums ever made...topping even The Joshua Tree. This is an essential CD to any serious music fan or collector. Achtung Baby is the most amazing reinvention of an established superstar band....ever. Not only did they pull it off creatively, but they managed to keep their legion of fans and add a few more along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best set","review":"Every song on this album is amazing--from the anthemic \\"One\\" to the electo-driven \\"Even Better han the Real Thing.\\" Here, U2 proves a sort of sonic poetry which truly sparkles on every cut. Besides the music, the album photography & design is also excellent. A perfect CD for soul searching, love making, & dancing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of U2's greatest","review":"Achtung Baby is a great album and necessary for any fan of U2's work. The powerhouse of the album \\"One\\" gets support from \\"Mysterious Ways\\", \\"Who's Gonna Ride your Wild Horses\\", and \\"The Fly\\". The underlying tones of \\"One\\" make this album perfectly suited to people the world over lost in their own seclusion. The sounds of a man, Bono, yearning for peace and love in the world are emphasized by this album. Purchasing this will be a tremendous benefit to yourself and your music life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!!","review":"Certainly the best album of the 1990s and one of the greatest albums of all time. Interestingly, unlike The Joshua Tree, none of the 12 tracks on this album would be considered smash hits (I don't think any of the tracks did particularly well on the singles charts). But as a whole, the album is MUCH, MUCH bigger than its elements! It is darker, more complex, more sexual than the previous albums; at times hypnotic, and at times incredibly romantic. At the time of its release, the world of music was in midst of a revolution. Grunge and alternative rock were the order of the day. Achtung Baby was as far from that musical style as The Joshua Tree was from 80s Heavy Metal and Pop. However, like a true classic, the album has outlived the fads of its time and continues to sound fresher than ever. I am sure I will still be listening to it 10 years from today."},{"rating":"2","title":"DARK","review":"I have probably listened to this CD a couple of hundred of times (it was on a constant rotation on my car CD player - when the car was stolen and recovered, they left the CD player -and Madonna CD, ha, but took AB). Needless to say, it was immediately replaced. Dark, brooding, athmospheric. Needs to be listened as a whole, over and over again, on good quality equipment.Every time I listen to it, I find something new. Warning: can provoke bouts of depression in usually upbeat people, if they take time to listen to the lyrics (Especially \\"The End of The World). Don't forget the Prozac, and become immersed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminal, Classic U2","review":"I got this album after hearing the samples and praise from anyone I asked about it. I must admit, at first I was severely disappointed. I found that I only liked a few of these songs. Now this is unquestionably my favorite U2 record and one of my favorite albums alongside Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\", Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\", and Muse's \\"Black Holes and Revelations\\".This was referred to as \\"the sound of men chopping down the Joshua Tree.\\" I hear why. This CD is nothing like its predecessors. U2 has taken there musical style to new and inventive heights with this. Each of these songs are memorable. One is beautiful, Zoo Station, Even Better Than The Real Thing, and The Fly make great use of distortion, as well as being very catchy.Overall this album deserves the praise being heaped upon it. If you you're looking at this album you have great taste in music, for this is a musical classic as much as \\"The Three Musketeers\\" is a literary classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"not nearly as good as the joshua tree","review":"i'm one of the few people that believe u2 went down the toilet with this record. i loved \\"the joshua tree\\" and played it all the time, but this record did nothing for me, but mildly interested me with the cut \\"mysterious ways\\". spring instead for \\"joshua tree\\" or greatest hits (with my favorite song pride) instead unless you live for techno stuff more than guitars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"I've been waiting for this to be remastered for some time, it does't dissapoint. Packaging is minimal and the extra songs, although I previously had them, are nice to be all on one disc. The sound is great, the re-master brings out parts that were buried in the mix and really helps to focus on the overall mood of the recordings. THis was accomplished without taking anything away from the original. BRAVO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the nineties, now stay home!","review":"This album ushered in a decade that turned sour with boy bands and gangsta rap. While I dont't really have a problem with rap(Which I think is hysterical!), there really wasn't anybody doing anything to keep this momentum going. Including U2 themselves. This album is a timeless masterpeice on par(though not equal because of the sheer influence of it)Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. People may not agree with this because they either don't understand or were never there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar U2","review":"Achtung Baby is U2 at its best. This style, music, world changing album is fantastic, be sure to check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone who likes U2 and/or good music, achtung!","review":"Achtung is U2's second best album to The Joshua Tree, so, if you're getting into them, get the latter, then the former. Anyway, I'm getting off track. This is just really cool. It starts out with Zoo Station which sends chills up my spine, goes through some great rockers, then ends with the slow \\"Love Is Blindness\\". Yet, one thing I realized while listening to this was; this is wierd. Really, really wierd. But it's great. Get it now, even though it takes a few listens to appreciate. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Nice Collector's 'must have'.","review":"I've been a somewhat U2 fan since the mid-to-late 80's and found that \\"Achtung Baby\\" was a worthy and edgy album of the 90's. After reading that this is becoming rare and hard to find, I ran down to Best-Buy and found thier last copy. First off, this is heavy, both in content and weight (no dolly required), but still a substantial box-set none the less. The music is impressive and the extra's are excellent, as are the DVD's. I only wish Pink Floyd would've gone this route instead of the \\"Immersion\\" fiasco. It is worth the $ and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"this time U2 short changes fans","review":"Disc 2 has all too familiar outtakes & B-sides while the more rare outtakes can only be had on the super expensive box set. i think classic rock fans are starting to get tired of being milked by these \\"deluxe\\" re-releases. no wonder cd sales are dropping. would it hurt the labels to release a single disc remaster & add a free bonus disc of outtakes? i think that would get better favor from consumers & probably sell a lot more copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably my favorite U@ collectible now....","review":"While I ordered this the first day that it became available for preorder, I am glad that the price dropped by $300 and that Amazon was able to price adjust. I was sure my husband would have been killed me if he saw the original price! Amazon is great for that, so I am giving them a great review for their price protection and adjustments. While I was willing to pay the price that this set was orignally set at, the final $400+ is much better! I will say that the collection is fantastic and filled with some awesome goodies for diehard U2 fans. I agree with the other reviewers that in that if you are only interested in the music, download it. This collection is more for the goodies and the physical art than the music which you already mostly have! I am giving it an A++++ review - well worth the money if you love U2. I played with mine and looked through it for 3 hours, and I'm still not done going through it. LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"U2's magnum opus (at least so far)","review":"Usually you'll find that bands release albums with one or two great songs, and the rest is filler. Not so with Achtung Baby. Most of the tracks were excellent; they should have been hits in their own right. U2 is a great band, and here they're at their best. With any luck, they'll keep churning out good music for many years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!!!","review":"I am not the biggest U2 fan in the world. Indeed I do find them mostly talked up beyond their true quality as a band. Having said that, this is a genuinely great CD. See I never thought I would admit it, but it does sit happily in my CD collection with a whole host of other classic albums. My problem with U2 generally is they release great singles then the complete album usually disappoints. I am happy to say this one does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"After fostering a solemn public image for years, U2 loosened up on Achtung Baby, a prescient mix of sleek rock and ulsing Euro grooves."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album of all time...","review":"I'm a music obsessed person. So it's hard to pick one album as my favorite of all time, but this one is definitely it! I broke my copy sometime last year and I was devastated. I just got a new one-thank GOD!-and it was so nice to be able to listen to this album again. U2 definitely needs to get back to where Achtung Baby took them.

This album does it all, from ballad to rock U2 covers all their strengths and goes into uncharted territory with this work. The song, \\"One\\" is worth buying the CD all on it's own. Sure, \\"Mysterious Ways\\" is a great song, but \\"One,\\" so symbolic of where the band was at the time is one of U2's best tracks ever. \\"One\\" is not only one of the great U2 songs of all time, but the video for one was a classic as well.

Of the many organ recitals I have heard on the great Klais organ of this abbey, I thought it truly was one of the greatest. Because of this, I obtained a copy of her recording Chosen Tunes, from Grace Cathedral, San Francisco. Though the space and organ are different, in this recorded performance I hear the same genius and virtuosity which I heard live at the Himmerod Abbey. While it is always difficult to fully appreciate a pipe organ from a recording, this recording does give a wonderful glimpse of the phenomenal sound of the organ and acoustic at Grace Cathedral.I hope that in the near future Dr. Matthews will make more recordings and return to Germany to perform once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The talent of genius shines again!","review":"To my mind, Bertrand Russell belongs to a very reduced of a quartet of the most emblematic and smart thinkers of the past Century (the other would be Aldous Huxley, Ortega y Gasset and Arthur Koestler).His prodigious erudition is carved in relief with this admirable and invaluable essay through which he literally exposes with meridian lucidity, key reflections derived and based on fundamental bibliography around a well constructed corpus of items that nourish and underpin the concept of marriage. It's a text whose reading is so stimulating, exciting and encouraging that hardly will be able to be ignored for you once you have decided to undertake this task.I mean, this book is a true kaleidoscopic journey in which anthropology, social psychology, human geography, ancestral costumes, mythology and history shake hands and interweave themselves. The outcome is perhaps, one of the most solid and original essays in this discipline.Acquire it as soon as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marriage & Morals","review":"I found this book very well-written and full of information about the history of marriage, sexual ethics, and morals. Bertrand, in his usual style, examines the social problems of his time and why they exist. This book was written in 1929, but is still logical and modern in thinking. Bertrand wittily and cynically speaks out against the restrictive dogmas of sex and love: ?It would seem that it is only with the introduction of the patriarchal system that men came to desire virginity in their brides. Where the matrilineal system exists young women sow their wild oats as freely as young men, but this could not be tolerated when it became of great importance to persuade women that all intercourse outside of marriage is wicked.? I strongly recommend this book for anyone doing a research paper on love, marriage, or sexual ethics. If you?re looking for something to make you think, it?s also a great book. I give it four out of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old book, but surprisingly still interesting","review":"This book was originally published in 1929 so in many ways it is inevitably dated. But in many ways it is still fresh, and despite all the talk about \\"new morality\\", the controversies in his day still rage today. (This is the book that got Lord Russell in so much trouble at City College of New York) What is unique about this book that it addresses some of the dilemmas of domestic life. Dilemmas that are real yet apparently other writers don't have the courage to face.This book deserves to be in the library of every serious thinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listening to a genius","review":"The book is a little outdated but, as it's true for all his works,it allows you the exciting experience of seeing the world through the insight of a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"great photos","review":"I just got this camera V lux-1 few days ago. As soon I received the package, I was very excited and used the camera right away. As of now, I am testing Auto mode with different type of scenes. I have tested indoor scenes using no flash and was very amazed with the quality of the natural colors and contrast of light. The light temperature was very good, just like real natural scenes. I found the focusing speed was fast enough to capture my young restless kids. Lag time was not noticeable.Having this great quality photo camera, I am very much enjoying taking photos more now.

THEY ARE DEPRIVED OF THE MEANS OF TRANSLATING WHAT THEY KNOW INTO THOUGHTS THEY CAN THINK.\\" WHAT?!?!?!?!?!? I am sure there are lessons to be learned from this book, but between the marginal-quality, occasionally cryptic writing and the scorn the author shows in passages like this, they're lost. Forget selling this book back to the bookstore... I'm taking it straight to the recycling bin.

Metal pipes are shoved deeply into the throats of ducks and geese, reaching their stomachs. Then a lever is squeezed to pump huge amounts of corn directly into them. This makes the animals become grossly overweight in just a few weeks and their livers will expand to up to 10-12 times their normal size.I think it's absolutely shameless to just pretend all the suffering doesn't exist and that it's irrelevant to reviewing books like this one. Yes, books like these have a right to exist (free press), but so do the opinions of people like me who oppose promoting foie gras.I'm sure the recipes are amazingly tasty to many people,.... but at what prize?We have the internet now, so please google foie gras and inform yourself before making a decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"A link between martial arts and a life experience","review":"This book seems especially written for those people that think that karate is only about fighting, punching or hurting. \\"Among Warriors\\" will give you the insight that karate deserves as an art of inner strenght, humbleness and above all respect. A book where the begining or the end are not as important as the content itself, just as life is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very pleasant historical novel in Virginia","review":"One of the major assets of the novel is that the author is a female writer who gives a specific view of the Southern gentleman before and during the Civil War. It relates the education of a young boy, brought up as an aristocrat in the best Virginian tradition who grows up and becomes a real man through the ordeal of the war, the friendship of a poor white and the love of a woman. It's beautifully written, especially when dealing with nature in Virginia. Of course, the point of view is sympathetic with the Southern cause but critical of slavery.Ellen Glasgow is a major Southern writer of the beginning of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaches about the afterlife","review":"This illustrates the afterlife in a beautifully done movie.

It offers maybe a different way of looking at what's next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting","review":"I was disappointed when I saw that the movie was subtitled-I have trouble keeping up when there are subtitles-but I decided to take a chance on it because the beginning captured my interest.

It is a concept promoted by a medium and how that medium feels about the \\"good\\" he is doing for the \\"stuck in Limbo\\" folk. The movie borrows from many sources, but relies more on the Roman Catholic dogma. I gave it 2 stars because this medium gave his book which I'd call a \\"religious stew\\", a shined and polished look, and patted himself on the back all at once. This movie is a great example of how people can make money off stew that has absolutely no nutritional value."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE!","review":"What a great film! I've never been a fan of subtitles (the film is in Portuguese) but you don't even realize it because the subject matter is so engaging and interesting.

The way this movie tells the story is visually and spiritually impressive.

I felt the film was great if you adhere to the western version of heaven and hell, redemption and being \\"saved\\". It appears to me that those who feel they are \\"saved\\" want to \\"see\\" what the ever after might be like for them. This film appears to give you a glimpse of what it MIGHT be like.

Then I became frustrated at the padded, glacial, bloated books that have made up the second half. Then I read Path of Daggers, lots of interesting things happened and it looked like the plot was warming up.Then came Crossroads of Twilight...after reading it I can say nearly half to two thirds of the book could have been simply left on the cutting room floor and nobody would be the wiser. Jordan has proven he is a detailed writer at the cost of having an engaging series. More word count is spent on characters that the reader will never see again, much less care about care about.This series is becoming like a siege, I have invested the time reading The Wheel of Time and know I will tough it out. How much worse could it get? Only if there are 10 more books after this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Wheel of Time... Who Cares??","review":"Robert Jordan has suceeded in losing a fan. A series that started out with a bang is continuing with a huge yawn. Jordan has apparently decided that character development is more necessary than plot, and that confusing, intricate detail is more necessary than any semblance of action. One wonders if his main goal is writing the longest novel in the history of mankind, rather than bringing any kind of closure to what started as an immensely interesting series of books. His \\"Wheel of Time\\" needs to have the axle greased, that flat fixed, and put into motion towards a conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book of the series","review":"Nothing happens. People move here, they go there - all with no effect or advancement of the main story. No motivations of any significance are revealed. No battles are fought. No fights. No saidar or saidin used except trivial, every day usage.The whole book could have been 4 slim chapters (Rand, Perrin, Mat, White tower/Egwene) in a book where something does happen.The whole book leads up to (SPOILER HERE - look away) a possible truce with the Seanchan and Egwene getting captured through her own stupidity.Wow! What action! <-- sarcasm, if you haven't caught on.I hope Robert Jordan is reading these reviews, because he has a lot to make up for with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"700 pages...and NOTHING HAPPENED","review":"While I am not familiar with the \\"bridge\\" mentioned in an earlier review, I have certainly become familiar with the concept. I regret the money I spent on this book nearly as much as I regret the time spent reading it. Should the author ever return to the excellent skills he demonstrated in the first books in this series, I would recommend that anyone reading the series in a future generation simply skip this one - they will not miss a thing. If he does not get better soon, I would tell that future reader to skip them all.If Mr. Jordan reads these reviews, bear in mind that I will not buy another book of yours again, unless I read it first at a library. I hope you decide to actually do something in the next installment - it might lead to my return as a purchaser."},{"rating":"1","title":"No end in sight","review":"More endless conversation, more nattering women....

Worst of all, no end in sight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest in the series","review":"It's hard to give a 2/5 to a book in a series I'm very fond off, yet it's hard to find any redeeming points for Crossroads. The story stops. It literally grinds to an almost full stop. Devoting a part of the book to going over the effects of Rand's actions at the end of the previous books could have been agreeable. We after all all remember where we were 9/11 or whatever. Thus, a couple of hundred pages devoted to portraying how Rand's actions reflect on other characters and what they were doing at the time sounds like a good idea.It doesn't work, however, when you devote 800 pages and nothing, nothing at all, happens.Why the 2/5 then? Well, the writing style is the same as all previous books and chances are if you liked those, you'll at least find some redeeming points.Reading this book, I had the continuous feeling that had Mr Jordan not passed away, the series would never in a million years have concluded with book 14, the pacing was simply not there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the money.","review":"I have nothing negative to say about a single Jordan book, expect this one.Clearly this book was only written this way in order to extend the series further and sell more filler titles. At this point only every other book seemed to advance the story line, but this edition completely dropped the ball. The first two-thirds of the book is merely commentary on how all the main characters reacted to the ending of the previous novel. Nothing happens. Seriously.

He has managed to take what he learned in Vietnam and apply it to writing i.e.; How to take a great opportunity to succeed and turn it into a 10 year war with no real ending and no winners. This book drags on for hundreds of pages building characters to sickening heights then unfortunately doesn't push them over the edge to their well deserved deaths. I am sure he is building his loyal reader base up to a final battle between good and evil but he used his readership and sucked bucks without delivering the action and excitement that made this series so good. This book is a rip off of epic proportions. I don't mind paying for a quality product but this was like reading the Ishtar sequel screen play.

It turns out, there were so many other interesting things I could do, other than read this drivel.How much more money can he honestly think we will spend on this endless dreck? I want the time I spent trying to read this book back. Find something better to do with your time and don't read it.

I've enjoyed this series of books very much since I stumbled upon them. I can honestly say that this is the first book of the series that is complete and utter garbage, filler.The story moves nowhere. I can't even say nowhere fast because Jordan's flair for detail bogs you down and makes the reading slow.Hopefully in the next book Jordan will remember that the story is about the Dragon reborn and his two friends.

Very Disappointing... :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disappointing","review":"Once again Robert Jordan disappoints with \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\". I have been an avid Jordan reader since the beginning and its clear that the quality of his books has gone downhill. If I hadn't read the prior nine books, I would surely not start reading Jordan now.There is very little plot advancement in the Crossroads of Twilight. Rand doesnt even appear until the very end and you only get a glance at Nynaeve. I can't believe it took him nearly three years to write this book! One bright spot is that Crossroads of Twilight is not as bad as Path of Daggers. Wait for the paperback or check it out from the library, its just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left without satisfaction.","review":"I found myself very disappointed with book 10 when I finished. Jordan's wordiness usually entices me, but left me hanging this time. Jordan put massive amounts of description into what women were wearing, or their facial expressions, etc. and came out with a very wordy book with really nothing to say. There was really no forward movement in the storylines making it seem like this book is simply a means to make money and continue to stumble this series forward to no end. His portrayal of women leaves much to be desired with a constant view of females being catty, sly and full of ulterior motives. Even the end (where all the books usually pick up) was a yawner. I feel I wasted time in this text and am not going to recommend the series to anyone else until Jordan shows as much passion for the story as in the past. I think it's gone on even too long for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"sleeping Witches","review":"The book was the slowest ever!

Much of the novel is a reaction to the previous novel and Rand barely appears. This is a cross road indeed, with little direction or choices made by anyone. So much of the novel seems like a diversion, with new minor chracters that seem very unrelated to the saga's plots. By the end of the novel so few things happen, they could be summed up in a short pargraph, which is disappointing in a novel of this length. I may or may not continue reading this series, but this is the last book in the series I will pay for. The page turning days in this series are long gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable.","review":"I assume these books are a cry for help.

Meanwhile his editor keeps letting him do it, as she knows that after reading this glut of wasted words nobody wants him walking around loose in any case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan is lost in the wheel of words","review":"This has got to be the worst book yet in this series. I am sure that Mr. Jordan is just putting words on paper to sell another book. He has lost all support from his readers. Each successive book is worse than the others. They are dragging the reader along. Mr Jordan must love to make up female names and describe them in boring details. That is how he gets 800 pages of nothing. There is no action in this book. There is very little continuation of the story. Give it up Mr. Jordan and finish the story. Any future readers should skip this book entirely. Unless Mr. Jordan plans to finish the story in the next book, I would recommend skipping the next books also."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have an Idea","review":"I just finished a new Spenser novel by Robert P.

Yet, Mr. Parker manages to tell a complete story including an actual ending in only 291 pages.My idea is this: let's take The Wheel of Time away from Robert J. and give it to Robert P. Rand would pick up Lan, Perrin, and a couple of Asha'men, toddle off to Shayol Ghul, kick some Forsaken butt, save the world, and be home in time for dinner. Of course Rand would have to cook because Susan, I mean Min, can't cook.Wouldn't it be grand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book with a loss of purpose.","review":"I read the book when it first came out, even though I agree that the first few books were excellent and the latest have just been average.This one was terrible. The book starts developing an interesting sub-plot with Perrin chasing after an abducted Faile, and just when it gets suspensful and interesting we switch to another more confusing and less intriguing sub-plot.Never fear, right? We'll sooner or (much) later get back to the Perrin/Faile crisis, wouldn't you think? WRONG!!!! The book finishes the second and third sub-plot and forgets it even started the first one!Maybe this is no reflection on Jordan's writing abilities. Maybe the publishers insisted on deadlines or something and that this was a team effort in the making. We can only hope.I'd like to see Jordan return to form and head towards a conclusion. He could probably get it done in two books or less as long as he decides to do it.Until then, I'll stick with Terry Goodkind's novels . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"An industry problem","review":"This is not a review of the book so much as a review of the state of fantasy & sci-fi literature. We have a problem here my friends...a problem perpetuated by us, the fans. We are continually fed endless series by nearly every popular author for the sake of the allmighty dollar. The only person getting fulfilled by reading these bloated works are the author and the publisher. We, the fans, are forced to wade through up to 10,000 pages for a story that could (conceivably) be accomplished in a tight 600 page novel. Ask yourself: When was the last time you read a standalone fantasy novel?Yes I own the books, but Robert Jordan (and Tor) is one of the leading offenders in this area. Make a stand and stop buying fantasy & sci-fi series that end up turning into mindless drivel after a few books. These people (and companies) are publishing books merely for the sake of publishing and making money...not to tell us a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the end, nothing","review":"Painful to read.

It has been reduced to a muddled soap opera that progresses so slowly it cannot be called WOT but should be called Week in Review. Do not bother to read any more of this series.

The plot has yet to move significantly since book 4. The 1,000,001 character was introduced at the beginning of the book, only to have the character ignored for the rest of the book. It seems the only way to get him to finish the story is if people stop buying. So long as people keep buying, he will have no incentive to advance the plot. I wish I had my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"700 pages of brain fart","review":"Really, how could he have possibly released this?? How can he have so little respect for his fans to sell this mess? Nothing happened to any of the characters that couldn't of been told in a page or two.

Please, everyone- Pretend it stops at book 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother - It's only a status report","review":"This book is a waste of money and time. Robert Jordan spends about 700 pages telling us the status of most of our favorite characters. We spend a while with Perrin as he continues to follow his wife, Faile. We visit Mat as he continues to successfully hide Tuon from the rest of the Seanchan through two rather risky periods. We spend a while with Egwene and it is made clear that the cause of her headaches is related to Hakima (for those few who didn't catch on in book 9... or 8). We visit Elayne and Avienda very briefly. Elayne is still pregnant. A few people know. Nothing else happens. Not a single story line progresses. This is a very frustrating book if you are looking for action or resolution to at least one story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look forward to the unedited version...","review":"Robert Jordan started the Wheel of Time like he was Tolkien, or at least Terry Brooks. Accolades arrived, followed shortly by an epic editorial lapse (even by epic fantasy standards).With this book, the last, and the one before that, he's aspiring to become the Henry Darger who lucked into a publishing contract.Mr. Jordan's continually peculiar fixations and minor perversions do, however, give me hope that someday the uncensored (and unedited, naturally) \\"writer's cut\\" will emerge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad...Bad...Really Bad!","review":"I'm not going to write a detailed review.

But, the shortstop still goes home well paid and the fans are left with their wallets a little lighter and their hearts a little heavier."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm very glad that...","review":"I borrowed this one from the library. As most of the other reviewers have said this book does nothing to advance the plot. There have now been three \\"set-up\\" books with no advancement (plot, character, ect). But you do get a lot of drivel about the thread count of the pillows that a weaver in a small fishing town (that a major character has never been to or heard of) makes. Ohh, tell us more you great sage. Didn't something major happen in an earlier book that was incredibly important (hint: the taint) and you hear almost nothing about it! With all the genius that the major players are supposed to have, they act like spoiled brats with a power complex. At this point I'd like to see the Dark Lord and the Foresaken take over the world and reduce the world to ash so we're not exposed chapter after chapter of who said what to whom and what clothes someone is or is not sweating in or smoothing.Skip this one or borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"I have been reading Robert Jordan's books for years and this book was a big let down. He could have written a 50 page version and that would have been better. He would expound upon the most trivial details for pages and pages for no apparent reason. The only reason I kept on reading was that I have too much invested in this series and have grown very fond of the characters that the writer has stopped developing in any significant way. I think he has to get a better editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste!","review":"What is Jordan thinking. He is taking longer and longer to write less and less. I've been a huge fan since book one, but this book was terrible. When the series is supposedly wrapping up soon, Jordan keeps adding new characters. It's ridiculous, I feel like I need to take notes to keep track of everyone.If you like the first few books in this series, read George RR Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" insted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm... well, I'm downright dissapointed!!","review":"Don't get me wrong.I have become one of the many loyal readers enthralled with the Epic Adventure that places you right in the midst of the fantasy lives & events throughout the series. I've journeyed with thousands of others through every smile, every laugh & giggle, and even sometimes through a tear or two. But I almost couldn't wait until the end of the book, and I also skipped a few pages where the text just seemed to drag-on (no pun intended).To my astonishment there was not even a single battle that I was aware of, and I am VERY sad to say that CoT could EASILY have been left out altogether and not even missed!!!R.J. I hope the next book redeems you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money!!","review":"This book could have been knocked down to a forty pages and not lost a thing. The writing is slow and boring, the action non-existent, and the main character (the one who this WHOLE story is about) is in all of about 10 pages.Disappointed does not begin to describe my feelings. The only reason I finished this drivel was on the off chance something interesting would happen at the end. (It doesn't).Mr. Jordan & TOR books owe a big apology to all their fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"CoT Goes nowhere","review":"I don't know what happened to the Wheel of Time series, but the last few books have been largely a waste of time.

I am terribly disappointed that Robert Jordan has managed to completely derail the excellent story he started his series telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 700 page Set-Up Book, Again?","review":"Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series is my personal favorite series. I have read the entire series 4 times. Well it was until this book. Does he ever plan on ending it? The first 400 pages are about what was happening in the world at the end of th last book. At least he finally got back to Mat, but too little to late. To make a long story short, this book was by far the worst one in the series. Don't buy it in Hard Cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":":::SIGH::::What a big disappointment! Robert Jordan continues to \\"pad\\" his novels with too much background details to make this series last longer.

It is so incredibly frustrating to wait so long for each book to come out, and to then be so disappointed by the last 4 books. Please listen to all your readers and write the story like you did up until \\"A Crown of Swords\\", because I for one am fast losing my patience with the plodding pace of the last 4 books and if the next one isn't great I will no longer be reading the Wheel of Time series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not upto the Mark.","review":"It was not worth the wait.The whole book happens within a very short span.A slow slow book.I think he took the extra time to write the last 3 chapters.Thats all that was upto mark"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment. Many will stop reading WOT","review":"I do not recommend this book at all. You are better off reading chapter summaries. This book goes no where. It is one big prologue. Book 9 left off with some real good subplots that should have been drawn out in this book, but nothing happened. Nothing was answered. Only more questions came up. This is a fantasy series and this book was nothing in the realm of fantasy. Save your money. Robert Jordon has lost his tough. Im sticking to free chapter summaries for the rest of this epic. I want to find out what happens to Rand and crew but not at RJ's drawn out money hungry drab. Tor and RJ should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely My Least Favorite","review":"I've stuck with RJ through thick and thin. Like most people, I was a little frustrated with the slow plot movement of the last few books, but I also stood up for RJ, claiming the he was simply trying to make a more realistic world. And, well, isn't real life boring sometimes? But I must say that I was quite disappointed with this title. As other reviewers have said, virtually NOTHING of importance happens in this book. Some decisions are made, but the repercussions are not seen. The major events of \\"Winter's Heart\\" don't even play a minor role in this novel... in fact, most of the characters don't even know what happened yet! I really had my hopes up for this book after the climax of \\"Winter's Heart,\\" but they weren't realized. Of course I will continue to read the series, and I look forward to the next book in the hopes that it will be more along the lines of the first 5 or 6 books. I just hope it won't be TOO long of a wait this time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As The Wheel Turns ...","review":"I have been a fan of The Wheel of Time series for quite a while. Unfortunately, the quality of the books has declined quite a bit since Lord of Chaos. Robert Jordan's detailed descriptions, which originally were interesting and helped move the plot forward in the early books, have degenerated into long-winded and quite predictable blatherings that do little to advance the plot of the books.I would like to suggest the RJ change the title of the series from The Wheel of Time to \\"As The Wheel Turns\\". Certainly Mr. Jordan has discovered the daytime soap writer's gift for dragging out the smallest event into entire chapters.-Jim"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO PLOT ADVANCEMENT","review":"This book goes nowhere! Non of the loose-ends from book nine were tied in this book. In fact, you could skip it entirely and not miss anything.

They actually had action, interesting plot developments, and characters you could love or hate. Now we're burdened with too many characters, too many plotlines and sub-plotlines that it's almost impossible to keep characters straight without some sort of glossary/listing. It feels too much like Jordan's drawing this out too much, padding the series to make more books. If you're invested in the series already, wait for the paperback and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan repeats himself","review":"If I hear the phrase \\"icy blue stare\\" to describe an Aes Sedai one more time, I'm burning all of his books. This has the potential to be one of the best fantasy series of all time and Mr. Jordan is wasting his time on basking in the minutae of his world. Yes, we know there is intrigue. We know you can't trust anyone. We know everything balances on the edge of a knife. Why doesn't he just get on with it and do something already!?And has anyone noticed that almost every character in these books has begun to have the same outlook on things except for Mat?

Other reviewers haven't done justice to how little happens in this book. There are 600 some pages in this book. If you have read book nine then you know it ended with a momentous event involving a lot of magic use. The first 500 pages of this book occur BEFORE that event and leading up to it. Basically it can be summed up as every character sensing the magic use and being scare of it.Rand, the main character, doesn't even show up in the first 500 pages.You could skip this book entirely and except for the last THREE pages you wouldn't even know you had missed anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of the series","review":"I am a big fan of the WOT series. In fact I am re-reading this series from the beginning. This book must be the worst of the lot. I am tired of same old drivel repeated over and over. We all read a thousand times how imperious Aes Sedai are, how tough the wind finders and wind mistresses are, not to speak of the wise ones. It is ridiculous filler to keep reminding the reader of the same cr...p. We are not stupid.This book also has a thousand useless characters, from maids, to soldiers to Aes Sedai and on and on and on. They don't do anything, everyone is afraid of everyone else then they disappear never to make any diffrence to the story other than pages and pages of useless descriptions. I am a very patient person and I enjoy good prose and detail. This book is just detail about detail sake. 200 pages would be enough to make this book interesting. The rest of it is waste. TOR should be tarred for publishing this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there's no \\"Zero Stars\\" rating......","review":"...because this dog of a series deserves it. Like most of the folks who've written reviews, I was also enthralled by the first four or five \\"Wheel of Time\\" books, but have been increasingly disappointed since then. The quick pace and tight plotting of those first books gave way to the bloated, glacially-paced anchor-dragging navel-gazing that has come to characterize Jordan's most recent WOT books. His obvious disdain for his fans seems to be surpassed only by his greed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with all, but I'm in it for the long run.","review":"What everyone has said is true. This series has been on the decline. Jordan started out great, one of the greatest fantasy writers I had read. But gradually, the story got drawn out. Until finally, book 10, the hardest book in this series to read. And while I feel I can finish this series in one short book, I will not hold it against Jordan. He has managed to do what most can't, he has created a whole other world, and filled it with creatures and characters we only see in our imaginations. He created a story that is the work of what I feel is a genius. But unless he's got something up his sleeve, it's time to end it. Either way, I'm in this till the end. I'm so into this story that I have to finish it. I can't just let it drop off, I have to know who wins.

I've given up on Jordan ever actually wrapping things up, but it'll happen eventually. When it does, I have my bookshelf of the series waiting and I'll re-read it in sequence without having to wait years between the books, probably several times, and I'll get more pleasure each time I re-read it.

The purpose of a book is to tell a story, but with Crossroads of Twilight all Jordan does is waste paper.

I promise, I'll get the next one from my local library before I even think of laying out money for it. Squeeze extra royalty payments out of that, you pretentious goon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens","review":"Quite literally nothing happens in this book. It is like an aside rather than a main event. This is possibly the most disappointing book I have ever read in this or any other series. There are roughly 50 pages actually worth reading, essentially what you have here is a 700 page prologue.How this book took 2 years is beyond me.

The next few books in the series were pretty good as well, but after that it is a pretty linear decline into mediocrity. Crossroads of Twilight is definately the worst book in the series thus far. The entire book seems to set the stage for yet another book, which won't come for another 2 years. I had thought Winter's Heart had enough explanation of the present. I was hoping that Crossroads of Twilight would add something of substance. It's depressing that the series that really got me into fantasy in the first place has fallen so far. The only reason to read this book is the fact that it is book 10 in WOT; it would have no hope of ever standing alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"My only consolation after wasting my time reading this book is that I share the company of so many others who, though sorely disappointed at the downward spiral this series has taken, are spurred by either compulsion or sheer force of will to make it to the conclusion. Sad that I still cling to a flagging hope that the action will pick up and something interesting will happen. The series began so brilliantly, but now even if something does happen, you have to hunt for it in underneath all that endlessly repetitive and confusing fringe-twitching and shawl-shifting by hundreds of minor characters who really seem to have no reason to be there. I have to say I really suffered through this one. If there were a no-star category, it would be appropriate. You could probably skip this one and still know what's going on. I ordered #11 anyway.

I loved the second book of this series.The current incarnation is insipid. I wanted this book to end so badly so that I could hurl into my fireplace and purge myself of the experience. The taint was cleansed in the prior book, and now has attached itself to the remains of this utterly tiring tome of irritation.I want the \\"Final Battle\\" to come quickly and evaporate all the annoying, trite characters that deserve to die. There are no characters with any pathos, just random text following some meandering plot and filling a minimum page limit.Mr. Jordan, please conclude the WoT with a series of Cliffs Notes, I cannot bear to read another 700 pages of train of thought garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"crossroads of twilight","review":"i can not believe i paid money for this .... jordan has lost it and me as a fan. can you believe 24 chapters before the main person ( rand ) shows up? also, how did the male side of the one power get clean? i for one don't care if jordan ever finishes his too many story line epic,because i won't be buying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Reading reviews of this book is more entertaining than the book itself. If Jordan was attempting to deliver anything other than a cash cow for his personal fortune, he failed miserably. The book delivers no plot movement, and for those of you who have defended Mr. Jordan saying he was putting the context in place for a rousing finale, how many books of context do you need?This was once one of my favorite series, but I will never again purchase one. I found myself 500 pages with less action than occurred in the first 100 of \\"Eye of the World\\". It became a labor to pick up the book to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This must be a joke","review":"I understand the last person's thinking that this is a setup for what is to come. Unlike the last person, I do not believe that you need 3-4 books with 600+ pages to describe location and sub-characters. I can understand if Mr.Jordan decided to have the main character in his books. But one chapter for the main character(Rand)in this last installment is ridiculous. The characters that he delves more into are Perrin, Elayne, Mat and just about everyone else and their cousin. Mr.Jordan should be ashamed of himself. From the momentum of the first 4 books he was going so good. Now he is out of ideas and trying to milk his past successes for all that they are worth. Mr. Jordan, if you are listening, end the series sometime soon and move on to another profession."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Jordan Did It Again...","review":"and that he did! I really don't blame him, I blame myself more. I've been holding on to this fantasy/dream that the WOT series will return to the quality of the mid-ninties. I know, we all know, that the past few books wouldn't have even been published, nevermind bestsellers if they were books one, two, or three. What is expected? That the final few books will be amazing and worth thousands of pages of garbage we've read for the past few year...I highly doubt it! Name a series that goes from great to horrible and then back to great...maybe Friends, but that's it.My view: shed a tear and quit, never touching the WOT series again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frelling Dren","review":"How very, very sad. Unlike the earlier books of this series I found this one extremely easy to put down. It was like sitting through a lecture on \\"how is every character doing emotionally\\"I think I may in fact not even bother with the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would really rate it NEGATIVE 5 stars","review":"If you have read any of the other reviews you will see a common thread. NOTHING HAPPENS. Not one significant story line progresses in this book. Robert Jordon is trying to get as much money as he can milk out of this series. You will get a very though discussion of weavels throughout the whole book.I wish I had read this in college because I could have benefited from absolute artistry of stretching a 200 word short story into a 600 page book.I've NEVER been so disappointed in a series as I was on book 9. Crossroads of Twilight was even WORSE. I can't believe I read the whole thing, it felt more like work than pleasure.Jordon as managed to totally mess up what had the potential to be one of the best series in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please end something!!","review":"680 pages later, and not one thing resolved. If anything, there are less things resolved. The tower is still divided, Faile is still captive, Mat still isnt married, who knows what is going on with the Black Tower, and Rand is barely in the book. Save yourself twenty dollars, buy it in paperback, so maybe after you read it will have less time to wait for a plot line to end. I have been waiting close to 7 years for the tower to be united, and i am 20. Thats more than a third of my life. Some of the other lines are just as old. If Robert Jordan has a heart attack before he closes some of these......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Wheel of Time book yet","review":"Don't get me wrong I love the wheel of time series, but after waiting so long for Book 10 to come out I feel cheated by Crossroads of Twightlight. This book is ~700 pages long but I think that the main plot is farther behind now than when book 9 ended. Basically through out the whole book nothing happens, not a single thing. If Seinfeld was a show about nothing, then Crossroads of Twightlight is a book about nothing. All your favorite characters are there, but they each have ~2 chapters worth of doing nothing in the beginning and middle of the book followed by another brief chapter of doing nothing at the very end of the book.I would advise WoT fans to skip this book entirely and move straight to book 11 when it comes out in another 2-3 years *sigh*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads to NoWhere","review":"This is a huge waste of money and time. The story is going nowhere at a snail's pace. I love this world and the characters and I realize this is Mr. Jordan's golden goose, but there is a limit to how many of these filler books people are willing to purchase or read. Rand barely figures in this volume, Nynaeve and Lan are afterthoughts. The chapters written around Elayne and Aviendha are truely teeth gratingly annoying and tedious and the chapters devoted to Egwene and the assorted, and impossible to keep straight, Aes Sedai she consorts with are not much better. Even the usually reliable Matrim is unentertaining and bogged down. Don't waste your time, save your $$$ for the next volume, maybe something will actually happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does someone write so much about so little?","review":"Note to Jordan -- YOU NEED TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN in every book. 700 pages of excruciating detail about everyone sitting around waiting has made me no longer care what happens -- this is my last Jordan book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about the money","review":"I was personally very disappointed by Crossroads of Twilight. It seems increasingly evident that Robert Jordan and his publishers only have a profit in mind when writing this series. There was absolutely nothing of interest in the latest book and I would not recommend this book to anyone. I \\"was\\" a diehard Wheel of Time fan, but now I am very disenchanted. For anyone who is interested, George Martin's series is a much better read and it is obvious he cares more for the quality of his work, than the expected profits from who knows how many more sequels Jordan and his money grubbing publishers wish to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anything happen at all in this book?","review":"After reading this the first time I forgot if anything really happened. So I decided to read it a second time and sure enough, nothing happened. Some people say this is a set up for big things to come. If you cant remember anything that happened then whats the point of having a setup. Also, I have no idea who anybody is anymore. Beonin, Zerowin, Meaolin, Mao Tse Dung, theyre all the same. Stick to the main characters Rob and wake up, this is getting boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Former Fan","review":"I'll make it quick...Dont Waste Your Money!!! I'd give it less than one star if that were possible...Nothing else needs to be said..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book 10's Alternate Title ...","review":"Jordan is starting to become the Clancy of the fantasy world. Jordan's writing would imply that he doesn't hear any of our criticisms because we make him a best-selling author with each book. Success begets arrogance, which begets this drivel. The more I read this work, the more I miss Tolkien, Martin and even, Jordan (books 1-6). Well, I appreciate the chance to read 680 pasges where each story is take forward a few weeks, with basically nothing happening during those weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Wait for Very Little","review":"I like Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series very much. His ability to pull the readers into a situation with the detail of his descriptions is un-paralleled.However, when those details overwhelm the story line it can ruin the book. In Crossroads of Twilight he has produced so much detail and filler that it is extremely difficult to pick out anything story wise happening.Needless to say, I am very disappointed. There is a lot of good in this book but it is buried in what would otherwise be considered filler. Detail is good when it is used to accent the story line or when it is used to bury/or hide important \\"clues\\" to the series mysteries. It is not good as filler instead of story line. Please RJ, do not make us wait so long again for so little."},{"rating":"1","title":"im not happy","review":"after waiting so many years for this installment, i find that its not what i ,had hoped for yes mat is there and he is great, but the story goes nowhere plenty of politics, more that i could take, in fact i found myself skimming the pages, never before done with this series, i do realize that it must be hard to keep the story going after all this time, but i know that he is better than this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cash cow","review":"Jordan is milking this cash cow for everything its worth.Half the book takes place before the end of the last book, Nothing happens in this instalment of the Wheel of Money.You could skip this one and wait 3 years for the next one and not miss anything!!!Jordan has me hooked on this series.(I've been reading it for 10 years), but it will be a cold day in hell before i purchase any other book he writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I've been a fanboy up to this point but this book was a chore to read, the chapters about Elayne and Egwene actually had me skipping pages knowing I would miss nothing and hoping for them to just end. I have never done that in a book before and I am pretty disgusted this worthless collection of rambling thoughts was ever published.I give it 1 star for lack of a lower numeral in the rankings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why waste your money?","review":"I stopped reading Jordan two books ago because it seems he is more interested in selling as many books as he can rather than finishing the tale. When I started reading this series I would rate it as one of the best I have read, but with hashing out the same events over and over with no advancement in the story, it has bored me to tears. I believe Mr. Jordan has a brilliant talent in telling a story and getting you to care about the characters, but please end it before it becomes a big.... bigger joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I GIVE UP","review":"I have to confess . . . I read this book hoping against hope that it would progress the story, tie up loose ends and begin to weave together the tapestry. It does none of those things.I thought the first few books were darn near Tolkien . . . the last three or four books really have nailed down Jordan's legacy. A man for whom no story is too long, no trite phrase can be repeated enough, and ulimately a man who cares more about selling copy that writing.I WILL NEVER READ ANOTHER JORDAN BOOK AGAIN . . . in contrast, I will read everything written by David Gemmell or George Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you heard this one before?","review":"Okay, I know everyone has complained a lot about this bookand so I want to too!No, but just one complaint that I haven't seen too much,what ever you think about the whole Rand 4some, you must be as tired as me of hearing:I love Rand! But it's really weird to share him with Elayne/Min/Aviendha. But then again, I really love E/M/A like a sister, or the girl I love like a sister does, and how can I deny her him? I love them both! I want him! I want her to have him! Blah Blah Blah BlaH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time.....","review":"An utterly useless piece of literature. It is a shame that the series that involved me so deeply into the world of fantasy has come to this. Mr. Jordan clearly lost his talent for engaging writing. To believe that anyone would find this almost 700 pages of minutia entertaining is clearly delusional.If I haven't made my point yet allow me clarify: NOTHING happens in this book. The entire book could be summarized in a few concise paragraphs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"What ever happened to the rule \\"don't write anything that doesn't develop characters or plot\\"? This is the worst installment in the series to date. If you like to buy books for no reason I highly recommend Crossroads of Twilight. This book was published for an extra paycheck. Almost nothing happens. More Aes Sedai (hundreds at this point) running around whining and bellyaching. Perrin is still searching, and with the exception of about ten pages, nothing worth reading. Mat is interacting with the DotNM, and has about twenty pages worth reading. Rand has five pages. Egwene has one page worth reading, but that is no surprise because she has been boring me since Shadow Rising. Did I mention Elayne, there's no need to. There is also about fifteen pages about the inner workings in the White Tower and some Darkfriends worth reading, otherwise don't bother.This book was written to extend the series. My recommendation is save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads to Nowhere","review":"Although I have thoroughly enjoyed this series since a friend turned me on to it, I am very much disappointed with this book.The plot was not developed further in any way. The characters were not further developed. Most frustrating of all was the complete absence of any action in the book! This, of course, is excluding the predicament Egwene finds herself in in the last few pages of the book.It seems that all of the characters and Jordan are taking a vacation from resolving any of the issues from the series. If you've not already bought this book, skip it and see what is said about the next installment a couple of years from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the Madness","review":"I promised myself that I would get this \\"monkey\\" off my back at book 9 but here we are at book 10 and the product is so diluted that breaking the habit is easy. There will be no book 11 or 15 or 20 purchase for me thank you. This scam has run its course. The series started with such promise and built upon itself and peaked many books ago with Lord of Chaos (book 6) in my opinion. As hard as it was to put down books 1 through 6 it becomes increasingly easy to put down subsequent books until the thought of even wasting your money stops and you start to move on to other much better fantasy like the Georege RR Martin or Tad Williams. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. If I could give the book negative 5 stars I would do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Don't buy this book. Really. Just say 'no'.

I have to believe that all my time reading 10,000 pages can't be for nothing... Oh wait, it's not.

I started reading this series at the beginning of my twenties, now many years later, it's beginning to be increasingly more difficult to await and buy a what used to be \\"a must have\\" next sequel.Lately it seem to me that RJ is more intent on selling quantities than producing quality.. stretching his long time fans along like he does, he's bound to loose them all.sad to see such a good story fade away like this.RJ better start to wrap things up in the next sequel for me to even consider a new buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha , ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha","review":"I thought the first book of the series was really stupid. Jordan can't write. So, I was very surprised when people started comparing him to Tolkien. How can you compare a very stupid series (WoT) to the best fantasy series ever (LotR)?So, I would like to say to fans of Jordan who loved The Wheel of Time : YOU ARE SO STUPID.Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wot CoT","review":"This book was said to be in good condition, but when I received it, the spine was broken and the pages appeared to be water damaged.

What little that happens in this book can easily be summarized in a paragraph or two and you will save yourself countless hours of boredom. On the upside, this book is a tremendous sleep aid. I've read some of the few positive reviews about this book that laud it as a necessary set up piece for Book 11. A 700 page set up piece?! Come on! We are human beings, not ents. This is an epic fantasy series - throw us a frickin' bone here. The only thing epic about this series now is Jordan's self indulgence."},{"rating":"1","title":"600+ pages where nothing happens","review":"Warning: Spoilers ahead.Nothing goes anywhere! Except some good stuff between Mat and Tuon. For that, I give the book two stars. Otherwise... I'm a fast reader, but the fact that I finished this book /this/ fast means that I did a lot more skimming then actual reading. The number of people who do not appear, or have only a cameo, is astounding. Include in that ALL the Forsaken except Mesaana, Nynaeve, Cadsuane, Fain, Slayer, Thom, *Rand and Min* - heck, RJ spends more time talking about what one of Graendal's stooges is doing then he focuses on Rand. Everyone seems to take the destruction of Shadar Logoth calmly enough, the rebels are still sitting outside Tar Valon, Mat's still on the run, Perrin's still hunting for Faile... *yawn* Can we get some plot advancement? Maybe?Checking it out at the library is definitely the way to go with this one. It's not worth the cover price."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't read any more Jordan.","review":"Seriously, I can't take it anymore. This series started out as one of the best ones ever written, and has deteriorated into some of the most boring sop I've ever read. There is no fixing it. Jordan has ruined what could have been his legacy by giving in to his own greed and dragging the story out book after book. I will not deign to reward him by buying number 11. Maybe that makes me more loyal to his work than he is. Don't waste your time on reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably boring","review":"I CANNOT believe how anyone could have appreciated this installment. The people who write good reviews MUST be lying, or voluntarily blinding themselves. I really had to force-feed my brain to keep on reading this rag.How could this be? I am flabbergasted by the downfall of the wheel of time (no caps). I still remember yelling with surprise and delight all through the first four books. Those days are long gone. The last books (generally speaking) were so loaded with ridiculous and pathetic twists and comments that reading them sometimes made me uncomfortable.Jordan MUST finish off this mortally wounded epic, it just plain ol'sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I Have Skimmed in Years","review":"I have stopped buying Jordan's books, refusing to feed the monster, so to speak. Instead, I get copies from my local library. What a boring book. Absolutely the worst book I have read in years. A note to some of the reviewers who posted here in support of this book: please don't get mad at my for not being able to finish this book. Its not my fault, really. Its just that its so horrible, I couldn't continue. Instead I skimmed the first sentence of nearly every paragraph. And I couldn't tell that anything happened. Is everyone in Jordan's world as fashion conscious as a writer for Vogue? I can't imagine Tolkien taking a moment from the Battle of Helm's Deep to have Aragorn have internal dialogue about how he disapproved of Gimli's hair or blushed at thinking how tight Legolas' leggings might be.I was amazed that this book was even published. Jordan violates every single rule of writing fiction, the first of which is to treat you audience with respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW!!!","review":"The problem as we see in the tenth book of this series, is that it is in the 10th book. The series was only supposed to last 7 or 8, but like a literary sellout, Jordan takes a 5 million dollar advance to extend the series to 12. I don't know about you, but if I had a series outline that was 7 to 8, and I had to squeak 4 more books out, my series would have devolved into the utter meaningless, meandering drivel it has become too. The female characters have all the warmth of a snow pea, and grate like a rusty file, and the male characters wouldn't know how to handle these unrealistic women if their lives depended on it. I give up. With any luck, so will Jordan. Book 11 will be another garbage fest, with the \\"payoff\\" in book 12 bound to be a complete letdown. If you want to read a good long series, I recommend Jack Whyte's Camulod Chronicles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompetent or Greedy?","review":"I really cannot decide if Jordan has let this beast grow so huge that he doesn't know what to do with it anymore, or if he is just trying to milk every dollar he can out of it. How is it possible to write a 680 page book that doesn't advance the story AT ALL? The first half of Winter's Heart was horrible because nothing happened. But at least in the end something MAJOR was resolved. So after the first 500 pages of nothing, I was hopeful that something would happen in the end. But it didn't. If you're reading this series, skip this book. Find a summary on-line and save yourself several hours. Instead of this, you really need to read George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire. Infinitely better than what this series has turned into."},{"rating":"1","title":"This the worst book I've ever read!","review":"This book is sooo bad that the only positive I can derive from it is sharing my misery with all the good folks on this message board.If you haven't read this yet, don't do it!

There is nothing redeeming about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please \\"STILL\\" Robert Jordan !","review":"I just finished reading the tenth book, and if I could just get ahold of Mr. Jordan long enough to knock that ridiculous hat off his head, I might get SOME satisfaction out of the whole expierence! I simply cannot believe so little could happen in over 600 pages! I was stunned when Rand finally appeared on page 540...my god! I read the first 8 novels in a little over a month, and loved almost all of them. Now, after having to wait so long for this meandering waste, I am so upset..I can hardly type this! I actually found myself skimming page after page searching for any scrap of actual meaningful plot. I am also convinced that R. J. himself could not keep track of all those endlessly similar Aes Sedai names without the help of of computer program. Could somebody just tell me if Moraine is actually dead..so I can skip the rest?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough, already","review":"Although I have nothing new to add to the vast majority of reviews already submitted, I just wanted to help bring the average rating down to where it belongs. The truly horrible, sad, and depressing fact about this series is that you could skip both this book and the last and not have missed a thing. A man who might have been one of the greatest fantasy writers ever is quickly being mired in mediocrity by the weight of the last 1500+ pages of garbage he has produced. I'd gladly wait 5 years between books if they could even approach the beginning books in this series. As it is, I'll wait for his next one to hit the discount table before I waste my money again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment, thy name is Jordan","review":"As with many others, I was exceedingly disappointed with this book. I've been able to accept the relative lulls in the last couple of books, but this one was simply atrocious. How can ANYONE spend 680 words to say nothing? I don't understand it.Want my honest opinion? It is beginning to seem as though Mr. Jordan and company have determined that the WOT series is a goldmine, and they should play it out as long as possible. Well, guess what, folks? Keep up this sorry state of writing, and you're going to completely lose your audience.Mr. Jordan, dear sir, it is time to finally wrap up what you have begun. Or will you go down in flames, known forever as the author who couldn't end his story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Jordan Retirement Fund","review":"I have now donated a couple a hundred dollars to the Robert Jordan retirement fund. Hey Rob! stop miliking your investors and write something that moves faster than a one-legged tutrle. Give us a little ROI. I picked this up one figuring that after 1500 pages of INTENSE character explenation and no plot movement, that we were in store for big events. I now feel like a Cub fan waiting for the world series. I will give it one more shot with book 11 three years from now and if it tanks then I thats it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summary","review":"I can basically summarize the whole story in one line.Winter is almost over lets wait til Spring (aka next book) before we do anything.However, ignoring the snail's pace of the book, I must admit it is very well written.

With nothing happening in this book, you won't miss a beat by reading the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of Twilight","review":"I am astonished that anyone would say this book is great. If you've read the entire series (which was really great in thebeginning) maybe you're trying to be loyal to Jordan. I wish I had read the reviews before I [spent the money] for this story. More to the point, I wish Jordan would read the reviews and put Rand out of his misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody get Jordan an Editor, PLEASE!!","review":"I can't say I was entirely disappointed with COT--Jordan's recent efforts have been almost as unimpressive. It's simple, Jordan needs an editor to provide some adult supervision, to cut his prose and to demand he pull things together. He had 600+ pages to wrap up any one of a still multiplying number of plot lines. I appreciate suspense, character development, detailed descriptions, etc., but let's move the characters forward. I loved the first six books but have been struggling with the rest. I know he has some great ideas, but this book was a miss. It does little to advance the story and left me in doubt as to whether I'll plunk down 30+ bucks for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan appears to have taken a wrong turn...","review":"I agree with the readers who found this book to be another filler. Jordan has now got so many plotlines going that even were he to advance them all at a reasonable pace, still the overall story gets along about as fast as my aged grandmother!I guess at least he's consistent. I see the male and female characters still \\"interact\\" at the same idiot level of full-time misunderstanding. Jordan's creator appears to have made men to be hen-pecked, and women to smooth their skirts.680 pages (in the edition that I read) and all in all Egwene gets caught. Fullstop. That's all folks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like a cow","review":"With another drawn out book on my list of frustrations with this series which I once adored, I feel like a cow who is simply being milked for as much money as possible. I thought one of the most important aspects of the art of novel writing was to be good at telling a story from beginning to end, assuming there is one here. I am not convinced this is occurring with this long series. And since I doubt The Wheel of Time would end with eleven books, I suspect I will have to wade through two more books to find out how it all comes to a grand finale. How disappointing. I guess I can sum up my review in just one word: MOO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst effort yet!","review":"As a fan of the series, I have been eagerly awaiting this novel. However I quickly realized that I probably should have spent my my money on a good haircut instead. Confusing,disjointed,rambling,inane,pretententious,and ultimately very boring are the adjectives that seem most apt.No suprises or series insights here.I find it very discouraging to see a well loved series go down the tubes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Number 10","review":"Hey all,After reading books 1 to 9, I would say that Jordan's fiction has its fluctuations between exciting and slow. In the books 1-9 there has always been a balance, some books slightly more slow and others slightly more exciting.Book 10 however is a completely different case. I was disappointed, for majority of the first half of the book the only thing that kept me going was what had happened in book 9.All in all though, excluding a lot of the waffle, I would say that book 10 was satisfying. Not exciting, un-like books 1 to 9.Cheers,"},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive and dull","review":"The quality of the first five books has kept me reading, but I cannot stomach it any more. Jordan is saying in 20 pages what he should be saying in one, and the story meanders on at an agonizingly slow pace. I can forgive a lot, but not being bored.A shame, the early books showed real promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disapointing","review":"I read the first three books and then waited with baited breath for each new installment. Unfortunately each installment now takes longer and is more disappointing than the previous one. Crossroads of Twilight is thin on plot and thick on the filling. Robert Jordan appears to be stretching the story out to breaking point, probably in anticipation of the royalties from each book. Unfortunately it seems the less substance he puts into each book the more fans fall by the way side. I would borrow this book or buy it second hand because it is certainly not worth spending your hard earned money on. Lets hope Jordan learns the error of his ways and starts displaying the brilliance that had us all enthralled at the beginning of this epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, make it stop!","review":"Nothing happens! I eventually managed to read the entire book, but it was a frustrating ordeal. The author has seemingly lost control over the characters and the story.

What was once the best series that fantasy had to offer has gone stale and flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"This series had SO MUCH potential starting out and somewhere 2 or 3 books ago it just started going downhill.This latest book is a total disappointment. Nothing happens. I hate to say this but it is VERY obvious that Robert Jordon has run out of a good story to tell. Usually, handing off a story to another writer to finish spoils it. But in this case, it's hard to mess up a story that's not going anywhere in the first place. What a waste.I just read a review that says the next book will be a prequel? Wow... is this writer INTENTIONALY trying to disappoint all of his fans (well most are xfans now)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan does not know how to finish a story.","review":"I started reading these books quite a while ago. The first few were good, and then it started to go downhill. Although I like some of the characters, for the most part, I simply don't care any more. The other thing that I find to be infuriating is that he spends the first section of a book reviewing the previous books. This section has been getting larger with each installment. So now my strategy is to wait for the last book (27 or something) and just read that. Due to his fear of alienating people, he'll have a huge section on what I've missed since the last one that I read, and I'll just be able to skip to the last battle, assuming he ever gets there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I started the Wheel of Time with great enthusiasm. First few novels were excellent. As I have read more one word comes to mind FILLER. I will not waste anymore time on Jordan's realm until the end comes out. And even then I may just read the ending since I doubt I will be interested in much more!!!!!Jordan is commercialization at its worst...fight the power!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I rate less than one star?","review":"I know that nobody will bother to wade through 1500+ bad reviews to read mine (which is ironic considering the refuse of the past five books I've waded through!) but I just wanted to add my two cents.The book is terrible. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic","review":"I am a fan of the series, owning all ten books in hardcover. That said, this book was filled with 600+ pages of weevils that should have been winnowed.I was hoping for a return of the fast paced action that began the series, the character development that stayed the series, plot development, more than a few words on the main character, or a cliffhanger worthy of anticipation. Any of the above would have sufficed, but none were present.Let's hope the next book is better. It can't be worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jordan Conspiracy","review":"I have a theory to explain the last five Wheel of Time books: Jordan died under mysterious circumstances in 1993. The publisher, Tor, hired a double to do book tours and then put together a COMMITTEE of hacks to keep cranking out Jordan books at the previous rate. They will continue to crank out books with no real plot resolution until the public (that means you) tires of the series and stops buying them. The committee will milk the series for all its worth.The only shortcoming of this theory is that I doubt that even a committee of aspiring authors could produce a book as boring as the \\"Crossroads of Ennui.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Because","review":"To be honest, I have little to say that some of the other reviews I read haven't already said, but because I feel completely bamboozled out of my hard-earned dollars, I wish to vent. This book is such a complete and total waste of time that I can only feel sorry for those of us who have stuck with this increasingly moribund series. How foolish to think that things were going to be different just because something finally happened at the end of the last one. This is by far the worse of the series, and if for any reason some innocent soul is thinking about starting to read this series, for God's sake save that person hours of unnecessary torment. The worse is I'm committed to reading the rest of this having invested this much time, but like others I vow to give no more money to Jordan, and I shall continue to think to myself, \\"Ah, this is how NOT to move a plot along.\\" If you want intricate fanstasy plots that move quickly, I suggest everyone read Guy Gavriel Kay immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very disappointing","review":"I have been an unwavering fan of the Wheel of Time series, having re-read the first nine books three times. Now number ten comes along and it seems as though it is written by another author. That, or else Jordan has lost his inspiration and plot and is wallowing about. I find that hard to believe. He's a better writer than that. I hate to admit it, but it would seem that now that we are \\"addicted\\" to the series, we are going to get \\"filler\\" for the next few books, and line his pockets. So very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Buying the Books!","review":"I've already reviewed this book once a few months ago. It is simply awful! Review after review prior to and since mine say basically the same thing. Does anyone really want to just go on buying more of these endless plotless monstrosities? How about this...Anyone who agrees with me should write a \\"review\\" stating that he or she won't buy another volume of W.o.T unless the next one is the LAST one and finally ends this long overcooked story! It really is a shame because Mr. Jordan has talent....he has just left it in the safety deposit box where he keeps all the cash the publisher paid him to go on and on and on...."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.R.R. Tolkien you're not","review":"Tolkien wrote because he is passionate about his work. His books are works of art. Jordan was like that too in his first 6 Wheel Of Time books. After that I guess he started writing not out of inspiration but out of necessity. To please himself? his publishing company? his bank account? one thing I'm sure of is that he does not write anymore for his fans and followers, and his books are now written without inspiration and passion."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is impossible to descibe how boring this book is","review":"Do yourself a favor - search for a summary of this book somewhere and read it instead (will be less than 2 pages long, cause absolutely nothing happens).I'm sure you can skip this volume and go straight from book 9 to book 11 and miss nothing of the plot.The great setup at the end of the previous book? Totally ignored.This one is 800 pages well worth skipping.Boring. I found myself scanning through 20 - 30 pages at a time, just looking for some dialogue between all the incredibly boring descriptions.If you read this you will regret it. I ignored all the warnings from other reviewers and I hate myself for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite an eye workout","review":"Worth reading, but only to appreciate these reviews, the majority of which are infinitely better written and more entertaining than the primary source."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hamster is dead but the wheel is still turning.","review":"I have found that I am severely disappointed in this latest installation of The Wheel of Time. The series started out in such a magnificent fashion. The characters were likable, the plot advanced well and the story was entertaining and exciting. I couldn't put the first four books down. I read five through nine at a bit of a slower pace but they were still enjoyable although nearing book eight the characters have dissipated into whining people who could have solved some of their problems by simply talking to each other. Rand has gone from a likable youth to a whining and moaning young man. I know that his character has many pressures but he has hardly advanced as a character in the past few books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore Any Good Reviews.....","review":"This is a filler book of epic proportions.If you have a weak heart and like the idea of nearly 700 pages of conversation and description then this is the book for you. There is no action to speak of so you wont get too excited reading it.Like most of the other people giving this book bad reviews I have read books 1 to 9 and enjoyed them. Book 10 is just a vehicle for killing time and taking our money. Shame on you, Robert Jordan.To paraphrase a previous reviewer, anyone who gives the book more than one star either works for the publisher or is related to Robert Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Robert Jodan Just get on with it.","review":"The wheel of time started as a great series but Jordan in his last few books has not progressed the story much rather he seems to have lost control of the threads and doesn't seem to know how to bring them together again. I loved the first 5 books but have struggled through the remaining. It is almost like he is milking the popularity of the series with a load of padded books- which is a shame given that the base story and concept is fantastic- hurry up and bring the plot together. I mean what did Rand do in the last book???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intergenerational agreement","review":"For the first time in years, I have to agree with my dad who has also reviewed this book. It's a waste of time and trees. There is no movement of the plot, no action, no worthwhile character development, and no clear purpose other than to sell another doorstop-sized book. Most people who have read it have been able come to the same conclusion. Of the 1512 reviews to date, only 66 (4%) \\"true believers\\" thought it was 5-star great, while 939 (62%) thought it stunk at one star or less. It is interesting to note that while most of the negative reviews focused on the author's and the book's shortcomings, a majority of the avid fans used their review to attack the other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait","review":"This was a very disappointed reader. After reading RJ's books over the years I have slowly started to feel a sharp bitterness with his work. Mind I will read his work until his last book is published, but not with the same passion I once did. In Crossroads of Twilight, as in Winters Heart, the story seems to fade. It just seems that RJ is writing so that he can write another book. I won't give away plot or story line, but to say all the main players appear, though Rand isn't seen until three hundred pages in. Few questions are answered, though more are asked. And the end leaves you so twisted you feel like tossing the book across the room. With the probability that the next book won't come out till late 2005 this reader feels disheartened with ever seeing an end to what once was epic series with outstanding depth. Remember it started out as a series of only six books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan is out of control","review":"Robert Jordan came up with a great story, however, reading his work is like watching hours of the neighbor's home movies: He may be very interested but we can't wait until it's over. For every 5 pages of Crossroads, 4 are devoted to how the characters are dressed or the history of the tea cups being used. I'm getting the feeling that the author is hiding Rand the way Disney hides Mickey at Disneyland. And, what's with 95 pages of prologue to the TENTH book in a series? Why doesn't he just pick up the story where it left off in book 9?The many comparisons of Jordan to Tolkien are misguided. Tolkien took us on the adventure with Frodo and the Fellowship. Jordan's work, particularly in the last few books, has all the adventure of a flight delay in real time. I would like to know what happens to many of the characters, but it is simply not worth the sheer tedium of the writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the action?","review":"I keep waiting for some action to happen in this book. Instead we get a broadstroke overview of all the main characters and then some with no real movement forward in the story line. I hate to dislike this book because I've spent a year waiting for it's release. Rand the main character in the story did absolutely nothing in this new book and all the other main characters took one step forward in thier saga's but no more. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. If I didn't have so much time invested in reading this series I would bouycot his next release. Come on RJ get on with the story already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jail time deserved for reader abuse?","review":"At least I think Jordan deserves jail time for reader abuse.I won't repeat again what a good portion of the existing reviews have already said. But I do have a suggestion for those of you who regret purchasing this book. If your book is in like-new condition and you still have your receipt, TAKE IT BACK. I did. Send a message to both Mr. Robert \\"show me your money\\" Jordan AND his publisher, who should be held equally culpable for publishing this piece of <bleep>. If Tor had shown some backbone and stopped bowing to their own version of the money-god, if the editors had put their foot down and refused to accept it, maybe this would have eventually been a real book instead of...whatever it is. I'd not call it a novel by any stretch of the imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"...breaks faith with the Wheel of Time fans.","review":"Crossroads of Twilight is an incredibly poor installment in the Wheel of Time Series. There is no plot movement. No revelations. No action. Well, not exactly. There is the cute plot line concerning how well Birgitte fills out her pants!However, I would not want to appear negative. The book does contain hundreds of multi-page descriptions of women's dresses, skirts, cloaks, jewelry, general appearance and eye and hair color. Most of these descriptions do explain how the women need to twitch, pull, smooth out and fondle everything to keep it all in place. Sadly, none of it contributes to the plot....My recommendation is to skip Crossroads of Twilight...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan Phones It In","review":"The 10th book of a series that should have found it's end 5 books ago. Again Robert Jordan releases a book that merely trudges on with the storyline, the same old characters doing the same old things, this is half a book with nothing approaching an ending in it. While it's a good chance to revisit the world of The Wheel of Time, it's not more than a fleeting glimpse at a few days of nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOT=Waste of Time?","review":"What was once my favorite fantasy series is now my biggest frustration. Somehow Jordan has practically made me lose interest after 9 great books. This book is nothing but filler. It looks like they increased the font size (really) and gave us half of a book where everything happens in the 2nd half. That would be a way to make a good profit. This is the big book about nothing. I was warned ahead of time by some friends that nothing really happens in this book and they were right. Read with very low expectations. The only thing good about it is it is a quick read due to fewer words per page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess I'm in for the long haul","review":"Its a bit daunting to realize how long ago it was that I picked up the Eye of the World and signed myself up for this journey.While creating an epic story on a wonderfully grand style, Jordan is dragging this out for quite a bit.When my wife got this for me as a present I noticed that the book was shorter than others in the series and that was my first warning sign. Jordan seems to need 1000+ pages to get things to happen so it seemed book 10 would be \\"treading water,\\" which it is.I'll buy book 11 (in paperback - not hard cover) just because I like the characters & story, but I'm starting to doubt this story will be done in this decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"And...nothing happened","review":"I just wnat everyone to know nothing worth reading happens in this book. There are two or three small details that you will figure out in the next book and you won't have to read 800 pages of filler to find it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stalling and fluff","review":"I have read the earlier books in this series multiple times, although I agree that the last one or two had slowed down in pace. I do not mind the highly introspective tone of Jordan's narratives that seems to bother other readers. I held on to the belief that they were in fact \\"set up\\" books for something ahead.However, this book has made me decide to abandon the Wheel of Time series. It have such a passive feel that I had to look back through the book to verifiy that anything at all had taken place. Jordan is fond of hints and innuendos, but by themselves such tricks cannot sustain a book of this size. In the end, I think that Jordan's writing style has gotten so fluffy and long-winded that he can no longer fit a book's worth of activity into even a 700 page book.If you loved the last two books, then you should enjoy this one too. If you -- like me -- were hoping for Crossroads of Twilight to redeem the series, then take my advice: Now is the time to walk away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to End the Series","review":"Well, it seems the wheel of time needs to wind down and end this series. Without question, it has been the one of the best ever, however, this volume is evidence that you can take a good thing only so far. Mr. Jordan, please end the series now while you still have the respect of your readers.Very respectfully,Bill P."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wheel of Time Dithers","review":"Although the previous three books meandered to a degree, putting off action and reasonable directions for the characters and the story line,they at least continued to flesh out the characters and subplots in a reasonably efficient manner. While I finished Crossroads of Twilight,it was difficult to do so as the first two-thirds seemed to interminably describe and redescribe the same characters. It took 500 pages to reveal that the column of fire to the west was Rand's cleansing of the taint from male wielders of the power and destruction of Shadar Logoth, that had taken place in the previous book. The end of the wait for this volume was disappointing. Mr. Jordan needs to return to the crispness and quality of the first four books of this series and to finish the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cure for insomnia","review":"After per-ordering this book with the great ratings that were given to it I was looking forward to a pleasant experience. I found that this book took me two weeks to read because there was not anything of intrest hapening in the plot. I kept reading, knowing that Jordan sometimes packs the last one hundred pages with excitment. Nothing, the book could have passed as much information in a much more plesant read in about eight chapters. I am not an author, but I do know that this book in no way resembles the first books of the series, and seemed like a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book by itself","review":"I have read the other nine books and have enjoyed them very much. Sad to say, I did not enjoy this one. The plot moves very slowly and many of the subplots are still not resolved. People should wait for the next book before buying this one. This might be a good book if the series were read continuously. As it is, this is not a good read considering that we have waited two years for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book, nothing happens anyway :(","review":"Well nothing of any import anyway. Mat is still running around with the circus and the Daughter of the Nine Moons, Perrin is still trying (though not very hard) to free Faile, and Rand is, well I guess you can say he's still resting!I must give Mr. Jordan credit. His flair for the multiplicity of vacuity is astounding!Perhaps if you have the next book out in a year instead of two years you'll have less time to fill it with nonsense.That's two strikes Mr. Jordan & TOR. Three and you're OUT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drop this, read Martin.","review":"This series is the equivalent of watching paint dry. I would also give books six through whatever minus five stars. Quit wasting time and money and read A Song of Ice and Fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed just does not cover it!","review":"I don't understand what has happened to a series that had as much promise as the Wheel of Time. Crossroads of Twilight was the same as the last four books, only worse. There was no plot movement. This series has become a real source of frustration because it has been stalled for the past five books. The author even made us doubt if the small advancement in Winter's Heart actually meant anything (referring to Rand and Nynaeve cleansing saidin). I would not advise any newcomers to start this series. Mr. Jordan does not appear to have an end in sight. He has taken all the excitement I felt in the first five books and crushed it to nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Isnt there a zero star rating?","review":"Waste of money, infinite number of monkeys will produce some kind of conclusion to this series faster, and more entertainingly. I am jumping off this train wreck.Wait a few years, if alzheimers hasn't claimed Jordan and he finishes the thing (as if) may be worth buying at a yard sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dose of Perspective","review":"look at it like this: if you took EVERY word ever written by BOTH Tolkien and Eddings and combined them, they would be fewer than this Jordanesque nightmare of tedium.

He honestly believes this was a publishable book. His editors at TOR should be fired, fired for not having the moxy to stand up to Jordan and say \\"This book is nothing but a crappy re-write of book 9.\\" At one point I started counting how many pages of paper were wasted to write a simple sentence. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING new happens until the second to last page (hard cover edition). I heard an interview recently where Jordan said he didn't care about the criticism this book has recieved because he is writing the books for himself, well Mr. Jordan, do yourself a favor and hire a new editor because this was horrible! If this isn't some ploy to make even more money out of devoted fans than Mr. Jordan trully has lost his ability to write exciting stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Return Your Copy","review":"My title essentially sums up my feeling about this book...I read the book on the 7th of Jan. and returned it to the store on the 8th! What was the point of filling up 700 pages with a bare extension of the already lethargic plot from the previous two books? I've been reading this series since I was fourteen, lo these many years, and this book is OBVIOUSLY sub-par even compared to the other big stinkers, e.g. 8 & 9. Go to the bookstore and read it but don't waste any money on it. My only hope is that George R.R. Martin will somehow hear my keening wail and finish his book soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OH, THE PAIN! (Please End It!)","review":"The only reason I have this book is for the sake of the series. I almost did not buy it. My wife joined a book club and I got it for a PENNY. I had to think about it. My wife asked me how cheap do I want it? I had to think about it. If you want to read this book, read the first few pages the last few pages and a couple in the middle. That will catch you up with the story. The first books were fine I do not know what happend to the rest. Let's put it this way I can not go below a 1 on the rating. I would put a 0 if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a book not a chapter","review":"To all the reviewers saying Book 11 will be great and the last few have just set up for future volumes to come:THIS IS A BOOK, NOT A CHAPTER WITHIN.

With the last 4 books however, he has proven that he knows how to crush momentum and interest- and Crossroads of Twilight seems to be the worst of them all. I say \\"seems\\", because I have not yet finished the book. I am just over 400 pages into it, however, and NOTHING has happened. Minor characters are described and analyzed in painstaking detail, as are plots, subplots, settings, etc. Detail is good...but too much (WAY too much) of a good thing, isn't. If the last four books were written with the same flair and strength as the first 6, this would have been the last and greatest book. Jordan had established himself as a veritable legend with the first 6 books. Comparisons to Tolkien were VERY appropriate. Now, he needs to be succinct and INTERESTING in his last few to pull the series out of mediocrity and back into greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggle to finish...","review":"I have jammed through all the previous books pretty quickly... always finding some free time to read, not wanting to put them down. Boy was this book different. It took a great deal of effort to read this one. The story has been slowing for a few books, and in this one the story seems to have totally stalled out. The plot hasn't really moved forward at all. Reading about Mat was still enjoyable, but even that bit lacked any real excitement. <yawn> The author is obviously writing for himself. Was there an editor at all on this book? I seriously think this book could be distilled down into a 50-100 page intro for the next book and little would be lost. This book has pretty much killed what interest I had left in the series. I'll probably check back in 10 years and see if it's done yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"crossroads of twilight","review":"what started as a great epic fantasy is unfortunately losing its pace, crossroads is more of a traffic jam with nobody(characters)moving. this series quickly got me hooked but the latest installment just got me mad, come on jordan, lets wrap it up. if your eagerly awaiting the paperback release wait til the next book comes out as croosroads goes nowhere, maybe the story will move in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"are we being made fools of?","review":"jordans previous books were saved from his terrible, tedious writing style by some great action set pieces,some interesting leaps of imagination and, with rand, a compelling manichaean conflict but in the latest instalment there are no redeeming features. jordan appears to have no literary merit, his writing is graceless and his characterisation hackneyed and weak. the women are caricatures and so are the men, an assembly of cliches who mouth platitude after platitude. does every layer of clothing need to be described in such ridiculous detail, does every thought need to be forced upon us so, does he have an editor. jordan appears to think that every little thing needs to be spelt out to us again and again to the extent that one feels he thinks we lack sufficient intelligence to understand the most simplistic of notions and ideas. by continuing to buy this mind numbingly boring drivel he has spawned of late we may just be proving him right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away... then keep running.","review":"What started as a great series has run out of gas.

It's been a long series and used to be fairly good but the author only had the main character appear only once in the entire book for one chapter. I believe this is called milking the reader for all the bucks he can get out of the series. I am very mad and would like the author to get on with the series or get off and quit.

Any serious author doesn't use an entire book as a mere prologue to the next book. That's a horrible way to write a series, and the main reason this series has gone down the drain. What could have been a great fantasy series has turned into pointless drivel. I could sum up this book completely in a page summary. It's come to that point where there is -zero- plot advancement, the redundancy has become unbearable, and Jordan's writing has gotten worse and worse. This series is dead.For a real fantasy series go pick up George R.R. Martin's 'Song of Ice and Fire' saga. Now that's a truely great fantasy story by an author who knows how to progress a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the best that Jordan could come up with?","review":"Please do not waste your money buying this book.

Nothing ever did. The entire book was a prologue. It became clear to me that Jordan is merely trying to get as much money from as little content as possible. The book ended almost exactly where it started. There was no suspense and no climax. In all, COT was rather less than ordinary. I can't believe I waited so long for this.Don't get me wrong, the book was successful in one way: it has quenched my anticipation for further books in the series.

Most of the interesting side plots are dropped in favor of new characters who overwhelm the reader by their staggering numbers and their seeming irrevelance to the storyline. I will probably buy the next book, because I am a glutton for punishment, and there is a tiny optimistic flame within me that says Mr. Jordan will return to form. Please come back to us, Mr. Jordan. Bring back the Wheel of Time that we once loved. We miss Rand and the rest of the Scoobie gang.

I really started to hate Elayne in this book. I still have close to 300 pages, and if I had not already read some good reviews of KOD, I would put that series away for good.I am still trying to figure out, what part sucked most till now, but I guess, it is Elayne and all that stupid subplots about getting the throne of Andor."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the worst one ever","review":"I can't believe Robert Jordan wrote a book this horrible... atleast in my copy... Rand is barely mentioned till around the 24 chapter or so.. thats like 600 pages or something.... and all the characters are just wallowing in their own little problems. There is NO developement or anything in this book. It is just as if Jordan is just filling up pages. How can he go on???? i dont know, this just isnt buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"wheel of time grinds to a halt","review":"Apparently the wheel of time revolves at various speeds! In this volume, it finally grinds to a dead stop. Never were more words spent describing irrelevant and unremarkable aspects of scenery and clothing. Now that the wheel has stopped, perhaps the next volume will reveal it moving again ... in reverse. Ten volumes of flashbacks? Perhaps the same tales will be told from a different perspective, e.g., the view from the underside of all the fallen leaves, rocks, and snow he feels compelled to describe. I'll wait for volume 21, when things may begin to move *forward* again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"I noticed that the rating for customers is 1 and a half stars, that speaks volumes, which it seems to be Jordan's aim now. I have never been this dissapointed in a book before. Mat and Perrin are the only people who move in the whole book and it is only down the road a little bit, everyone else is in the same spot at the end. On the plus side it is well written but fluff only takes you so far. At the end of the book I was reminded of the scene in the Monty Python's the Holy Grail, when the large group of people yell, \\"Get on with it!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"please shoot me","review":"i have read all of the books in this series, and this one was beyond sub-par. granted, the author is trying to work towards the end of the series, and this book was key in moving plotlines along, but it still was a tease, and a bad one, considering the book was released 2 months after the originally projected release date. i would recommend that if you really want to read it, wait until it comes out in paperback, or borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too much","review":"One star is too high a rating for this book. It is one of theworst books I've ever read. I used to be a big fan of thisseries and I think its sad that it has come to this.All the reviews that talk about how bad this book is bring upvalid points so if you are thinking about buying this book readthem. I thought the bad reviews were more entertaining thanthe book anyway. If you want to read something good check outGeorge R. R. Martin instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Jordan's Book 10","review":"Slooooooow is the best description I can give this book. Too many characters are added unto each succeeding books that it becomes difficult to keep up with who is doing what, especially since the time lapse between books is much too long. I don't believe Mr. Jordan knows how to end this story. I no longer enjoy reading it and wish he would \\"nail shut this coffin\\" while he still has readers who are intrested in finding out how this lengthy saga ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we there yet? Maybe in another 10 books...","review":"Unfortunately, it seems Robert Jordan has fallen into the commercial trap that so many pulp fantasy writers do: serial placeholders. The first three or four books in this series were excellent, with a sufficient mix of character development and plot action. Now, it seems that we have 600+ pages of rehashed character un-development with a few new novelty characters thrown in to make it look like something is happening. After finishing reading the book and looking back, there is NO significant plot advancement at all. You could skip this book altogether and pick up book 11 without even realizing it. I'm very disappointed in Robert Jordan, and even though I've been forcing myself to read The Wheel of Time since it came out, if Mr. Jordan is trying to drag this series out for another ten books, I'm sure I won't be the only reader who moves on to fresher material long since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"Don't get me wrong the series is good but its getting a bit on the long side. The problem with this book is nothing actually happens! I'm serious a lot of people talk, a lot of people move around but nothing happens...Leave off purchasing this book until it is in paper back or even better dig it up at a second hand store ( i know thats where a lot of copies are going to end up! )I know you aren't going to believe me but in all the other books I can name something good or positive that happened, a forsaken that dies, a battle won but in this book I can't name anything exciting happening except a twist that was thrown in at the end ... but that was as subtle as a sledge hammer and I believe added in by the editors after they read this extremely boring book.All i can say is I hope he does better in the next book ... I have invested so much of my time and energy into this series I would really hate to see it fizzle out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"Jordan has either proven he lost track of the plot (though his interviews a while ago claimed he already had the ending written from early on) or he has truly succumbed to milking the market. Unfortunately, all he has done is sent me to the library. There is NO compelling reason to buy this book - it goes nowhere, does nothing and only served to destroy much of the joy the early books gave me.Seriously, the first eight books are worth owning, nine and ten are a loss. I suggest you wait for your local library to get a copy and check it out. If you have to wait several months to get the copy from the library, don't worry - the wait will seem quicker than this book reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of Twilight","review":"I for one have lost patience with this extended drama. As in the last 3 books, nothing really happens. I have just finished reading this book, and if asked, could not not tell you with any certainty what went on. The characters move ever so slowly and develope not at all.If the whole collection had moved at this pace I feel sure Mr Jordan would not have won the admirers he has. The series has lost momentum, which is a dangerous thing for publishers who rely on hard back sales. I for one will wait until the next one has gone into paperback. However given the time it took for No. 10 it could be a long wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"For shame RJ","review":"This has to be the worst book in the series. I am a devout wheel of time fan but even I can see that Robert Jordan is milking it. Yes thats right milking every penny he can out of the series.You will put this book down many times. Why ? Because its boring, there are no major conflicts in this book. The characters that he has been adding at the prologue of this and all his previous 2 books just dissapear.Please finish the series with a bang, dont let all your hard work be for naught. As the series stands now its chaos.Dissapointed Fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother.","review":"Flash!

Even his die-hard fans are starting to have doubts. Someone in his editorial department or his publisher need to tap him on the shoulder and say \\"Hey, it's okay. Just end you. There's rehabs. Or you can always write \\"Wheel of Space\\". Same characters except in space. But please just finish the book\\"Plot summary: Nothing remotely interesting happens. Unless you like to know what type of clothes Elayne likes to wear. Rand (you know, the main character) is missing from the majority of the book. Take everything that's been written about all the main character from the previous book, cut and paste it to this one, and there you go. This is easily the worst WoT book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I think!","review":"This book needs to be put on the back shelf! It may sell, but only on the merits of the series. Did Jordan forget the standard format of a hero's journey? He forgot the most important part; the climax! Wheres the battle, the downed enemy, or the discorved hazard? Left out? LEFT OUT! How can a GOOD book end with out some milestone?So if you've been reading the series wait till it comes out in paperback then buy it.. read it.. throw it away! If you haven't been reading the series DON'T START!! Wait until its done then skip this novel when you do read it.Finaly to mister Jordan, FINISH the series!Thanks,Jim"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eh?","review":"I read this book when it came out, and it was the first WoT book I had to wait for (1-2 years). I was a little shocked to discover how many people hated it, but in retrospect I can see that it had a lot to do with how long some people had been waiting for the series to end, and that the effect was a cumulative thing which began for some as early as TSR (though now most people consider the books to get progressively slower beginning at ACOS; many older fans go further back, and some referred to LOC, now a fan favorite, as 'half a book').It's interesting to see how these things develop as the years go on. Now, most new readers don't even notice the blip in the slower books, and many seem as shocked as I was that COT is so hated. For its place in the series, it does I think exactly what it was supposed to do, and there is quite a bit of value in it that is overlooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happened?","review":"I wouldnt say that nothing happened, since after i read this book, an end to this series is very unlikely in my eyes. there wasnt any action at all and the story wasnt brought forward, but Jordan introduced some new problems and characters. This really got me frustrated, and i feel like a junkie, who doesnt get the thrill anymore, but cant let go of his addiction.Please Mr. Jordan: release us!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback.","review":"Not One Battle scene in the entire book.No major decisions or events.In fact, the entire thing was like reading deleted scenes from the last book. Scenes that could have been left deleted. Perrin chases his own tail, Matt courts his future wife, Egwene watches the rebels chase their tails, Rand makes a cameo appearance and the bad guys are either all on vacation or doing equally boring things of their own. Definitely NOT worth the price of buying in hardback. Very disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can anyone tell me whar really happened?","review":"I believe the answer to this question is nothing happened in this book. Now I am a livid fan of this series, but honestly the characters did nothing but mosey around thier plots and nothing was accomplished. The descriptions were as always good, the dialogue was consistant with the other volumes, but the complete lack of any action, story conclusions, plot tie ups, or any progression of the story left me wondering if it is going to be worth picking up the 11th volume. (is it just me or were there only supposed to be 10 volumes three or so years ago) In addition I feel jipped, this book wasn't worth the twenty or so dollars I spent on it. In all actuallity I think it might be worth the hassle of skipping the tenth novel and simply wait for the eleventh, I don't see where any one will miss anything.Sorry if this offends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will this Age ever end?","review":"If you are anticipating Robert Jordan's newest Wheel of Time installment to merely weave the tale more tightly and leave even more questions without a single answer, then I strongly recommend \\"Crossroads of Twilight.\\" However, if you are expecting book ten to reveal even a glimmer of an answer or wrap up any of the subplots, I would not- at least not until the eleventh book is released! Most of the characters are revisited and their situations updated, but no real advancements in the plot or subplots are made. We know barely any more at the end of \\"Crossroads...\\" then we do at the beginning. You must eventually read this book to continue on to the next. But, since we probably have another two years to wait for book eleven, I see no reason to read it now.

Every character is in exactly the same point as when we left them in the previous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we there yet?","review":"Actually, I stopped at #8 and refuse to pick up any of the WoT series until he's FINISHED! That said, I get the basic plot from the other reviews here and so I feel good about my decision to wait. I remember (sigh) the early days when I was reading the first two or three in the series. Like the beginning of a new relationship, it held promise, I looked forward to each page, and scheduled \\"dates\\" where I could sit home and spend time with this wonderful story. Since about book 6, however, (like many relationships) it's gone quite stale. Wrap it up, Rob."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the rest of the story?","review":"This book goes absolutely nowhere. I thought maybe several hundred pages fell out of the end and I missed all the action. I'm kind of curious how long Mr. Jordon thinks people will keep paying for books that don't move the plot at all. I forgave him for book #9 thinking that he was building up to a blowout in book #10. But....nothing. Hundreds and hundreds of pages of characters that I don't care about talking about nothing important or advancing the story in any way. You've profited enough from me, Mr. Jordan. Never again. Why isn't there a zero star rating?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexcusable","review":"The title of my review sums it up. There is simply no excuse for this, period. The only thing approaching a viable excuse is that book 10 has been \\"setup\\" for something else, which every review over 1 star seems to harp upon. Book 9 was setup. And book 8. And book 7. That's several thousand pages of setup.Which is, as I said, inexcusable.Books used for setup should not be permitted, end of story. (Assuming this is even \\"setup\\" to begin with, which is quite a stretch.) Prologues are for setup. Chapters are for setup. Novels are not used for setup, let alone two or three of them in a row. Some people claim book 9 somehow moved the plot, but that's only in comparison to the rest of this tedious nightmare.Wheel of Time was my obsession and love for almost ten years.

I can't believe I wasted money on this book, let alone slogged all the way through it. Jordan is a workmanlike writer at best and is completely uninspired here, except by the large dollar signs this series continues to bring in based on its promising but now squandered beginnings seven books ago. Will this series ever end? Don't hold your breath as long as Jordan and TOR still make money from it. I wouldn't be surprised to see the 4 or so major characters split off into book series of their own in order to keep this tedious material going as long as people will pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"what was the great thing about this story NOTHING!!!He's just trying to make it longer so he can get more moneyi loved all his storys some more than others but this one has nothing to like about it .

Jordon is now writing just to make a buck. What an insult to his loyal readers. I'm debating whether to even buy the paperback of the next installment. If it stinks as bad as this one I'm done with the series. Jordon should be ashamed of himself because he can't seriously believe his loyal readers would like this obvious stink bomb. The only explanation is that he is dragging out the story with unnecessary and excruciatingly boring details such as the color of mud on some peasant's boots just so he can sell a few more books. The book is a miserable disappointment. Given six weeks any hack could have written it. Watching ice melt would have been more interesting, and a lot cheaper.

You could probably cut this book out between books 9 and the future book 11 and not really miss anything. I found it hard to keep track of all the minor incidental characters introduced at the beginning of the book and I was annoyed that the writer didn't get to any of the main characters until about 80 pages into the book. It is too long between books to remember the myriad of little characters that he spends so much time on. I lost track of the various generic Aes Sedai running around in the different cities. I feel like I need to reread the whole series each time a new book comes out just so I can remember who is who.What happened to all the great monsters he created in earlier books? What happened to all the action of the previous books? .

It's obvious now that Jordan is being paid by the quantity of words and not the quality. He wrote 600+ pages that could have easily been reduced to 50. There were times when several pages would go by and no dialogue takes place. Instead, you have to wade through endless descriptions of how gray the sky was or what clothes someone was wearing. Then of course you're reintroduced to countless minor characters that you can't remember anything about because it's been 2 years since the last book.

Remember reading the first 5 or 6 books till all hours of the night and going in to work the next day bleary eyed? Then go home and read far later than was wise yet again? I used to hope that the series would go on for 20 books, but instead it died after 6. The WoT and book 10 have devolved into mediocrity. When held against the standard of the start of the series, it has devolved into nothing but a waist of my time.This book is the twitching corpse of a once great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Formula- Same Old Disappointment","review":"This is yet another disappointing installment of the once-magnificent Wheel of Time Series. Like many, I was completely enthralled by the early books of this series, however the author and publisher seem to be more interested in prolonging the series (and I assume their cash flow) than completing a great work of art. COT, like its immediate predecessors, is a maddening jumble of fragmented plot lines that fail to move the master story ahead in any significant manner. Tor, like the author, has forgotten what made the earlier works in the series great- that each book was a self contained story that had a beginning, middle, and end; but somehow still supported the over riding plot line.At this point, the story may be unsalvagable as is the support of many fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"My patience is at an end","review":"With \\"Crossroads of Twilight,\\" Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series becomes only the second fantasy series I've ever given up on. I've been strongly considering it since \\"The Path of Daggers,\\" and now my patience is finally at an end. The series' forward progress has slowed over the past few books until now it's almost at a standstill. What is resolved here?.I have defended the series in the past against detractors who said that Jordan is happily drawing this out with a sadistic cackle and dollar signs in his eyes, but this is too much. The first few books were great, so if you want to experience the Wheel of Time, read up through \\"Lord of Chaos.\\" Only imagine that the Dark One himself showed up at Dumai's Wells, Tarmon Gai'Don was won, and the world continued happily into the next Age.of adult characters who behave like spoiled children almost as much as I do of the never-ending plotlines.

I have gotten suckered into buying all of the rest of the series, but with the last couple of books I could see that Jordan really no longer cares about making a good story, but rather milking this financial situation for all it is worth.

But pay attention to the clues; circular reasoning, overwhelmingly female point of view, the authors massive hat and fake beard.... ROBERT JORDAN IS A WOMAN!!! \\"He\\" is a psuedonym. \\"He\\" would not be the first female author to pose as a male.

This books is a break from Jordans normal writing style. In most of the previous WOT books Jordan would touch on all of his plot lines but concentrate on advancing two story lines. In this book he trys to spend too much time on everything and you end up going nowhere. Not only does he not close off any story lines, but he opens up several new ones. The end result is you only get half a book here. There are alot of interesting things that happen, but I suggest waiting for the next book and then buying both at once. In fact if Jordan wants to salvage most of his readers after this debacle he will need to release a followup book to this in a hurry. If we have to wait another two years or more I can see alot of fans not comming back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"This series started out as one of the best of all time, and now it's sunk to this. 690 pages of garbage.

And if you need it for your collection a one page summary slipped in between books 9 and 11(assuming that one will be worth reading)should suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, useless exposition!!","review":"I am absoultely appalled! How did one of my favorite series deteriorate into a play by play account of ordinary, mundane activities? Nothing was accomplished in this book, that is, nothing that couldn't have been covered in three or four chapters, leaving the extra 500 pages for a real book. The painfully slow pacing of this installment has me seriously considering whether I should even bother picking up the next one, and I am truly disturbed by the prospect of seeing this cherished series continue to degrade. It would be better to leave it unfinished then continue on in this manner.I'm sure it's obvious, but I advise you not to purchase this book. Get an unlucky friend to summarize it for you. Or go to one of the many fan sites on the web and read a summary of this book, but do it quickly, because this book has the potential to drive off all but the most fanatical \\"Wheel of Time\\" fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I own all of the WoT, the last several in hardback. I've read all of them twice or more. I've had CoT on pre-order with Amazon for about a year. Suffice it to say that I'm a fan of the series. However, after reading this one, I'm thinking about just quitting. How an author could do so little in 680 pages absolutely boggles the mind. Glacial would be a compliment. I mean, this is ridiculous.I have no problem with Jordan spending a fair amount of time setting the stage for big events to come. However, he could have easily compressed everything in this book into a prologue or 2-3 chapters. Why bother reading it?I really thought RJ was going somewhere with this series. I thought it might end in 12-13 books, as he's been claiming for awhile. ... Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!!","review":"It's hard to imagine someone could write so many words and say virtually nothing.

I started this series when it first came out, and have re-read it twice to refresh my memory for the new releases. All I can say is that book 11 is the only one I did not yet buy, instead borrowing it from the library, and am glad I did. Why is RJ compelled to re-introduce characters we weren't interested in the first time? I find myself going to the glossary trying to remember them, only to find an obscure geographical name that no one cares about. I guess I need to tug on my braid, smooth my dress, and skim past these sections. Who cares about every noble in Andor? Not me. I want to read about the characters that kept me interested these long years. Please, Mr. Jordan, finish the story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And yet again Jordan fails to deliver","review":"An avid Wheel of Time reader, I eagerly snap up each new volume. Those like me can save their time and money. If you feel you simply must read this book, check it out of the library and avoid buyer's remorse. Better plan: Assuming the WOT will eventually roll to a conclusion wait for the final book. If future volumes have the same impact as recent volumes we will be easily able to pick up the final book not having missed a thing. I am beyond frustrated with this author and can no longer recommend the series. Yes there is often a less than stellar book in the midst of a great series, but COT gives us the third? fourth? plodding volume. I will reread the early volumes again, as I have before, and savor every word. But I'm done holding my breath in anticipation of the next installment and will not be suckered into spending my money on another book. I deeply resent Jordan having 'done' this to his so faithful readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited a year for that??","review":"Normaly I love this series but this book was such a major disapointment. It basicly was nothing more then a very long prolouge. How the hell did Robert Jordan's editors let him pass this off as an installment to the series. Well I'll defiantly be leary before shelling out $[amount] on the next one to come out. I cannot express how disaponting this book was. 30 odd chapters of women drinking tea and having conversations.

By volume 6, I truly found myself hoping that a bomb would fall on and obliterate every lead character. Not that we should come to love each fantasy lead character, in fact, some I love to hate, but I remain absolutely indifferent to Jordan's characters, as I've grown indifferent to the whole Wheel of Time thrust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Robert Jordan, please read:","review":"Mr. Jordan:The entire book could have been written in 20-25 pages.Stop it with the drama and cut to the chase.

Absolutely nothing. No one really went anywhere, no one did anything. It contributed nothing to the series. You could not read this book and you would miss, well, nothing. I think Jordan has lost track of where he wanted the story to go. He has no clue how to end it. Either that or he's become enamoured of his own prose (and the big checks.) I'm not looking forward to the next book and I probably won't read it. The Wheel of Time series has become ridiculous. End it already! Here I'll end it for you.

At this point I am through, Mr. Jordan you have beaten me.

I expect that I will continue to read them as long as they keep coming out, with the ever-fading hope that the series will someday end, and end well.Unfortunately, if the current pace continues, it will never end. In Book 10, nothing happened to further the plot. Perrin did nothing. Mat did nothing. Rand did nothing. The Forsaken did nothing. The Aes Sedai did nothing. Elayne did nothing. This book did nothing.But incredibly, I still have hope. Maybe Mr. Jordan will read all these negative reviews and try to pick up the pace in the next book. Maybe he will write an outline beforehand so he can plan what happens in the plot.

I thought that we finally had a writer in Robert Jordan who could easily rival JRR Tolkien for plot, characterization and drawing the reader into a great world. Books six to nine slowly disabused me of that notion, as they increasingly became confused and mundane. But this book is by far the worst of Robert Jordan's entire series. Its a filler, like a bad Saturday night TV show, something to hold you over until the movie you wanted to watch begins. The lack of action, the poor attention to previous plots and storylines make this a book without purpose. There is no tension or motive in this text, one may as well have condensed the book into three or four chapters in a book that moved the story along. If it wasn't for the fact that this book would leave a gapping hole in your collection, I would say don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, please end this series!","review":"Okay.

I've read about all I can stand about the \\"ageless\\" Aes Sedi, what all the women are wearing, Rand's apparently incurable pain and suffering, and an entire host of other repetitive and boring self-serving details which I could do without. Despite my aversion to leaving a tale unfinished, I don't think I'll be reading Jordan's 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, etc., etc., etc. offerings. Too I take fervent exception to the New York Times' claim that, \\"Robert Jordan has come to dominate the world Tolkien began to reveal.\\" Nonsense.

He smothered them in banal descriptions, trite quasi-emotions and hackneyed repetitive dialogue.I am no longer interested in what happens to them. Good books are about who feels the pain. Those are the characters that grab a reader. The character that is MOST effected by events...that most hurts is usually the most compelling.Which is why the best part of CoT was reading the reviews.

There was still a reasonable standard of quality.Books eight, nine and ten are simply terrible. If not for the fame the first seven books garnered for this author, I am not sure they would have been published. This is a Frank Herbert \\"Cousin of the Hairdresser of Dune\\" type plunge motivated almost entirely by money.

We want Rand and Mat, and maybe Perrin.The only parts worth reading are the characters who can channel feeling the blazing beacon, the effects from Rand attempting to cleanse the taint from saidin, and how they all react to it.This book really just somehow sucks, after 9 amazing, fast-paced ones. I hope this book was just a set-up for the finale or the 11th book or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm tired of this series","review":"I read a few chapters at the bookstore I feel insulted and robbed by this whole series. Don't do it. Enough is enough. By book eight I was hoping for ten books. By book nine I knew Jordan was stringing a decology into a dodecology or more. I refuse to read this one. Maybe when the final volume comes out, I'll backtrack and read them all. But I can't take another thousand pages of characters wandering in circles followed by a two year wait and another thousand pages of nothing happening.

Through disbelief, or fear, we will probably never know. The back-cover has only 3 short, one-liner reviews. That's saying something. To be completely impartial, I enjoyed Jordan's style for the first 50 pages or so, although the fact that there is no action in the entire book made me relegate it to the proverbial dusty shelf.Do yourself a favour. Read something serious instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete garbage","review":"Ok, the Wheel of Time started out with constant surprise, action, and a growing understanding and wonder of Jordan's world that grew as the characters did. This book was a complete lead in to his next book. The story line has gotten huge, and he barely touches on each of the subplots, or even the main plots! I had to read over 500 pages before Rand even got a chapter, and then he didn't do anything. You could easily skip reading this book, and book 11 will probably still make sense to you.

Lets talk about helping Mr. Jordan. My advice? MAKE... SOMETHING... HAPPEN!!!! PLEEEASE!! For the love of God, if I have to wade through another novel where absolutely nothing exciting happens, I'm just going to start writing my own Wheel of Time novels. I think I'll start by reducing the number of proper names in the book from, like, A BILLION, to a more manageable number like, say, six. And I'll give them easy names like Bob or Mary. Oh, and I'll also remember to make the names vastly different instead of having three characters named Bob, Baub, And Borb. I swear, I spent the whole novel just trying to remember who the hell everyone was because the last one I read was during the Carter administration. Seriously, the first six books, were awesome, but I'm starting to wonder if even Robert knows where this series is going.

The first 70 pages is devoted to new groups that readers could care less about, and the next 600 or so don't bring this novel any closer to an end. Nobody does anything. The entier novel is written only to set up the next book. As slow as everyone has moved in this book, I think its covered about 6 months with the last 4 years of novels, Mr Jordan actually has the nerve to start the story with each group, about 4 days prior to the end of book 9.

Others seem not only to lack pace, but to lack any plot development. Sadly CoT falls into the latter category. This came as a geat disappointment following on the heals of installment #9, which seemed to regain some of the momementum lost in the previous novels.

I started Jordan's series years and years ago and gobbled up his huge books in record time, eagerly awaiting each new installment. Now it is apparent he is merely dragging the story out for financial reasons, and it is a shame because this series will be his legacy. It has brought him fame and fortune, and if he allows it to drown in unnecessary verbiage future generations will not even begin reading it; they'll be forewarned and forearmed.

Alas, no such luck! Mat's dice in his head would fall out for lack of action. Let me start with the good point - it is a wonderful (wonderfully long) prologue to the next book. Lots of descriptions and insight. Having said that, the reader will still find the innumerable subplots, the unnecessarily similar names, and little or no action. There were steps taken but nothing towards any kind of sub-conclusion as in previous books. The cliff hanger ending is unthinkable given the amount of detritus the reader had to wade through to get to it. I want my money back.

It's a clunker.","review":"I am sorry to admit that this was the most boring book of the series so far. I wanted to give the author the benefit of the doubt, but it's really a waste of time. I don't think that tempting the reader with a small glint of hope that something might happen by the end of the book is fair, and the only good thing that I can say about the installment is that I got it at the used book store instead of at the retailer. I'm happy I didn't pay full price for it, but I regret having used the time to read it rather than just going to the forums for the summary. I'm crossing my fingers that the remainder of the series will be more exciting than this - after more than 10 years of waiting to see how it all ends and re-reading many of the books in the series, book 10 was a bummer. Jordan may be a great author, but this book was a clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very efficient writer","review":"I must agree with other reviewers who have complained about the length of Mr. Jordan's prose. I borrowed the CD version of the book to listen to while driving on business trips. It took about two CDs just to get through his prologue. That does seem a little excessive. It takes him a paragraph just to discuss a single action.Since I have to do quite a bit of travelling, I will probably finish the book on cd. However, there is no way I would ever buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Wheel is Broke","review":"For many years I have been an avid Wheel of Time fan. I absorbed every book RJ wrote.

My decision is to wait until he is finished and then buy the books and read the series through from start to finish... unless I am too old and can't read by then! This series is just way too long to be tortured by a piece of a story at a time! Instead read the Sword of truth series.

I cant say that anything happened at all in this book. Instead of one great story, it now seems like youre reading a few separate stories that go nowhere. Jordan spends a few chapters on each, then just kind of ends the novel in some random place. I believe that Jordan has it in him to continue writing books like he did at the beginning of the series, Im just beginning to wonder if he wants to. This book was like one giant prologue. Just a bunch of filler. And I have to agree, he brought in way to many characters that have nothing to do with the main story. Way to many names to remember. I just have to wonder, after two years, what took so long? He could have summed this book up in a quarter of the pages...

ANYTHING!Sometimes I read Crossroads of Twilight, but only very late at night when I can't get to sleep. I am up to page 278.

Unfortunetly, this book tops them all. I have never encountered a book that took so long to say next to nothing. I would say that 80% of the text is description and 20% is plot-advancing dialogue. It takes Jordan, on average, an entire page to go from \\"Hello\\" to \\"How do you do?\\" Filler, anyone? Not to mention the myriad of characters who all blend together because none of them are particularly memorable. Apparently, all Aes Sedai have some sort of hive-mind that gives them all the same personality, but different motivations.I could rant on and on about Jordan's obsession with every character's clothing or the inner digressions each character has after every line of dialogue.

Crossroads of Twilight absolutely stunk! There was almost no plot advancement, no action, and none of the page turning excitement that made this series a bestseller. Add to that Jordan's insults to those who thought this book stunk, and a lot of readers will put this series down for good. The only reason I will even consider reading the next book is because the series has been so good up till now.

The plot devolpment was horrible, very subpar in comparison to Jordan's other novels. The circumstrances the characters find themselves in the beginning of the novel are nearly identical to those at the end.For the people that are big fans, like myself, I assume you will go on to by the book despite my criticism.

The series has so much potential - despite its seemingly unnecessary complexity and volume of characters. This book does nothing to move the plot forward, presents no resolution to any of the plot twists, and ultimately adds nothing to the series. The character development is of no value, there are numerous editor slips (grammer, people, grammer), and there is no real story progress. Overall, one could omit this book from the series and lose nothing about the plot development, character positions (geographically or ideologically), and ultimately would have saved themselves many hours of useless reading. Mr. Jordan, please move the plot forward, get back to basics, and pre-read the book before publishing in the future. Remember the rule, if it does not contribute or move the story forward, delete it.

I tried to breeze through the beginning to get to some actual main characters, only to find that nothing was really going on with them either. Where as the other books in the series have some major conflict or battle in the end to make you feel like you accomplished something by reading it, Crossroads of Twilight has no such major event. Some minor plot twists was all that was given, in my opinion.I was left with a feeling of,\\"Huh!?

And then there are the weevils, dirty little devils that are spoiling the food. Okaay....It's unfortunate, but with everything the characters have been through before, a little weevil infestation shouldn't be worth 700 pages of whining and stalling. Where's the battle?

About 5 years ago, as the books became worse, I read two interviews in a row and figured out the problem. One was from Stephen R Donaldson, who said that when he gets an idea, he immediately knows how many books that idea can sustain. RJ's interview stated that his inspiration was \\"what would it be like to be tapped on the shoulder and told you are the Messiah?\\" A brilliant idea, which sustained the first 3 books; after that it has been nothing but plot without spirit or a driving idea. Everything else negative that people have said is true-- the annoying characters, excessive descriptions, lack of plot progression, etc, but I think the deepest problem is that the inspiration for the series is dead. RJ--please just let the Dark One destroy everyone and start a new book with a new idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will it ever end","review":"I cannot remember when I first started reading this series. It may be trite and cliche but Tolkien created a master epic in 3 books. Now there have been 10 books and if they all move things along at the pace of this last book he must have plans for 10 more. I was already frustrated by previous books so I checked this last one out from the library. I will never buy another book in the series. However I feel compelled to read them.

Jordon strung everyone far to much in this book. He hardly touches on Rand. The action is NONE. He does a great job of establishing characters and closing some gaps left open from previous books however this book just leaves you dry. It almost make you not want to know what happens next.

The pace is way too slow, not enough about Rand, the Aiel, fain, most of the forsaken, Nynaeve...Perrin gets stupid, Matt gets boring and Egwene is much too careless.

Although reading some of the other customer reviews has me a bit leery that even this may not help... :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Paper","review":"I have been an avid fan of the series for years (feels like decades). I bought this book anticipating the best. I am disappointed. This book doesn't even really pick up where the last one left off. More to the point, it describes the event from another characters aspect and location around the time Rand cleanses the source of the taint. It does proceed forward a little, but not by much. This whole book could have been summarized at the beginning of each chapter related to the character involved. This was a huge waste of paper and time. I will continue to buy the books and read them, because I am too far in to not know how it ends, but give the public some credit. People will stop buying the books if you don't keep them interested. This book was not interesting at all, and rather boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad I borrowed it from the library...","review":"...Overall I still enjoy the series, although the cliched \\"why are women so hard to understand\\" writing is starting to grate..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content? What Content?","review":"The guidelines for writing a book review say I should focus on the books content. Unfortunately, this book *has* no content to speak of. Jordan needs to learn how to write, Harriet needs to learn how to edit, and TOR should stop treating him as infallible because he most definitely is fallible. CoT is the proof of that. The Wheel of Time series has jumped the shark, and the sharp decline in quality of the past three books after such a promising beginning is truly sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by fans with terribly low expectations!","review":"Well, I was excited about reading this book. That lasted until around page 50, where I wondered when anything good was going to happen. By the end of the book I realized with the exception of one thing happening with Egwene (at the very end), Jordan took us nowhere slowly. As I read the other reviews I can't help wonder why even a die-hard fan would give this more than the minimum 1 star. Most of these say it's a case of Jordan setting up the next big books. I think they've been saying that for 4 books now. Don't fall for it. ... Don't do it! Don't fork over cash for this book. Try a different author instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh God, I'm a sheep.","review":"For me, this series really ended with book six. Until that point, I placed Robert Jordan on a very narrow pantheon of fantastic fantasy authors that transcended the genre to become...great authors, period.Now, I dutifully await each opportunity to fork over twenty bucks..Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anthropology???","review":"I felt like I was beating my head against a wall. I love the series and think Robert Jordan is brilliant, but this book didn't go anywhere. How much politics and court intrigue are we expected to read? This is supposed to be a fantasy novel, not an anthropolical study. It is one thing to give back story while elegantly painting a picture of an alien world, it is entirely another thing to give us a blow by blow examination of the governmental structures and their intricacies.Where is the action and fantasy in this fantasy and action novel? I get enough political analysis watching the news, I don't want it in a Wheel of Time novel.I'll read the remaining novels because I've already invested so much time and effort, but I'm prepared to complain a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I'd just like to say that this book is a waste of time to read, unless you like overly long descriptions of places and characters. The plot development could be summed up without leaving anything out on probably one or two pages. The rest of the book is just long and overly detailed descriptions. I suggest you find a summary of the book and read it, instead of wasting your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a bad Movie Sequel","review":"I've waited years to read the resolution of the various plots that Jordan created in the first nine books - and like a bad movie sequel - utter disappointment is my reward. I read the book in about two days - and as I approached the last 100 pages I kept hoping something would happen - Thanks for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"They could have saved a few forests...","review":"...Did we really need to cut down more forests for this long-winded bore.zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.............................","review":"I remember there was a time when things actually happened in these books. This book spent 700 pages talking about nothing. The plot did not move forward at all. Robert Jordan spent the first 500 pages catching everyone up to the end of the last book.Give me a break already! I feel stuck in this series because I've read through 10 books over more than a decade and I feel like I should at least stick it out to the end, but I don't think it's going to be worth my time anymore.Jordan can spend entire chapters discussing what skirts people are wearing and who is being a woolhead or a ninny - but that does not equal plot. It equals random useless filler that is BORING to read. The characters haven't been developed at all, they don't learn anything new, and nothing changes. From start to end of 700 pages nothing happened.Feel free to skip this book. Nothing happened at all. Just wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had enough.","review":"680 pages of filler. Nothing new happens, could have skipped this book entirely. Am donating all 10 books to the library, so others don't have to waste years and money, for nothing.Will not buy or read another of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"RJ's true motive ....","review":"I'm really starting to question RJ's sanity. I don't buy into the \`cash cow' thing. Who would destroy 10 years worth of work and his status as fantasy king on purpose ? I think Jordan has grand delusions about the WOT. I actually read where Jordan thinks his writing has greatly improved since the first books.This is so obviously wrong it makes you wonder where he is coming from. I also think RJ gets real enjoyment from watching his readers squirm about some of the plot twists that he's introduced over the years (some 10 years ago in the first book !!!!). Why answer questions when he can hear \`Who killed .....' for the hundredth time at a book signing. Watch them squirm, Watch them squirm ........ . This may sound far fetched , but its my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG WAIST OF TIME","review":"A big waist of time , the only thoughts that come to mind in regards to book 10 of this series. The 95 page prologue was bad enough, but the chapters just ramble on about nothing that has any relevance to the story line. Endless chapters about shawls and smoothed skirts brings nothing to the story. What started out a series of well written books has now become filler. I hope that Mr Jordan writes the final book before fan loose interest and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"is this book written by the same author or did he take a vacation somewhere and had one of his editors write this bs?With the exception of some death-watch guard, this book doesnt move forward at all. It just a fills in what everyone else does while Rand was cleanse the taint on the source. This book has no plot what-so-ever. Its definitely the worst book that RJ has ever written.I'll still be buying his books just to see to the end of the series, but wont be recommending this series to any more friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the ending?","review":"Through book 6, Lord of Chaos, this was a fascinating story. I really enjoyed reading it. Since book 6, it has slowly deteriorated. The last two books have been severly lacking in anything close to climactic. I finished this book thinking that they forgot to include the last 50 pages in my edition. Alas, no, that was the end. Thanks for taking my $20 and giving me lots of descriptions of how people look and no story to go along with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"An entire book of a great series seemed to be just wasted. This book was very disappointing to say the least. The storyline and character development may have taken 50 pages and the rest of the book was pure fluff. For an effort that took more than 2 years to create, I fail to see where the time was spent. By the end of the book you are almost at the same place you started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect bedtime reading","review":"This is a pretty nice book to curl up with just before bedtime-- I was never once tempted to read beyond midnight, and yet I still looked forward to spending a little time (yes, sometimes too little) in the lives of these enjoyable characters every night. But, really Robert-- a little plot doesn't hurt every now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two authors or One??","review":"I have been an avid Wheel Of Time Reader since the beginning. This latest book was worth about 4 chapters. The other \\"million or so\\" words seemed to have been put to paper by a different author. The phrasing and word choices were different than the unusually cunning usages that Mr. Jordan has given us in the past. Does Mr. Jordan have a ghost writer? If so, tell them to just put this series to an end and start something new. One last book for all of us diehard fans, will be more than sufficient. Don't bother buying the book unless you are a true fan and even then only buy it if you can't borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"crossroads of twilight(wheel of time book 10","review":"you can basically skip this book and it wont be any problem in keeping up with the series- Their is only one chapter on Rand-the most of the book is focused on the restoration of the lion throne by elanye and the unification of the white tower...i for one dont care about these subjects...no violence no wars just some hum drum drama including the ever so enlighting of matt's soon to engagement to the daughter of the nine moons(boring) and perrin's search for flaile still continues with nothing resolved.VERY VERY VERY DISSAPPOINTING BOOK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already!Lets end this saga!","review":"I f you are reading this, you have already read the other 9 books. If you haven't, DON'T start with this one! Robert Jordan has so many characters that the main one, Rand, doesn't even appear until page 540. I don't think that 30 pages of the whole book was directly involving him. HIs prose is as good as ever, but this books slogs along for almost 700 pages and nothing really happens until the end and even that is almost a non-event. I will read book 11 when it comes out because I enjoy the Jordan style, but I want a conclusion already. All this book did was drag armies from one spot to another with nothing happening. Too many names of minor characters and not enough contact with the major ones. Let's hope that book 11 winds this whole thing up so that Jordan can start a new adventure. The early books were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheel of Time keeps spinning","review":"A major disappointment. Little plot development, endless descriptive paragraphs with little contribution to the storyline or character development, basically hundreds of pages with virtually no movement. I had been a big fan, but in the future I suspect if I read any more Jordan it will be a paperback. Given the torpid pace of this book, it is likely you could pass over it and still pick up the next volume without missing a step."},{"rating":"1","title":"The never ending story - g'mme a break","review":"I've followed this series with the original eye of the world that was released in paperback. That book mentioned that it was the first book of a trilogy. Nine books later... apparently Robert Jordan has decided to milk this story for the rest of his life. Although the first three books were outstanding, nothing of substance happened in the last7 books!?! I for one have gotten to the point that I don't really care what happens anymore. I would have bought this book if the story came to conclusion, but from reading all of the other reviews it's just waste of more time. Robert, if your reading this, GET ON WITH IT. I'd be a lot harsher in my review, but you know what they say about being an author vs. a critic <sigh>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of Twilight--disappointment from start to finish","review":"At first I hoped that I was only imagining that the 95-page prologue was meandering and meaningless. Unfortunately, the following 600+ pages were just as meandering and meaningless. Mr. Jordan exercises an incredible ability to build sub-plots that go into more (unnecessary) detail and depth than the main plot(s) and apparently serve no real purpose. I've waited eagerly for the last few books in the series. Now it's like Star Wars...I'll buy it and I'll read it, but only to get some sense of closure. I no longer \\"eagerly await\\" the next pieces of story; just PLEASE get it over with. If you're a die-hard fan, buy this book. If you're sort of a fan, wait for the paperback. If you've never read the series don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing & Unnecessary","review":"Robert Jordan did not need to bother with \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\". Absolutely nothing happened. Only at the very end does one of our major players end up in the hands of the enemy. The rest of the book is a waste of time, both in advancing the plot and in developing the characters.In addition, Mr. Jordan is either thoughtless or arrogant to not include some kind of synopsis. If he is going to make readers wait so long between books, he should include some kind of list of characters and how they came to be where they are in the story. He could probably even make money by selling a separate \\"Guide to The Wheel of Time\\". Because I enjoyed the first nine books so much, I would probably buy it, in spite of Book Ten. Book Eleven will determine whether or not I give up on this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ever happened to.....","review":"Why are there so many dropped storylines?Will the Ogier or WayGates ever make a reappearance as important?Will I ever be able to tell any of the Forsaken or mysterious new 'evil' players apart, I noticed a disturbing tendency to introduce new disturbances in the force every time a forsaken is defeated?What/Who is Padan Fain?What about Rand's father?Trollocs - are they just not around anymore or what?Why do I even care about this. I need a notebook to tell anyone apart and main character's story threads will be entirely dropped for hundreds of pages...It would be different if I thought it was going anywhere...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Recap","review":"So we go into \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" expecting big and exiting things to happen do to what happened in \\"Winter's Heart\\". Well that's not the case on this the 10th installment of Robert Jordan's epic: \\"The Whel of Time\\". For some reason I think that the Wheel of Time is turning at a slower rate, and in some cases going backwards.The page count in this book is marginal compared some other gargantuan volumes in this series, and three quarters of it is a recap of what happened in the last book.I was so exited to buy this book that on it's release date I was in line at the Store where RJ himself was showcasing the book for the first time, I get home and read it, and 4 days later I'm like, That's it?Wait for the paperback, and don't hold your breath for the next book.George R.R. Martin Song if Ice and Fire is a much better story IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to Tears","review":"The last 4 books in the Wheel of Time series have been so boring I'm ashamed to admit I read them. CoT is probably the worst. It's impossible for this series to return to the lofty heights of the first few books, but now I am concerned that Mr. Jordan is afraid or unable to finish the series at all. He goes on and on. Nothing of any consequence happens. Avoid this series like the plague. I want to know what happens--if anything else ever does happen--so I'll probably finish it and give Mr. Jordan and his publisher more of my money. I wouldn't wish my fate on any other living person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Nowhere Fast","review":"The 10th book in the Wheel of Time series...you would think that by book 10, something would happen. Well, like the previous reviews have stated, nothing happens. I take that back. Fists are made, dresses are smoothed, braids get tugged, etc. Actually, it's on par with book 9 (\\"Winter's Heart\\"). It seems to me that Jordan needed something for filler between books so, he wrote \\"Crossroads of Twilight.\\" The entire book could've been summarized in 1-2 chapters in a different book. So, it could've been book 10 still, but it would really be book 11 with book 10 as the first couple of chapters. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"Nothing happens. There are hundreds of pages of filler. I have enjoyed the first 9 books very much, even though most of them switched stories too often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot??","review":"I have to agree with other negative reviewers. I have been a fan of the Wheel of Time since the beginning and Jordan's current trend is frustrating.Crossroads of Twilight just had no major plot ocurrances. There is the usual characterisation, but nothing of interest happens! As we are getting near the end of the series you would think that things be be heating up.I ask you....a 90 page prologue with no major characters just to go over what has already happened??With all the things that need to be done, the rescue of Faile, the storming of Tar Valon, the romance of Mat and Tuon, a united Caemlyn, not forgetting the final battle.....will the series go on forever?? Please put us out of our misery Mr Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this written?","review":"This is the first review I've written. I usually just read the reviews written by other people but I felt compelled to write one about this book. I cannot understand why Mr. Jordan wrote this book. The book goes nowhere. A lot of characters I've never heard of, or will probably never hear of again were introduced. Absolutly nothing was accomplished, moved forward or resolved. What a \\"LET DOWN\\". I really like the Wheel of Time series, but if Mr. Jordan can't come up with anything better than this book, he has lost himself a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Value Your Books By the Page","review":"Folks, I have tried, really tried to enjoy this series. Jordan has creaed such a wonderful world with interesting characters, but I am now at the end of Book 5, and I plan to abandon this series. It seems many readers simply continue to read because they have \\"so much invested\\" they don't want to end the insanity. I am honestly dumbfounded by Jordans' writing style, no other author I have ever read draws out a plot as he does. It is mind-numbing and boring. Like other reviewers, I find myself trying to read ahead in a desperate attempt to find something interesting. If you are just starting out reading the Jordan saga, I recommend you stop and save your sanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowest installment yet","review":"I waited anxiously for 2 years before this 10th book in the Wheel of Time series came out. I read the reviews here and they convinced me not to rush out and get the hard-bound edition. Man! I'm glad I waited too!820 pages of which only 1 chapter chronicled the activities of the main character Rand. Sheesh! Lots of talk about him, but almost none of the other supporting characters and substories interacted with him. In Book 9, he cleanses Saidin of the evil \\"taint\\" of it and yet none of the other characters even know about it.All my griping being said by many other fans of this series, I will still anxiously await to read reviews of the 11th book in this series before I decide to buy the hard-bound edition immediately or wait for the paperback one.I only hope that Jordan's remaining days of life will permit him enough time to finish this story before one or both of us die."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"As many have said already, it was long and dry. The details were laborious, the weather, the buildings, and expecially the dress and actions. Most of the book is that, details which get to no where. The book has the feel of setting the scene for the next stage, yet in and of itself, nothing happens. The last 2-3 chapters tell all that is really important"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great night-time sleep aid!","review":"My feeling is exactly as I read read in other reviews... NOTHING happens, Rand makes an appearance for about twenty pages, and oh yeah, just how much embroidered silk do we need to hear about?? I think his overly detailed descriptions of what people were wearing took up a combined total of 450 pages! All the pertinent happenings could have been told in 100 pages. The first few books of the series kept me up to all hours of the night... this one put me sleep before night even came."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I felt that very little moved forward in the story. While I enjoyed everything as I read, when I got to the end all I could do was say \\"Thats it?!?!\\" Two years is a long time to wait, and I hoped for more. None of the cliffhangers from \\"Winter's Heart\\" were answered, at least not completely. I would have liked at least one thing to get resolved. I guess my final vote is indeed, disappointing. Great reading, but at the end, I was not satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame","review":"As a french reader I have read Robert Jordan's books for many years, and was expecting eagerly Crossroads of Twilight...well, I was, and I am, very, very disappointed. Near 700 pages to tell nothing ?! If it is not a shame, it is without doubt a record."},{"rating":"1","title":"700 pages of nothing","review":"I loved the first 7 books in the series. The past few have just been about making a buck so you will buy more books. NOTHING happens in this book. Did I need to read 700 pages to find out that all the characters are in exactly the same spot as they at the end of the last book? PLEASE! I'm writing to the publisher to complain"},{"rating":"1","title":"The never-ending story...","review":"I can't believe I waited more than two years to read this extremely disappointing piece of work. The Crossroads of Twilight does absolutely nothing to advance the story line of the Wheel of Time series, if there is, in fact a storyline to be found anymore.It would be different if he were writing a TV series, or a soap opera where a new episode comes out every week, but after more than two years since his last volume,I expected much, much more.It's almost as if the writer and his publishers have found a cash cow and don't want it to end. Whenever they need more money, Jordan just cranks out another 700 pages of drivel and then drives to the bank.I have read and enjoyed Mr Jordans work in the past, but quite frankly, I don't think I'll be able to work up much enthusiasm for the next installment of his never-ending story."},{"rating":"1","title":"To RJ: It stinks!","review":"I wanted to like this book I really did. There were only a few parts that I found to be interesting, such as the scene with Alviarin and Perrin's interrogation. Unfortunately that didn't justify the rest of this book. All of the scenes with Elayne were awful, I didn't care anything about that siege or the politics at all. Rand was hardly in it also, after accomplishing so much in the previous book, that's absurd. This was not the quality writing I expected after waiting so long. I don't buy the argument that this is a setting up book either, I don't feel that you need an entire book to set up your plot. Jordan should be ashamed of himself for putting out this terrible quality book.He owes us book 11 much sooner, and it needs to be far better than this or I'm done with the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"flash2028","review":"I love this seriese and I'm trying not to take this book personally, but its hard. I feel bad for every person I have turned onto WOT. Jordan and his editor have managed to turn die hard fans against them. I've kept hope that some of the side plots hinted at in ealier books would be resolved eventually, while the main plot progresssed slowly. Its hasn't happened at all. It just keeps growing and going no where. My little brother is currenlty reading book six and is loving every word. I feel bad knowing whats in store for him. I would keep hope, but I can't fathom how Jordan could address everything he has introduced with out some spin off books. It is all such a dissapointment now. I'll probably wait until the series is finished before I read another book and then I'll spend as little money as posssible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I quit","review":"I quit. I started reading this series in high school. I think I was able to read up to book five(?) before having to wait for the next book to be published. I graduated from college last year. I don't mind waiting years to read the next installment of a quality series but tWOT hasn't been a quality series for quite a while now. This book was the final straw."},{"rating":"1","title":"who is controlling this series?","review":"The PUBLISHER!Listen, I love these books...books 5 and 6 were two of the best books I've ever read in the genre, but this is ridiculous.Jordan has stopped telling the stories of these heroic people, and instead is PADDING his work with endless, tiresome, and unimportant drivel.At this point in the series, do you honestly CARE what kind of velvet Elayne is wearing? Stop describing clothing and get to the point!I felt cheated and will not buy the next book until it is out in paperback...or maybe (god forbid) I'll just borrow it from the library and save the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The books should be called \\"The Waste of Time\\" Series","review":"I know I will draw much ire for my criticism of Jordon on this latest farce, but I am compelled to believe that this most recent book was more about the contract to write a book than do any justice to the world he has created. It's fluff, filler, boring! I found myself skipping entire paragraphs and then pages and finally chapters,looking for something to develop. I feel I could just abandon the series and never pick it up again with much regret, especially when stuff as mediocre as this last book is touted as being akin to greats like Tolkien. It will take alot for Jordon to redeem himself, in my opinion, or even match what has gone before in the next few books. I may never know, because as it stands now I just want my money and time back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of Twilight","review":"A waste of time!! Wasn't this series originally supposed to end with the 10th book? There is no good reason to drag this out.Jordan has lost the respect and appeal he gained with the earlier books in the series.Guess I'll reread Glen Cook's Black Co. series again(best ending ever!) and hope George R.R. Martin finishes A Feast for Crows soon.Boy, did he ever raise the bar with the Fire & Ice series!! Better to do it his way and take more time and deliver something that satisfies than the tripe Jordan has turned out the past couple of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment in a great series","review":"Let me start out by saying that I would defend every other book in the Wheel of Time series. Though some were certainly better than others, I liked every one and have reread the series numerous times. But, Mr. Jordan has finally written a book that even I can't say I like. I was unaware that it was possible to write a 700-page book about ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. But, I now know that it is possible.I look forward to the next work in the Wheel of Time series. I hope that Mr. Jordan can return to his previous standards of excellence. And, for those of you who plan to continue the series to its finale, I would recommend reading this book just so that you catch the bits and pieces of seemingly important information that Mr. Jordan sprinkles in. However, don't go into this with any high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Robert Jordan gone senile?","review":"Despite the waning of this series, \\"The Wheel of Time\\" has consistently provided; believable characters, thick and rich detail, well thought out development, well paced action, and an amazing world parallel to our lives but with enchanting differences. Crossroads of Twilight has NONE of that. The characters feel stale, and uninteresting. The detail that Jordan had so mastered was taken to excruciating levels. I couldn't stand reading through four pages about what the feel of the camp and the inside of a tent was. After it was already introduced!Each of the characters separate plot lines lead to nothing. No form of resolution, no answers to previous questions, and tedious new questions.Ether Robert Jordan is trying to sap every last dime out of this series, he has the worst case of writers block ever (despite almost 700 pages 0 content!), or he is senile.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK UNTELL THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT. Then make sure that one is not tripe either."},{"rating":"1","title":"672 pages of limbo!","review":"If I had it to do over again, I would wait until book 11 comes out and then read COT. In this volume each of the major characters makes a small, incremental step toward the next book while managing not to do anything interesting.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing - very little plot advancement","review":"I'm a big fan of WOT, but this book is very dissapointing. At least in the last book, we had something big happen with Rand cleansing Saidin. In this book, very little happens with the plot and a lot of it is just people who can channel noticing Rand wielding a ton of the One Power and their reactions. One of the few good things in CoT is that we get to see more of Mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Whole Bunch of Nothing","review":"While the book is written well, it is filled with a whole bunch of nothing. I think this is a dirty trick the author is playing. There are so many stories being told, that at this rate, the series will require 50 or more books to complete the story. It's time to start tying them together. I really don't want to be 50 years older waiting for the end of the story. But then, I suppose that is good for his wallet. I say, get the story told!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"The absolute worst piece of crap I've ever been subjected to. There ought to be laws covering crimes such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan's Weaved A Pattern He Can't Control","review":"...P>Jordan has weaved himself a pattern that there is still no end in site. Nothing happens in this book, that couldn't have been writen in 200 pages. There is no movement of plot, and very little building of characters.He has 3 easy chances in this book to close certain plots, but instead he drags them on, and introduces new problems to these plots. You could easily skip this book and go straight into number 11, if it ever comes out, and not miss a step.Don't get me wrong, Jordan is as colorful and detailed as ever, and that is the problem, I don't need to know EVERY LITTLE DETAIL OF EVERYTHING, just the main points!At this rate, the end won't come till book 15-20, and who knows if he is even going to be alive by then to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"waiting for godot","review":"It appears that Jordan has forgotten for most authors, the key to a good story is that there is a good story. One that brings you from a beginning to a hopefully rousing end.I guess he is too caught up in the warp and the woof of the weave of time that always is a beginning; not THE beginning, but a beginning, and absolutely never, never an ending.Frankly, no one would have missed anything in the plot development if this last volume of WOT was balefired out of existence.I most regret having bought all his books in hardcover... now it seems that they, if ever completed, would take a space on my bookshelf larger than the encyclopedia britannica, and yet tell a story that goes nowhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this be the reverse of book 6?","review":"I mean by this.... Book six is really a continuation of book five but with to many pages to fit in one binding. After reading this book I see it as the first half of one very long installment. The other reviewers are correct though, nothing really happens. Also, one reviewer mentions that you should wait and see how many more books there will be. According to Mr. Jordan, as of last fall, there will be two more installments."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I can't express how disappointing this book was. In the prologue it all seemed so promising and then NOTHING ELSE HAPPENED. Not a single thing in the prologue was developed more than 10 pages beyond the prologue. Rand was in it for a sum total of 15 or 20 pages, and he DID NOTHING. Not to mention i think they mentioned the cleansed saidin TWICE, and just IN PASSING. Also, there were no bad-guy chapters, so we got nothing new there, not to mention the fact that the boring-as-hell Perrin sidestory took a needless boring-as-hell detour to a stupid pointless town and took up half the book. All in all, it .... Please make the next one even half decent. After Winter's Heart, I was just so sorely disappointed. I ordered this book last August for god's sake. So disappointed. One extra star for an interesting prologue, but none for the entire rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly mediocre","review":"Robert Jordan has proven himself to be an excellent writer in the majority of his books in this series, but it seems that the pace of his story has become excessively lethargic. This book continues a disturbing trend of focusing on less-than-pertinent minutiae in a plodding play-by-play of the charaters' actions. Until the last 30 pages or so there is no actual advancement of the plot, and even then all he provides us is foreshadowing of important events that, given his current plot pacing, may not occur until a thirteenth or fourteenth book.While I admire Mr. Jordan's style of writing, I find myself having to be an apologist to my friends regarding the quality of this book and the future direction of this series.In short, I am unsure where he is going with his magnificent story. I apprehensively await the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK!!!","review":"While I wasn't expecting his book to be action packed, I found myself turning page after page wondering when SOMETHING, ANYTHING would happen. I did get one smidgin of action near the very end with an apparent abduction of one of the main characters, but the situation never evolved. Let me state that I am a HUGE fan of the WOT series. I think the whole mythos is wonderfully developed, highly entertaining, and intellectually stimulating. However, I read this book with the thought that Robert Jordan must not be able to decide where he wants to go with this. I felt the book was written as a money maker, NOT a continuation of an incredibly rich tapestry. This is the first WOT book that actually bored me. Not your best work Mr. Jordan. I'll hold out hope for the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK! What on earth is going on? This series used to be fantastic, but it has digressed into something less appealing than a glass of Metamucil. These characters used be be wonderful, the writing was eloquent and engaging, and things *happenned*. But now, I read 200 pages of badly written narrative to learn that absolutely nothing has occurred. Forget about it and go and read something else. The ingredients on the side of your cereal box will be more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody Fire The Editor","review":"Now I've read all of Jordan's books. There's a lot in there that's good, and the series started off so well. Somewhere however, the series has become lost and mired in intricate plot that has no momentum or direction. Many have blasted Jordan, but I would suggest another source: THE EDITOR. Who in the heck could be signing off on this and saying with a straight face, \\"Yeah, that's great Robert. Maybe you should introduce a few more plot lines and characters\\". Fire the editor, get Jordan back on track and let's bring this puppy to conclusion. Write another series in the same world later, but for the love of all that is good, please finish it. I hope the folks at TOR are reading these reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of Twilight","review":"I have waited for a climax to this series for a long time now. The early books were interesting and had exciting settings and action. Book 10 on the other hand was like watching old reruns from Eastenders.

Thank you all for reassuring me in the belief that I was truly ripped off for buying this book and furthermore, had hours of my life wasted reading this drivel. This is just a note to fellow disenchanted readers, after an hour trying to find a way to contact Mr. Jordan to tell him to wrap it up, I was unable to find any such portal to expell my wrath. I encourage you all to wait until the final installment, and even then, just share the book amongst friends. . . we all have paid far too much for such little entertainment and Mr. Jordan's personal endulgement.

In the entire book, nothing happened to advance the story. There was not a single confrontation involving channeling. Come to think of it, there was not a single confrontation. I think that either Jordan has no idea how to finish this story or he is trying milk this series and extend it indefinitely. He'd probably make more money if he wrapped it up and just got down to selling \\"deluxe gift boxed sets\\". At this pace, no one will be around to read the conclusion. We all will have long ago given up on him ever finishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"Before reading this book, I went back, and started reading again from book one to book ten. When I did that, I realized I really did like Path of the Dagger and Winter's Heart and Crossraods. I think what frustrates most people is that there is a 2 year wait...when I could flow from one novel till the next it seems like one continous story. Although, I'll admit, I wish more time was spent on Mat than Elayne...which is why the book only gets four stars.Truly the main characters can't be fighting major wars every book, they'd run out of soliders before the final battle."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKS","review":"Inane, Boring, The worst book I have ever read.

God, I can't get enough, this is the most amazing book in the history of mankind.Let me explain. You see I have, for some time, had trouble falling asleep. Nothing worked (except large amounts of alcohol, and that brought on its own set of problems), until I got this glorious piece of sh...literature.Afterwards, I couldn't fall asleep fast enough! This book is so dull and tedious, its like paper chloroform. Thank you, Robert Jordan!P.S. The best part is that even after I finally finished the book (probably in my sleep), I can still use it for its god-given purpose. All I have to do is think back to any part of this \\"torture-with-letters\\", and I'm out like a rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book so far","review":"I was hugely dissappointed to find that book 10 is the slowest moving book thus far. (at least it seemed like that to me) I skimmed over much more than I read in hopes of finding something resembling a storyline. There was so much useless drivel and description that I fell asleep reading Robert Jordan several times!! (a first)Who am I to say \\"don't buy\\"...if you've stuck with the series this far, in all likelihood, you'll buy as I did regardless of the poor reviews. But \\"don't buy\\". Get on a waiting list at a library. RJ needs to quit milking his previous success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whole lotta nothing going on","review":"As a series, you have to have the book, however, read the first and last 5 chapters and you'll keep your sanity.Jordan has succumbed to the \\"people will buy anything\\" crossroads(pardon the pun) in his writing. As far as I can tell, only one 'thing' happens in this book. It is basically 500 pages of telling life stories of people you never heard of and on the whole, this book could be a five page pamphlet for all that gets resolved.Mr Jordan, please end this now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back.","review":"I was a latecomer to the Wheel of Time. I obviously liked it, because I read ten books. This book felt like an episode of daytime television. Nothing meaningful happened, and I wondered if Jordan really means to keep writing the series until they nail his coffin shut. I actually took the book back to the store and demanded a refund. I have NEVER done that with a book before. I felt like I was being exploited by the author for his own pecuniary gain. Very disappointing. You see, I like Egwene and Rand and especially Perrin and the rest of the Scooby gang. And I want to see the story resolved, but I'm not going to read ten more books that don't do anything to get it. I compare this to say, Robin Hobb, who wrote nine books in the same world and somehow never bored me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed and Disgusted","review":"Enough is enough. Books 1 through 6 were magnificent. Books 7 and 8 slowed way down and I had trouble getting through them. Books 9 and 10 totally stink. Nothing seems to ever resolve itself and the characters have become boring, boring, boring. RJ started out with a great idea but has bowed to corporate greed and is stretching out this series for what appears to be some hefty pocket lining. I have decided I am finished! I will not buy another book in this series. Totally disgusted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm...","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. The first couple of books in this series were very good, but they have most definitly been getting slow. In fact they have slowed down so much, this one literally moved backwards. 680 pages of absolutly nothing. I congradulate you Mr. Jordon, i don't know many authors who could have filled that many pages and yet nothing happened. I guess I'll read the next because the series does have some good characters (the ones i could keep up with) and on the positive side there's nowhere to go but forward, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan is loosing it.","review":"I don't know how this book ever got published. You would think that one of the proof readers would have told RJ how bad it ..... The WOT series has changed A LOT since I started reading them back in 1993. The first books were full of action and adventure, but the last 3 (including this one) are some of the most boring stuff I've ever read. Nothing happens in this book. Can I say it any more simple then that? Absolutely Nothing Happens. Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Robert Jordan still writing these?","review":"This book was terribly disapointing. He spent the first 500 pages retelling the end of the last book,then in great detail nothing much happened the rest of the book. I loved the first books in this series but now I doubt I'll finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably BAD","review":"This is just so sad -- Jordan could have had a phenomenal 5-book series, that would have gone down in history as one of the greatest fantasy series ever. Instead, he seems to think that we readers like to read hundreds of pages that describe background characters that we don't care about and have nothing to do with advancing the story.The only way he'll ever end this series and put us out of our misery is if we stop buying the hardbacks -- be patient and wait for the paperback version or read it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"quantity rather than quality","review":"I was fortunate to discover TWoT series for the first time last year. I had the pleasure of reading all 9 books one after the other, and enjoyed all of them, even the weaker installments. So, I was waiting with bated breath for Number 10 and bought it as soon as it hit the shelves (in hardback too, which is something I rarely do). I should have waited for the paperback edition. The latest installment is very poor. Turgid plotlines, seemingly unending chapters of characters meandering through the plot: even the villans seem distracted. The only entertaining section was that describing Mat and Tuon. Hopefully, book 11 (if it ever arrives) will be better......."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought the last one was bad!","review":"At the ripe ol' age of 27 it now feels like I have always been waiting for the next Jordan novel my whole life. I loved them up to six and was disappointed by 9, but hell... at least it had an ending. This book really just goes nowhere. He could of at least had someone fight a big battle with the Seanchan. Maybe one fight with the one power, I would have settled for him discribing a murder happenning instead of 'oh by the way someone got their head ripped off last night'. cliffhangers are for sequels, not 12 book series that are 600+ pages each. A hundred pages of action at the end or even the middle is something we deserve for forking out about 200 dollars or so each by now (and now i've had to buy some in paperback because of wear). I don't want to wait for and buy the next but I'm sure I will and that shames me. I'm weak, don't be, pass on this one and the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheel of Time?... Waste of Time!","review":"Utterly, utterly auwful. Mr. Jordan, do yourself a favour and simply disown this book altogether. Just think, you could simply stand up and say 'no, I'm sorry, it was a terrible mistake' then write another book ten, which, hopefully, would be the last in this already hoplessly elongated series.The only reason you should buy this book is as fuel for the fire. And with the amount of drivel Joran puts out, it would probably give quite an appreciable burn-time.Yes, the great, seven-spoked wheel has finally ground to a halt - and to be frank I no longer care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Otherwise Known as \\"Wheel of Money\\"","review":"Man must be getting paid by the word.

I still cannot believe I have wasted more than 10 years of my life! Honestly though, the first 5 books were well worth the time. Of course I read those in a couple of years. Having to wait 2 years / book and then get this nonsense is criminal. There are way too many characters for any sane person to have even a vague interest in. Most of these are just clones of each other, right down to the way they dress and talk. It normally takes me a couple of days to read one of these books (1-5 anyway), Book 10 took me 6 months. I still have no clue what is going on. If you are planning to buy this, I strongly suggest you dont. Maybe if sales go down(probably too late now) RJ will start writing the Wheel of Time again instead of writing about his winter holiday and renaming characters.Can we give negative stars in reviews?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already","review":"Yes, this series has really ground to a halt and is slowly suffocating under the weight of it's own hubris. But I will still read each new book, though it's a lot easier to wait for the paperbacks, now. One thing bugs the ever living crap out of me though: what is Jordan's obsession with fashion? He spends four or five pages setting up every scene by describing EXACTLY what each person, important or not, is wearing down to the buttons (LITERALLY, HE DESCRIBES THE BUTTONS!). Was he an aspiring fashion editor who's dreams were dashed? I think he created the whoel dreamworld thing solely based on the idea that people could change what they were wearing with mere thoughts, fulfilling his fantasy of describing a new outfit every 5 seconds.Anyways, this book is nothing special. If you're deep into the series, then you know what you're getting yourself into. If not, well, reading war and peace will be quicker and make you look smarter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever written. Bar none. Deserves -5 stars.","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read in my entire life(or in all my other lives if I was shirley mcclaine). Nothing happens. I think reading the ingredients to a can of soup is more exciting. The only good thing about a book like this is to show aspiring authors how not to write. In addition to Strunk & White's book on writing, this book should be quoted for 'bad style' quotes. Oh, this book makes an excellent fuel if you run out of logs for the fireplace. I don't believe in the death penalty. Therefore, I would let deathrow inmates read this book.However, that might be considered 'CRUEL & UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT'. I just finished reading this book, and am seriously considering suicide;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOT Changed my Life, COT just about Ended It","review":"Eye of the World was the first book I ever read for pleasure reading. I absolutely fell in love with it. I have been biting my nails waiting for every new release. I forgave Winters Heart for dragging because of the amazing Ending.Crossroads of Twilight had nothing. It kept going on and on about characters that I couldn't even keep straight. They are all minor characters who have names spelled very closely.I think I have officially Switched over to Sword of Truth Series by Terry Goodkind. (A new novel about once a year instead of every 2 and there is absolutely no plot lagging there)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the POINT already!","review":"This book was such a disappointment that I felt compelled to write my first review. It's too long, has no plot development and is so filled with incidental characters that I felt like I needed a reference dictionary.Did anyone else notice that characters repeat themselves? The first time it happened, I thought I'd lost my place and was re-reading something. By the third time, I started to get irritated. Doesn't Jordan have an editor? If he does, I'd say it's time to get a new one.A thoroughly disappointing book in what started out as an exciting series. Save your money and try George R.R.

I love this series, and will have every book on pre-order when available, but this book was definately unimpressive, and completely forgettable.When you have 8 or 9 major characters/storylines running at the same time, it is hard to progress all the characters... So what you have here is many short stories where next to nothing happens for the entire book. This is NOT what I would have expected after waiting 2 years after book 9. There is SOME plot progression, but not muchWhile not a complete waste of time, it is the next best thing to it.I can't wait for book 11... maybe in 2 or 3 years.

The 9th book was a relative improvement, in part thanks to the last chapter.The 10th ? as bad as the 8th. It sounded as a wrap up of EVERYONE around the conclusion of the 9th, and for the firsts 600 or so pages, nothing that really was new.I just have a simple question, how many dragging books will be written before this story actually ends ? Every good story needs an end, and this one was due 2 books earlier.

Of course I will finish it, then read the next ones as they come out (paperback or library of course, never hardcover again) for no other, better reason than that I do want to see what happens next. \\"Game of Thrones\\" by George R.

ALso, the Prologue was tough for me to follow, and I have read each previous book! I hope this is not the end of the series! I can't recommend the book and don't think any reader will miss out if he jumps from the previous one to the next to come. Bummer! And now we all sit and wait another year or two.

I rushed through WoT for this?!","review":"I began reading the WoT series in June of 2002, and already I've finished reading CoT. I love the series, don't get me wrong, but number ten was VERY disappointing. It's great that an author would want to describe more of the world his books are written in, as well as current events within the series...but...where's the action? Where's the edge-of-your-seat feeling I got from reading 1-7 and 9 (sorry...ten seems to follow the monotony of eight). I'm waiting anxiously for number eleven, I just hope it's very soon and MUCH longer. Eh...this gives me some time to go back and review stuff in case I forgot, maybe even begin Terry G.'s Sword of Truth series. C'mon, Mr. Jordan, we want more!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled.","review":"As with all of the books the writing is excellent and the plot full of deceit and intrigue. However it is far too drawn out slow moving. What Jordan could say in a page he takes a chapter for. Nothing is said about the male half of the True Source being used except for a line or two from Rand's miniscule part in the book. It was somewhat of a trial to get through the whole thing but nonetheless I read on, hoping that something important would happen. Only three very interesting things happened and one of them seems to be the setup for the plot of the next book. Nonetheless I would have to recommend it to people who are fans of the series because let's face it, there are things in here that you will need to know if you are going to read the next book and though it will be a slow ride just hope that the next book will make up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can it be more than 2?","review":"I think we can all agree that Jordan is an excellent author. My disappointment is not in the writing but in the lack of movement within the storyline. I've never skipped a chapter before...before! I guess it'll be another 2 years for the next one. Since this 700 pg prologue sets up a promising 11th book. I would rather wait three years and have something worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"Ok we get it, Jordan is fantastic at character development, but really, after 1000's of pages, I have a pretty good grip on the characters.

Absolutely nothing was brought to a close. If you are a fan, then I would suggest getting a copy off of IRC (#books) and wait for the remainder sales. There is no reason to support this ...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost his touch!","review":"Robert Jordan has lost his way, he's lost a commitment to the story, and he's lost a commitment to his fans. How long is this tired story going to continue. Where is he going? It's a really shame, because I've come to love most of the characters. This may be the last book of his I ever buy. Which is really very very sad since I fell in love with the story with the first book. Those of us who have followed you and this story from the very beginning deserve better from you Robert Jordan. We really do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for Book 11.","review":"Big Battles, Conquests, Action & Intrigue are not to be found here. The book catches up our favorite Aes Sedai, Elayne, Egwene, Perrin & Mat from where we left off on book 9. VERY SLOWLY!!! Over half the book is dedicated to this goal. This was an awful slow read, no action, much plotting and finger pointing. The plot moves forward about a week, with little activity, with only one stupid ill-conceived action by one of our favorites for a new cliffhanger.I'm sure Robert Jordan put some foretelling in this book, and some plotting has taken place, but from my view, you probably can skip it and wait for book 11. The time taken to read this book was a complete waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited two years for this?","review":"I'm very disappointed... a couple suprising things happen, out of 600+ pages of the first WoT novel I've actually found hard to stay with. It took me a few days to finish it, since I kept getting bored with the lack of plot advancement. RJ, we know you can do better than this. You've proven it, so why are you leaving us with virtually nothing new until book #11?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody Save ME!","review":"i must be brainwashed or something. i keep telling myself that i wont pay for another one of these books, but.....WHY CANT I STOP? its called curiosity. when you start reading TWOT series you kinda get into it and you really wanna know what happens to the characters of the story. But it never is enough and then you have to wait years for the next one to come out....it really is rather painful. These books suck you in like some kind of bizarre soap opera and here in hawaii, things usually come later then in any other place in the US. i HATE IT. bUT OF COURSE I'll probably buy the next one...Unless i die, or Robert Jordan dies...hey thats a thought, i wonder how old he is. WILL IT EVER END? anyway, if you really want to, read it.If you have all the books with you when you start, they really are rather interesting...but oh so painful when the story is cut off."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring...","review":"Book 10 can be summed up thusly: it recaps everything that occured in book 9, itself a stuttering bore until the final pages. This is the book where everyone stops and chats about things, what happened before, what they might like to do in the future. And, of course, endlessly complaining about things that they don't understand. Mat Cauthon, generally regarded as the next most exciting character, next to Rand, spends three chapters deciding to... pick up stakes and move a circus. Perrin spends over a hundred pages ... doing what he did in the last book, exactly nothing worth reading. Elayne spends several chapters discussing how she might consolidate power in Caemlyn. Egwene spends endless time discussing how she might overtake Tar Valon. If you've read the dust jacket you already knew all this! Reading this book is similar to having a friend tell you about a great movie, rather than seeing it yourself. Get to the action, man! Argh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book ...","review":"I have read WoT with love and devotion for the past 9 books. 7 and 8 were a little slow but the end of nine had me thinking the story was going to pick up the pace once again...Sadly, crossroads of twilight is the worst book in the series; advancing the story maybe a week, and only mentioning Rand for about 15 pages. Robert Jordan needs to get on the ball and finish this series before he dies of old age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally a WOT book to match its \\"Sweet\\" cover.","review":"Yet another 680 pages of turgid prose. PoD was bad, it was redeemed however by the battle at the end. I liked book eight (I can't even remember the name) for the battle with the Seanchan. This book however had NOTHING that was worth reading. Literally nothing. If you even go back to RJ's Conan books and those Fallon books you will find no peer to this garbage. Jordan has lost his reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summary","review":"I wish I'd gotten a summary before I read the book, it can be summed up in two words-nothing happens.

In the future I will read it at a bookstore rather than wait for a year in anticipation"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"Hundreds of pages of needless exposition with maybe 5 sentences of plot advancement.

It became quite clear to me half way through this book that it was going nowhere so I decided to not finish it. There are entirely too many characters and after two years I have absolutely no idea who is who. There seem to be a million different Aes Sedai, Senchan, Sea Folk, Kin and Etc. Keeping them straight is difficult and when they do close to nothing, it seems pointless to try.This book was simply awful. I am deeply disappointed as once I looked forward to each installment with great joy, now, I will simply have to ask one of the poor souls who continue to suffer how it ended. I foresee this conversation taking place in ten to twenty years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheel Has No Beginning And No End...Kind Of Like This Series","review":"Well, I won't be fooled again. I will not be reading another Robert Jordan book, ever. I'm so disappointed it has come to this, after so much time invested and such a promising beginning. When Jordan can't even get 3 stars from his most loyal fans (the only ones still reading), you know something is very wrong. The warning signs have been there for him for the last 5 books or so, and yet he can't seem to take the hint. I'll stick to George R. R. Martin from now on for my epic fantasy, a man who seems to still know how to put together a complex world AND make things happen in it that keep your interest page after page and book after book. Sorry Mr. Jordan, you blew it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please end something","review":"This book is a complete waste of time, ink, and paper.Other reviewers have bemoaned the lack of action. There doesn't need to be action if there is progress and conclusion to threads, sub plots, characters. There aren't ANY! In the author bio in the first few books there was a statement that RJ intended to write until they nail the coffin shut. I used to regard that as a promise. Now, I think it is a threat. Victor Hugo would have hidden his head in shame at the useless excess verbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This one is the worst yet,and that's saying something, I only read it for the occational glimpses of his old style shining through.Unfortunatly it's too late for me to stop reading the series now, but if your new to the WoT then save yourself and get out while you still can, you will only be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potboiler that WON'T end","review":"This series had a good start for the first three books or so, but it has devolved into many plotlines that are sometimes skipped for entire books. That would be okay if the story kept moving, but instead we are subjected to multi-paragraph long descriptions of characters dress and beliefs and then the character is never seen again. That isn't good writing, that is fluff and filler.The only reason I bought this book is because I had thought there would only be 10 books in the series since the pre-quel is out. Foolish me. Not only has Jordan given up putting serious effort into the series, he will NEVER FINISH IT. I not only suggest no one read this series, I suggest no one read this author unless you are into masochism.PS: How do you look at a ceiling and see that the square tiles \\"interlock\\"? I mean, how can they be squares, yet be seen by an observer to interlock?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have my money back?","review":"This book is boring from the first to the last page. It seems that jordans books are getting worse as the series goes on. In this book he is focusing on parts of the overall storyline that we do not need to know and would frankly be better off not knowing. There was not one exciting scene in the entire book. And this was a fairly long book. There are too many names in this book. The majority of characters are not important in any sense and should be left out completely. This is a message to jordan: Get on with it and stop trying to milk us for all we are worth. I refuse to buy another one of your books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refund Please","review":"Content? We don't need no steeeking content.Or so Mr Jordan would have us believe. 620 pages of BLAH with maybe 50 pages of worthwhile material scattered through the entire book like corn through a fresh load in the bowl.Theonly good thing I am willing to say? No Nyv to *sniff* repeatedly.Plenty of tugging of skirts and knuckling of various features to more then make up for it. And don't forget a riveting expose on silk laundering.I'd call it drivel, but even drivel would say this ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I saved my time & money","review":"After the last few disappointments, I refused to allow Jordan to make a fool of me again. You people have shown me I made the right choice. I will wait until this thing hits the [money]discount bins, buy it, and put in on a shelf with the first 9 (In my opinion only the first 4 were worth the money). When Jordan decides to quit milking his fans (suckers is most likely the more accurate word)I'll pull the books down and read them.For those of you who want to encourage him to conclude this thing, refuse to buy any more books until he does. Better yet, return every one that can still be returned. Odds are he and his publishers are laughing at us, they might not be so willing to laugh once sales dry up."},{"rating":"1","title":"RJ has been replaced by a computer program","review":"Maybe RJ is dead and Tor has a computer churning out his books.

More importantly, I get increasingly frustrated that the \\"good guys/gals\\" cannot seem to add 2+2 and come up with 4... I know they can't be perfect (or we would have no story), but do they always have to be so clueless?As many others have observed, George R.R. Martin's \\"song of fire and ice\\" series is much better at keeping the pace going and keeping the characters interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The slowest book in the series","review":"Reviews of Jordan's WOT books usually complain about the slow development of the plot. Although the first five books are definetely more exciting and better written then the last five, until this novel I was still a satisfied reader. Book 10 however was a complete dissappointment. Jordan spends 850 pages on description of how a riding skirt looks and which fringes the Aes Sedai wear and less then 50 on actual plot development; \\"slow\\" is a nice way of describing this one. Personally, I don't know if I have the patience to wait another two years for the series to continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"This novel is simply horrible. It is the most boring read I have ever experienced with any author of anykind. I find sitting down and reading through a University text book is more enjoyable than reading through this book by Robert Jordan.Jordan should take story-telling lessons from George RR Martin, a much superior author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Waste of Prescious Resources","review":"If you want great fantasy as opposed to poor, read George RR Martin's series instead.Martin's characters and plot are both interesting-something lacking in this overdrawn boring series.If you enjoy reading pages of description irrelevant to the plot, you may enjoy this series. If suffering from sleep deprivation, read this series but keep a barf bag nearby.Comparing this series to the classics demonstrates a unfamiliarity with the classics and is an insult to the classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I started this series because I had heard a lot about. Thefirst few were good and interesting. However as I readfurther into the series it became harder to keep up an interest. I'm usually a fast reader, but this one was a choreto read. I had to force myself to finish it. I will probably finish this series, provided it is finished in the next 10years. There are many things I don't like, the women, the1 to 1 kidnappings per book, these \\" powerful \\" peoplewho anyone can overpower. I see a silver collar around Rand'sneck in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new soap","review":"This book is reminds me of the daytime soaps on TV, you can skip this book and still not miss the story.

Mr. Jordan has been placed on the \\"wait for the paperback\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very DULL, long winded catch up.","review":"Seems like Jordan is milking this series for all he can. This is the second time that he has not really moved anything along in a book. Nothing MAJOR at least.

Now that he is getting nearer the end the books are half the size but not half the PRICE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"This book is horrid, absolutely horrid.1000 pages and nothing happens. Absolutely nothing happens - never again will I buy one of these.I actually loved the first 4 or 5 books - raved about them to anyone who would listen.

Horrid is the only way to describe it.Shame on you Jordan, shame on you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of Twilight","review":"This book is only mildly entertaining. In all about 200 pages are worth reading. If it was a film it would have had a number of scenes removed. There was far too much tedious detail which added nothing to the plot. I'm sick to death of Avienda and Elayne. There was way too much stuff about Aes Sedai and Egwene. Wouldn't it have been more interesting to have more detail about the Asha'man. There are also quite a few characters who I have forgotten. It would have been nice if the glossary at the back had more imformation for those of us with short memories. In an interview with Robert Jordan he said that orginally he had planned three to four books. He then thought six would be enough. It is now up to ten and this last one was a big disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"674 pages of nothing","review":"I have loved the previous 9 books in this series and would rate them all 5's. This book, however, stinks. NOTHING HAPPENS. Most books have some sort of climax, this has none. I don't know what took him 2 plus years to write this but I hope I won't have to wait another two years to read the next book. I feel as though I wasted my money purchasing this. Do yourself a favor, borrow it from the library, this book isn't worth the paper it is printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"How repetitive","review":"This book is true to Robert Jordan's form- slow, plodding and overly detailed. He spends pages describing dresses, of all things! Not a single clothing change goes unnoticed, as each dress, no matter how transitory, gets its embroidery, material, color, feel, protection from the elements, and cleavage showing described.He also fails to move the plot along strictly because of the sheer weight of the 15 or so subplots that don't need a chapter to review. The book lacks focus, and it shows.It wasn't always like this. Jordan's first five books in the series manage to include enough detail to completely flesh out the world without weighing down the action. The previous books had a minimum amount of downtime, but now he writes entire books of downtime.I don't know; I'll give the series one more pass. If Jordan drops the ball again, that's the last straw."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 years for this?","review":"I can't believe I waited 3 years for this. The book would not have been so dissapointing if the time between editions had only been a year. If I have to wait 2 or 3 years for the next book I may not finish the series, it has proven to not be worth the wait with the last 3 books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wheel of Time has stopped turning","review":"I have only one thing to say to Mr. Jordan and that is \\"MOVE IT ALONG, SIR\\" because the plodding pace is wearing out my patience. How could you have published this book, when it could have been pared down into the prologue for Book 10 is just unbelievable. If Book 11 is anything like the last 3 books and most especially Crossroads, then I will no longer be reading The Wheel of Time.

I've been reading this series for 13 years now, and was hoping that with the momentous event at the end of the previous book we'd finally start wrapping this thing up. Nope. The plot advances very little in book 10, there are no big surprises or revelations and the characters are all still in the same predicaments they were in at the end of book 9. I can't imagine what the author was thinking. For the vast majority of the book, we see what everyone else was doing up to the time of the end of book 9, so it's not even advancing chronologically. Still, I will be one of the first in line to buy book 11 because after such a substantial investment in time, money, and enjoyment of the first 8 books, I really want to see how this thing ends. If it ever does."},{"rating":"1","title":"In his own words","review":"Robert Jordan wrote his review, \\"The words popped out of his mouth before they were clear in his head.

There was more time spent describing what everyone was wearing than there was advancing the plot! Not a single trolloc, myrdraal, battle, or discovery in the entire book. The only bright spot was the interaction between Tuon and Mat, other than that I'm horribly disappointed. If you are a fan of the series, you will probably read this book, if you have only read the first few, don't expect this to follow in the footsteps of the early part of the series. If Mr. Jordan cares about his fans, he will get back to what brought us all in in the first place; action, plot advancement, new discoveries, and a light at the end of the tunnel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A couple hundred pages of pure drivel...","review":"This book was pathetic. I slowly managed my way through the 90 pg. prologue, where, of course, we are plagued by new characters or minor characters that don't seem to have any real purpose in the greater scheme of things. And then I start getting into the real book. Nothing happens.Oh well, I shrugged, and continued reading. 400 pgs in. Nothing has happened. Absolutely nothing has happened. Unless you count a two page essay on how to clean silk.As I got closer to the end, I slowed, hoping that -some- action would end the book, that at least -one- plotline would be resolved. But no.Robert Jordan needs to wake up and stop writing what appears to be 650 pg. prologues for the next book. At this rate, the series will -never- end and he'll just continue to reap in the dough. Well not anymore. I, for one, refuse to buy a Wheel of Time book again. Thanks, Jordan, for writing six good books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Jordan, but just an overlong prologue","review":"Much has already been said about this book, so I'll summarize my point here:There is insufficient plot and character development. Jordan essentially wrote 700 pages of prologue to his next book. Crossroads of Twilight could have set the stage while managing to tie up at least a few of the many loose plot threads in the series. It lacks any real direction or purpose, which makes for an unsatisfying reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight on a series","review":"I frequently sample new writers and am frequently surprised to find a new favorite author...which is how I initially lucked into Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I normally look forward to his releases but now just look forward to the final installment, if/when he ever decides to write it. The 10th book in the series is beyond the pale; just looks like random thoughts put together to meet a publishing deadline. I skimmed through countless chapters of minor players...too many threads in this convoluted picture. Hopefully, the editors will take note of the many negative critiques this book will get and will get Jordan back on track. As for me...I will wait and read the reviews FIRST before buying any new installments in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wheel of Time has a flat....","review":"Robert Jordan is still not over the 7th Book Itch. Unlike fellow Charlestonian, Citadel Grad, and author Pat Conroy; RJ is evidently spending too much time walking the beaches of Kiawah and staring at his fish. Absolutely minimal action and no real plot development. I have read all the books in this series, and feel incredibly let down by this lazy apparently last minute effort. To add insult to injury, we are to wait 2+ years for more disappointment? Oh Goody.

IT'S WORSE!!. TAKE EVERYTHING SAID IN THESE REVIEWS AND MULTIPLY IT BY ONE THOUSAND!! It's that bad. I will certainly not buy any more books by RJ until he finishes the series.

I have to disagree with the person who said Jordan doesn't \\"steal\\" ideas, he just adapts them. I'd agree with that IF Jordan's \\"borrowing\\" was simply the general story of reluctant savior/youth saves the world. But the parts he steals are entire characters, tendencies, battle styles, etc. The Void is straight out of Steve Perry's works, as is the \\"Crane Fights Boar\\" \\"Turtle Rushes Down Stream\\" etc. battle moves. The main characters start out as sad copies of David Edding's works. I'd call that stealing, not borrowing. Of course, we see from recent books 6-10 that Jordan is incapable of creating anything interesting any more, so that must explain it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm DONE with Wheel of Time!","review":"I was an AVID fan of the first five or six books of the Wheel of Time series, but books seven through ten have really had that \\"throwing in the anchor\\" feel to them, as Jordan slowed the storytelling pace to a crawl and milks this thing for all it's worth. It's come to the point where I literally cannot finish reading the latest book \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\". The story is so slow, so tedious in its detail, and so sprawling in the number of characters and political minutia, that I have reached the point where I no longer care. I'm deeply saddened that Jordan has transformed such an initially good and emotionally engaging story into such dry, lifeless tedium. Don't waste your money on this travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gnashing of Teeth","review":"To say that I am frustrated does not capture the depth of my feeling. I, like so many others, suffered the years between the last installments hoping beyond hope that this one, unlike the last several, would move the plot forward. I like character development and I enjoy the art of writing a scene so that the reader can actually envision it. But, that said, we read epics because of the adventure. There was no adventure to be had in this volume. It was a sidebar: What everyone else doing when Rand cleansed saidin. It certainly could have been said, if it had to be said, shorter and without the repetition from earlier installments. And then, the book should have moved us closer to the Last Battle. I look forward to Number 11 with dread. I will read it because I have come this far. But it is the last time that I will take Jordan on faith. If 11 doesn't come through, I am finished with the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"in response","review":"This book did not stink because it didn't have war. This book stinks because nothing substantial at all happened. NEW CHARACTERS were introduced. Get on with the story of the characters whom we have grown to love and whom we bought the book to find out about. There was no character development or plot development. I now have a clearer sense of what people looked like, dresses, smiles and all. This series is like a professional athlete; If it sticks around too long it will become a laughing stock. Robert Jordan if you are reading this, the reader wants closure. I seriously think he will die of old age before finishing the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the.....?","review":"I don't really know what to say....this book was a real let down.....especially after waiting over two years...I was really hoping to say \\"Wow !

After finishing each, I couldn't wait for the next one to come out. However, in the last 2 books, Mr. Jordan has taken tens of thousands of words to painstakingly say absolutely nothing. With creations of fiction like this, he should take his talents to the speech writing corps for the Democratic Party. I have wasted [money] and two weeks of my free time reading his last two \\"efforts,\\" and have in doing so, I have been played for a fool. I'll not be again.

It would have been wonderful if something would have actually happened in this book, but descriptions of clothing, pointless conversations, and the introduction of literally dozens of characters that do absolutely nothing fill this book. I think Jordan has completely lost touch with the idea of what details are important to a story. If this series is supposed to end in another 2 books, my guess is everyone will sit around and smooth their skits and drink tea until the last page of book 12 when a horde of space aliens will swoop down blow eveything up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not very advancing.","review":"Just about everyone else has had it correct so far, the books good, but it dosent get the story moving more then a bit. I just finished it, and i must say it was very well written, like all of them, and entertaining....but VERY little happened! It just set the story up some more, but if the story gets set up much more, its going to fall down. The next book in the series has the possibility to be one of the best hes ever written, but after waiting two years for the tenth book, and having it advance the story less then a week or two past the 9th book, i dont know if i can wait that long again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Mr. Jordan...why???","review":"Sigh. Yet again...a Wheel of Time book. I remember when my cousin gave me the first book in this now delapidated series. It was so fresh, so vibrant, so interestingly differnt. He was vividly descriptive and even though a fool could've seen that the main character was the Dragon Reborn, it was still fun to see the characters slowly come to that realization themselves. And once they did come to that realization, readers knew they were in for something truly epic...and so they waited for the next book...and the next...and the next...and the next...and the next...and nothing has yet happened. Doing this with two books would have been forgivable, after all, everyone makes mistakes. However, Mr. Jordan refuses to listen to his former readers. This review says exactly what every other review said: boring, redundant, not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment abounds","review":"I was greatly disappointed in this book. Compared to Book 9, this could have been about Little Orphan Annie.The only action takes place in the first few pages. Nearly 350 pages are taken uup with \\"deep\\" insights of the three major female characters. There is no conclusion or even a hint of one. The three male heros are left in limbo.I think that Jordan is using The Wheel of Time as his annuity. I expect another ten in the series to keep his royalties coming in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens!","review":"I loved this series, but this book just sucked! NOTHING HAPPENS! No issues get resolved, no mysterys are unraveled, no answers are given. Rand is still pretty much crazy, the rebel Aes Sedai are still sitting outside Tar Valon, Faile is still Gai'shain, Perrin still isn't able to do anything about it, Mat is still trying to get away from Ebou Dar, Taim is still in charge of the Asha'man, it's still winter, and the Seanchan are still invading. After 700 pages of discriptions of embroidery, silks, gilded chairs, how cold it is, and every other stupid detail that doesn't matter, we will have to wait another two years before the next book comes out. Will it even add anything to this great story? I hope so. Crossroads of Twilight is a waste of time. Everything that happens in this book is effectively summed-up in the liner notes. Go to a book store read that and wait for the next book and you will have gained as much insight as all 700 pages would give you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless.","review":"If this book had never been written, the Wheel of Time series wouldn't change. Nothing happens. Nothing. No major plot developments. No minor plot developments. A whole lot of characterization, and yet, Jordan's characters are all blending into one sort of 'SuperCharacter,' which cannot be stopped. Run away. Flee this mighty evil. Its ceaseless whining and conjecture about things which it knows to be false will only bring doom! Dooooooom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spinning Wheels","review":"I've enjoyed the series, and will likely buy Book 11, but this installment was disappointing. Please stop \\"spinning your wheels\\" and get on with it.If Book 11 is not more entertaining, it may not be the ending, but it could be AN ending for many readers of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I just have to say I am very disappointed with this book. I was waiting for some great action after the source being cleansed and got none of it. I think Jordan needs to pick up the pace and get this series heading towards the final battle. Starting to get a bit ridiculous with all the tedious and boring routines the characters seem to be going though."},{"rating":"1","title":"How long, Lord, how long?","review":"I was an enthusiastic fan of the series, couldn't wait for the next book to come out, then read... this... whatever it is. It's like the time you spend in an airport waiting for a delayed connector flight. You're not going anywhere, you don't have much to do, and nothing interesting is going on - you're really just keeping your place in case something happens later.It just seems that Robert Jordan has lost his enthusiasm for this story but doesn't quite know how to end it. Maybe he hasn't been able to come up with an idea for another series so he's not ready to let this one end because he needs the money?"},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't even finish it","review":"Not even worth one star. It is a shame and a tragedy that this \\"author\\" is so popular when genre masters like Robin Hobb, Guy Gavriel Kay, Steven Erikson and others go unnoticed. Jordan and Tor should be ashamed of themselves. Rest assured Jordan and Tor will not be getting any more of my money or time. STAY AWAY, for the love of God, STAY AWAY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, my Wheel of Time stopped. Somebody wind it!!","review":"Too many characters, glacial action.Here is a summary of all the action in this book. Perrin chops the hand off of a captured prisoner to get information on his kidnapped wife, Faile. A minor character is stabbed (but healed), and the perpetrator is shot in the back with a crossbow.That's it. All of the action in the entire book, summarized in two long sentences. To be sure, there is plenty of tea drinking and hand wringing and various groups of women talking to each other.I suppose that the series is making progress, as we have moved from reading about how much lace they wear in Ebou Dar to how much embroidery they wear in Jurador.Clearly, Robert Jordan would rather write about hemlines and necklines than sword fights and magic duels.I want a refund on the last five books (books 6 through 10)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I liked the beginning, and I want to see the end... I'll liken this to driving - I live in Idaho so I guess it would be like driving to Las Vegas which is a trip filled with nothing but barren desert. This book represents the lamest part of my drive through said barren desert."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will you make an end?","review":"I have been waiting for some plot movement since book #6. This story should have been a trilogy, not a campaign to wipe out forests. I could insulate my attic with all the installments of this story. Please, someone, edit this story down to the meat."},{"rating":"1","title":"I quit around book 6, or was it 7?","review":"These reviews are just amazing. I was looking for something to read tonight, and ended up entertaining myself by reading at least 100 of these reviews. The one-star reviews seemed especially on target.At least, I think they are, since I haven't actually read one of these books since book 6, or was it 7? I just remember starting the last book I tried to read and it spent the first 100 pages with 'the women' bickering about something, and I thought, 'I'm really, really tired of this. I cannot relate to these petty folks.'So, I did myself a BIG favor and STOPPED READING THIS DRECK. And you know what? I haven't missed it one bit. Last thing Mr. Jordan needs is encouragement to write more of this swill.And like so many, I was really disappointed, because the first four books were pretty good. But, the series has become more and more tiresome as each new book is released. No more for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"omoi peplegmai kairian plegen eso","review":"This book ought to embarrass its author. After dominating the world of epic fantasy for a decade, RJ has either become so megalomanical that his editors can't reason with him or he just plain lost control of his story. _Crossroads_ is the worst installment in an increasingly tired series. If tarmon gaidon doesn't come soon, the world might just collapse under the weigh of all the cardboard charaters and trite phrases that have appeared in the last three books.Perhaps RJ just plans to flog this dead horse until The Wheel comes full circle."},{"rating":"1","title":"There needs to be a plague...","review":"I can't stand the characters any longer. Rand is a snivelling, self absorbed, mopey, boring, weak... I have run out of descriptions to describe how loathesome he is. Thankfully he only entered about 15 of the 700 pages.In fact, all the characters have become loathesome. I can barely tell them apart anymore. Maybe because they are all pretty much the same character in different clothes. Lots and lots of different clothes. This book would be definitely improved by a massive plague going through the world, wiping out half the characters. We wouldn't even miss them.I join the other reviewers in grieving in the loss of what talent Jordan originally had. Perhaps he has massive writer's block and is disguising it with this drivel.Get it from the library if you have insommnia. Sure-fire cure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do we bother?","review":"Not long ago I used to reguarly check WOT sites to find out when the next book would be out. Now I find myself regularly checking this page to read the latest review - they're far, far, more entertaining.But why is this book so bad? Because it doesn't have a single redeaming feature. On its own I can put up with bad characterisation, I can put up with a ridiculous amount of description, I can put up with the main character present only for about 20 pages, etc. etc. But I can't put up with all this together for 800 pages.It goes without saying that I'd never reccomend this series to anyone who hasn't started it, and to anyone who's read to book 9, but reads slowly: just find a summary on the web - you'll save yourself much torment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when its finished, please.","review":"What else can be said about this horrific book? The sheer amount of paper & ink spent detailing what the characters are wearing is absolutely mind-numbing. When you've got to rely on good reviews from the likes of brown-nosing want-to-be writers who call the general public a bunch of dim-witted bulbs, because they can't appreciate \\"good literature\\", then you know you're in trouble. No, this is not \\"good literature\\"; it is stupid. And it's a slap in the face to every customer who naively slapped down their hard-earned money for this gargantuan book in the futile hopes that Mr. Jordan has decided to write for us mere mortals again. This book is boring, slow, ponderous, & about as exciting as my college algebra textbook. Please, for the sake of your sanity go pick up something else, anything else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Colossal Time Waster","review":"Bla,bla,bla,bla,bla,bla,bla,bla,bla.........the END! Thank goodness it's over ! Robert Jordan needs to fire his editor's and any one else he goes to consult with on new books.\\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" introduces more characters than the bible in less pages not to mention what their wearing,what they feel about nothing and what the weather is like when you meet them ARG!This book was even worse than the last one which I will some up for you ; Bla,bla,bla,bla,bla,bla-Mighty battle-the end !Mr. Jordan you need to give your head a shake! Perhaps try reading Terry Goodkinds \\"Sword of Truth\\" series to reinspire yourself.The first books in this series were masterful!!!!! I keep hoping Jordan will get it back ..........I almost wonder if he even wrote this last one!ps.This is my first reveiw(the thought of writing this was the only thing that let me finish the book!)pps. Robert we know what your capable of! Thats why we'er all so disappointed :( ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again!","review":"WOT - does that stand for Wheel of Trite? Did Robert Jordan's wife write these last few books.?Either Jordan has a limited recollection of his earlier writings or perhaps he has contracted Alzheimers. Why else would he repeatedly introduce so many new trivial characters in place of developing original plot lines and major characters. It is pure frustration! (And shame on you fellow WOT fans who gave this book four stars even while pointing out the slow pace and lack of story deveolpment.)Tell your accountant not to worry however Mr. Jordan. I have invested so much time that I will read to the bitter end; because the first six books were excellent and I care about the main characters.However, I would NOT RECOMMEND anyone to start what has become a tedious and frustrating trudge through thousands of pages of meaningless new characters, lands and subplots ."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be a complete wool head to have read this far.","review":"I was one of Jordan's biggest fans through the first 5 books. Great characters, imaginitive premises and satisfying resolutions -but each following book in the series has been less and less enjoyable. This one really takes the cake. Jordan seems to take great pride in introducing a minimum of 17 new characters in each chapter, each one supplied with generous physical descriptions and absolutely nothing more. It is impossible to keep track of , remember or differentiate 178 different Aes Sedai and 220 Sanchean, 44 Two Rivers, 28 Saldeans..well, you get the point. He's lost complete control of this series. I won't read beyond this chapter. Even worse than this is the fact that nothing happens. Nothing!! Rand himself is barely in the storyline. I've never written a review online, but I couldn't wait to burn this one. Do yourself a favor, and start following another writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Past Time To End It","review":"I have been a fantasy fan for a very long time. I started with Stephen Donaldson, moved on to Terry Brooks and then to Raymond Feist and David Eddings. At one time, Robert Jordan ranked with the best. That time has long since passed. The book is uninteresting and does nothing to move the series along. Jordan fans should skip it so as not to lose whatever love they may have left for the series. Jordan has long since run out of new or interesting things to say, and it is time to end the series. Hopefully he can find a final novel that is worthy of ending what was once a truly outstanding series. I do fear, however, that he has lost interest in what he does and is merely holding on for as many paychecks as he can squeeze out of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dickens Has Nothing on Jordan","review":"My God! I thought Dickens took eight chapters to say what most people can say in a paragraph, until I read this! I'm a big fan of the series, but I'm ready to trash my whole set...anyone want them? The important events in this book should have taken place in less than two chapters. With Jordan writing under a pseudonym and writing prequels all I can think is that readers and fans are being taken on a ride by both the author and publishers. Enough is enough! Release the next book in the series and make sure there is some substance to it or more and more fans will lose interest. The whole series should end in the next one or two books, at the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping for a turn around.","review":"I think Jordan did not really start losing it until Book 7. That book was the first time an ending occured with really no big event occuring and no converging of plot threads. Since then things have become worse, with the exception of Book 9 which is OK.But this one takes the cake. So much has been said in the other 2000+ reviews that I will only add: THERE IS NO REASON TO READ THIS BOOK. Because no plot lines advance or characters converge or events happen, a reader will have no problem going from Book 9 to 11.I have hope that Jordan can round out the series with two more books channeling the 1990 Jordan which hooked us all.If that happens it would save the series. And perhaps future editions of the series will conviently omit this book. It would be easy to do and not missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One paragraph expanded to 600+ pages","review":"This book could have easily been edited down to a single paragraph. I held out hope to the last page. I've defended Jordan as the books have become progressively bland and I've been a huge fan until now. I'm done. I feel molested and cheated. When I realized that I had 3 pages left in the book and was still waiting for some big plot twist, something to blow my mind, it dawned on me that I'd wasted a lot of time not even being entertained. I feel betrayed and very disappointed.600 pages of characters sitting around talking about tea and the weather. Even when we come across a haunted village, the characters sit outside it and talk about it then leave. Nothing. nothing.... nothing. what a waste.You know, I'm becoming angry as I write this. I don't even care how the storey ends now. This book was a money grab and a fatal blunder. Jordan, you've stolen the last money you'll ever get out of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you reviewers","review":"I stopped buying the WoT books after Book 7 (which I could not finish) but from Your SNAP I can tell I missed nothing. Not buying until the last book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can hardly wait for the next 36 books","review":"If you have nothing to do (and you don't want to do anything anyway) and you have lots of time to do it, I encourage you to read this book. I'm confident that the opportunity to fill your time with drivel and pointless narrative will be satisfying.By my reckoning, approximately 10 days of time passed in the lives of the characters in the span from page 1 to page 800. At this rate, we can look forward to 36 books from Robert Jordan just so we can see how the characters spend one year of their lives.My biggest dilemma is this: Should I donate the book to a second hand store so that the next reader contributes no money to the author and to Tor, or should I burn it so that nobody is subject to this farce of fiction? Hmmm... something to ponder.Don't buy this book. Let Tor know you're disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Boring Than Watching Grass Grow","review":"Would give this book -10 stars if possible.

The entire storyline of this installment can be summed up into two words \\"nothing happened\\". I have every book in the wheel of time series and have read them multiple times with great enjoyment. But this last book is just horrible. You keep reading the book waiting and hoping for something to happen and nothing ever does.In the Prologue, the \\"Wolf\\" is introduced into the story line then never heard from again. Are we to wait three more years to find out what his attack plan against the Seachan is and wether or not it will work?It is almost as if Robert Jordan doesn't know how to end the series and is writing this book to waste time.I recommend that anyone who has not purchased this book wait for the next installment and start from there. You won't miss a beat.Severely dissapointed in Mr. Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloooow","review":"I've been a Jordan fan for years, the first five books hooked me. This book, however, is incredibly slow moving. Get ready for minute details: the color of a random Aes Sedai's dress, the trim of her shawl, the hair color of an unknown Aiel... the list goes on. Plot advancement in almost nil, new characters come and go, never to be heard from again. What's the point? I hope Jordan gets things moving once more; it will probably take him two years to write the next book and my patience is wearing thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of the Never Ending....","review":"To put it bluntly: \\"This book [is bad]!\\" 700 pages ... .Let me say, I do love the series and I re-read everything before the release of each book. But book 10 is completely worthless and anyone can skip this whole book and not miss anything. The book spends 500 pages telling you about what other people were doing during events that happened in book 9.Nothing at all was accomplished in this book, no battles, no moves, nothing more or less then people talking to each other. I can't believe I actually spent so long waiting for this book to be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must...push....on...","review":"Almost there!Wait, what?

Oh come on how can you possibly finish this series when you go entire books without accomplishing ANYTHING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh look, its finally finished...","review":"I bought and read this even after the last several books sorely tested my standards for a preferred plot advancement rate of delivery. After putting up with another long winded novel to nowhere, I have unilateraly decided that the series has ended. If there is ever a book eleven, I won't be wasting my time reading it and if we all do the same, it really will end.I have dealt with this type of disappointment before with Roger Zelazney (and son) and can certainly drop Mr. Jordan's series as well.

Everyone should stop reading this tedious series until Jordan stops writing (hopefully) or finishes it (not likely)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poop on a stick","review":"Well I hated this book but attributed it to the massive fever I had when I read it. I could describe the tissue paper I used to blow my nose in Jordanian fashion but they limit me to 1000 words! Oh I also noticed the Mr. Cashing In Jordan has a book for sale in January.

I love the first 6 books - but, I've been disappointed, and to be honest, dismayed at the rest of them - especially this one. I don't care what everyone is wearing! Really! I want some action. I can only figure Jordan's getting paid per page, because this book was entirely filler. I really don't see how he can end this series in even 3 additional books. He's got too many characters - that I can only imagine have no actual purpose to the story other than to bide the time before he figures out what he's going to do with the main 20 or so characters.

Fair trade for this book? I think not. Jordan is an oxygen thief.Here's the deal: Jordan is married to his editor. No kidding. He can barely call what he does writing, and she obviously can barely call what she does editing. A perfect marriage and a perfect crime, for this series will no doubt continue until there are no more trees left in North America.Stop the madness.

I can hardly begin to describe my excitement at reading 5 pages of description about how the Aes Sadai choose there seats at their town hall meeting.Jordan has also introduced a new interesting liturary vehicle, the \\"slow down the plot until it actually travels backward in time\\" technique. Using this innovative tool, we may finally be able to answer the question that has been plagueing us all since book one... \\"how did the forest squirrels feel as they watched Moirain, Rand, et al. leaving the Two Rivers at the start of their epic adventure?\\" Of course, given his current pace, we won't hear about it until book 20..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dying of Thirst","review":"Being a Wheel of Time fan is like being in a dessert, dying of thirst.

I started reading this series when I was about 14 or 15 years old. I am now 27 and was so disgusted with the last one that I took someone's advice in this forum and started the George RR Martin series (excellent series, fufilled the promise of what WOT should have been). I do not see how people can continue to spend on money on a series that is obviously now published only to appease publishers and fans. Would any of you have bought the second book if Eye of the World was anything like Mr. Jordan's last 4 books? Will there be anyone around to find out how this once good story ends?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn me, even the plot summaries are BORING","review":"Having given Books 8-10 a pass (due to the disappointment of reading Book 7) I went to Dragonmount.com to read the summaries of said Books to see if there was anything interesting I missed. What greeted me was a bewildering flurry of names, places and various love affairs. I had a hard time keeping track of what was going on withing these summaries (i.e., I was completely unsuccessful - maybe it's because the summaries weren't written very well, who knows...); I shudder to think what kind of time might be had actually reading these books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm done.","review":"So sad. I can vividly remember reading the first few pages of \\"The Eye of the World\\" for the first time. I was but a teenager, and this book, and the ones that were to follow, would make me far more critical of average fantasy fare. Alas, I am no longer in high school. In fact, I am no longer in college. Come to think of it, I'm pushing THIRTY (!!!!!!) and this story continues to unfold. The tragedy. If this series had been but a moderate success, I am sure that it would have been wrapped up (with a bow) by book six or seven. The author has lost his handle on this story, and on my interest. Though it pains me to declare it, I give up on this series. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"600+ pages of nothing.","review":"Sigh....Anything I could say at this point would really be redundant (much like this book?), except that I'll admit Matrim's courtship of Tuon charmed me and made me laugh, so he gets the second star for that. Jordan really can't do characterization, can he? His characters feel like playing pieces he's moving around on a game board. Anyway, for a *good* fantasy series with convincing, well-drawn characters, one that actually makes progress from book to book instead of going around in circles, both plot-wise and with regards to character growth, check out Michelle West's Sun Sword books (The Broken Crown, The Uncrowned King, The Shining Court, and The Sea of Sorrows.)

His tendency for excessive descriptions of every character bordered on tedium. Of the nearly 700 pages barely 100 made any contribution to moving the plot along. The remainder covered endless descriptions of characters clothing, mood, hairstyles, accents and continual smoothing of skirts. Even when the stated smoothing was not necessary. This volume was a complete disappointment based on the strengths of previous books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing really happened.","review":"Its part of a huge series that I habe been longing to read for three years.

Matt travels with a circus. Perrin blushes a lot and doesn't shave. I know they say that these last few books ahve been building up for some great finale. If the Last Battle doesn't happen soon I'm not going to buy this series anymore. It took me a month to read just because I couldn't read more than a few chapters without becoming tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens","review":"I like many others have been very patient in watching this series unfold. Unfortunately, my patience is at an end. Over 700 pages and nothing of importance happens. Rand doesn't even make an appearance until after 500 pages have been laboriously turned. Tolkien only needed three books to tell his amazing story while Jordan is on his 10th and counting with no end in sight. I hope Jordan actually reads some of these reviews and realizes how terribly disappointed his fans are. I will not buy another book.

Jordan will not get another dime from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"After the last 3 books I should have known better than even think this book would be worth reading much less spending money on. I should have got something more exciting like Plato's Republic. It isn't like I absolutely have to have to have to have a book with lots of action but it should at least hold my interest past the prolouge. The fact that I got through it is a prodigious achievement for me, one which I shall never try again unless I am highly medicated. One star is more than this book deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"Like many reviewers here I had been initially angry becasue of the lack of pace in CoT; also, the number of pages which are pure filler, where nothing happens seems to increase with every book in the series and this is kind of annoyingI am not angry anymore. I think that Jordan simply lost his inspiration; both he and his publisher are likely to be desperate by now but what can one do?! Robert is not the first one who has fallen out of graces with the Muse and he is not the last.

This man almost single-handedly represents what is wrong with the fantasy genre today. It's not because he lacks talent - it's because he has talent but betrays it in favor of the all mighty dollar, and at the cost of his loyal fans....P>If you want good fantasy (which \\"The Wheel of Time\\" started out to be), turn your sights to George R.R.

THAT is how it's done."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Battles, No Excitement, No Suspense","review":"When I first started reading this series I enjoyed the first books because of the colorful characters, the fighting that went on, and way the characters worked through problems.

I have read this series since the beginning and am a big fantasy/sci-fi fan. I am also highly educated and do not have a short attention span. Not only is this a bad book with no movement, repetitive drivel about clothing, customs and fashion, and an almost misogynistic treatment of women, but I remembered around page 470 that I'd promised myself not to buy the next WoT book for the same reasons. I'm extremely disappointed that I have stuck with this author through 7000 or more pages, and this ... excuse for a next installment is all I have to show for it. I hope I remember my pledge to not buy the NEXT book. And the millions Robert Jordan is getting for each of these \\"books\\" guarantees he could care less what his fans think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip to page 600 before you fall asleep!!","review":"I struggled through book 9, it was a roaring adventure compared to this one. Honestly, you might as well skip to page 600 and read the last few chapters. All Jordan does is continue to muddy the waters and drag out the story line on what has grown to too many characters. I have heard he plans to write 12 in all. Fortunately, he won't get any more of my money as I intend to wait for my public library to buy the books. All I can say is the next book better \\"pump up the volume\\" to get us closer to closure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh....","review":"Mr. Jordan...for the love of...I know you intend this series to be your life's work but please don't making reading it, mine. The last 3 books have become tedious to the point of me only reading it the bathroom. I read the first 5 one after another with great delight and interest.

Robert Jordan opened my eyes to the world of fantasy books with his \\"Eye of the World.\\" It seems that the last few books has showed that the well of his imagination has begun to dry up, but the ink in his pen has not. Like many of the others who have reviewed this book, I find that he blabs on and on about nothing. He doesn't introduce anything new and exciting in this book. His characters, plot, and imagination have stagnated. Like another Amazon.com reviewer, I myself ask, \\"Why was this written?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"672 pages of setup - No action.","review":"This book was incredibly disappointing. This series is going downhill hard. Each of the last few books was a long (sometimes very long) setup followed by an exciting ending. This one is the same except it lacked the exciting ending. In a nutshell, nothing happened. I am eager to see how the series turns out, but Jordan doesn't appear interested in advancing the plot at all. He appears to be writing for the money by seeing how long he can drag the series out. Winter's Heart gave me hope that this series was picking up again. Crossroads of Twilight crushed those hopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book 10 - first 300 pages are worthless","review":"The first 300 or so pages of the book are worthless: Endless and useless details that barely touch upon the main story lines (yes story lines) after waiting years to pick up where book 9 left off.

One thing about Jordan's writing is that it's all about setting things up.. so that you can imagine what was the situation like and the scenario of the places involves.. One thing that I agree with this book story line is that it tries to cool down from the last book climax on cleansing the saidin.. it's a huge thing.. so we have to know the impact of that to the rest of the world.. If Jordan make it all in a paragraph to let in some new climax stuff.. we wouldn't have know what's in Egwene's mind, what did the Ashaman thinks.. are they afraid with sensing that someone far away are using the one power so much they could sense it thousand of miles away.. It's a good setup for the next scene.. the ending is good.. I never like Egwene anyway.. hahhahahabut thinking about the next book probably came out in another 2 years.. the wait are frustrating.."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Shame","review":"In my opinion, anyone who gives this book a positive review is in the pay of the author or Tor, a close friend of Jordan, or doesn't know good fantasy/sci-fi when he or she reads it. This book is absolutely the worse sequel that I have ever read. Jordan is just making the story more complex and prolonged without adding anything of value. I would start to question whether the same man who started this series is still involved. If he is, then, he just doesn't care about us any more. All involved in this series should be ashamed of themselves. At least Wurtz said she was sorry when one of her hardbound books was made into two paperbacks. Jordan hasn't said anything about why he is doing this to those who have been loyal to him for years. Well, I am getting off this merry-go-round right now. I am not buying another book in this series, and I invite anyone who cares about the integrity of the genre to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack Of Power","review":"After completing my newly programmed software designed to cross-index all of the WOT characters, plot entries, linked to page number and volume description, I realized I had a serious problem. My computer lacked the power needed to complete this task. Which in some ways RJ can probably relate to. How you can take a world of such promise and depth and drive it into the gibberish wasteland that is the WOT now I cannot guess. But I would venture a premise that his ego has outrun his talent just like my patience has outran my desire to see the end of the WOT as he views it.

I just don't know where to begin. Any plot development in this entire 600+ page book, what little there is of it, could EASILY have fit into one of Jordan's infamously long-winded prologues. Everything else is nothing but tedious, painstakingly long descriptions of what each character is wearing, their facial expressions, Aes Sedai temper tantrums, etc., ad nauseum, ZZZZZ... snore. Wha... oops, sorry, I dozed off there for a moment. What happened, Mr. Jordan, did you have a bunch of airheaded teenage girls ghost-writing this drivel for you?What a shame that such a once-promising series has now become the butt of so many jokes.

Just when I thought that Jordan's Wheel of Time series was picking up again (Winter's Heart was really solid), along comes \\"Crossroads\\". Remember all that neat stuff that happened in Winter's Heart? Well, this book is all of the boring, mundane, and generally pointless stuff the rest of Jordan's endless cast of characters was doing while the epic events of Winter's Heart were taking place. Literally hundreds of pages pass in this book with nothing even remotely meaningful or interesting happening.Die-hard Wheel fans will call this book more \\"setup\\" for events in later books. But frankly after ten books I'm tired of setup. This book really takes the \\"epic\\" out of epic fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Setup? SETUP??!!","review":"I am in agreement that anyone who puts more than one star on this review must desperately want a pat on the head by Senior Jordan.Books 8 and 9 ARE the setup!! They would have been total losses without the few money scenes. Book 10 was supposed to be their payoff! It ended up being a barren landscape devoid of activity - with movements so slow they actually travel back in time from the ending of the previous book. This way Jordan can extend the boredom further than any author has ever tried.Don't feel bad about having wasted your time reading this one. Just think how RJ felt when he lost a bet with his TOR buddies and had the choice of either writing a book where nothing happens or showing up naked to book signings.I think he made the sensible choice..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I've been patient. At the end of WH, I thought that my patience was finally going to be rewarded. It ended with something that *should* have been a major turning point. I mean, the Taint is clensed from the male half of the One Power. That's a Big Deal (tm), right? When I read that, I was certain that the next book was going to explode.It fizzled. A bunch of people see Rand's Big Project from a distance and, effectively, go \\"huh?\\". Meanwhile, everyone is still bogged down in the same plot-lines that they were last time -- and I do mean the *same* ones, and not a single one so much as inches towards resolution.After such an enormously portentious ending in WH, it's simply incomprehensible to me that Jordan would have chosen to spend yet more time twiddling with all the pieces he has on the board.What happened? A big, fat nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I was the most avid fan Robert Jordan could hope for, but this book, like several before, leaves me saying \\"what's the point?\\". No element of the plot is advanced, no battles to speak of (his strong point), and no reason to finish the book. I'm waiting until this series is over (assuming it will be), then reading the reviews, then making a decision. If the writing doesn't return to the original story, SHOCK, story, I'm done.As of now, there's better out there.

The rest won't tell you a thing, unless you enjoy 5 chapters of Eguens headache, a few chapters on tea sipping, 2 or 3 chapters on Elaine and Avendha's bath.Perin learns where the Shaido who kidnapped Fail are at, but he's nowhere nearer being able to rescue her then he was in the last book.I think anyone who gives this book top rating are the absolute die hard fans of Jordan that would give the toilet paper he wipes his but with a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"600+ page teaser never delivers! Ugh!","review":"The wasted pages of this book represent something only Tom Clancey could appreciate. Long-term readers of the series, like me, will be disappointed to learn that less than ten pages of this book advance any of the many significant story lines. Mr. Jordan, you owe it to your readers of many years to bring this story to a close, and not in a single book or the twentieth novel out of a series that was rumored to stop at twelve. Be warned!

I kept hoping for something to happen, even to the last page, but it was a complete disappointment. Very few, if any, significant events took place. The best that can be said about this book is that a little more light has been shed on some mysteries, and that both Mat and Perrin had some noteworthy character development.

Absolutely nothing resolved from the previous novels, merely more colorful, albeit, competent, embellishment upon already laid grounds. Whereas the first few novels were masterpieces of drama, action, humor, and epic scope, the last few novels (excepting the last chapter of Winter Heart) have been like watching daytime soaps.

At the end of the book, the characters are all exactly where they were when the book started. Nothing really happened. No loose ends were tied up. Plenty of forgettable characters were introduced though (among a cast of thousands of others that are already too hard to keep up with).I expected this book to not carry the storyline a tremendous distance. I was disappointed it didn't carry it AT ALL. I'll never buy another Jordan book even if the next one was the grande finale. It's really a shame, the series started off extremely strong and it's clearly a world that would support multiple series either before, after or during the existing storyline.

However, characterization is only good up to a point; after that, action becomes imperative. Jordan seems to have missed this point. The first time he wrote a book where nothing happened, I said I wouldn't buy any more if it happened again. After reading Crossroads and seeing absolutely nothing resolved, I have finally given up on the series. I may read the rest after he finishes the series, assuming he ever actually does, but until then I'm not wasting my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SERIES THAT WOULDN'T END","review":"As I waded through the muck that is this book (give me back my $...!), it occurred to me - either Jordan is milking us for every penny we have, knowing that we, as readers, just keep hoping he'll get his act together, or he has simply no idea how to finish this series.I'm leaning on the no clue side, as opposed to the greedy. Regardless, this book was a complete waste of my time and money.

This is an interminable journey that is going nowhere. Jordan obviously is depending upon this income source and is terrified of the end of the story.Absolutely nothing happens in this book. No resolutions of any situations, no battles, no character development - nothing.Furthermore, I'm becoming disturbed by Jordan's fascination with cleavage, spanking, and belt knives. I think he needs therapy.Even if you've already invested your time in the first nine books - don't bother with this one.

I have heard people bashing a few of the other books in the series but I have generally liked them. This book however has little if anything to do with the story. It does not develop the story along nor does it give us anything new. Some people say \\"oh it's just more character/world development\\" well, if after 9 books you need to develop your characters more then you are doing something wrong. Look at the world Tolkein created (regarding the original trilogy and the Hobbit, not the books published after his death). He created an incredible world and didn't just keep hashing out used up ideas.I will give Jordan the benefit of the doubt and read the next book when it comes out.

Not to mention the childish little girls that apparently rule the world... trying to tame the evil men (that are good for nothing but breeding).I think Jordan has gone over the edge and lost his mind. I just wish I could tell him to his face. Then again, I did read 10 (9 1/2 actually) of his books, so it looks like he got the last laugh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP CRAP CRAP","review":"I swore I wouldn't read this...at least I didn't buy it. I have, in hardcover, books 1 through 9. I may...MAY...purchase book 10 (in hardcover) if it is on sale...for about $5. Not much more than that, and only so I can keep my collection intact.This book is garbage. Nothing...I mean NOTHING at all happens in it. Can you imagine writing a 700 page book and have NOTHING happen.Oh wait...sorry. There are some earth-shattering things that do happen: some women tug at their braids and chuck stuff at guys. Some guys looked all confused when women chuck stuff a them and tug their braids (the women tugging their braids, not the men, 'natch). Oh, and there is a wonderful continuation of the whole, massive, everyone-misinterprets-what-everyone-else-is-doing plout...um...thingie. Sort of like an epic Three's Company episode if, you know, the chicks had braids they kept tugging and they threw stuff at Jack.TOR needs better editors.

It is greatly disturbing to see such a wonderful epic dissolve into nothingness. What a dissapointment. And now to add insult to injury, it appears Jordan is working on \\"Prequel\\" novels so the chances of him finishing this series in the next 10 years is pretty slim. Hopefully with all the incredibly bad reviews TOR will kick his butt, actually read his next book before they release it, and compel him to advance the story line. Little hope of that though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan only wants the money","review":"The only possible reason for this book is so that Jordan can pad his bank account. Here is a suggestion for those of you who had read the last 9 books. Go to a book store, read the last two chapters, and you know everything that you need to know to stay in the series. The worst thing we can do is continue to purchase these books until Jordan puts something into them. I made the mistake of buying, please don't do the same. Of course, if you are an insomniac, then read on."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzwhat, what","review":"Where are the editors? Someone has to stand up to RJ and tell him he can't write 600 pages of exposition and 100 pages of story. I'm being generous in giving him 100 pages of story. I want to scream that I don't care what the snow looks like, that you shouldn't take ten pages to describe nothing happening and what people think about nothing happening. It's like he writes and thinks that it is all gold, that nothing should be cut. I found simple errors in the text that make me wonder if an editor even read it. I started to get mad and actually counted how many pages it would take for the simplest thing to happen, 700."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fool of a twit","review":"I was amazed to see another review mention the possibility of a book signing tour by Jordan (not that one was happening, but that he would be on the lookout to give Jordan \\"an earful\\" about the slow pace of the books).

Time for a new joke"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Jordan does not disappoint","review":"In the 10th book of this epic saga, Jordan continues to weave a richly detailed and exciting story that captures the reader from start to finish. In fact, his ability to delve deeply into the events is what makes this series so singularly absorbing. As much as for the storyline, these books are about a world, with all its unique nuances laid out before us.The plot did not advance as much as many had hoped, but I felt that any less detail would have detracted from the enjoyment I got out of the book. There are myriad examples of this. The descriptions of the people and the houses in Andor give a personal basis to the political intrigue surrounding Elayne's quest for the throne. The interaction between Mat and everyone is fascinating. Etc. Personally, I could read another 10 books at this pace, and still be sad when they finish. The bottom line is--don't cheat yourself out of this book, or out of this series. It's fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the other Hand","review":"although the pace may be unbearable, and the progress minimal at best, im sure in reality most readers would be disappointed if the series came to a quick end. 10 books worth of setup, to be finished in a single installment? how would anyone (particularly the Master of Description himself) manage to tie up every loose plot end in one novel? it would be carelessly written, and not entirely thought out. However, having spoken with Jordan, I am aware that it is not his lack of vision of an end that keeps him from ending it.( he knew how it was going to end while writing Eye of the World) It is his numerous new plots and loose ends that he keeps creating that are stopping him. With so many, it becomes more complex to end a novel, as well as to produce a new installment(hence the long waits in between releases.) at any rate, enough of this rambling...A slow novel yes...a reason to lose faith in an excellent writer? never"},{"rating":"2","title":"How many sub-plots must there be?","review":"I really enjoyed the book, as I have the entire series, but enough is enough. Jordan still proves he can make you part of the story, but in the past few books there has not been a conclusion to a single sub-plot. Jordan just keeps adding more and more.He needs to go ahead and kill Egwene, Naneave, Elayne, & Perrin. Rand is the only character that matters and Matt is the only one that really has a clue. If he would do these simple things, he could finish the series within 2 more books.The book finishes with a very disappointing (ending), if you could call it and ending. That was what keep it from being a 5 star book. My biggest fear at this point is that none of us will live long enough to see and end to this series.At this point, whenever I see anyone reading the first or second books, I tell them to 'stop while they can'.

The are like NOW, those petty feminists. I want battles and peoples heads, and bodies blowing apart. These books are getting too cartoonie. The strategies posed by Rand and his crew are sensless. He should have smashed the white tower, making those snobby feminists kneel to his authority. There can only be one head on creature (army) he is forging. Rand is turning into a panzy. Next time he pulls his Heron marked sword out, he'll don his ballet tights on too.I'm starting to think Mr Jordan is a Liberal.(ooooo, thats real low, there less than dung)I still have faith in Mr Jordan, and will get his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the wheel of time has come unstuck","review":"Robert Jordan has excelled himself in producing 700 odd pages of largley incomprehensivle drivel.Vacuous, simpering, and wholly unbelievable women march through this tome with the credibility and speed of a ruptured duck.

I got this book when it first came out, tried to read it and lost interest. I have half of it to read still and may not even bother. He spends too much time on details which do not carry the story.

If so, then it's probably too late to tell you to wait until this series is finished then buy the first several books and the very last one.I'm getting really annoyed with myself for purchasing the last four books in this waste-of-bookshelf-space series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh!","review":"This book is absolutely the worst I have ever read.

Until this book all my expectations were either met or exceeded. I have never read a book filled with more fluff and less substance than this chapter of RJ's epic saga. There was not a single event until the very last chapter (all 6 paragraphs of it) that was even remotely interesting. Robert Jordan has shown a serious lack of respect for his fans if he believes this book is worthy to be included with all those that have come before. The only people who will enjoy this book are the die hard fans who believe Robert Jordan can do no wrong.[...]P>Sincerely,A very disappointed fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere, the plot went nowhere.","review":"Just another rehash of everything that has already happened. It would be easier of course if the books contained a list of characters so that rampant nearly identical spelling could be cleared up, but that would probably double the size of the book. Over and over Jordan reminds us about the past. I already know that Vanin was a horse thief. I don't need to be told again. If I can't remember that, I'm not going to read the book.Jordan needs to give up some of the secrets that we already know. We know the rings in the Aiel waste predict a weird form of the future as well as the three arches. Just let go of some of the secrets. This subplot with Faile and the Aiel is another waste of words. Jordan won't let his righteous character's fall, hell he won't even let them have sex.Finally, the quality of the book is lacking.

I counted 37 lines of text in COT, and I think WH is worse. Additionally, I would have to agree with those of us who say that Jordan is putting more and more meaningless detail in his book for fluff.

It cannot be salvaged anymore in my opinion. Jordan has lost his ability to write as good as he did in the first 6 installments. His disintegration started with a Crown of Swords and has reached an all time low in Crossroads of Twilight. Fans who write 5 star reviews on this installment must do so because they simply cannot phatom that Jordan lost it. Admitting that will wreck their world.

It was slower. A complete waste of time. The scattered plot events (you could count them on one hand) could have easily been condensed to an opening chapter. At least Winter's Heart had a central event (cleasing the male half of the source) for climax - don't hold your breath for one in Crossroads. Really. There's nothing. Its 680 pages of text have little more than the main characters wandering around being suspicious of everyone, incessant inner monologues about gender roles, and (absurdly) the introduction of new and reputedly powerful characters.

Once the series is done you can tell us what Egwene, Elayne, the Black Tower, the White Tower, the Senchean and all the other ... were doing.

This book does not move anything forward; at the rate he is bringing the series to a \\"close\\", I suspect it will be three to four more books (i.e., another DECADE) before this series concludes.

His descriptions and language are getting repetitive, as can be expected in a series of this length - not that that excuses it. I feel that his style is very dry and unexciting in the first place; with big ol chunks of straight, in-your-face, clunky, repetitive description, it seems exponentially more sleep-inducing.Not recommended for public consumption, this book.

There are only a few things of remote importance that happen in this book. I recommend that you spare yourself the agony and read an online plot summary instead.

More minor plots are begun, with none of the previous ones closed. None of the major plots moves forward. None of the major characters does, says or experiences anything particularly interesting. There is no action, and no suspense. After following this series for ten books and some 6,000 - 7,000 pages, I'm dropping out.

First, this is indeed a masterfully detailed chapter in a massive saga. Second, this book will not silence the critics of the pacing of the last three to four installments because it just crawls. Third, if you have ever read another massive fantasy saga (such as the Amber novels) you realize that there is a difference between pacing and sheer ponderousness (which this book suffers from). Fourth, those of us who embarked upon this saga are doomed to purchase every remaining book (whose timelines have now been reduced to the same passage of time as it takes the average reader to read this book), but if you have not spent a mini fortune on the Wheel of Time saga yet, for pity's sake go buy George Martin's Song of Fire and Ice saga instead.

I read books 1 thru 5 in 3 days or less. Books 5 thru 9 took 1 to 2 weeks ( Read them only when I had free time) Book ten appears to be written only for the author to make more money. I started reading the book as soon as it arrived (I Pre ordered it before publication) Last night I finally completed reading chapter 19. This morning I donated books 1 to 10 to the local library and I definitely will not purchase any further books in this series. Mister Jordon spends pages and pages going into great detail which has almost nothing to to with advancing the story. IT IS MY OPINION THAT, AFTER BOOK FIVE, HE WAS MOSTINTERESTED IN FILLING PAGES WITH NO THOUGHT TO THE STORY LINE. aT THIS POINT HE IS WRITING FOR MONEY NOT TO ENTERTAIN HIS READERS. I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY SCI-FI/FANTASY READER.

You know...the Dragon Reborn? Robert Jordan has lost sight of the MAIN character in this last book. Im sick of Mat Cauthon and Perrin Goldeneyes Aybara with their shallow plots, mainly courting and love interests. Remember, Mr. Jordan, that Rand Al'thor and his battle against the encroaching darkness is the main plot line...not the sub-plot. I suspect that Robert Jordan is no longer out to right a piece of literature but is only out to make a quick buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anything happen?","review":"Don't waste your time, read the wikipedia article and move on.

If even one person writes a negative review of Book 11, I'm done. This book was mindless drivel, for the first time in 10 books I skipped large chunks of endless debate with no adverse effect in understanding. I consider myself reasonably able to keep up with the myriad of characters, but by now I don't even CARE who's a possible Darkfriend and who's not. Will Robert Jordan ever actually write something worth reading again? By then will any of the original diehard fans have totally lost interest in this series? Nothing of substance happens in this book until the last few chapters, so wait for the paperback or just check it out at your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of Twilight and Twilight of a loooong series","review":"I eagerly anticipated the release of Robert Jordan's latest in the Wheel of Time series. I could not wait for paper back, so purchased the hard cover. Half way through this 700 page epic, I realized that there had been no Trollocs, no Myrddraal, no Draghkar, and believe it or not BARELY any Rand al'Thor!Jordan did an exquisite job of documenting prattling Aes Sedai fiddling with their dresses and welding Saidar to heat their tea, but that is hardly the hallmark of this series. By the all too long end of the book, there were no plot lines resolved from books seven or eight or nine, and only weakly discernible plot lines established for book 11. While confused, I remain resolute!I will pick up books 11 through 15 at a yard sale in 2008. I would think by then the good guys have Tar Valon, the Dark One has a black eye, and Trollocs are sent to live with the Seanchan.I know the next Age takes quite a while to get here, but this is ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst books I ever read!!!!","review":"I am done reading WOT!Very disappointed with this book and the author.

Jordan has abandoned the story and did not resolve a single issue. Unless, it's that Aes Sedai need to be frequently birched.This book is a MAJOR disappointment and is so filled with grammatical and typographical errors that it's distracting.Mr. Jordan, please go back to true storytelling and editors, do your job. Otherwise, this is a cash cow that may be sent out to pasture."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING HAPPENED!","review":"this book is extremely frustrating. robert feels it necessary to spend pages describing Aes sedai who say one line and then u forget about them, he uses the word snowy incessantly and worst of all, nothing happens in this book. its been over 600 pages, and nothing happened at all. none of the characters even find out who is truly causing their problems, so they cannot begin to fix them. dont read this book, just go online and look at a summary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Been Played For A Chump","review":"I've been a faithful Robert Jordan fan for all 10 of his books, but they have gotten worse and worse with each of the past few books he has released and by far Crossroads is the worst.

All of the cliches are there - the meaningful stares, the obsession with trivialities, the constant repetition, even the resurrection of departed characters.In the 700 pages of this, the tenth novel in the series, the author has watered down enough plot development to sustain perhaps one or two chapters by a more economical writer.Jordan claims that he has known how the series will end from the very first instalment.I wish he'd let us in on the secret before he takes it to his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time...","review":"Just like everyone else, I was so caught up in the first 4 books in this series, and figured in book 5 we would have a gripping conclusion to the series.

After being disappointed with the last installment, I decided to wait, read the copy from the local library, and then decide if I want to purchase the book. I am glad I went this route. This book is once again a disappointment for me. In keeping with the trend introduced in the last book, there are now too many characters, the plot is too wide and the story line has slowed to a crawl. The series should of stopped about 2 books ago, but I think the publishers and author are making too much money off of what they have, so they are trying to strech it out. This is most unfortunate since this has ruined the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the most part, a major letdown","review":"While it is interesting to see the details of the characters fleshed out, it is time for things to start happening. I can only pray the next book is a lot of action because this was rather made me irritated with the author. Especially given the slow movement of the last books.It seems like alot of interesting storylines just dissapear and so much goes unexplained that he starts in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired worn out and UGH!!!!!!","review":"First things first. There is absolutely no plot movement in this book untill the last chapter and that is even very slight. I cannot believe the People at TOR could allow this thing into print. I understand an author needs creative space but damn it's time to reel him in. I've never read a book that was so inane in my entire life. I felt so jilted when I finished reading it. I've grown to love these characters but now they are just being run into the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up. I will never read a WOT book again","review":"No amount of words can be used to express how dissappointed I am by this book. Just when I though that the series is taking a turn for the better after Winter's heart, out comes the worst book in the series. That's right, this book actually could have a slower pace than BK 7 or Bk 8! Pages and pages are spent on filler descriptions, ...cliches .... it's incredible how Jordan could have written these 700+ pages of junk!...even after reading COT I still feel that the earlier books of the series are a phenomenal work of art.Don't buy this book...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert Jordan has lost the magic","review":"He was one such a wonderful writer. I had hoped with his last book the plot would move forward and we would have some excitement. Instead it drolls on in on going absolutely nowhere. I can't help but find myself bored to tears. This is the last hardcover book of his I will buy. I expected more from him. I wanted more Rand! I wanted more Trollocs! I wanted more Aiel. I wanted more battles! I want anything except the useless drivel that was spouted in this terrible book. It seems the longer the series goes on the worse it gets. It had such potential too. Don't waste your time with this book. It is verbal diarhea. Robert Jordan is so immersed in details and side stories he has forgotten how to write an exciting and entertaining story. It is slow, boring, and filled with characters you could care less about. Avoid this book like the plague and don't say I didn't warn you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need some sleep?","review":"This has to be the worst book in the series hands down. Only reason to read this book is to put yourself to sleep. If you have read this series up to this book. I'm guessing you will get it.

This was more of a chore reading then enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"~I have to say that this was a disapointment to me. I started reading the series five years ago and have had to wait a long time for the conclusion, However Mr. Jordan has created such an intricate plot in the last nine books that it is no wonder it takes a long time to tie up the loose ends. However I have to wonder when this story is going to finnish. I will not stop reading the series because I think that Robert Jordan is a great author and his next project will probably be just as great as~~ the wot, Lets have the conclusion. and the other reviews of this book show just how fickle the masses can be~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Previously on 'The Wheel of Time'","review":"It's very disheartening that Robert Jordan has become so successful that he has ceased to beedited. In this latest installment, we spend several hundred pages reviewing where the each of the multitude of characters was at the end of Book 9,and are rewarded with 20 pages of new action. It feels like watching a tv show where you get 48 minutes of Previously on 'The Wheel of Time', and 2 minutes of new show. On the liner notes, Robert Jordan says he's going to write until they nail shut his coffin. Obviously we'll have to wait that long for him to wrap this up. It's sad for a series that had such brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and Boring","review":"Nothing happened in this book. I was so disappointed in this book. After the conclusion of the 9th book, I had assumed that you would see Rand and the others actually doing something in this book. Wrong answer. You barely even glimpse anything of Rand, Min, Nynaeve and Lan. Too much time is being spent on setting up storylines and way too much time is being spent on describing what clothes people are wearing or how they are going to do something in advance or what the hall ways look like. Just tell us the story and give us the characters and action that every one has been wanting. The series has dragged on long enough - give us the conclusion !"},{"rating":"1","title":"End It Soon!","review":"This book was a great disappointment. I discovered this series four years ago and was immediately caught up in the well-developed characters and intricate plot -- now I grow weary of these same things. This series needs to come to an end, and soon. This particular book does little to move the story along, the only reason to keep reading is to someday find out what happens! Don't waste your money on this hardback; instead, buy a cheaper book club edition, a used copy, or wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"There was a time when I would buy Robert Jordan's books and spend the next 2-3 days reading them without putting them down. This is not the case with his latest installment. I thought he was finally starting to get things together in Book 9 when something started happening and plot lines started converging on themselves. In Book 10 he is back to writing long winded descriptions about everything with very little happening.Sadly it has taken me over 2 weeks to get through two thirds of this book. Even worse, in the 500 pages I have read, the storyline has only advanced 3 or 4 days. At this rate we will all be dead before the novel has ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please end it.","review":"I have loved almost all Jordan's books, but as time goes on and the story stretches on and on, it has become painful to read. Yes he is a great story teller, but this story should have been over two books ago. Usually there is something that resembles action, but in this book it was as dry as the Sahara during a dry spell. If you have read all of the books so far as I have, you will want to read this just to keep it going. The next book I will wait until it gets to paperback, because this one sure wasn't worth the money for a hardback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth Skimming Only","review":"I join those who have been extremely disappointed by this book. It is another long set-up with not much happening. I give it more than one star mainly because of the scenes with Mat and Tuon, which remind you of the good parts of this over-extended series. The author clearly is not going to listen to those asking for some common sense editing and tightening. Of course, he can do whatever he wants and he's making a bundle of money. But it's frustrating. My suggestion is to wait for the paperback or borrow the hardcover, and then skim it for the scenes involving Mat,Tuon, Rand and Elayne. There is a lot in the book about Egwene, but it doesn't go anywhere and is not interesting. Nynaeve is hardly mentioned, and nothing significant happens with Perrin either. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing","review":"I really have been in love with this series ever since I picked up Eye of the World at a friend's recommendation and hungrily consumed the next 8 books. I was never disappointed until now. This book is one big prologue to I don't know what. Absolutely nothing happens in it. There are no surprises. It's basically all rehash of things we've already read and already know about. In fact most of the individual prologues (Mat, Faline, Perrin, Egwene, etc.) All take place before the end of the last book.Of course I will buy the next book when it comes out, but if it is disappointing as this one, I'll have to drop the series. In the meantime I'm looking forward to George R.R. Martin's next isntallment in the Songs of Ice and Fire series which so far has not been a disappointment and has far surpassed Jordan in keeping me spellbound and turning the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"there is no -5 star rating unfortuanately","review":"Poorly written, poorly edited, full of inconsistencies with previous books. Story moves nowhere (in fact, once again it moves back in time from the previous book), and there endless cliched descriptions repeated from earlier books (braid tugging, cool eyed looks, ageless faces, smoothing dresses etc).How many times do we have to have the *same* explanations for the way characters behave and dress? By book 10, we know it. But then, perhaps he is assuming that people who keep buying this series are obviously stupid and can't retain this information.Jordan is milking this series for all it is worth. Quite frankly, this isn't worth the money you are paying for it. If you must read it - despite all the warning reviews - then borrow it from a library. As for me, I'm not giving him another cent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Series Gone Bad","review":"I can only assume that Greed is what has inspired lackluster writing and an un-moving plotline. Yeah ... I can see the setup just like everyone else, but this is just stupid.Also, this is the second book in a row which has a dustcover that contians lies ... nowhere does Perrin risk his soul for Faile. hmmm ... I seem to remember that being in the dustcover of book 9 too. Maybe the last battle is really between pissed off fans and a writer who seems to have lost his touch.Despite its shortcomings I must say that Crossroads did top Winters Heart for WORST BOOK YET and I think we can continue to count on Jordan milking his once loyal fans until no-one cares how the series ends ...A true disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unquestionably his worst attempt","review":"This book plods along and goes nowhere. I finished it only because I could not believe how Jordan could screw up a great story so badly. After reading the great books (1-5), this is like watching a senior tour golfer shoot 90 from the ladies tees. There are now thousands of storylines speeding to no foreseeable conclusion. This was an epic tale that should have ended four books ago. The remaining installments should come with $100 bills attached to pay you to read them. Can TOR resurrect the author of the earlier books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan should have finished the series 3 books ago.","review":"I really enjoyed the first few books in the series; a unique, novel approach to fantasty. However, the last few books seem to be nothing more than an effort to draw the series out so Jordan can make more money -- Crossroads is the worst. The first 500 or so pages are simply fluff with no meaning or advancement of the storyline. When Jordan finally starts to move the storyline along, he moves it so fast you have to wonder what happened. Jordan had the opportunity to produce a classic series on par with Tokien and Lewis. Unfortuantely, he let the series get out of control. Pass on this book and wait to see if the next one finishes the series. If it does, borrow this one from the library and read the last 100 of so pages to prep you for the final book. If he doesn't finish the series in the next book, reread Tolkien and skip the series entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"75 pages of material...","review":"This is the most disappointing book of the Wheel series. Heck, this is a disappointing BOOK on al levels.There are 75-100 pages of REAL material that advance the plot at glacial speed, crammed into this 680 page bloated waste of tree pulp. The prologue itself is longer then the actual useful pages contained in this train wreck.The characters don't evolve, the plot stagnates, excessive use of description is rampant, and the characters seem to get stupider (and for some, this is QUITE a task).This is one book I would either snag from the bargain bin is you MUST own it, or borrow it from some poor sucker who bought it, if only to go through the same painful reading that the rest of us suckers went through. I will be waiting for the next book...at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mistress of Novices could assign this book for punishment.","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Robert Jordan's previous Wheel of Time books. Most have great action with spicy intrigue that give the reader an idea of how confusing it must have been to be in high politics in the days of royal courts, changing political climates and fast paced growth of \\"Travel\\". This book though, is all spice and no meat.There are too many new characters together in book 9. Old characters have mysterious motives for shadowy deeds; so shadowy you don't really know what they are doing or why you should care! I feel as though I sat down to a great banquet in Jordan's dream world Tel'aran'rhoid. Looked good but not filling.If you like mysterious characters and don't need action. You might like this. Just start it immediately after book 9. Maybe it will make sense to you.***Thank goodness book 11 is much much better and book 12 is awesome! **"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the Worst in the Series","review":"The only reason anyone would want to read this book is because it is part of the Wheel of Time series.

I doubt if I even finished book #9. It was not memorable. I am still debating whether to subject myself to #10. Besides, isn't the next book supposedly due out after this one a pre-novel? Doesn't an author usually do that after FINISHING the current series? So how long will we have to wait for longwinded #11? I thought this series was originally planned to be 10 volumes long? Will this series ever end, or at least pick up the momentum it lost 4 books ago?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I started to lose interest in this series after the sixth book, and wish I had stopped there. The last four have been painful to read. If the descriptions of the clothing were eliminated, the last four books would have amounted to about 200 pages combined. Agonizingly slow and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking the wrong Crossroads","review":"This 10th volume of the Wheel of Time seems to have come up with a flat. Although written in Jordan's usual style with copious detail and characterization, absolutely nothing happens until the last chapter, with Egwene running into trouble. It seems that Jordan could not decide where the series is going and was marking time until he decides. A reader could skip this volume with no loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is so Boring","review":"I knew that Robert Jordan was long winded, but come on. How many pages of this book are devoted to what an Aes Sedai is wearing or what look she has on her face? And if I read one more line about the Warders' shifting cloaks I am going to scream. WE KNOW ABOUT THE CLOAKS ALREADY!!! Honestly, the wardrobes don't matter. After about 350 pages of this I started skipping entire sections of description.In the past, I have really looked forward to the release of the next book in the series. Now, I don't really care when the next one is coming out. Besides, at this rate the series is going to take 20 books to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I have mixed emotions over this book. While I enjoyed reading it, nothing happens to advance the plot. NOTHING! I hear people complaining over the Elayne and Egwene chapters. I however, feel that these sections are the stronger part of the book. Perrin has only been interesting to read about in Books 4 and 6. Tuon, on the other hand, ruined the Mat chapters. TOY?!?! That's what she calls him. Very annoying, and she says it over, and over again. Although I would have given this book a 3, I think we, the fans, have to send Mr. Jordan a message, and show him our dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like \\"Crossroads of Boredom\\"","review":"This book was a huge, disappointing, waste of time. Other than the Mat section, the entire book is just filler. Even the book description is terribly misleading. It should read like this:Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, but first he must deal with the menacing problem of weevils in the barley. Can the townspeople remove the weevils in time, so that the soldiers can eat bread? (who cares?)At Tar Valon, Egwene prepares to lay siege to Tar Valon. Will something else come along that will distract her enough to put off this plot thread for the entire novel? (answer: yes)In Andor, Elayne fights for the Lion Throne (By novel's end, she is still fighting for the Lion Throne).For Rand al'Thor, nothing happens the entire book (NOTHING).In summary, do not waste your money. You can pick up the next one and not miss a thing. Hopefully, some plot development will actually occur in that one. Unfortunately, we have to wait another two years to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have known from the title...","review":"The title should have prepared me - twilight being allllllmost the end... but no, not quite - I don't think I could have been prepared for this book in any way. As everyone's said already, nothing happens, and I've come to believe nothing ever will.I've given Jordan the benefit of the doubt from Lord of Chaos onward, and he does it to me again. I thought he was back on track - even if just a little with Winter's Heart - but no, he's definitely not. I'm seriously considering quitting the series, and I'd warn anyone who's dissatisfied to maybe stay away from this book if you think you'd be swayed to quit.... trust me... you won't miss much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Slow, Slow","review":"I love this series, but this one is really boring. I suppose it is necessary to read if one is going to finish the series, but Robert Jordan could have given his loyal fans a much better book this time out. I will keep reading the series because I am hooked, but from now on wait for the paperback rather than scooping up the hardcover in the first week after a year of anticipation.You can skim this one and get just as much as you need out of it. Conclusion: Wait for the paperback or borrow a friend's copy if you really want to read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"How can it be that the same author that wrote the first four excellent books of this series produced this drivel? Not a single thing happened. I kept on reading thinking that something significant was going to happen in the following chapter but it never did.I will read his next book because I have invested so much time in the first ten books, however I am certainly not holding my breath for its release.I can only hope that Mr Jordan takes note of what his fans are saying and makes the next book a lot more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wheel of Time Moves Slowly","review":"I have been following \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series over the years. I have really enjoyed the series until the last few books, and this book the \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" has been my biggest disappointment yet.After reading the 672 pages, I conclude that I am growing very weary of pages upon pages of two line descriptions of differing Aes Sedai glaring at each other. I have also lost interest in the many paragraphs of detail going into the lack of weevil infested food Egwene is consuming, and with the lengthy descriptions of the embroidery on the characters clothing.The positive points of the story for me were the chapters involving Mat and Tuon's growing relationship and the chapter where Alviarin is marked.I will continue reading the series because I feel so invested in the characters and do very much want to read the outcome of this story. My wish is for \\"The Wheel of Time\\" to turn a little faster, and to keep with the pacing set in the first few books of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurry up and stand still","review":"Like most reviewers here, I agree: this book goes nowhere. I didn't believe it until I read it myself. Literally, the plot ends in almost exactly the same place it began. Readers of the series could skip this thick volume and not miss a thing of import. Like others, I miss the early days of the series and am starting to resent Jordan's apparent milking of the series for profit (ie: the re-release of book one as two \\"new\\" seperate books...) With books like this one, you're losing fans by the thousands, Jordan..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst.....book....ever!","review":"It makes me very sad to think about the WoT series now. It started out so incredible I remember telling people that I thought Jordan had the talent to surpass Tolkien. Oh how wrong I was. This series has consistently fallen into mediocrity, and with this latest attempt has actually become quite bad. I was pretty excited at the end of the previous book since I thought the series was finally going to be getting back on track. Again, oh how wrong I was. An advanced calculus text is way more stimulating than this book was. I normally take about a week to read a book of this size -- this particular book took me 3 months to trudge through. About the only good thing to say about it is that it's better than a glass of warm milk for putting you to sleep at night.CoT is a 100 page prologue to book 11 that was padded and stretched into a 680 page book. It's offensive to see how little respect Jordan has for his readers and his own series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Bad Novel","review":"I felt very dissatisfied after reading this book. I'm such a fan that I reread all the other books again before reading this one, but that didn't help my sense of outrage after finishing it. I was so frustrated to realize I was reading endless and pointless details that could drive one mad. I don't care how to wash silk, draw a bath, or how salt is made or sold. And will RJ ever learn that anything involving the Andoran succession or the Whitecloaks bores us to tears? Do we really need an extended scene of Perrin scoping out his camp, complete with ludicrous scent assessments every novel?Space taken up by this filler could have been used to actually tie up some plot lines, but no such luck. Believe the bad hype -- nothing of significance is resolved and barely anything happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's finally done it","review":"Jordan finally achieved what he has apparently been trying to do since book 5 of this series - write a book that goes nowhere. The four to five pages of Crossroads of Twilight that actually involve Rand are succinct and to the point, but the rest of the book is ridiculous. Jordan routinely takes several pages at a time to describe a conflict between two characters that are clearly minor side carachters with little to do with advancing the plot. This book ends as if Jordan were simply tired of writing, and wanted to publish something to keep readers interested in his series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lengthy With No Plot Movement","review":"I have enjoyed the level of detail in the previous novels, but this book seemed to bog itself down in the enormous amount of sub characters and moment by moment descriptions. Very little happens in the 650+ page book by the end. In fact, the only significant and interesting plot developments are (of course) in the final pages-merely teasers for the next book.The stereotypes of the characters are starting to grate too: the men can't understand how women think, women think men are wool headed, men struggle over the death of women they cause. Characters haven't seemed to develop much over the last four or five books.The only reason I finished this book in hopes that the future of the series will greatly improve. If you have enjoyed the series so far, then you should be able to plod your way through this (nearly) minute by minute account of what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amazing feat of literary contortionism","review":"How did he cram a 50 page book into 700 pages? I'm speechless."},{"rating":"1","title":"went no where :(","review":"I started reading this series many over ten years ago and fell in love with the fast pace of the story line and the awesome fight scenes. In the lastest book there is nothing that goes on. No fight scenes, no intruge, no time went by. I got the feeling from reading it that only a matter of days has gone by and NOTHING. I am on the verge of ending my affair with this series. I am wondering if he know how to end it??? While he is still a well written author there is nothing in this book to hold my attention. It used to be that I would read his books till all hours of the night and get down in like two or three days. This one took me almost two weeks to get through because I fell asleep all the time. I think everyone should write to the publisher and voice the fact it better get better or we shall stop buying this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hahaha","review":"How could you rate this anything less than 5? This is one of the great comic works of our time. The literary irony of having 500 chimps write 700 pages of utter ... and convincing a horde of people to buy it...brilliant. Oh I cannot stop laughing...oh wait, I bought this. Mr. Jordan, I get it. I realize you've written a hyperbolic satire of the fantasy genre, but could you please give me a refund. I need some cash to help with the anuyerism I suffered while trying to figure out which pages had been photocopied from previous books and which were new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read all the books because I liked the series","review":"This book was another enjoyable read in a great series. To the critics of the book: All readers of the series know about braid tugging, ear boxing, folded arms beneath breasts. I'm not sure how critics reminding readers of the obvious counts as a witty review. I'm also not sure why someone would give the tenth book in a series a bad review. If you don't like the series why read ten books? Jordan does what any great story teller does: he creates drama and suspense which we yearn for years to be resolved. These books don't just jump from one conclusion to another ( I mean, there can't be a final battle in EVERY book), they fill the moments between significant events with characterization and vivid descriptions of everyday events in the lives of characters in a fantasy novel which should be interesting to everyone who reads fantasy novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Read Book Nine, You're still Up-to-Date","review":"The pace of the plot has slowed down over the last three books in the series, but up until now at least SOMETHING was resolved in each book. Jordan is not nearly an author of the quality required to hold one's interest through such tedious plot development. After over 6000 pages in the previous books, there's no need for developing the characters.There's a cheesy \\"to-be-continued\\" ending. However, I was so bored two-thirds of the way through that I'd skipped ahead to the end and cheated myself of the one unexpected turn in the entire book.If you've already read the first nine books, nothing anybody says will keep you from reading this one. Heck, I read it all too. Save yourself some money though, wait for the paperback edition or buy it used. Save yourself some time and wait for book 11 (or Book 12 at this rate)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long prologue","review":"The book was very slow moving and not much happened. It seems like things are set up nicely for book 11 to be filled with plot advancement and excitement, but this book had little of that. Crossroads was basically one long prologue. There were a few good parts which I did enjoy, thus, I gave it two stars instead of one. I hope the next book is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"What a load of rubbish!I have been reading this series for 10 years and eagerly awaited this next installment. Instead of action and wonderfully rich story telling I got 600 odd pages of the politics of the Aes Sedai. The main character of the story, Rand, didn't enter the book until about page 520. The plot didn't advance, no one did anything. It was, in comparison to his last nine books, boring and tedious.Come on Mr Jordan, stop trying to pad out an extra book or 2. Keep the story moving and let it end when it has too. Another book like this will result in your millions of fans worldwide getting fed up and abandoning the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"If someone wrote a parody on wheel of time, this is it","review":"800 pages where almost nothing happens at all. Last page contains the only significant event, like a parody on all movie series \\"please stay tuned, will he make it, what will happen next...\\". There were a total of about 50 pages that I found enjoyable, recognising the writers ability to make a good story. Rest of the pages were read waiting for the story to start moving, for some intriguing story. In fact, if I decide to read the next book based on the fact that the previous books were better even if they have deteriated the longer into the series we get, I could have skipped this book totally and never even have known that I missed a book in the series.--- Mats ---"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...again.","review":"All the reviews I've read so far seem to agree on the same thing.The book contains only a tiny amount of plot development.Despite having to refer to the last 3 books to follow the hundreds of minor characters, Richard again insisted on repeating his detailed descriptions of them, and their behaivour, each time you met them.For those who agree with Richard that humans learn how to relate to each other in school yards and stop learning after they turn 10, you'll love this book.I hope it was his publisher who forced him to write this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happened!!!","review":"I started reading these books years ago. They started slow and then got really good in the middle but the last two books have been disappointing.After reading book nine, I thought, hey, very little happened! I felt sure that book ten would fix this and move the story forward.Unfortunately, nothing happened..lets repeat that...Nothing Happens!!!! Most of the book is spent moving characters around but very little is achieved. Also Jordan is tending to focus more and more on repeatedly describing the same types of character interactions. It is getting boring!!!I figure, I'll give him one more book to move the story forward in a real way and then that is it for me.A very disappointed fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of Twilight","review":"I'll keep it simple.

When we got the bizarre photo, it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Flying Dutchman","review":"Like the Flying Dutchman this story seems destined to never reach shore, or in this case a conclusion. This particular installment is particularly unsatisfying as it covers very little ground and does so in excruciating detail. The rumor that this series will conclude in a mere twelve total volumes seems unfounded based on the current pacing and amount of material to be covered.So a word to the wise, if you haven't started the series don't. If you have don't buy this book, go to your library and get on the waiting list. Trust me, you can wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Series... Horrible Book!!","review":"In recent Robert Jordan books we have been seeing more talking and less action. In this book there is no action!! There is so much detail in things no one cares about, you find yourself skipping pages. The series already contains so many great characters, why introduce even more?? It will just confuse (or bore) the reader. And absolutely nothing was resolved at the end of this book. When I read the last book, the end had me wishing for the next book just because I wanted to see what happens to The Ahsh'man. Do we see that in this book ? Nope we see claptrap about Egwene and her Aes Sedai, Perrin and Faile, which thier current storyline should have ended in this book because it is just too boring. Do yourselves a favor and skip this book it is not a necessary read in the Wheel of Time saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lovin' gone bad","review":"As Robert Jordan continues his epic story of Good and Evil, he continues to dilute the plot with oceans of minutae. Many books ago, the reader caught on that the final battle would involve many, many people and creatures on both sides. Tragically, Mr. Jordan sees fit to name each and every one, including their rich diverse backgrounds and relationships with every other living thing. The result is rambling long books involving little action, and holding precious little interest. To be sure, Mr. Jordan writes descriptively well. But the last several books have no longer been as eagerly awaited as the first five or six. Even the most diehard of fans are losing interest, as they can get their epic fantasy fix from the likes of Peter Jackson. Rereading the LotR trilogy reminds one how an epic tale can indeed conclude. Mr. Jordan should take note. Of course, as an author, writing for money is what he does, a fact that has become disturbingly clear every two years lately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Disappointing","review":"This is the worst book in the series IMO. Whatever happened to the Robert Jordan who wrote books 1-6? You know, back when important things happened, and not just rushed into a climax at the end. Of course, this book doesn't even have a climax. Nothing happens! All of the major plot threads are practically at the same place they were at the beginning of the book. Some people claim this was a \\"character development\\" book, but I must have been reading something different from them. I read more of the same inner character turmoil that we've seen for the last nine books. Others claim that this is a \\"setup for the next book book\\". Likely, but I can't even fathom anyone can write 700 pages of setting up. When I physically look at the book, I'm bewildered by how someone can write 700 pages of nothing.Of course, I'll keep buying 'em until the series is done. I'm a junkie in need of a shot. But I'll no longer recommend the series to others, except perhaps when it's all finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"In \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" Robert Jordan has hit a new low. In each of the previous 9 installments of the Wheel of Time, at least *one* major sub-plot or mystery was brought to some sort of closure. Not so here. Virtually nothing at all happens. Do yourself a favor. Save the ... bucks and wait for the Reader's Digest version. Jordan has \\"forsaken\\" his loyal audience in what I can only assume is a crass (albeit successful) attempt to milk every dime out of this now-wearisome psuedo-epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"With the Wheel of Time series Robert Jordan created and introduced interesting characters involved in the familiar (but with a unique flare) theme of good versus evil. Crossroads of Twilight, however, is not worthy of Robert Jordan or the Wheel of Time.Robert Jordan needs to reread the first 3-4 books in the Wheel of Time series, revive his writing style and retake control of the story. He also needs an editor who will cull out unnecessary details. (Compare the first book in the series (The Eye of the World) to this latest effort -- you will be astonished at the change in style, content, and pacing.)I hope that the remaining Wheel of Time books will reflect Mr. Jordan's work earlier in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogging down in the details","review":"Robert Jordan my be losing control of his creation. He has introduced too many minor plot lines and twists that are now bogging down the story to the point where nothing happens. The plot doesn't move forward in this book, in fact, it barely catches up to the end of the last book. Most of the book is concerned with details that really should have been taken care of in the prologe. The problem with that is the prologue was already 1/7 of the book. Robert Jordan really needs to decide where he's going with the story and trim a little of the fat. As it is he's heading into a disturbing patter of every other book being good. Four years is a long time to wait for any sort of plot movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too long to get into the story","review":"Boy this book takes like half the book to finally get into anything meaty. I tried reading this book several times before I just put it down. The writing in this book also doesn't seem very clear and concise. Maybe I was bored out of my mind after reading 5 chapters that I wasn't paying attention anymore. Or it could be the Robert Jordan is just getting too old to write good books."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know....","review":"I really enjoyed this book, despite all the negative reviews I'd heard prior to reading. Sure, there wasn't a great deal of action, but there were many interesting plot and character developments, and I still adore Jordan's writing style. Descriptive, but not overly so. (And to anyone who disagrees--try reading anything by Dennis L McKiernan, THEN tell me CoT has too much description). Overall, this book was a turning point in the series, and I think readers can look forward to more fast-paced books in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera in a Fantasy World","review":"I have now read Volumes 1 through 10 of this series.

Then this bogged-down series is for you! Jordan tracks an ever-increasing number of characters along a never-ending journey designed to rob you of your hard earned bucks and never providing a satisfactory conclusion. Watch as Perrin tracks his wife's kidnappers and then, just as he has almost caught up with them, sidetracks into a city where we are bogged down with the details of purchasing grain full of weevels. Hopefully in the next chapter he'll remember she's missing and stop getting side-tracked, but that is probably wishing too much since the purpose of the series seems only to continue itself.Please everyone boycott this garbage!

The first few books were excellent and I kept gobbling up the next in the series like a junkie. After about 7 or 8...the addiction turned to boredom. It's like if crack started putting you to sleep after taking it for awhile. Anyway I started reading it and then put it down after a couple pages. I just didn't care what happened to the characters anymore. It still sits in a drawer by my bedside, but I've re-read several other novels and haven't gotten desperate enough to pick it back up. I'd sell it on EBay, but even there nobody wants it. Plenty for sale for 99 cents with no bids. Oh well. Now I see yet another! Vol 11. Yikes!

But alass I am a addict, I have so much of my time invessed in this decology? that I had to waste my money on this book.With that said, here is my take, there are some good chapters in the book, but you can count them on your hands, nothing gets acomplished, and you are left with a sense of no plot avancment. That sucks, with a series that streches 14 years now, you expect to move forward,Buy this book, just don't read it in bed, it will put you to sleep.I think that I speed read 1/3 of the book of fluff that jordan put in just to squeeze out his requiered number of pages!In the future Mr. Jordan please leave your edits from the last book in the trash don't serve them up as a new book.Angry WoT Fan,John"},{"rating":"1","title":"well, one has to read it and the sequels as well, but!","review":"I was really disappointed that this book is merely a money spinner for the author. All of the events precede the climactic events in Book 9 or are perhaps concurrent. So zero plot development here, after reading close to 700 pages and I am not exaggerating about the zero. I admit to still getting oh so engaged with the protagonists and you can't help but like them, but zilch actually happens. The book left me cold. With some deft editing, should have been combined with Book 9 or perhaps with #11 so atleast there would have been some plot movement. With #11 I will know to wait for the paperback before plunking down my money - there's nothing earthshattering that couldn't wait another year to read. So disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much detail, not enough story.","review":"Robert Jordan's story was wonderful in the beginning. Unfortunately he has become bogged down in the myriad of details and characters he has created.

This book amazingly more than the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree with the others.","review":"This book covered nothing and went nowhere with the plot. Most of the events covered in this book happen just before and during the cleansing of the male half of the source and we end up right where we were at the end of Winters Heart. There is no development of Mat or Perrins situations, lots of descriptions of them, but no development. Rand at the end is seen to have surrvived, but there is little or no mention of what effect the cleansing of the male half has had. I really expected better from Robert. This book almost seems like he suddenly discovered that he only had 11 books worth of material and a contract for 12. The only good thing is that I didn't put out the money for this book. The bad thing is that someone who loves me did pay for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down the drain...","review":"Up to Book 5 or even 6 this series deserved 5 stars.

The only reason it gets two stars is because Jordan has enough talent to make fluff mildly readable.

The only thing you will be able to take away from this book is that either RJ is in desperate need of money and is looking to line his pockets or that he has absolutely no clue as to where this series is headed. The first six books of this series were outstanding, seven through nine could be stomached, but ten is a very bad soap opera. Nothing happens in this book and it goes nowhere.

This series could be so great, there are so many threads he could follow, but instead he throws names around like crazy and ignores the multitude of interesting characters he's already developed.I can sympathize with someone suffering from a bit of writer's block, as it appears Jordan has lost the inspiration that marked the first 4-5 books.

I especially like the one that said Jordan's die-hard fans would give the toilet paper he wiped his butt with 5 stars!! Hilarious!!

Go to the library borrow the book and read evry 50th page, you won't miss a thing.

I got so bored with his flowery descriptions at points that I started skipping whole paragraphs. Believe me, I didn't miss anything either. At one point it takes him a whole page to describe a table. As far as the plot is concerned, nothing happens. This book could have been much better represented as a 100 page prologue to a book that actually does something. Not worth the money.

THIS book is not even half a book. It is nothing more than a prologue for the next book.After the end of the last book, I was really hoping that the action would pick up. Boy was I wrong! It is one thing to string your readers along to make a few more dollars, but at least give a 680 page book a PLOT!!!!IF I continue with this series, I will be sure to buy the books used. RJ will get no more money from me. He has swindled me for the last time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless...","review":"This book was a complete disappointment. If you have read the previous nine books, you can just skip this one. There is absolutely no useful plot development, no action, nothing.I cannot believe I waited two years for this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Worse","review":"This series started out great with the first few books, but at around six or seven it started to go nowhere. The only reason I read Crossroads of Twilight was because the series started out so well and I kept hoping it would get back on track. I am sorry I wasted my time. All it seems to be about now is gossip between the rival female characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Twilight has set on the this series...","review":"Soon, night must fall. Hopefully, very soon!This book was so boring, it took me 7 months to read and even when I picked it up, I could only skim it just to get the basic idea and see if anything happens. Unfortunately, nothing happened in this book. It was 672 pages of utter boredom. What a waste of money.Mr. Jordan, finish this series already! By the way, I will never buy one of your books new again. you are no longer worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"mind-numbingly boring","review":"Nothing happens in this book. It may be true that Jordan is just setting us up for the next book, but that's what I've thought after the previous 3 books as well, and nothing much has happened. In any case, this book could have been condensed down to two chapters at most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for fueling a campfire...that's about it.","review":"What really bothers me about this book is not it's horribly slow pace, nor is it the lack of a plot(even though what little there is doesn't pertain in any way to the overall storyline of the series). My main problem with CRoT is it's late release. Jordan actually stated in an interview that he had the release date pushed back so he could, 'make the book a enjoyable as possible.' Fans of the series waited an extra three to four months for a book that has so little to do with the actual overall theme of the series that it might as well belong to another. Beware potential buyers, much pain lies therein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing in too many words","review":"I have always been a fan of Jordan, but this book is just a let down. I cannot get past page 100. How can anyone say nothing in so many pages? Jordan must be getting paid by the word. Good thing this book was given to me as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be called \\"Waste of Time\\"","review":"This book is a waste of time! Nothing happens!!! I wish I could return it! Fantasy Adventure? It's more like an episode of \\"Days of our lives.\\" Robert Jordan's work has taken a downturn for the worst. His last few books in this series have definitely been sub par. This book lacked any type of battle, action, or a plot. It has no start and no end. With over 600 pages of text you would think Jordan could move the plot along, but he didn't. I think he is adding extra books to milk every last dollar out of this series. He has lost me as a fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"In one word, DISAPPOINTING. RJ has stretched the plot so thin, eight (!) different sub-plots going on in parallel, that after you've gone through the 680 pages you realize nothing much has happened! There was more action packed into one chapter in the first few books than the whole of this one. I can't help suspecting that RJ is stretching (milking?) The Wheel of Time on and on so he can get to book Twenty and we will still all be waiting for Taimon Gideon....."},{"rating":"1","title":"so terrible","review":"what is going on the series started out awesomely...and this last book just dragged on forever for me. i couldn't wait to get to the end not because i wanted to know what happened but because i couldnt' wait for the book to be over. hopefully book 11 will have some more substance and less aes sedai dramas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever Read","review":"This book is terrible. Out of 700 some odd pages, maybe 100 were readable. The number of characters has so weighted this series down, I don't know if it can be concluded with 50 books. I have no idea how this series will end up in two books, if that still holds true, other than a nuclear weapon killing everyone.Maybe Jordan should read Goodkind in order to learn how to focus on key, important characters and leave the rest on the editorial scrapheap.The publisher should be ashamed for letting this book out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book in all of man kind to be accurate.","review":"This is the worst book i have ever read if at all Robert Jordan even chekc out these reviews he should know for sure that his stupid book no longer interests most readers. Omg the amount of desctiption on a 2 minute incounter between 2 people takes up 10 pages for pete sake. I must agree the first 5 or 6 books were awsome the pace was moving, things were happening, people were discovering themselves than boom!!! its like we are stuck in a time warp going slower and slower and everyone waiting to see what the others were doing so basically sitting around and doing nothing.....IF I CAN GIVE THIS A 0 STAR REVIEW I WOULD HAVE!!!!

There were pages in this book that made me feel like I was reading the Dragon Reborn again. The chapters about Matt were at least as good as anything else in the series. For that alone I give the book two stars.Still, I can't see rewarding him by buying this book. Get it in paperback or borrow it from a friend and save it for a rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment","review":"I have read so far all the series with great enthusiasm, I hope to keep doing it but it is more difficult every day.This last book was too slow for me. The plot has no progress, instead of action in every scene we get the color of the dress, the place in the room where they sit, the personal history of the cabinet maker who made the chair ... you know where i'm getting to.The name and personal history thoughts and philosophy of yet another character that does nothing to advance the plot is not what I payed for.So for a series with great promise, and strong and interesting main characters, I am a disappointed.In summary of the 800 pages, Rand only shows on page 600 and we get 200 pages of plot. And then the book ends abruptly.The first book was amazing, I hope the next one can live to earlier expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My God.................Never Again","review":"What a ......, ......, ...... book. The worst in the series so far. It took so long to read it felt like the 'Age of Boredom'. No action, no balefire, no Forsaken dead, no weird creature with the thing around its neck. If Nynaeve had mede an appearance instead of a brief mention she would have pulled her braid out roots and all. Don't care about Egwene's wobbly chair, sick of Lelaine, Romanda and Aes Sedai politics, had enough of Luca's Travelling Show and wish Perrin would just get on with rescuing Faille. Rand you say? Who's he? Tarmon Gaidon, it sure felt like it.Will I read Book 11? Probably, but only out of some sort of misguided loyalty.(Handy Hint-Don't pay good money for this book, borrow it from your local library, then all you've lost is time.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 of 1668","review":"Here are the customer review ratings for the Wheel of Time series, as of 11/7/031.

It seems that lately Jordan's two or three remaining fans (probably family) are trying to bump up his rating from a dismal 1.5 stars (with 1 being the minimum, this is like getting a .5) with lame reviews. This book was inexplicably lame, unfathomably pointless, and confoundingly pathetic. Is this actually a book, or just 600 pages of filler with about 3 sentences worth reading? Can the big bad Forsaken appear any sillier, weaker, or uninteresting? I doubt it. RJ has hit rock bottom with this latest \\"offering.\\" I recall being as disappointed with the last three \\"novels\\" and will no longer purchase anything with \\"Robert Jordan\\" on the novel.

I was excited to see how cleansed Saidin would be handled. Sadly, the subject barely even came up. Most of the book seemed to be dedicated to describing what people were wearing and what a room looked like. The various plots were advanced only a few weeks in the time frame and even then it was hard to keep track.It appears as if Jordan is running out of inspiration and is just plodding along to meet deadlines. I know he can do better work than this. I hope that he will wait until he has a good product before publishing the next book.

I'm very disappointed since nothing really happens to advance the story. It sort-of felt like homework to finish it because it's boring and slow paced. Many of the main characters appear only peripherally and I hated the way the book ended. I hope that the next book in this series is better.

That book got me into Fantasy. Now years later, Crossroads of Twilight makes me want to stop reading fantasy. This is by far the most convoluted book I have ever read. The descriptions are long, dialogues between characters few, and action non-existent. I mean what happened to Mr. Jordan. He reminds of another Mr. Jordan who should have retired when he was ahead(Micheal Jordan for anyone who doesn't get he allusion. I won't spoil the book by going into details, but let's just say this might be a book worth renting from the library and skimming, but most definitely not worth buying and reading carefully.I think you time is better spent read George R.

He needs to get back to the story that has intriged millions for the first 8 novels. His lack of focus and story line in this novel is boring. I could not finish the book.

How long before the Wheel of Time finally runs out of Saldyllic varnish and its spokes start to rot with the Cursed Diseases of the Whitecloak? How long before Rand al-Thor and the rest of his wretched, two-dimension ilk burn in the eternal flames as the Wheel of Time crashes into their forlorn planet and explodes in a fiery ball of...um...fire? How long until this extremely tedious and repetitive series comes to close!?Nothing much happens in this book. Some people mumble, some people walk around, and the plot slows to a snail's crawl.

No events that forward the plot really happen and we are subject to mindless rambling about whatever pops into the authors mind at that moment.I must say i preferred Terry Goodkind's latest book Chainefire to this. I am not a big fan of Terry Goodkind but his latest book is taking a turn for the better after two very bad books both of which were about a goat.Honestly if you want to find and ending I would wait till he stops writing and buy the last book in the WoT because recently nothing seems to happen in his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"The books started out ok but fell apart when the author decided to stretch the series as long as it could go. Fanatics will say that it doesn't matter when you look at the big picture of the series. It only takes one mistake to screw up a good thing, and Jordan did a fantastic job ruining his books and has become an embarassment of the genre. This book is the worst of the series only moving the plot on the very last page of the book. I feel sorry for those I recommended this series to before i read the later books. I strongly ask you to avoid a all costs!

I don't care about Perrin's shrew of a wife...I want to hear about Rand!!! When is he going to start hanging out with his other \\"girlfriends\\"? When is he going to take control of the Black Tower?

Like others I waited a long time for this latest installment to come out and like the others I was totally disappointed. I concur with the previous writer who said this series started going down hill around book 6.The plot goes nowhere. I'm at a loss to determine if it's Mr Jordan, or his editor that deserve the blame for this. The second time I read the book, I read thru it to determine why I didn't like it and I've figured out why. It appears that Mr Jordan has decided to put 3 to 5 paragraphs of descriptive scenary for every line of dialogue. Don't get me wrong, the vibrant descriptions of the WOT are a key element, but in this case it's over the edge.Maybe he's getting paid by the word. You could have put the entire story down in 1/3 of the space. I'm not buying another one of his works in hardcover, I'll wait until they come out in paperback from here on out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this book released?","review":"I do not see why this book was released. The plot is not significantly advanced. The comedy of errors in the 'plot' is grotesque. In volume 9 the male half of the source is cleansed, yet NEVER do any of the Aes Sedai involved notify any others, Nynaeve never notifies her close friends, leaving everyone else in the dark? HUH?!?!Charcters are growing 1 dimensional. Matt has dice rolling in his head. Perrin has Golden eyes. Nynaeve tugs her braid. All the women deny ever being wrong about anything. It is all the men's fault.OK you now have the next 4-5 books save your time waiting and save your money. The series started out great, then pulled defeat from the very jaws of victory."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series has become a forced death march.","review":"Almost nothing happens. Large amounts of time are spent rehashing stale character tics, two-dimensional characterizations, absurd gender relations, and the minutiae of everyone's clothing. More and more side characters are brought on stage, the few main characters with any \\"screen\\" time spin their wheels, and the few important things are practically ignored or given a paragraph. We spend pages on Egwene wandering through thecamp, but have throwaway lines about the Windfinders breaking out of Ebou Dar. We spend chapters with Elayne glacially moving towards the throne and Perrin glaciually moving towards Faile, but the cleansing of the Taint gets hardly a mention.Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm done","review":"What a waste of time and money. Jordan has finally driven me to quit. I don't understand what happened to this story but the last two or three books have gotten worse and worse. Now I no longer care what happens to any of these characters and Jordan wouldn't tell me for another 15 boring books anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to this series?","review":"This WAS a truly wonderful series of books. This one is just sad. Page after endless page of mind-numbing pointless detail where absolutely nothing happens. Does he not know where to go with the story? Or has it turned into such a cash cow for him that he is intent on churning out pointless book after pointless book just because people will buy them. Maybe someday Jordan will start writing again, until then skip it. This is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who the wrote this?","review":"I am normally a very very big fan of RJ but this is by far the most horrible piece of [stuff] that he has ever written. This book goes absolutely no where. If you cut out the fluff there would only be about 200 pages in this book. You could then trim that 200 down to about 75 if you left the stuff that was crucial to the ongoing story line in and threw out the rest of the irrelevant plot tweakers. That would have made an excellent prologe to what should have been a brilliantly recieved tenth book.I am honestly begining to wonder if he is just milking all of this for the money. I mean come on 3 years between books, that would be forgiveable if this was a quality book that he took all that time writing but come on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The longest chapter ever written","review":"Once again Robert Jordan managed to write a book where almost nothing happened. Most writers would have covered book 10 in one, maybe two chapters. I can't help but wonder if he's just trying to drag the series out. I read book one when it first came out and it used to drive me crazy waiting for the next one. The last couple haven't been worth the wait. If this is the way his books are going to be from now on, maybe its time to end the series. If you've been following the series from the begining and have to read the book, check it out from the library. Don't bother buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan is taking us all for a ride.","review":"This is absolutely, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the worst book in the series. Nothing happens to propel the story forward or keep our interest. Nothing. It's the same old garbage. Endless discussions. Endlessly boring. One would have to suspect that Jordan is taking us all for a ride. Stringing us along to make money off of his loyal fans.It's pathetic. Truly pathetic. This is the last time I buy one of his books. I'm done with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment","review":"Unfortunately, this book did almost nothing to move any of the stories along. The majority of the book revolved around Matt and Perrin, but neither story arc moved much. Perrin is still chasing the Shaido to rescue Faile, and Matt is still travelling with the circus with the Daughter of the Nine Moons. Rand makes a brief appearance after page 500. The one redeeming quality of this book is that he did not start a new story arc.If the story continues at this rate, it will take another 100 books to complete the story. Jordan should actually be ashamed to have published this book. I have given him chance after chance, but I will not buy another of his books until the series is complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan's Fashion Show","review":"Having been frustrated with Robert Jordan's previous books in this series that are ploddingly paced, I find reading Crossroads of Twilight like reviewing hundreds of articles on local fashion shows. Jordan seems to think that characters are made vivid by telling us exactly what they are wearing. After 200+ pages of watching character after character parade across Jordan's stage with him announcing in the same monotone what they're wearing, I give up. He has apparently decided that it is better to milk his audience for every penny he can than to produce a great, enduring fantasy classic (which he was well on the way to with the first 3 books).This book finally quenches my thirst for the Wheel of Time, not with satisfaction, but with disillusionment. So long, Robert."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a colossal disappointment...","review":"I have just finished the highly anticipated Crossroads of Twilight and I'm still wondering when my anticipation will be met. This book is repetitive, ill-defined, and ultimately boring. Chapters are filled with inane detail and mindless thoughts and dialogue with very little true plot resolution whatsoever. If the entire series was finished this book might be forgiven in light of the overall series, but to wait for years only to read this tripe really ticks me off. The author's lack of creativity and focus in combination with publisher's inept editing and dollar-driven marketing strategy are alienating fans and are killing what used to be the best fantasy series in decades. In truth, if Crossroads of Twilight had been the first book in the Wheel of Time series there never would have been enough of an audience to warrant a second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Oops I did it again\\"","review":"Like a broken record, repeating it over and over again. How many times does a reader need to be reminded that Aes Sedai pierce you with a stare and the world is so complex and so much is happening (Oedipus complex maybe). Oops, I lost the plot somewhere. This story \\"Crossroads of Winters Heart in Twilight\\" is the culmination of 3 very bad books. I fear there is no end in sight. Jordan has become entangled in his own web of mistrust, deceit, and perhaps is himself tainted by the source (whiskey that is). I enjoyed this series, for years, eagerly awaiting the next installment. I have lost my interest and am contemplating putting this series to rest, COT has done nothing to change my mind. What started so well, has spun out of control. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOT: Waste of Time","review":"We are now ten books into this series and everyone is ready for something to happen that will answer some of the questions that Jordan has used to leave us all hanging. Yet, to my utter amazement Jordan chooses to go back in time rather than take the series forward. He goes through the painstaking process of telling us where every character was at the exact moment that Rand cleansed the Source in book 9. There is no development whatsoever in the plot. All of the major characters are doing exactly what they were doing back in book 9. What's Elayne up to these days? Still trying to secure the Lion Throne. How about good old Perrin? Sorry to disappoint you, but he's still chasing Faile and the Shaido. Surely, Egwene unites the Tower? Nope, she's still sitting outside of the Tower where Robert Jordan left her two years ago. Believe me, I already wasted my time on this book, don't bother wasting yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing happens, no conclusion","review":"the book starts with a prologue of various charachters and their activities which will never be seen again throughout the book. the book doesn't end but leaves a cliff hanger to a conflict that was never really established. The middle is just filler, no charachters changed their position for more then a few days of walking/chasing/sneaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many words, many pages, no action","review":"As Jordan writes more books, the action has decreased. Pages of minor, inconsequential characters' thoughts, descriptions of their clothing, meaningless conversations and other related trivia do not make an engrossing read. Let's face it, fantasy literature requires action, this book lacks it, and was boring. This series desperately needs things to happen. Next one that comes out, I'm going to wait for one of my friends to read it first, and if they tell me nothing happens in it either, I'll skip it even though I've invested alot of time reading 10 prior, long volumes. That's how dull this series is getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't be Jordan","review":"This book could not have been written by Robert Jordan. I refuse to believe he is capable of writing such boring drivel. I would not be surprised if the publisher had someone else write this and put his name on it. This book was too painful to read. Thats how boring it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Wheel of Time book so far","review":"This book is an exception to the great stories that have appeared in previous WOT books. It's all politics, walking, talking, running, and everybody is pretty much in the same condition as at the end of book 9. The \\"climax\\" isn't a climax at all, we are left hanging! After so many books with significant endings, this one is leaves you thinking, \\"Where's the next chapter, or two?\\"If you love the WOT series you will not enjoy this book very much. At this point it seems RJ is dragging this thing out for all it's worth instead of giving us any substance. In tempo, it's similar to book 9, without the last two chapters.Wait two years and see if the series is worth keeping up with is my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"50 pages crammed into a 680 page book.","review":"I've read all of Jordan's Wheel of Time books more then twice. I would give all of them 4+ stars. Until now.R.J. seems to be devolving into one of those self-important people who love to hear themselves speak (or read what they write in this case). All of his last 2 or 3 books suffered from page bloat, in that 100 pages of useless dialogue (not moving the story), hackneyed phrases and yet another new character to take up space (when he can't seem to devote enough to developing some of the main ones). Crossroads does not suffer from bloat, it seems to revel in page bloat. This book could have been cut down to about 50-75 pages and still had it's usual dose of men complaining about women, women thinking men need to be controlled and people knuckling and sniffing.My advice for readers who haven't picked this up yet, but love the series....wait 6 months and get it out of the 5.99 bin. It will kill a few days time, but not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, So Sad","review":"Remember when Rand first saw a Mydraal following behind him.

Or how about in Rhudean (excuse the spelling) when he learned the history of the Aiel. RJ's world rivalled Tolkien for history and imagination. Remember... Oy I could go on forever. What happened to the series?That sense of danger is all but gone. We know that there is absolutely no chance of one of the characters dying. The Forsaken have all become ninnies. The Aes Sedai have all become ninnies. Elayne is a ninny and by association so is Birgitte and Aviendha.The Sea Folk are all ninnies, the... IT'S A WHOLE DAMN BOOK OF NINNIES!

I read fantasy novels to be entertained. I WAS NOT ENTERTAINED. I was tortured. You could summarize the action in this book with about 10 bullet point sentences. NOTHING HAPPENS! The number of detailed new characters descriptions was mind boggling. And most of them are unimportant. And is EVERYONE in the story harder than steel, more dangerous than a viper, with eyes like a hungry hawk with an unflappable calmness? zzzz . . . zzzz . . . zzzz . . .

It was very painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautiful thing disregarded and destroyed.","review":"It cannot be emphasized enough how much I used to love this series.I've read the first 9 books many, many times.

NOTHING!!! And that nothing only from the POVs of those WHO CHANNEL SAIDAR!!!!!(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I am so glad to those who took such pains to explain in detail why this is such a disappointment and waste of time.

Jordan SHOULD be embarrassed to have turned himself into an author who must be paid by the word, and those are pretty empty words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great story told","review":"It seems that a lot of people find the latest of these books quite dull. I believe Robert Jordan has created a world very much like JRR Tolkien. I agree that sometimes it is hard to drag myself through some of the pages but over all it is a very good book with a very good story behind it. I have been reading books since I was old enough to read and I know when to just stop and put a book down. This is not one of them.

I would simply like to add that there is absolutely no excuse for the publisher to allow such clearly unedited...garbage to make it to press. Who cares if Jordan has already published lots of stuff? All the more reason to reign in his verbosity and suggest that the plot be central or, at the very least, addressed. This is simply pathetic, and no one in their right mind should purchase it. Perhaps not even libraries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone teach Jordan about plot movement!","review":"Spending good money on this book is a waste of time. If you must read it wait a few months and get it from the library. I was eagerly waiting to see how Faile would be rescued or how Egwene's Aes Sedai would gain the White Tower or ANYTHING that would have been worth spending the [$$$] I laid down. Nothing happens! Jordan apparently has no idea how the story is going to end so he just write really long descriptive passages that lead nowhere. The scene where Perrin is in the town, that may have ghosts, and is dealing with negotiations for grain is a prime example of writing gone awry. Why weren't the ghosts dealt with or at least expounded upon! The stars of the book are the weevils that seem to get mentioned in every chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milking the Cow","review":"Jordan should be ashamed of himself. \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" is ten pages of interesting material spun out to 700 pages of dross.

However, he should have finished the Wheel of Time series long ago, and gone on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this going to go on forever?","review":"After more than one year of waiting, I started reading this book with the usual expectation I reserve for the \\"eye of the world series\\". Unfortunately it seems that Robert Jordan thinks he can make us go to the bookstore and buy the continuation of the continuation forever. He has made the series a money machine, and is not willing to advance to a conclusion. In Crossroads of twilight nothing happens. There is already so many characters and parallel plots that it takes the first 5/6pages to review them, and then he uses the following 1/6 to introduce more alternative plots. After ten books, I would feel comfortable if we advanced towards a conclusion, and concentrated on the main plot. Is this going to go on forever?The only positive thing I can say about the book is that the characters and Jordan's writing style have become so familiar that the book is as easy to read as a comic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed fan","review":"I have been reading Robert Jordan since 1991.

This is pure ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, now I really feel like an ......","review":"Ok, HOW long did we wait for book 10? 2 YEARS? This book went almost no where. Jordan is filling pages and pages with pure fluff. Having waited for this book for that entire time, I feel like I just got my chain yanked. Aside from a few major decisions being made, Jordan spends his words describing filthy clothing, and or just TALKING about clothing clean or not, for a great percentage of the book. Lots of describing scenery, and background, but little on plot devlopment and progression. I am very dissappointed with this book and it is starting to color my overall perceptions of the series. I hope he gets back to what he gave us in the first few installments, and I will likely ready whatever he may produce in the WOT in the future, but I won't be anticipating it or holding my breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a die-hard Wheel of Time fan...","review":"I love the Wheel of Time. I've been waiting for this book for a long time. I've read the whole series many times... this book was a serious disappointment to me.Nothing happens.Then... it happens again.680 pages go by and it happens many times.I'm disappointed. Not a single plot was resolved in this book. Not even a minor plot. Only marginal hints were given as to what is to come and most of them completely ambiguous. All the major plots ended at high points where one more chapter could have given some closure. This would be fine if there was only 1 minute of commercials until it starts up again. Now we have to wait 2 years.I would never have thought of giving a Wheel of Time book below 4 stars until I read this book. I have no desire to reread it. That, for me, is a strange feeling. If the series doesn't get better I am dropping it while I still think of it as a good fnatasy series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The big picture","review":"I've heard a lot of talk how Crossroads of Twilight was no good. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!? It should be obvious that COT is building toward the last book: Lews Therin had the hundred companions, and now Rand will have the power of a bonded white and black tower behind him for the last battle (not to mention a cleansed saidin). This all building from all the way back in book 6!(4 if you count the Great Sa'angreal) I think people forget that this series isn't like Goodkind's -here's another adventure- format, but like an intricate 10,000 page novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What really happened","review":"Somewhere in the middle of Lords of Chaos, George RR Martin, Robin Hobb, Tad Williams and 10 other great writers (13 in total) captured the real Robert Jordan and had him stilled.

To me it read like just part of a single chapter.As for the characters, as I read the series, I almost can see the strings that leads from Jordan's hand to each of the them. That makes them feel rather artificial and forced into certain molds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"The Wheel of Time has become the Waste of Time. I have been a complete fan of Jordan's books - waiting breathlessly for them to be released. I intentionally saved this book to read as my reward for completing my graduate degree (and finally having the time to read). Boy was I disappointed. Jordan has taken this story line and made it so convoluted it is practically impossible to follow the plot. The foreward momentum seems to have stopped, and with all of the time bewteen books - you very nearly have to re-read the series just to figure out what is happening.While I will not abandon this series entirely - I will not purchase another book until the series is complete. Then I will wait to see how it ends before deciding to purchase. At least you can read this free from the library - because unless things change - it is unlikely Jordan will get another dollar of my hard-earned money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could we please GET somewhere!","review":"After reading other reviews, I was glad to see that I am not alone in thinking that this book did nothing for me. Robert Jordan has created this amazing world with such compelling characters. But there are so many sub-plots and useless descriptive (fill) narratives that in 600 pages you get maybe 20 pages of real plot advancement for thirty disconnected storylines. There is absolutely no sense of progression in this book, and no real climzx for the volume.This book is nothing more than 600 pages of what everyone is wearing before they got to book eleven.It will be a shame that this epic series may never see an end. The way I see it, either the elderly Jordan will pass on, or I will waiting for the next volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is all the action","review":"I had to force myself to read this book. After reading the other 9 books, I though I have put in too much time into this series to abandon the whole thing. This story is moving way to slow for me. The good parts of the book are too short. I have decided to wait another 5 or six years when the whole story will be complete and then read the rest of the books. There are other books out there in then mean time."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Were Very Disappointed","review":"My husband and I couldn't wait to get our hands on this book having read all the rest of the series. And the series is awesome! Until you get to this book. Nothing really happened. People just seemed to move through the story without really doing anything...and there was lots of waiting. For what? I'm not sure. Nothing new happened. Nothing was concluded. We ended up spending ... for a hardback book full of filler. We still like Mr. Jordan but we'll wait for the paperback of the next book and hope it's better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck happened?","review":"I have found the rest of this collection to be quite good, so mush so that I'm reading the series again. Howerver this book was a HUGE let down. I'm still trying to figure out how this book adds to the over all story line. I mean nothing happened! there are a few parts that were intersting, such as finding out how Mat will mary the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and Egwene being capured. Other than that the book was lacking of any plot climax what so ever, no wait, it was lacking plot period. I recomend reading it when it comes to your local library and hope the next book will make up for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!!","review":"With Eye of the World, Jordan laid the foundation for an epic fantasy/adventure that I have thouroghly enjoyed- until now. Reading this book is almost painful! I find myself skimming page after page and the only thing I missed was the tedious description of what each sister was wearing. The chapters concerning the females have become especially bad. How many times do we have to hear the same scenarios over and over again? Characters that were once interesting have become flat. Adventures that were once fast-paced have become a stagnant mess! I know Jordan can do better than this. The proof is on my bookshelf. In my opinion, The Shadow Rising and Lord of Chaos is some of the best fantasy fiction ever written, but it's time to bring this series to a long-overdue end. I can only hope that Jordan will write a conclusion worthy of his earlier work. After reading Crossroads of Twilight, though, I have little hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooooooooo Boring","review":"I love all the books in the series but vol 10 was boring beyond belief. It covered too much in each character from the maid you'll never read about again to taking up a whole page to set a mood. Geez, I would never guess it's even the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"If negative stars were possible, I would rate it as such.","review":"This book is horrible. If you don't read it, you won't be missing anything. Remember the last book, the one where hundreds of pages were devoted to Elayne securing Andor? Do you like pages and pages of redundant, useless descriptions (for people and places we have already seen) that only serve to make the story crawl at an unbearable pace? Do you like reading about characters that should have been cut from this series long ago? Well, if you like those things, you'll love Crossroads of Twilight, The Wheel of Time, Book 10, where absolutely nothing of substance happens.This book should actually be numbered 9b.Borrow it from you local library (like I did) and read it before committing any money towards this book, or series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed","review":"I really had a difficult time finishing this book and think it could have fit into one or two chapters in his next or last book.

Hope the next one is better but I am reluctant to even buy it.SV in TN"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!","review":"It doesn't even rate 1 star but that's as low as the scale goes. This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Mr. Jordan and the publisher should be ashamed of themselves for even sending it to be printed. This entire book was nothing but a waste of time and money. Either Mr. Jordan doesn't know how to finish the story or is just trying to screw his fans out of more money. In either case I am through reading this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book!! Read why below.","review":"I personaly thought books 4,5, and 6 of this series were the worst. This one takes the cake. Out of 800+ pages of writing (paperback), there is probably, and I'm being generous, 100 pages of new stuff. Out of the new stuff there is more excitement watching a snail crawl. Just skip this book in the series and find someone who was silly enough to finish this one they can describe everything that happened with in 5 minutes and prqay to the Dark One that the next book is better. If you don't believe me, go ahead and read it. I hope you enjoy an 800+ page review of what has happened in the last 9 books.To Mr. Robert Jordan,Did you read this after you wrote it? I would've burned it and started over again. Did your imagination have a lapse? There is almost nothing new happening in this book. Just let it go and finish the series. Read Mrin Codex by David and Leigh Eddings and learn how to write a a fantasy novel, or give him a ring I'm sure he would share my ideals."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I wish there had been an option for no star and I am certainly glad I waited to get this 700 page waste of time from the library rather than buying it. Jordan is going slower and slower in his plot advancement. What am I saying, there is no advancement at all. The only thing happening of note was Egwenes problem at the very end. That's it. The rest of the book discusses hemlines, dress styles, who is jealous of who, and the whole book moves maybe 2 weeks of no one doing anything. I read it, just because I waited 10 weeks to get it available at the library. The only time I have been this let down by hopeful anticipation, was after watching Joe Millionaire. Both a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazingly pointless","review":"I started to read RJ in high school, I finished high school, went to college, got married, had a kid went to grad school and RJ is still not done.

Robert Jordan could have written what was in this book in about 5 pages but he took 700 pages it to do it. Also one of the main reasons I read this series is because no matter how slow the book is you can always expect something really cool to happen in the last 20 or so pages of the book. That was not the case in Crossroads of Twilight, the last 20 pages were just as boring as the rest of the book. If you have read the every book in this series as I have I'm sure this review won't change your mind but you should at least wait for it to come out in paperback before buying it. Lets hope that Jordan can actully put some action in to book 11."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best series ever, but not the best book in the series","review":"Wheel of Time is arguably my favorite series (other than Harry Potter.)

I just know I will buy the next book, I'm just too addicted. This book was the most boring yet. All the action happens behind the scenes and no fighting to speak of. Is their a war for the survival of goodness going on or not? Mr. Jordan your fans are begging you to quit milking this series and finish it in the next book.

This was by far the worst book of the series. At least in PoD we had the battle with the Seanchan.I doubt I'll waste the money for another purchase til I am 100% positive that the Last Battle has been fought and decided.RJ needs to get back to his roots and style of the early books.To bad there isn't a no star selection or better yet a negetive selection for the rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I think Jordan has painted himself in a corner. He seems to not know what to do and where to go. How else can one explain the snail's pace where nothing happens in a hundred pages?! There is little excitement; there are few new developments. And there are pages and pages of absolutely pointless descriptions of Aes Sedai and their dresses...I came to really like the characters in the WOT series but I must say that the book is really boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheel of Time standard in harmony with the telecom market","review":"And that's about it. The quality is hopelessly falling with no major trend-changes near the horizon. One can only wish for Mr. Jordan to improve his skill at narration... Obviously he can write when putting a mind to it so I guess I'ts a real bad case of writers block. Or the much needed editor has finally lost the battle and Mr. Jordan is now roaming free to leave every word ever typed to the press. Or whatever... Is it too much to ask for ANYTHING to happen in 600 pages? Anything at all? The pathetic \\"too be continued\\" end is on the same level as the Jason movies. I can't wait for the next book but only because of nostalgia of the milieu and action presented in books 1-6. There seems to be some pressure on the writer to rectify himself. Doubtfylly Mr. Jordan will deliver..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"No action, way to much fluff about personal appearances. Robert Jordan may have gotten in over his head with to many characters in this story. I can only hope this was all stage settings for great things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"More!","review":"Too many complaints about the length and depth of Jordan's series. This book deepens the plot, expands the charachters roles, raises the level of anticipation and suspension. I can't imagine why anyone that has been reading the series would want it to end!?! Yes, many parts seem overly drawn out and Jordan is overly descriptive, but once again, I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for book 11 to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Just download a summary instead of reading this book. All the characters just sit around and whine about the cold and how obnoxious men/women are. Right at the end one of the main characters does something totally stupid and out of character, and that's about the only interesting thing. So either download a summary, or skip the first 600 pages. I'm not kidding. You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"I really only have a couple of things to say. One - if R. Jordan would spend less time detailing the type of spices they add to wine served in worked silver goblets inlaid with ornate jewels, etc, less time detailing the type of clothing worn by the characters, less time mentioning how many women like to \\"smooth their skirts\\" when they were upset, we would probably only have 8 books in the series to this point and they might not have completely lost the potential that they once had.Talk about milking it for every penny. He should be ashamed of himself. Book 10 and we are really no further ahead than we were at the end of book 7. Boring. Boring. Boring!!! Two - the characters are what make the books stand out- Unfortunately, they have become secondary to the desire to have Book 27 in the Wheel of Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minus 5 stars","review":"The reviews complaining of how tedious and boring the plot development succeeds in being in a book that actually manages to be published are heaping more praise on this book than it deserves. Amazon's rating scale should extend at least 5 stars into the minus category- a minus 5 rating is more than this effort deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"last RJ hardcover I purchase","review":"Well, other reviewers have already pointed out that this book is a tedious and unenjoyable read, so I won't repeat their complaints. I'll I can say is that I've purchased and read the hardcover versions of every previous novel in the series despite the fact that book 6 or 7 was the last one I felt was really a fun read. After CoT I sold my RJ books to the local used bookstore and vowed never to buy another RJ book (though I can imagine airport scenarios which would cause me to forsake this). There was a time when I honestly thought he was one of the best fantasy writers out there. Now the best I could say of RJ is that if you are suffering from insomnia or some similar affliction and have already read G.R.R. Martin's books multiple times there are worse authors in the fantasy genre you could waste your time reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"crossroads of twilight","review":"i was very disappointed with this book. After barely being able to put the earlier books down, this one made me go to sleep. All setup for the next volume, it seams to have been written just to make money.

It seams like an army has been sitting next to the White Tower for 2 years now. All setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of time and money","review":"This book was the biggest disappointment I have ever read. After waiting eagerly for this book for so long I am disgusted by how big of a let down this book was.Why?Nothing Happens. Continuing the grand trend shown in the last several books in this series noting happens in this book, no major conflicts, no momentus events, nothing but talk abouty things we already know from previous books. There as so many different characters now, each getting one or 2 chapters devoted to them, that it will take several more books just to get one of them to walk to the grocery store.If you are really into story develpoment and dont mind nothing happening, by all means buy this book. But, if like me you enjoy to read an actual story, not just the setup for another book (which will probably be another setup for the next......), and want something to happen in a book skip this piece of trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish they had negative numbers!","review":"That was the worst book in the series. I sat there hoping that there would be at least one battle, there wasn't a single one. I can summarize the book very easily, Rand cleanses the source and that is all. It didn't even talk about how that happened, there was just one pillar of Saidar and Saidin. Talk about a waste of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Time","review":"I have followed this series since the early times when something was happening. I am still wondering what happened in this volume. The protagonist was again ignored and what looked like some truly great movement from the last volume came to a complete halt.

Consider that the next volume will not be out until 2 to 3 years from now and you will see that the author had better get serious about the movement of the plot or he won't ever finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I actually do this to myself","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love this series, and will continue to read, but, come one! I am not sure if RJ has lost his way or not with the series, but it sure feels like it in this book. I eagerly look forward to the next installment, but I hope that he moves the stories forward.Overall, every story line seems to have moved sideways. There is nothing really new.Please, let the next book bring at least one story line to a close!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robbed","review":"I waited for this book to come out in paperback so that it would look right with all the others from the series that I bought. Now I am glad I did because it cost less and burns easier. Looking back at the Eye Of The World and comparing it directly, there is now a whole different style to Jordans work. Why change a winning formula? It was clear from the feedback from books seven and eight that readers were getting fed up with trawling through over complicated and elongated plots that go nowhere fast. It's us readers that put money in your pocket, so why do our comments get completely ignored? We've made it clear that we've been getting impatient with the series for THREE YEARS! Can you PLEASE make SOMETHING happen, Robert?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassing continuation of a long dead series...","review":"Purchasing this book reminded me of the poker adage, \\"don't throw good money after bad.\\" My advice to all readers is, fold, and find something else to read.Glaciers move more quickly than the last five books of this once-promising series. The author has clearly lost control of his plot, his characters, and has completely and woefully lost his vision. It is utter, endless drivel. I am tremedously disappointed, as I hope Mr. Jordan and Tor Publications are.Run, don't walk, and find something worthwhile to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper","review":"Another instance where an author thinks he can just milk us for every penny. This book is utterly pointless! I'm sure you can find a one or two paragraph summary of what happened in this book - I'd suggest reading that and saving your money. I seriously doubt I'll be reading the next book - if I do, I'll be checking it out from a library. There's no way I'm giving Robert Jordan any more of my money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So many strings so few pages","review":"Once again I delved into the wheel of time hoping to find a story that would shine like one of the first three books in the series.. but allas i was dissapointed.. once again. The weaver is trying to make a carpet out of too many threads and the carpet isnt getting anywhere near to completion. The book is +- 800 pages but not much happens.. a tiny bit here a tiny bit ther.. The story is draging its feet like a child that doesnt want to goto school.. Im really sorry i haveto say this but the story has lost its magic. Sorry folks but i wouldnt buy this book if i had a second chance.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six hundred seventy-eight pages and NOTHING happens","review":"What a disappointment this series has become. The first three books were so gripping and fast-paced. Glaciers evidence more action and change than this novel. At the end of the novel, nothing has happened. Perrin still seeks to free Faille from the Shaido. Elayne still seeks to secure the Lion Throne. Egwene still seeks to consolidate her control of the Aes Sedai and to reunite the splintered order. Mat is still traveling around with the the Princess of the Nine Moons, still railing against his seemingly fated destiny to have her as his wife. Rand? He is hardly seen at all, but like all the rest does nothing. Guess cleansing the male side of the source plain wore him out. Robert Jordan needs to pick up the pace and draw this series to an end. His readers deserve better than they got with Crossroads of Twilight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Since I had read other reviews on Amazon[.com], I didn't go out & buy the book, but got it from the library instead- thankfully. I really don't know what happened to this series- it started off great and now we're just bogged down in book after book that could be summarized in 5 chapters. And is it just me, or is the misogyny running even more rampant as the books continue? I would hate to think that all women are as smug, manipulative and haughty as Jordan makes them out to be. With the exception of Perrin and possibly Rand (though we barely see him in this book), there wasn't a single likeable character in the book. I'll still read the next books, just to find out what happens, but not with pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A call to action","review":"I'm glad to see all the bad reviews for this book. I started reading the Wheel of Time when I was in grad school in 95. I think the series was on about book 5 or 6 by then, and I happily read through the available books. The next one came out shortly thereafter, and I even bought the hardcover copy I was so excited to read it. Then 2 more years passed, and I read book 8. 2 more years, book 9. 2 more years, book 10. I've pretty much forgotten anything that has happened in the early books, and now all I remember is how painfully slow things happen. I expect Jordan to die before he finishes the series, leaving everyone hanging. And to make it worse, he releases a prequel to the series before he's even finished it? I refuse to buy any more of his books until (at least) he finishes the series. Perhaps if we all boycott the books, Jordan will wake up and realize he can't milk us for 10 more books and will end the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why o Why Mr. Jordan?","review":"Most of the reviews of this book and this series are completely accurate. The first five of six books of this series are among the greatest fantasy books ever written by anyone. Then Mr. Jordan decided to start trying to milk this for as many books as he can. Since those first five or six books this series has become plodding and uninteresting. I have continued to read each new instalment, hoping for the old magic, but it just hasn't come back. So unless your like me, and just wanting to hold out hope that this series will return to its old self, DO NOT buy any book from this series after you've read the first five or six."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Man...","review":"Jordan can't even get TWO stars from his most loyal fans now? What a sad tragedy this has become. Books 1-5 were some of the best I have ever read (and I would still recommend them to anyone), but the magic has been over for a long time now for Jordan. When and if he ever finishes the series, I'll buy the last book to see how it turns out but this is just ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backtracking","review":"I was halfway through the book when I realized that the events transpiring hadn't even caught up with the END of the last book, chronologically!

I'm done."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's amazing, really...","review":"... how little can happen in so many pages. It took me a whole evening to read about two foreign women going shopping for red, green and blue fabric, for pete's sake. I have too much invested (as in years of my life) in this series to give up on it now, but I'm getting the next installment from the library (gasp!!) I'm giving this book two stars, though, because for some reason I just kept on reading - and it successfully got me to sleep every night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boycott the \\"New Spring\\"!!","review":"A complete waste of time and money.

Anderson, which is conceivably the worst book ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless Twilight","review":"Sorry to jump on the bandwagon, but Mr.Jordan, please get a new editor! Crossroads of Twilight resolves nothing, adds new characters and complexity to an already overburden story line, and repeats the cycle of endless misery for Rand and his companions. Not even one \\"attaboy\\" for cleansing saidin? Faile no closer to being rescued? Nynaeve and Lan ignored? No change in the siege of the White Tower? If this keeps up, the last book will consist of nothing but the resolution of all the outstanding cliff-hangers! It would be a great benefit to readers to close some of the open story lines and perhaps even provide some long overdue happiness to some of the main characters. The Eye of the World is becoming dull. I pre-ordered this book, but am hoping I can maintain the discipline to wait for the next one to come out in paperback. Less expensive; less disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A betrayal of our hopes","review":"A shocking disappointment. While Winter's Heart seemed to get the series back on track, this volume moves the plot barely at all. While Glimmers, the prologue available this summer, seemed to presage the lack of any plot development; I hoped it was not to be. However, some 400 pages in to CROSSROADS, when a chapter was spent introducing us to some minor and hitherto unknown Andorian nobles, I realized that my hopes were in vain. Nothing happens, and we learn new or interesting about anyone. The harshest indictment I can make of Crossroads of twilight is that there is no reason to read it. Mr. Jordan said he wanted people to finish his series and say \\"boy that was fun.\\" I wish someone would tell him that at the amusement park, people go to enjoy the rides, not waiting in line for the rides to begin. This book is like waiting in those lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even deserve 1 star! Was there one fight?","review":"CoT doesn't even deserve one bloody star! I am an outraged fan, insulted and a fool for buying this book. The only thing good about this is, hopefully, RJ will actually decide that enough money is enough and he doesn't have to milk it to death. That and Matt and Tuon. That's about it. Two years for this. Unbelivable. Don't buy it or better yet, write your own ending(s)or put yourself in a cryogenic freeze until 2150 when book number 80 is released, \\"The Absolute Definative Next to the Last Battle. Really. Part IV\\" by Robert Jordan XXII. Detailed findings of geology in relation to Shayol Ghul and the Breaking. Oh, and Rand is one mile closer to the Last Battle watching everyone sniff at each other. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Me -zzz Robert Jordan - $$","review":"I was smart enough to stop reading after the 7th book, when I suddenly contracted Narcolepsy and was advised by my doctor to stop reading Robert Jordan. My doctor had several other similiar cases and all were cured by this remedy. So no, I didn't read the book, but I can tell by several other reviews that it is another piece of crap, written solely for the purpose of making money. For a series to start out so great and promising, its downfall has been highly disappointing. It is comparable to the last two Star War's episodes which were also crap put out to make money. I despise authors like Robert Jordan and Piers Anthony who prefer quantity to quality. Unfortunately, I think this disease might be spreading after the similiar downfall of Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series.If you want to read exceptional fantasy, read Stephen R Donaldson or George R R Martin, if you like books that appeal to 10 year olds, keep reading Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"WHAT WAS ROBERT JORDAN THINKING?Thanks for wasting my time, Mr. Jordan.

I couldn't remember all of the details. So after reading book seven I decided to wait and purchase all of the ten books and then reread them. Now it appears that Mr. Jordan is not limiting the series to ten books. I am dismayed. Am I supposed to purchase an unlimited number of books before the story is told?

I go through and highlight every time someone gets their coat, cloak, shawl, dress, skirts, or stole described, is tall for a Cairhienen, is short for an Aiel, fingers their weapon, or adjusts anything. No joke, in one of the books one of the characters stops herself in mid-thought to ask herself \\"Who cares about dresses?\\" Even better than describing someone's coat, I just read a passage where he said someone wasn't wearing a coat! Hardly a page goes by that I don't have a passage to highlight. I'm actually re-reading the series just to see if it's really as bad as I've complained...and it looks like it is. I hear 11 is good.

Alternatively don't buy it at all and borrow it from some poor sap who paid good money for it. This book is more of the same as the last two -- with none of the major plot adavancement (good vs. evil, Rand and his followers vs the Dark One and his)that made the first books so good. You could take the last three books (including this one), get rid of a 1000+ pages of fluff (Crossroads is 90% fluff and 10% content in my opinon) and have a book at the caliber of the originals. This series has really gone downhill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Customer","review":"I'm a ling time fan of the Wheel of Time series, but this book has to be the worst.

All of the plots of equal importance while Rand's story has taken something of the back seat for the time being. If you will recall, during many of the other books, it has mentioned that without all of his friends stuggling through their own individual hardships, he will fail. Rand has always been a main character, more of a central character than the rest, but never THE main character. Although this book is quite tedious, there is still much of the neverending political intrigue which has been prevelant in Jordans writing since the begining. I enjoyed the book, but am begining to wonder if much of the unnecessary fluff was put in to help Mr. Jordan's growing addiction to the almighty dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this series have a conclusion?","review":"Does this series have a conclusion?

Why couldn't they put two of those go nowhere books together. I guess they wouldn't get 20 bucks a pop from all of us suckers who wait anxiously in hopes of not being disapointed, yet again. I find myself struggling to rember the last books and ambigious references to events in them. Normally I would re-read the series, but I find myself wondering why I would possibly want to waste the time when I could go read Anne Mcaffrey or someone else.

I spent half the year rereading this series in the hopes that something will finally happen. And nothing did! The synopsis on the cover sheet does a better job of telling what happens without having to read through 680 pages of fluff! I think Mr. Jordan needs to get back to the early books where he wasn't afraid to kill a few people. He keeps introducing characters but none of them ever go away and each successive books has to tell what happened with these other characters.

Nothing, absolutly, nothing happens in this book that you will even notice if you dont read it. I assume there was a reason for Jordan to write a book contianing no additional plot or events but have not yet been able to deduce why. The fact that it took him over 2 years to write 700 pages where you basically learn where people were at the time of Rands cleansing of the taint is very depressing.

I remember the anticipation before a new book in the series came out, to see what was going to happen next.Now I do not care any more. Starting with books 5 and 6, things started slipping. As the series became widely popular, the editing went by the wayside. Endless new characters, new plot threads, no conclusions to old plot threads, major milestones just suddenly happening in the last chapter of the books, seeming to be tacked on just to have something happen.This series started out to be a masterpiece, now, its a sad legacy to what might have been.

This book has the bun and all of the \\"fixins\\" but the main ingredient seems to have been left out, dropped on the floor, or stolen.I realize that this analogy is somewhat poor and rather drawn out... but so is this book.I don't mind having read Crossroads, but it is disappointing to have waited 2 years for the bun with no beef.... and have to go hungry for another 2 years until the next offering is served up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm in Hell!","review":"This is not a book, its more like a portal into Hell. Avoid at all cost unless misery loves company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan get worse with every book","review":"It's really sad when a gifted author gets senile at a (relatively) young age, but that must be what has been happening to Jordan over the last 6 or 7 years.Each new book of the WoT series has less plot and coherence, wanders even more aimlessy , and just doesn't tell a 'story'The first 4 books where really good, although even then you could see a definite drop in quality from book 1 to book 4; but now, the story telling is totally lost.Save you money"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to believe other reviewers where cynical...","review":"But What. The. Frick. I'm all for rising action and tensions, but literally nothing worthy of note happens. Maybe it we bear out in the rest of them (I'm clearly too invested to quit at this point), but I really could have just skipped this book. It's hard to imagine Jordan writing this and anyone at all saying, \\"Great job, Bob. You'll make even more fans with this one.\\" I would have given one star but I do like the series as a whole. As long as the next book gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip van Winkle","review":"I have read each book to completion within a month of publication.I am in general agreement with the single star reviews. This is a weak book in what was initially a strong series. It is the nervous twitch of the series, the ruffling skirt smoothed.I suggest those who have not yet read this book to give it a pass, and the next one as well. When Jordan releases the twelfth, then pick up all three and read them as a trilogy.Those who really need a Jordan fix could always begin the whole series again. I have, twice. Otherwise, make friends with your librarian."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S TIME FOR AN END TO THE WHEEL OF TIME","review":"While I am an avid reader of Jordan's books, I've got to say this author seems to be milking this cow for all its worth. This book is over 600 pages with a story that could have been written in maybe 10. He should be ashamed of himself. He seems only interested in printing these books to make money, say nothing drag out the series and he'll make more money with each book. What's wrong with him!!In this book he repeats everything over again which he has said in the last 9 books. Worse, there's no story only detailed descriptions of places, it's like watching a movie with vivid landscapes, but the actors saying and doing nothing. Even worse is the constant addition of new characters who have minor roles, who Jordan feels compelled to tell us every little detail about how they look and what they are wearing, who cares ... stick with the main characters and the main story. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"True disappointment - even though expectations were lowered by the glacial pace of the previous two or three books, this was a let-down. I agree with the reviewer that states Jordan needs a good editor - more than that, he needs an editor that is not afraid to put their foot down and strip out all the fluff and padding that exists in the past several volumes.Bottom line - bought it, read it and then promptly returned it. Not worth the price of a hardback - I'll probably purchase the mass market paperback when it comes out, just to have the collection up to date. Then again, I may not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the story go?","review":"Two years of expectant waiting and Robert Jordan produces something less than mundane! This book must be the worst so far. I miss the plot intrigues, crisp narrative and action of the earlier books in the series where we flitted from character to character, each time being left on a cliff edge.The entire contents of this book could have been confined to two chapters. There has been virtually no plot advancement; Mat is STILL in Ebou Dar with Tuon, Perrin is STILL hunting Faile, Elayne is STILL trying to win the Lion Throne, the battle for Tar Valon has STILL to take place.Robert Jordan should re-read the first few books of the series to see why they were so popular. My one time delight with the Wheel of Time is quickly fading to disinterest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry and Disappointed","review":"I waited patiently for this book to come out thinking that a great story takes time to develop and progress. I was discusted to find that all my hope and patience was rewarded with a book that says nothing, goes nowhere, and leaves me hanging. I'm not really interested in reading the next book. I wish I could return it but it was a gift from someone who knows of my love of the story. I'll keep my copy only as a reminder that someone cares enough about me to buy it. Other wise it would be back on the shelf. I warn others to wait for it in paperback if you just have to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"I waited 2 long years for this book to come out and was excited when I found out it was about to be published. After 100 pages I was depressed, after 400 I was bored and by the time I finished it I was angry. What happened to Jordan?? Lord of Chaos was the greatest book I have ever read. I read it in one sitting! I could barely struggle through 100 pages of Crossroads of Twilight at a time without falling asleep. This entire book could be compressed to one page and the plot would not suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is it?","review":"I can't believe I waited for this for two years. Enough for me, I'm finished with this series. Take away the \\"Jordan verbosity,\\" and you have an interesting trilogy. I can't sit through another five or six years of waiting and prequels to get to the end of this. Save your money. Find other ways to entertain yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"If you like reading repetitive descriptions of women's dresses, want to know how many different things can be \\"pale\\" and care to know an appearance of every minor character (from hair, eye, and skin colour to a look on the face) then this book is for you.The drivel that is this book is a slap on the face to readers from Rober Jordan. You could have more fun watching grass grow for 2.5 years than reading \\"The Crossroads of Twilight\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe in the next one something will actually happen...","review":"I should have known better than to get my hopes up after book 9. This book is 680 pages of nothing. Nothing is resolved at all and you can pretty much skip the first 600 pages of book 10 and be ready for book 11 without much trouble. So do yourself a favor, and wait until your local library gets this in and save yourself the trouble of buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I have not even finished reading this book, and I am not sure that I will unless I am extremely bored. This installment is slow, hard to get into, and just plain boring. In my opinion, nothing of great importance has happened for several books now in the Wheel of Time saga. I feel like the author is writing book after book simply to sell more books, rather than to add to the development of the story. Come on, if Tolkien can do it in three, why are authors such as Jordan taking 10+ books to develop an inferior story."},{"rating":"1","title":"another lost reader","review":"This is really too bad. The first six or seven in this series were phenominal. The eighth & ninth were getting dull but I assumed Jordan was ready to start bringing together the hundreds of characters and subplots together. Instead he releases this book full of nearly 700 pages of nothing happening. What happened to all the great battles that the earlier books used so well?I am so dissappointed with this book. After reading book nine, I was disappointed, but hopeful. Now I am dissappointed and have no desire to finish this series. It had so much potential, and Jordan has let a potential masterpiece turn into a boring, dry and uneventful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Drivel","review":"What the heck? This book goes no where as others have pointed out. Jordan needs to have the story stick with the multitude of characters from the awesome first five books and STOP introducing new ones with every new book!!! Who cares one whit about Amyrilla and her party of stupid followers whos oppose Elayne? Jordan introduces them in one chapter, spends an eternity describing them, and then NEVER talks of them again. What the hells the point in this?? Stick with Rand, Matt, and Perrin and the girls. I don't care about poor Falion's plight. I am only half way through this book and wish I hadn't wasted my money. It almost seems like Jordan is no longer conscious of what he is writing and has completely lost the direction the original story was going. I am through with the series. I will make up my own ending in my mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the story","review":"Yawn. The first Five books I spent day and night reading. I couldn't put them down. The pace of this series is so slow that I literally had to force myself to read this one. Since the 3rd book I've preordered every book. The next one I'll wait till it hits the bargain bin. Give me a break it took until the end of the book till Rand even showed up. What a joke. Jordan should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So near, yet so far.......","review":"Like so many of the faithful RJ fans, I eagerly awaited the release of COT, the 10th book in the series and had done reading it within 2 days of purchase. If I had to say one word to rate it - Disappointing!!!. Yes, in contrast to the last few books, he does deal with all the lead characters but as some reviewers have put down - there is no advancement in plot. In the published interview, RJ has said he hopes to finish this series in 2 more books - I just cannot see how that can happen without been a disappointment. But like so many others, I will keep waiting for the next one...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up!","review":"I have continued to read the last several books in this series out a sense of obligation. I have invested so many hours on the previous nine and I usually don't give up easily. Crossroads did the trick, however, with countless long passages of little or no action whatsoever. I want to scream when I'm reading those endless chapters of Aes Sedai characters gossiping with one another! The central character in the drama, Rand, did not even appear until page 540! I blame Robert Jordan for abandoning the fans of an amazing series (up to Book 6 at least) and the editors and publishers for not caring about what kind of pulp they put out on the shelves. Please stop the comparisons to Tolkien as Jordan missed that boat about 2000 turgid pages ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is the worst book of the series. The plot evolved little - if at all. Initially this series was going to cover 8 to 10 books. Jordan needs to wrap it up. He can always do a sequel (or even better - a prequel). If the first book had been written at this pace, I would have never read the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winter's Heart Version 1.5","review":"While this book has a great deal of information in it, it does not really tell a story of any kind. It fills in details from Winter's Heart (hence the title of the review) but moves the overall story not at all. At the end of COT, Jordan's characters are a little older, in a little more danger, and have done little else.Please Mr. Jordan, wrap this up now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Protest","review":"It seems that even authors are not immune to greed. Having found a formula that guarantees him a large payout every two years Mr. Jordan seems loathe bring his series to a conclusion. At this point I doubt if he can get it done in 15 books which of course means we will all still be here in a decade.So, what's a reader to do? We all have far too much time and energy invested in the series to simply pass the next installment by. Do what I did. Save your money and simply check the book out from the local library. Maybe Mr. Jordan will get the point, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of good paper","review":"The book stinks!!! Nothing happens, time seems to have stopped. Makes me wonder why I have read it. A total waste of time, paper and money!!! The plot is boring. No battles have occured. Nothing! With Perrin whinning all the time and Egwene doing absolutely nothing!) the only interesting scene was the conversation between Rand/LT and Logain. The only good thing that happened was the appearance of Loial. Also the attack of the windfinders should have been discribed. It would have made the book much better. So I think there is no need to read the book at alll - just wait for the next book to come (if there is a next book). I really hope for a better book. CoT is worse than PoD. RJ can write much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!","review":"I came into this series about 3 years ago and was hooked. Still am. But this book was a big disappointment and a big bore. Currently Im re-reading the series to see if I can find anything at all redeeming from this book. Nothing so far.Well the best suggestion I can make is to wait till book 11 comes out then get both book 10 and 11. So that way you avoid that sick depressing feeling of having to wait another 3 years till book 11 comes out. Save yourself the heartache."},{"rating":"1","title":"A contradiction of everything that has happened.","review":"Mr. Jordan lost his way long before. I swore after Path of Daggers that I wouldn't read any more. After recieving Winter's Heart as a gift I thought I was right until the end when at least something happened. So when a friend loaned me Crossroads I read it with something approaching optimism. How wrong I was.I called this a contradiction of everything that has happened. The Dark Lord actually used to be threatening. The forces of evil used to kick ... and take names. Our beloved characters were actually threatened. Nowadays I'm less concerned about armageddon then the characters just going into meglomania fugues.Jordan has lost it. He's just squeezing every dollar he can from us sad saps. I will forgive an author I love many things. But continually putting out swill just to fatten his own pocketbook crosses the line. This series has ended for me, not in glory like it was supposed to, but in mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for paperback!!","review":"Robert Jordan is the master of re-using a phrase a thousand times!! I nearly stopped reading when I encountered the \\"folding chair\\" the Aes Sedai \\"dignity\\" and the ever present light in the world of dreams .... PUHLEASE. When this series started it was about a young man who was going through changes - now he gets a bare few chapters @ the end of the novel?? All the other events were so predictable I tried to return my book!! Hey how about some action? Robert Jordan is apprently writing this for 6th graders since he does nothing unpredictable anymore and he has no action!! If you have waited this long - wait a while longer and buy it in paperback!! This book does not belong on any best sellers list!!! I'd give it negative stars if the rating system would allow me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fork in the Road","review":"When it comes right down to it, Robert Jordan has made a choice. After writing the first 6 books of his series, Jordan realised that he had many loyal fans who would buy his next book(s) regardless of their content. Robert Jordan made a choice, between being remembered as the author of a great fast moving series of books that's main purpose was to please the fans, or, he could draw the series out as looong as he possible could, milking every dime he could from his loyal sheep. He chose the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Path of Daggers with less excitement.","review":"This is possibly the most pointless book I've ever read. It is 700 pages of eloquently written tripe that could have easily been compressed into 3 chapters at most. There is no action whatsoever and it somehow manages to end up in nearly the same place as the last book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Kind of Anticipation","review":"As someone who eagerly awaited - and bought - Crossroads of Twilight, it'd be an understatement to say how disapppointed I was. Unfortunately what made Jordan such an engaging writer and the series so addictive - the vision, the attention to detail, the rich character profiles - is fast becoming his downfall. He seems to have become lost in the minutiae and is veering away from the central elements of the plot. The fault lies as much with the Editor as the writer; both are responsible for making a book readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Jordans favor","review":"Ok folks,I'll admit the last couple of books have been a tad slow, but I have grown to honestly like these characters. It's kind of like getting a really long family letter every year or two. Jordan I believe also warned everyone that this would be a long tale simply by the words he uses to begin and end each tale about the wheel of time. I do not have a book in front of me and have forgotten the exact quote. You have to give authors credit for even writting one novel let alone a series of 10 thus far...I don't know anyone that after that many books would be fresh every chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"700 pages of nothing","review":"It's amazing, Jordan can spend years writing a book that we all hope is bringing to a close the end of an age. Yet through the first 400 pages we discover simply what everyone was up to when Rand and Nynaeve were cleansing the male source. And the remaining 300 pages, a few political issues. No threads concluded, no threads even advanced. Skip to book 11 and you probably won't even miss what happened in book 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"i loved it","review":"first of all this is an excellent book. you guys are just spoiled because of the amount of action in the first 5/6. jordan in my opinion is one of the greatest writers of all time. i will read every book in this series, over and over again, until \\"they nail shut my coffin\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"He ruined the greatest series of all time","review":"Jordan has dragged this story line so far and introduced so many damn characters that this book is akin to a blithering fools ravings. He's got so many stories going that by my count the entire book takes up less than two weeks worth of time. TWO WEEKS in 600 pages! He had captured my imagination with the early books but now I'm sick of struggling through the last three books every time he switches a story to try to find the names of the people he is describing and why they are important. Worse, I'm tired of seeing similar Aes Sedai names and trying to remember why they are important instead of hearing about their damn dresses.The man can describe things like a minstrel, but that is all he does in this book. He describes bread and grain and mud and snow and cold, meanwhile the main characters don't do ANYTHING! BOO HISS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Drivel","review":"I can not believe that this is the same author that wrote Eye of the World. This book is a complete flop. I spent 90% of the time trying to stop myself from ripping the book in half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robbed! Robbed I tell ya!","review":"I was out of work on disability this summer with a back injury that kept me in bed for weeks. After reading everything in the house, I was thrilled that book 10 was here and that it was so many pages since I had so much time on my hands. $40 and days later I ended the book feeling totally violated.Robert Jordan has truly reached a new low. If I had turned a piece of crap like this to a creative writing professor I would still be reeling from the hit to my GPA. This is truly the worse piece of fantasy fiction I have had the displeasure of slogging through.I mean, did he even READ this book? Clearly the editor didn't. RJ has become another bitter hack milking his cash cow for all its worth. After reading the review about his behavior at the book signing, its clear he's another Stephen King. What used to be his passion has become a chore. He resents the job and now the fans as well.Well, Mr. Jordan, here is one fan you won't have to worry about anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad. Very bad.","review":"Wow, what a poor excuse for a novel and WoT book. Terrible, slow, boring, horrendous...I really hope Jordan kills this series soon and gets back to his earlier writing style asap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not a novel","review":"It was an excercise in spelling strings of words that, while were syntactically correct, amounted to a negligible amount more than vaccum in deep space. Does it matter how many books in the beginning of the series I cherished, how I spent hours upon hours relishing the PLOT and the UNIQUE characters, how excited I got with cataclysmic EVENTS and sudden INSIGHTS on character DEVELOPMENT, or how the multi-layered plot lines almost DANCED in their PROGRESSION?In the end this is the singly most shameful release of a fiction book I have ever come across. I will not buy the next one until I get a chance to read it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - but eager for more","review":"As an ardent fan who re-reads the series at least once a year this was a very disappointing volume.Much of the text summarizes historical info - a waste for anyone who has read the series. Perhaps the series is getting too long?Also, very little happens. I believe Jordan is a victim of multiple plot lines - we get chunks of info about Mat, then Perrin, then Elayne, and then Egwene before a little update on Rand. There is no connection - it is like pieces of 5 books slapped together.My suggestion - merge people together so you can cover some ground or put out separate books.I will get the next volume - I hope I am not disappointed again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ergh...","review":"What the heck was Robert Jordan smoking?! Half the book is going over what exactly happened during a moment during the previous book. Only one new plotline is introduced.

Wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"the pits","review":"If I could give this book a zero, I would have. It is incrediblethat Jordan could not conclude even one of several possible adventures, i.e. Matt and Tuon, Queen of Andor, battle for the White tower, etc. Instead, we are treated to insignificant snippets of the (now) zillion story threads. OK...I didn't expect the last battle. But I did expect something and got zip."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down.","review":"Well, I have read, and re-read the WoT series a few times, and I enjoy picking out little details that I had missed the 1st time through. Unlike many readers, I had no complaint about how the series may, or may not have dragged in the last few books. But this time around it was just too much. I can understand that the WoT is in reality just one massive book, but the details that just went on and on in Crossroads of Twilight made my mind numb. Where in other WoT books I've read with a hunger because Im enjoying the story, this time I found myself just skimming the pages in hopes that something/anything, of interest happening. Im sorry, but RJ blew it this time, if I have to wait 1/2 of forever for the next book in the line, odds are I wont buy it. Hopefully Jordan and his publisher will understand they let out a disaster, and will get the next book out rapidly to try to salvage the WoT."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 bucks closer to the end","review":"As many before me have stated, the book has failed to capitalize on the promise of the previous few books. Jordan has spun such a tangled web that it takes many hundreds of pages to advance the plot minimally. Yes,things appear to be wrapping up, and I'm still excited that the finale (whever it might come) will be spectacular, but the only reason to read the book is to get that much closer to the end (which I hope will come soon!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever Read (but not finish)","review":"What is most surprising is that some people gave it 2-5 stars when it deserves less than zero.

I kept waiting for something to happen. I kept saying to myself that something would happen on the next page. I had to read the whole darn book just to make sure there wasn't some tiny bit of information to be had.Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zip.It will be a miracle if RJ can rescue the story. I'm not sure I'll bother with the rest of the books. I know I won't buy them. It simply isn't necessary to have a separate SERIES for each character, which is what he has effectively done.RJ has lost control. I do not need several pages on what people are wearing.

The Forsaken are totally ineffective, the Black Ajah are inept, Aes Sedai in general act like a pack of dysfunctional little girls, the Sea Folk continue their incessant whining, and nobody seems to have even noticed that the taint was removed from saidar in the previous book.

For Shai'tan's sake, finish the series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless from cover to cover","review":"Some people have said that this book focuses on developing the characters rather than action, but all Jordan really gives us is trite navel gazing and the endless regurgitation of his limited array of character traits and descriptive phrasings (aparently all Aes Sedai share one collective hive-mind consisting mostly of icy stares and dress-smoothing). Nothing at all happens, you could probably just read the last few pages and get the same effect. I'm probably not going to finish the series after this, I can't blame Jordan for milking the series for a bit of money, but this offering of mostly filler is just plain insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","review":"If you seriously follow the series, you might want to skip this one all together. It is definitely not up to par with the other books. It fact in reading this book, one gets the feeling that the only reason for this one was to draw the series out even more.

You aren't the only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nynaeve tugs her [blank]","review":"You would have to be crazy to read this.

Even though the first couple of books were good to very good, this one was so painfully awful that I wish I had never read any of them. If you have read the other nine books in the series do not read this one. It will severely taint your view of Robert Jordan.There have been only a handful of books or movies that I have not finished, this being one of them. I got within twenty pages of finishing the book and I just stopped. It was that bad.There has never been a fantasy book that has spent so many pages on how people were dressed.

As a school teacher, I had a real problem with reading at night. I read quickly, but I am one of those unfortunate souls who is incapable of stopping reading once having begun. That, thanks to the 10th installment of The Wheel of Time series, has been cured...I'm snoring within 10 minutes of opening the book. What amazes me is considering the investment...here in Canada, these novels sell for $50 each. This means I have invested $500 into a set of novels that may possibly never end...It is time for Jordan to either knock a couple spokes out of the wheel of time, or add three more wheels, pop into 4X4, and make something happen. The wheel of time might keep turning, but I will be waiting for paper back tracks from now on. With this book in particular, however, Jordan has found the best cure for insomnia since sleeping pills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of Boredom","review":"Now I have been a huge fan of the WOT series. Books 1-6 were absolutely awesome. After \\"Lord of Chaos\\" the series started to die down. \\"Crown of Swords\\" was an ok addition, \\"Path of Daggers\\" started the slow movement of the plot, \\"Winters Heart\\" almost brought the story to a standstill, but with this new addition \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" RJ has brought the WOT series to an all time low. This book contained 678 pages of pointless detail. The highpoints in this book as far as im concerned were Mat's brief encounters with the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and Rands VERY brief appearances. To summarize you could read about three chapters of this book and still know enough not to be lost when the next one comes out. And since RJ is taking his sweet time releasing these you can expect the next one some time in 2007!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overambitious, self-indulgent drivel","review":"Most of the other reviews I've read have restored some of my faith in human intelligence and literary savvy, and I am in full agreement with the consensus; this novel reeks of the self-indulgence of its author and offers very little to anyone but an incredibly narrow niche of readers with a penchant for underdeveloped, overly complex plots. This book labors over minutia that adds almost nothing to the story line, and the number of characters that are introduced or re-introduced is simply prohibitive. Brevity is the soul of wit, Mr. Jordan, and a better author could have (or perhaps should have?) compressed this book into 150 pages without losing any plot depth or detail that actually enhances the novel as a whole. It's a shame that the quality of this series has degraded so much over it's lifespan; the only reason why this review gives one star is that zero is not an option....."},{"rating":"1","title":"therapy","review":"Reading the reviews here has become a form of therapy.

Listening to others describe their disgust with WOT is so reaffirming.Robert Jordan's series has become the Titanic of American Literature; once filled with promise but now a pitiable heap at the bottom of many a landfill.Honest readers will admit there were clues to Jordan's poor writing even in the first books; mainly final chapters packed with rushed, super-extra-action! and female characters ALWAYS described the same way, (braid tugging, etc.)I feel sorry for Robert Jordan because he undoubtably reads the Amazon reviews. As do all his peers, friends and family. One-and-a-half stars after 1,800 reviews is a monumental humiliation.Please, Mr. Jordan, finish this series ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Did you ever get the feeling that you were getting taken advantage of? Buying this book made me feel that I had not only been a party to the destruction of some remote rainforest for the amount of paper used but I also joined a growing club of disappoined readers the world over.When I first picked up the paperback of Eye of the World I couldnt put it down, the next 3 books after that I couldnt wait for the paperback I absolutely had to have the book as soon as it came out.The story was engrosing, it captured me and wouldnt let me go and it left me wanting more.Unfortunetly with this book I wanted less, so much less aimless wandering, so much less blabbering.I think we deserved a hell of a lot more for waiting 12 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited breathlessly for this?","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said by another reviewer? Shouldn't we be heading toward a conclusion by now? Please say yes Mr. Jordan, because I really want to continue enjoying the Wheel of Time series. But the good will that was gained up through book 7 can't last much longer.As Tolkien demonstrates, brevity and conciseness are often as valuable as attention to detail, even when creating a world and writing a series of epic scope.P.S. Am I the only person who's edition contained sentences with random words missing and paragraphs that seemed at times to have entire sentences missing? Turn the grammar check on Bob; or, better yet, get the next book to the publisher in time for an editor to give it a quick run through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abominable","review":"Even given the ever slowing pace of the Wheel of Time books, I was staggered at the tempo to which Robert Jordan has managed to slow in this latest installment. If it wasn't for some of his stylistic hallmarks (or should I say mannerisms) I would even doubt that the first book and the tenth were written by the same man. And if the ending of book nine gave promise that the effort needed to persevere with the previous three or four books might actually be rewarded, as I progressed with book ten those hopes were quickly drowned in tears of boredom. Eventually I had to adopt a special reading style, which was more akin to scanning, in order to spare my mental faculties, but to be honest I think one could read this book upside down without missing anything of importance.It is a great shame that a story which started off so well should have come to this and I'm sorry to say that Mr Jordan has thoroughly lost the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"impatient reader, ZERO STARS","review":"Mr. Jordan, I hope you at least peruse these reviews because the WOT series has crashed like the stock market, book 10 has burst the bubble. I just finished it yesterday and it was so uninteresting. We really don't need to know the names of every character in the room in any particular meeting or whatever, those pages could be used for killing off some of those extraneous factions or getting more countries in line. It has become convoluted with all the side plot twists, there's so much going on that it will be difficult to tie up into everyone getting ready for tarmon gai'don, which should be a book in itself since it's supposed to be an epic battle. I'd hate for someone else to be finishing this series or for it to just be abandoned. I hope to see the next book out within a year, six months would be better. And, either get things going towards the end or start killing characters off without bringing them back so the plot can progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAH!","review":"I've slogged through nearly half of this book and I turned to the reviews instead (which are much more amusing and a better use of time). At the risk of repeating what *everyone* else is saying, Mr. Jordan, Can You Finish It Already?It's not just that the cast of characters has swollen to include the tiniest thread of plot; they are all the same! All the women are short tempered harpies! All the men fret about what harpies the women are!Deep breath. I truly enjoyed the first four novels in this series. I would even maybe read them again. But is it just me or is RJ trying to ride the WOT gravy train?I will not spend anymore money on this author or his series.Check out Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin. It's turning out to be long too but at least things *happen* in his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord Almighty","review":"Remember after Dumai's Wells: \\"Bend Knee before the Lord Dragon\\"? how the man escaped from the box ... I had a chest full of fire on my way to the three on three tournament after finishing that book. Word is bond..Or how about when the girls first started running through the dream world and spying that witch Moghedien where ever they went. Then good ol Birgitte showed up with the hunchback. Those were the days. When callandor was snatched by a band of Aiel and Matt saved a bunch of pissy Aes Sedai. And Rhuidean. The horn and the battle in the sky. Man I thought Ishmael was the dark one for the longest time. he was cool.But I can't stand the women anymore. I haven't met too many women who glare and smooth random fabric, but if I did, I'd beat them to the ground and get arrested -- howling all the way that Jordan made me do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a way to make this a negative star review?","review":"The series started well, tailed off, and now has the same literary quality as the back of a box of Cheerios. All the women are the same character with different names (and different dresses, we can't forget the dresses!). Nothing happens until the very end, and when something does happen it only opens up another possible storyline for books 11-56. If this series ends before triple-digit volume numbers, I'll be astonished.I refuse to buy the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't Robert Jordan Made enough money off this series yet?","review":"After reading the first book in this series i became entranced. I flew through book after book taking less than two weeks each. Then I hit book eight and it was like hitting a wall. I think it took me around a month to finish eight, nine and ten. The books didnt gradual become boring, they intantaneously became akin to watching paint dry. This might seem like exageration to someone who has not read the last few books however I assure you it is not. Jordan spent more pages describing the attire and the moods of every single character, no matter how insignificant, than on developing the story.Book eight was a major dissapointment to me, and when I finally finished it I prayed to god book nine would be better. But it wasnt, and therefore I prayed to god that book ten would be better. But it wasn't.In my opinion this series is only seven books long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Robert Jordan","review":"You suck. This book sucks. Thanx for ruining a good series by selling out and dragging it into oblivion. Hope all the money you made justifies ruining what could have been one of the greatest works of literature in Science-Fiction/Fantasy history. Instead you have more money for producing 10, 11, 15 books instead of 7 good ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of Mediocrity","review":"First, I have to say that it's well-written, with consistent characters.Unfortunately, it's well-written boredom. I waited impatiently for this book, and was rewarded with something I had to trudge through. Rereading it doesn't help. Rereading the series doesn't make this book any better - but it does make the rest of them look very good.I'll probably still buy the next book, because I do want to know what happens next... but I'm still very, very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake Me Up Please","review":"Wake me up when Mr. Jordan decides what the ending of his book will be. I am one of the millions of people hooked on this series, yet I just spent 700 pages hoping that something important would happen. The only thing that kept me turning the pages was the hope of the elusive plot twist visting me on the next page. I can't help but think that the author doesn't know what direction he would like to take with his characters. I really think that the intelligence of his readers was insulted by this thinly veiled excuse for literature. You could have skipped this book in the series and then had someone explain who \\"Tuon\\" is, and you would be all set for the 11th book in the series. Or is it the 17th??? I forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time.","review":"Absolutely horrible. If you are a detail freak then world eat your heart out. The book was too drawn out, too many details for too little to happen. Robert Jordan is the ONLLY author I know who can write 600+ pages and have little more than a month turn in his book. If you want to read a protracted series where events actually happen turn your attention to Janny Wurts' \\"Alliance of Light\\". Right now Robert Jordan is gouging all of us for money. If you really need to read this book, wait for your local library to get it in, request it, put it on order through your library, beg them for it. But don't spend your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Robert Jordan gone senile","review":"Despite the waning of this series, \\"The Wheel of Time\\" has consistently provided; believable characters, thick and rich detail, well thought out development, well paced action, and an amazing world parallel to our lives but with enchanting differences. Crossroads of Twilight has NONE of that. The characters feel stale, and uninteresting. The detail that Jordan had so mastered was taken to excruciating levels. I couldn't stand reading through four pages about what the feel of the camp and the inside of a tent was. After it was already introduced!Each of the characters separate plot lines lead to nothing. No form of resolution, no answers to previous questions, and tedious new questions.Ether Robert Jordan is trying to sap every last dime out of this series, he has the worst case of writers block ever (despite almost 700 pages 0 content!), or he is senile.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK UNTELL THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT. Then make sure that one is not trip either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have wrapped the series up 5 books ago","review":"The beginning 3 or 4 books were quite good with interesting storylines and ideas. Unfortunately the series was dragged out beyond good story-telling. I am not surprised since it is on the bestseller list, but I am surprised a lot of people are still buying the book (I borrowed it from the library and did not find it interesting enough to read the whole book). The story has been dragging, nothing much is happening, the characters are non-descript and boring. I wish it was wrapped up 5 books ago and this could have been a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic..... ALL FILLER!","review":"Everything that happened in this latest installment could have been written in two chapters. NOTHING HAPPENED!Robert Jordan has definitely fallen in love with his characters... and lost total sight of telling a story. He has probably a couple hundred characters now in this story.... so it is easy to see how he can write over 600 pages of filler/fluff/psuedo character development.Enough already! I'm not sure how he is going to salvage the mess he has created. He has turned one of (if not the) best fantasy stories into a never ending saga to create more and more characters. Enough characters already..... Mr Jordan needs to get back to TELLING A STORY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still standing at the Crossroads","review":"Believe the other one star reviews. Honestly, you could skip this book, read the next one and pick up right where you left off [from book 9]. I still think Robert Jordan is a good writer and his attention to detail is astounding, but that attention to detail is what's slowing the series down. I don't want to read a page devoted to describing how a person walks into a tent or what their dress looks like. Things that could be sufficiently summed up in a couple sentences are instead getting multiple paragraphs. Add to that weaving in new characters for additional subplots and our original characters are only in about half the book. One has to wonder if RJ is just prolonging the series for more profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was (and still is) a very boring book","review":"I am still trying to wade through this book. I am only on page 70 and it has been at least a month and a half since I began. In the past I have finished these books off in a week or so. Something \\"something\\" seems to be putting me to sleep before I can read 2 pages, and I am having difficulty taking any time out to read this book. I think Robert needs to get working on some action \\"very soon\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 years of waiting for horse [poop]","review":"If I had the chance to meet RJ I'd have only one question for him... No, nothing about the charecters that were and still are great.. No, I'd ask him why I should even bother to continue to read this saga. maybe, Just maybe, if he took the last 200 pages of POd and the last 200 pages of WH, and nothing at all from this latest book, then maybe he would have came up with a book worthy of my money and more importantly time. The sad truth is we'll still buy the hard covers and make this clown more millions... I wonder if he has even read what he's been putting out... truly a sad case for what started off so brilliantly"},{"rating":"1","title":"More characters and little substance!","review":"I have enjoyed this series since it started, but I should have catalogued all the characters Jordan has created in the previous books so I could understand who and what I am encounting in the newest one. He seems to be more facinated with creating more players and devsing neat names than telling a tale. With the long time span between novels it requires someone with great memory power to remember all the players and all the subplots. And this book is just a review of the activitiess of the secondary characters rather than an advance in the plot line. At this time, I am reading it more for commitment to a task than for enjoyment, and if the next one is just another \\"run in place\\" segment, I am not sure if I will buy it. I am losing interest in the series because it is becoming too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers abused for plot convenience!","review":"The ratings are fair for this insulting book. I will only criticize the most appalling of the flaws. To create anticipation for the next book in the series, Jordan completely changes the personality of a key character. The particular character had always been portrayed as cautious, wise and intelligent. Jordan changes this character to being stupid, careless and impetuous. This is hack writing at a level worse than the pap you see on TV! I have been able to forgive the flaws in the other books in the series because Jordan had given me enough in each book for me to keep reading. Completely changing the established personality of a key character just to advance a sub-plot and create interest for the next in the series is unforgivable! Do not start the Wheel of Time series and, definitely, quit before you read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointly SLOW","review":"I must give this last attempt at continuing this epic tale a very low rating.The book drags on for over 800 pages and fails to tie up of the long threads of this very twisted plot and just goes on to add to more of the \`pseudo mysteries' that plague this series.The descriptions of attire and scenery have become all too trite and contribute very little to furthering the main plot of the story.Disappointing and SLOW is all I can think to say of this episode of a saga I am beginning to get very tired of."},{"rating":"1","title":"jordan wtf","review":"This was by far the worst book in the series to date. It felt like all of the characters were simply treading water and nothing new was happening. Not enough Mat, Perrin and Rand to satisfy me. Rand got a chapter and change; unacceptable. While reading this book i felt like Jordan was just trying make as much money as he could off the series by putting out a book where nothing really happened. I am also very tired of the whole women against men theme. Very weird/useless/annoying to have to read. Makes you wonder what kind of man Jordan is ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"No ending.","review":"I recently discovered the Wheel of Time series and avidly read all ten volumes. I am decidedly less than pleased to find I wasted my money on a series which has no end. The 10th book was printed in 2003 and it did not end the series. No warning was given that it is not the last book in the series and that another book(s???) is to come (Who knows when?) Very irritating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one.","review":"I am a huge fan of the series but this was painful. There is no reason to read this one as it does nothing to advance the main plot lines. It takes two thirds of the book just to get to the point in time where that last book ended. You really can skip this and not be lost at all on the main plot line. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad sad sad sad SAD","review":"Well, 2 things to note.1 - It's sad that Jordan mucked things up so badly. There's 1944 reviews on here that average out to 1.5 stars. Sad when the early books got 4 to 4.5 stars.2 - reading the reviews of people who hate what this series has become is better than reading almost any book.Now... all that hate has to come from somewhere.... where does it come from?OH YEAH I KNOW! IT COMES FROM ALL THE READERS HE'S BETRAYED!Finish this farce man! End it! Bugger the prequels and get on with finishing this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already!","review":"I just finished this latest installment of the broken wheel of time. It doesn't go anywhere! How often do we need to hear about dresses being straightened, sisters with bad attitudes and ageless faces?? All this was setup books ago in this plodding series. I admit that I am hooked. Maybe just a hopeless optimist. But the book should resolve something, but never does. No bad guys killed or love interests brought together, or battles fought. Can't we just at least get rid of Elaida? Or maybe save Faile? Frustration is the word that describes this book. Now I hear there is a Prequel out! Why waste time on that when the main story isn't close to being done?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Paper, Time, Effort, etc. etc. etc","review":"A recent positive review compared this series to a chess match, moving all the pieces in place.What a load of tripe! This would have to be the slowest, longest, poorest played chess match in history.If you like endless description of what the characters are wearing, with little if any plot advancement, then this book is for you. Or if you want to read pages detailing the washing of silk (Who on earth reading a novel wants this?), read on brave reader. Perhaps an aid to sleep is what this book really should be marketed as.If you want to read great fantasy (as opposed to poor) read George RR Martin. There's honestly no comparison. Martin's work, as opposed to this mess, is focused, dramatic, exciting, has evolving characters, and is fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you certain Jordan still lives?","review":"He's either senile or dead. No creater would allow a good series like this one go to hell-in-a-handbasket. I figure his kids are churning out the books while he rots or drools on himself. This cash-cow has long since dried up. I could write better than this and I stink on ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Just Say...","review":"...that I love to read. I'm hooked on fantasy, and Robert Jordan was the one that got me hooked. I devoured the first nine books in three months, and by the ending of book nine(which I loved...the ending, that is) I was so excited for CoT. I bought the hardcover as soon as it came out, not wanting to wait...yea, never doing that again.I got to the start of Egweene's part and stopped. I could not stand it anymore...almost the whole book takes place during the chapter of the last book!!! Like, what the heck?? Trust me, you'll not miss anything by not reading the book...I couldn't even remember who have the characters were by the time I started reading it anyway.So take it from me, I'll read book 11...but I'm for sure waiting until it comes out in soft cover...I could of bought something MUCH better with that 45 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"let it end...please","review":"Oh...my...god...Around book three in the series (the last book to actually be any good) I thought \\"I guess he'll wind it up at 10 or so. That's a good number for a series.\\"Well, considering the total and complete lack of progress the past 3 books, add the introduction of a host of new characters, a whole other side of the world, the impending doom of the last battle, and a prequel SERIES, and I can only beg a merciful and forgiving god to end it someday.Like other reviewers have written: I give up. If and when Jordan is done collecting his paychecks, and the series ends (preferably with the White Tower broken, Asha'man running rampant in the streets, Rand a babbling lunatic, and the world torn asunder) I will read the cliffs notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"At the crossroads","review":"This book is rated 1.5 stars. That's too high for trash like this. It hurts me a little to make that comment, being an avid WOT fan and all, but it's the brutal truth. By now whoever's reading this has probably heard about the flaws of this book so I won't go into great detail on the matter. Instead I'll just give a short summary of the problems: 1 dimensional characters, stalled plot, uninteresting scenario's and an overall sense of bordom are what make this book so terrible. Literally nothing happens. I don't care to speculate on why Robert Jordan's works have declined so much in quality over the past few years, it's really not important. The fact is once he was a great writer, now he's not. Like many of Jordan's long time fan's, I'll definetly think about whether or not I'll pick up the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"waste of time\\"","review":"don't buy the \\"the waste of time\\", book 10.it's the lastest instalment of more junk from robert jordon who should have ended the series with book 3 or 4.but hey, he's run out of ideas and wants to cash in on stupid people like me who eagerly bought up those early trade backs/hardcovers (which were worth every penny) and want closure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a more boring book out there?","review":"To anyone who hasn't read this book, and is a Jordan fan :save your time and money, just wait for the next book. nothing happens in this book. Read it only if you have sleeping problems. Five pages before bedtime, and you are out cold for the night. This book should have been minimized to a couple of chapters in the series, not turned into a full novel.Mr. Jordan has failed spectacularly with this book. Maybe the next one will be better ( nah...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the cliff's notes instead","review":"Robert Jordan has created an immensely detailed world as a setting for this series. This book keeps you up to date on a daunting number of those details in the many widely separated venues he has created, spending several long chapters on each one. He does not resolve or significantly progress any of the plot lines, with the possible exception of developments with Tuon and a (truly) last-minute plot twist. The nearly 700 page tome could be summarized in about 15 pags of notes. My advice is to wait for book 11, and only read this one if you're a true die-hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much promise, so little delivered.","review":"Crossroads of Twilight is the culmiation of all Jordan fan fears. It's filled with Jordans overdescriptiveness, with no real plot advancement. I'm sorry to say that this is not what his readers were hoping for during the LONG wait for this book. It seems Jordan has started to care more about the $$ then providing his readers with the action packed, involved, wonderful world that hooked his loyal fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"It is obvious that Robert Jordan doesn't have any passion for this series any more. Skip this series and pick up a real one. George RR Martin's Fire and Ice series puts this one to shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Endless Waiting.","review":"If this is the crossroads, then the roads stretch out in both directions forever. The plot is not advanced an iota. Nada. After the semi-cliffhanger of book nine (Rand unconcious, source clean, maybe, etc) I was really hoping for something to happen, some questions to be answered, some plot/character development. I was sorely dissapointed. Really, I think this book has put me off the series entirely. After books 7, 8, and this one, there just doesn't seem any point. At this rate, we might see the end of the series by the year 3000. Is Jordan getting paid per word?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME AND PAPER!!!","review":"The truth about this book; you have a 600 page book that has about 200 pages of dialogue and 400 pages of superfluous description. Jordan really has lost control of his plot and his editors should know better than to let him get away with publishing this tripe. There is no character development, almost no plot development, no real storyline. The reader is introduced to a maelstrom of confusion and disjointed thoughts of the author. The simple fact is that this book could have been shorted by two-thirds and then rewritten to actually go somewhere, heck anywhere. Save yourself some money ignore this book and skip to the next one. Maybe someone will put Jordan over their knee and knock some sense into him. I've been reading Jordan since the late 80's when I was in high school. As of this book he has officially lost a fan. I will finish out the series because I'm hooked, but then will never read him again."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to kill a great series...","review":"This has been one of the best series ever written up until Crossroads. How can absolutely nothing happen in close to 700 pages? The only explanation I can come up with is that Jordan is trying to stretch this series out for another 10 books. Well he has successfully killed this series for me. I won't be reading anymore and I would strongly suggest not reading Crossroads. It's a complete waste of time. It was downright boring throughout. Usually Jordan at least finishes the book with some excitement. Not this time. Boring, Boring and even more Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had enough!!!!","review":"I'll keep this short. Hundreds of pages of fluff. Lengthy unnecessary descriptions. Nothing happens. The plot isn't advanced. The book isn't worth buying even at a discount. For me the series is over. I'm never reading another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Unecessary","review":"Waste of time. There is not character development and not plot development. There is no reason for this book. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"another disappointing jordan book","review":"Robert Jordan's newest Wheel of Time novel, Crossroads of Twilight just can't keep my interest. The first few books in the series were well written and full of new ideas. Now that Jordan is finally starting to tie things up (a relief), he is unable to maintain the excitement of previous work. He has so many different plot lines that he is keeping track of and such a high level of intensity in all of them that it is difficult to care about any of them. The characters that were stubborn in the beginning are still stubborn now. They have developed in skill and experience but not in wisdom, and that adds to the problem. Why care about characters that are always the same? What is noble or worth admiring in a character that does not grow? If you want a good read, I suggest you try the Robert Jordan. If you read this series anyway, you are likely to get hooked, like me and just have to finish it despite your better judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"crossroads of twilight","review":"If you miss this addition to the Wheel of Time series don't worry, nothing much happens in the book anyway! I am sad that yet agian Mr. Jordan has failed agian to move the series forward. I was so enthralled by the first 7 books and have been waiting for story development to continue. I am still waiting. It seems Mr. Jordan has lost interest in this series and is perhaps contracted to provide books for the series whether he has more to add to the story or not.The relationships between the characters that made this series so great have become lost in the details. The wait was not worth it and I personally have lost interest in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with it already","review":"I couldn't put the first book in this series down. That has not been the case as the series progresses, or, in the case of this book, hardly moves at all. It was amazing to me that Robert Jordan could spend almost 700 pages with nothing happening! He could have shown us the decisions these characters made in a chapter each. Since book 2, it has been true that each book only contains one major event, but this one didn't even have that! I'm getting so disgusted with the series that I may wait until it ends and buy only the last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORELY disappointing","review":"I opened the book with relish and began reading, in hopes that the previously flagging story line would pick up and fly again. Sadly, that didn't happen. I moped from page to uninteresting page and characters talked and dithered and talked some more.Nothing truly interesting happens in this book. I have stopped feeling for the characters that seemed realistic in earlier books. In this latest installment of the Wheel of Time, the characters seem to be going through motions like mediocre actors in desparate need of a break.Possibly the worst insult is that Rand, The Dragon Reborn, (and supposed main character for the series) doesn't not appear until page 529! Even then, the reader does not stay with him for more than a handful of pages. Whatever happened to \\"show, don't tell\\"?Steer clear of this one, folks, and find a book worth spending your time upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow train coming....","review":"Hi!This is not fun! i have been waiting for this book so long and nothing is happen.

This book is linking the lives of the characters that have been scattered so that readers can follow more clearly. Although I wanted and was expecting some sort of important event to occur, in truth that would just be giving us a plot line instead of telling the story with skill.This book leaves a lot of loose ends that need to be tied and therefore the next book will surely make up for what this one lacks. Also Jordan's writing ability is also amazing and deserves credit in itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak effort","review":"More than 600 pages of people in bad moods not doing much. Mr. Jordan needs to re-read his earlier work and remember that a book should have a point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of BORING!","review":"I am extremely disappointed with this book. Robert Jordan has merely produced 700 pages of filler without furthering the story. It was not exciting. In fact, it was dull. The wheel of time did not turn at all with this installment. How much more nothing can I take? Jordan is just producing words to cash in on the readers that fell in love with the beginning of the series. \\"There are neither beginnings, nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time.\\" How true..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loyal fan, hoping against hope...","review":"I too have been reading this series since the beginning. After finishing this book, I may not bother anymore. I definitely won't set aside the time to read the book before checking out the review - like so many have very limited time for pleasure reading, and this book was not a pleasure.Mat and Tuon were interesting, but do you think you kidnap the heir to the Seanchan throne and she just goes along with it? Someing just doesn't jive.Perrin and Fayle and Berelain - I don't even care anymore.I was frustrated when I was halfway through the book and realized that most of the plot entry points were BEFORE Rand cleansed the saidin. Come on, at least get FURTHER than the last book!No new characters until you figure out what the ones you have are up to! I would not recommend this book to anyone but the most hardcore Jordan fan, and it seems there are fewer and fewer of us.I will not buy the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah boring...","review":"Blah Blah, we had some tea. We took a hot bath. Ok, the first 1-6 (or 7) books were fine, but this like 8 and 9 (at least some of it) are PLODDING. I mean really, do we need the detail of them taking a hot bath and having tea with honey in it? Shoot just about the only detail we don't get is them using the latrine or outhouse or whatever.I hate to say it, but this just isn't up to par and I can't believe that his *editors* haven't told him that. While I enjoy the detail that makes his world so real this is way over the top.Message to Robert Jordan: get new editors and pick up the pace. Given the slow pace here, I hope he has the plot written down somewhere so his great-grandchild can finally finish it at book 208."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Hell Jordan!!!!","review":"Jordan has wasted another 800 hundred pages. After such a long wait for this book I was very disappointed when I finished it. The story has moved forward very slightly but it looks like Jordan needs at least another 10 books before we are any where near the end of this story. I suspect by that time even the dark one himself would have lost interest, never mind us mere mortals."},{"rating":"1","title":"More build up","review":"First I would like to say that I had to give at least one star. I couldn't give it a zero. It deserves a zero. I can't give any plot points away, because nothing happened. Every character is in the same basic situation at the end as in the beginning. I think just about anybody could have written the same thing for this book. All of the characters go on a path that could have been easily skipped over as stuff that happened between books and did not need to be written. The only reason for this book to be out is so that the series wouldn't be forgotten. I doubt a good fantasy series like this would be forgotten. I think it would have been better for this book to have not been written. It was written and tarnishes the image of an otherwise very good series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother Buying It","review":"In the beginning, the Wheel of Time books were fast-paced, rich with character development, and presented a nice admixture of themes from Tolkien, Herbert, and other great authors. But alas, the wheel turns, and the well has run dry. There is hardly any plot to speak of in this book, and the repetition of inane musings and descriptive phrases (smoothing the folds of a dress, tugging at a shawl, etc.) is enough to drive one to distraction. In effect, upon finishing the book, everything about the Wheel of Time universe seems two-dimensional and trite. Perhaps the copy editors at Tor have been told to leave Jordan's writing untouched, or maybe Jordan just hammered through writer's block for the sake of meeting his deadlines. Whatever the reason, you're wasting your time and your money if you buy/read this book. For that matter, hold off on any early purchases of the 11th book until you see more positive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book of series, totally out of line with series","review":"First I have to say that I LOVE this series! However, This book is so off the map, wierd characters and just a knock off that it pissed me off, It seems a book that just got published to sell from his name alone.However, the book after this, with the conclusion is Awesome. I will miss Robert Jordan. god rest his soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"Don't bother to read it. You can skip the entire book and only miss one or two events. Or get the book from the library and read the last 30 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why should New Spring be any different?","review":"It's been at least 3 books and 2000 pages since anything has actually happened to advance the plot of the Wheel of Time. Why should this book be any different?At least you can get these things really really really cheap if you wait 6 months and look on half.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"He lost me after book 7","review":"Why do you all keep wasting good money on this puke? The series started out great and I hungrily read one book after another then the story got weak, then it got pathetic, then it just ground to a halt. The good news is I knew enough not to buy book 9 or 10. After looking at these reviews, I can see I made the right choice. So did the series finally end or is it still running on and on like bad case of diarrhea?"},{"rating":"1","title":"why read this book????","review":"Why read this book....It answers no new questions. Most books have a beginning and end. Will this book ever be completed. I will not be buying another sequel for it does nothing. Don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, 1400 pages of practically nothing","review":"With the exception of Elayne getting pregnant and Rand cleansing the male part of the source, nothing happened in the LAST book either. All this book does is introduce so many meaningless characters that Mr. Jordan has run out of original names. They are all beginning to be the same, save for a letter missing or one or two letters transposed. I was SO disappointed. Trust me, you can skip this book and read the next one without missing a beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lagniappe (that means something extra...which in this case is not good!)","review":"blah blah blah blah blah....all this guy does for the last few books is waste our time and steal our money. End this damn series already. I love the first few books and then he just starts taking forever to go anywhere with the plot. It's like a tree that never gets trimmed, with new branches sprouting and growing wild. He keeps adding new elements to the story but never ends anything, so it just keeps expanding with no ending....EVER!!!!!!!!! My dad always joked that Jordan would die before this story ever saw an end, and now he did. Jordan thanks for ruining one of the best series ever in order to fatten your damn pockets by dragging this crap out endlessly!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wheel of Time (Book 10) \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\"","review":"The story just pulls you in and holds you until the very end.Like the other books in this series, I look forward to the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story progress is unforgiveably slow. Don't waste your time!","review":"Jordan must want to drag this series to 1000 books. There is no progress in the storyline in this book. I enjoyed the first 5 books in this series but they got progressively slower in advancing the story. I hoped the story would eventually reach some kind of conclusion, but now I have lost all hope. I was extremely disappointed by this book, so I am writing my first review to prevent further agony. This is the worst book I have ever read. I'll never buy a book by Jordan again. Try the Ice Wind Trilogy by Salvatore to get a book with action and a reasonable conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Finish It","review":"Like so many others before him Mr Jordan gets to a certain point in the story and begins to write fill. No substance just filling pages. I notice this with Terry Brooks as well. This is really unfortunate, as it kills the reading excitement and you begin to lose interest. I'm sure this is a money thing to stretch the story into as many books as possible, but enough already. It may be Mr Jordan's purpose in life to write this never ending saga, but it is not my purpose to read it. I'm finished with the wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"For God's sake, get on with it!","review":"I absolutely loved the first few books in the series. Then I started to get tired of waiting for some of the story lines to continue. The characters, after all, are so complex and have so much going on. So I got one book, then another, then another - and finally realized that Jordan is milking this for all it's worth! He's never going to resolve anything because he's making too much money stretching it out, and stretching it out, and stretching it out...... Could we have a little more action instead of pages and pages of bland, totally unnecessary descriptions and feelings, please? This is finally it for me. I will not buy another book of his in this series. I'll miss the characters, but it won't be nearly as bad as having to read through 100 pages of drivel per scene! Hey Robert - good premise, but you're losing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money...","review":"I give up! I'm not going to bother reading another Wheel of time book until the series is complete (if that ever happens). I have read over 600 pages so far and absolutely nothing has happened. Actually, \\"read\\" is a little strong... I began skimming pages after page 300 or so.The first four or five books in this series were really good. Good enought to keep me, and many others, coming back for more. Even after reading THOUSANDS of pages of neverending gibberish, I had faith that at some point it would turn around. HA! The joke is on me!This series has become an absolute disaster. What a shame for something that had so much potential. At this point, I can't even imagine how Jordan will bring it to an end. For that matter, I have ceased to care..."},{"rating":"1","title":"To 'Only for the enlightened'","review":"I am dissappointed in the reviews which critizes those of us who dislike this book. I read a review titled 'Only for the enlightened' which refers to everyone who dislikes the book as 'simpletons'. To that reader, I would like to make a point. If you chose to actually read the negative reviews, its not all about readers whining about the lack of 'hack and slash' action. The readers are complaining about lack of closure, every expanding storyline, redundant details, useless details, lack of face time for the main characters, unbelievable storylines, storyline progression, character development,.....etc. Many of the reviews are different from each other and far from simple. Just because someone disagrees with your opinion does not make them simpletons....that makes you arrogant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted wanting","review":"When this book first came out in hardcover I waited...and bought the paperback. Now I'm really glad I didnt pay the exorbitant price of the hardcover. The speed of this 10th book is nothing at all compared to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd books.... it's slow! It all started going downhill for me starting from the 8th book. The characters are tedious now and although once I was fascinated by all the strong female characters in the series, now I'm tired of all their scheming and whining- the dirty looks... it's just plain annoying now. And I'm not even done reading the book yet! I find I'm having a hard time getting myself to finish reading the book. It's been so long since I've read the last book and who are all these new characters anyways?? It's getting too confusing and boring to read!I'm not sure if I will buy the next one... I think I'm gonna go and read the old ones again.. at least those books were fun to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The wheel of time turns and ages come and go...","review":"Truer words have never been spoken. Somebody please shoot me.I decided after Lord of Chaos that I would continue buying into this crappy series only if the next book (Crown of Swords?) was the last one. Hahaha - how happy am I that I made that vow instead of being like the poor suckers saying 'maybe book 12 will pick up and tie it all together'. Poor sadsack, deluded, readers.We'll all be dead before Jordan (or should I say Satan!) finishes this dull, pathetic series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm tugging my braid","review":"This book stinks. I really enjoyed the series for the most part, although things started to seem pretty pointless in places beginning with \\"Crown of Swords\\". I thought the ending of \\"Winters Heart\\" was absolutely spectacular, and it really excited me about this book (the next in the series). However, this book was a total let down. It totally defused the climax of the last book since NOTHING HAPPENS. Ok, stuff happens, but it doesn't advance the plot, it just stalls it. Endless new side plots, worthless new characters.Personally, I don't care how long Robert Jordan takes to wrap up this series. HOWEVER, advance the plot, you jerk. If it takes five more books to tie everything together and end it, then so be it. But start tying it up. It's time to end side branches, bring people together, and stop introducing new characters and plot lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I used to love the WOT series and recommended it to all my friends, but I can't recommend this book at all.Basically, nothing happens, the plot isn't advanced at all. You can basically skip this book and read the next one and not miss a beat, so why pay the money and suffer the tedium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this installment of WoT","review":"This installment of WoT was totally forgettable. In fact, I may have read this book twice without any hint of recollection. I think fans of this series can safely skip this book without any loss of continuity. If you absolutely need to read it for yourself then simply skip to the last chapters featuring Perrin, Mat, and Egwene. These three chapters contain ALL of the plot developments. As for the rest of the chapters:* Elayne and Rand do nothing.* There are no battles.* Nothing important happens to any major characters.The good news is that an editor/author will make a truly great work some day by producing an abridged/plagiarized version of this story. Just three volumes, 1500 pages, and non-stop action. This will be the fantasy classic that will be read by generations to come. Too bad Jordan/TOR let go of the reins and allowed greed to run rampant over an extremely promising storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stop RJ just stop","review":"For the love of god, please stop writing! This series should have ended three books ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Wheel of Time turns...\\" SLOWLY","review":"Reading this book was amoung the most boring events that have occured in my life. I picked up this book, spending ten dollars of my own hard-earned money, expecting a fast paced and action packed read. I was terribly wrong.This book is potentially interesting... for those of you who are interested in nothing aside from tea and the exact array of every individual thread on every dress.To be blunt, this book sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sitting at the crossroads.... still","review":"Yes, this is indeed the worst book I have ever read.Sad really. Once upon a time, (5? 6? books ago? and quite a few bucks) I would have considered R. Jordan one of my favourite authors. Now, I would have more pride in carrying a Mills and Boon or even Time-travel-historical-romance novel around and recommending it to my friends.We should apply for a protection order to prevent him ever again publishing a word."},{"rating":"1","title":"uhhhh","review":"I started \\"reading\\" this series of books about 2 weeks before Robert Jordan passed away. At that time I was on the second book and was disappointed that he wouldn't be finishing the story. I've however been more and more disappointed with the books since the 5th book and can barely stomach them now. I will continue to \\"read\\" them, actually audiobooks for me, until they're completed by B.Sanderson, the new author assigned to the story, in the hopes that he will be able to pull it all together. There are FAAAAARRRR too many useless, uninteresting characters and plotlines in this series. I think that someone could abridge the whole series to date into 3-4 decent books that would be more cohesive and better reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced Moratorium","review":"A few of the other reviewers have it right when they mentionthe unnecessary stall. I would like to know how many booksdoes it take to get to the final battle. This one contained very little actionwith overextended plots to allegedly expand the characters who were presentsince book one, for those of us like me who read all of the nine previous booksit did little to do so.So what happens now? I must wait a year or a little moreto try and get reacquainted with Lord Goldeneyes or see howMat plans on taming Tuon? I am not sure if I will, thereare other books and my reading interest might suddenly change.This is taking too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finish the Series","review":"Jordan needs to finish this series and get back to the action!

I struggled through the last few books simply because I remembered how good the first 4 were. The time has come to bring this series to a close. It saddens me to see the pure genius of his eary work degraded into material to make himself a buck. Mr. Jordan you have ruined a fantastic series with your greed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly better than everyone is giving it credit for","review":"Let me start by saying that this might be the most anti-climactic book I have ever read.That said - I enjoyed reading it anyway.I like the characters, the setting and the storyline, but of the 680 pages, the only relevant \\"action\\" was in the very VERY end. As long as you are prepared for that the book won't disappoint you TOO much.I wasn't prepared for that though, so 2 stars it what it gets.Anyway - I will stick with the Wheel of Time series to the end for one main reason - books 1-3 might be the 3 best books I ever read, and I've read quite a bit of fantasy.(Wizard First Rule & series, Rhapsody & series by Elizabeth Haydon, George RR Martin etc.)In short - don't expect much and Crossroads might exceed your expectations. Barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was extremely disappointed","review":"I have followed this series from the beginning avidly. Books eight and nine were a bit of a let down, but when i finished Book Ten (which I ran out to the store to buy as soon as I learned it was out), I threw it across my bedroom and vowed not to buy another in the series. I don't think that one plot advanced one iota. There was no mention of Nynaeve or Lan (oh yeah she was sitting in a tree when someone crossed a courtyard, he was fighting). There was more time spent on characters who are not central to the plot than to the main players. I can only say that the only way I will buy book ten will be after i read a bunch of reviews otherwise im bailing out. Sorry Mr Jordan, I held on as long as I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens","review":"Like most who have bought and read Crossroads of Twilight, I've invested so much time and emotion into reading the Wheel of Time Series that I'm damned to keep reading it to the bitter end. But whereas in the past I would have recommended to friends and strangers to pick up the series, I can't do that anymore. Three of the last four books (instalments 7, 8, and 10) have pretty much sucked; book 9, Winter's Heart, reminded me why I love the series, but CoT betrayed any good-will WH had restored. I recommend not reading the Wheel of Time series until it is concluded, and there's no telling when that will be. So, gentle reader, check back in about 5 years and see where the series is. But even if it's done by then, Jordan has meandered so far afield from the heights of the series, the Wheel may not be worth the time it takes to ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Mr. Jordan, finish the series before you lose us all","review":"I am a big fan of the Wheel of Time series and loved the first 8 books. By book 9 I was beginning to wonder, \\"when is this all going to end\\" and book 10 does nothing to help get any closer to a conclusion. As Mr. Jordan continues, his stories are becoming less and less interesting and one is left disappointed. Though there are some good parts, much of the book is quite tedious and since it's been so long since the first book, it took a bit of time to remember everyone this round! Please, Mr. Jordan, let's move on to the final battle and finish the series before we lose all interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery loves company","review":"Reading the reviews here lets me know that I am not alone in my pain.Robert Jordan's series has become the Titanic of American Literature; once filled with promise but now a pitiable heap at the bottom of many a landfill.Honest readers will admit there were clues to Jordan's poor writing even in the first books; for example a plodding pace followed by final chapters of rushed, super-extra-action! and female characters ALWAYS described the same way, (braid tugging, etc.)I feel sorry for Robert Jordan because he undoubtably reads the Amazon reviews. As do all his peers, friends and family. One-and-a-half stars after 1,800 reviews is a monumental humiliation.Please, Mr. Jordan, finish this series ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal performance","review":"I just finished reading the book about 10-15 minutes ago.Nothing happened in this book... nothing at all.There is the extreme attention to detail, but the whole point of a book in a series is to advance the story line. This book really didn't do that.It took me about 3 months to finish this book, when normally I can go through a 700 pager if it's good in a week or two.It seemed too much like a chore to read this, not something that was fun.Hopefully book 11 finishes the series, but for some reason I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please get on with it","review":"I have valiantly tried to slog my way through this series.I will often read a book that bores me just because I feel compelled to finish.10 books.

It became tedious, and it sounds as if it's only gotten worse. There are many more interesting books to read out there. I do have to say, though, that I've really enjoyed the reviews. As an earlier reviewer mentioned, this could be the birth of a new art form :) I can't wait until his next book is published and can only hope that it garners reviews as entertaining as those for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you retire well as an author?","review":"The best way is to keep your climaxes long and drawn out. Jordan has managed to do this over the last three or four books now, and he shows no sign of lessening the pace. Of course, he does this by stopping all action is his books and splintering the story off into a dozen or so fragments so you have to buy all twenty of his books to get a complete story. He's discovered how to avoid the weakness that develops when you have a set of novels set in a fantasy world:some people can't be bothered to buy all the books---they just buy the ones that interest them. By sticking all his novels together, he can make you shlep through all 7,000 pages or so. Great marketing, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Just plain boring. Nothing happens.

Whew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will he ever complete the wheel of time series????","review":"I have read the wheel of time series avidly and enjoyed almost all of them. This one however was real let down. Instead of wasting time with a fil in novel Jordan would be doing his fan base a whole ot of good if he finally got down and back to the real story.I know that some folks say thisis just a preparation for the the next release, but it was never done with any of the others, why this one.I will buy the next true release of the Wheel of time series but nothing else from this series ever again unless of course he manges ot capture the imagination.Sometimes you can get too saturated and an epic of this order has to be a difficult project but with todays computers and writing software, the job is no where near as difficult as it was 10 years ago. IN fact # 10 just seemed to be a software generated summary I hate to be a critic especially of this series, but the Wheel of time does go on and no one lives forever"},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooooooooring","review":"It has taken me MONTHS to read this. I got a signed copy for my birthday in January and I am still only 400 pages into it. This thing is a meandering series of pages that makes for a perfect sleep-aid. Seriously--I PLOWED through the first 8 books and thought this would be good, but it just sucks. Rand hasn't even appeared yet! The biggest problem is that Jordan just sticks you right into it so you are dealing with all these characters with similar names and it's impossible--impossible, especially with the lame index that is not helpful at all--to remember what the hell is going on.If you are going have an index, make it useful! I just got my copy of \\"Quicksilver\\" by Neal Stephenson...looks like this book is relegated to the shelf...again..get this book if you've run out of valium."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The first five or six books of this series were so good I couldn't put them down, but the last couple have been so bogged down in details that they are boring. This whole book could have been a single chapter. The plot did not get moved forward at all, there was no action, basically it felt like an attempt to make the series even longer and make more money. I want to finish reading this series, but it's becoming tedious to read. Get on with the story already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pot Boiler Extraordinaire","review":"After the action and excitement of the first nine Wheel Of Time books, this one (Book 10) reads as though Jordan was half asleep when he wrote it. I'm a BIG fan of the series, but this book was the worst pot boiler I've ever read. There was virtually no action for the first 2/3 of the book. There were even words omitted. The book was some 700 pages long, and most of it was about the confused state of mind of the characters. There was just enough suspense at the end to make you wonder what would happen next, but then, that's what we thought after Book 9, and we got jack! To my relief, there was no more gratuitous titillation; but there was also no plot - none whatsoever. The story advanced maybe one tiny step. Not what I expected for my money and for my wait. Very, very disappointed. Scathingly so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"Until I read this book, Robert Jordan was my favorite author (well, in a tie with George R.R. Martin) and I LIVED for the next Wheel of Time novel to come out.This one was like a short visit with old friends, but it was 700 pages of useless \\"chit-chat\\" There was no action, no adventure and only VERY minimal plot advancement.I can't believe that I waited two years and had it on pre-order for a year to read this. Don't waste your time and energy or money on Crossroads of Twilight unless you are an absolute Wheel of Time junkie..... Better to just re-read the earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, now I really feel like an ... ...","review":"Ok, HOW long did we wait for book 10? 2 YEARS? This book went almost no where. Jordan is filling pages and pages with pure fluff. Having waited for this book for that entire time, I feel like I just got my chain yanked. Aside from a few major decisions being made, Jordan spends his words describing filthy clothing, and or just TALKING about clothing clean or not, for a great percentage of the book. Lots of describing scenery, and background, but little on plot devlopment and progression. I am very dissappointed with this book and it is starting to color my overall perceptions of the series. I hope he gets back to what he gave us in the first few installments, and I will likely ready whatever he may produce in the WOT in the future, but I won't be anticipating it or holding my breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worst WOT book so far...","review":"Robert Jordan owes me two years of waiting and $...! This series has gotten progressively worse after book 5. Crossroads of Twilight dips to new lows. I can't believe Jordan made the world wait two years for this... He makes next to no progress whatsoever in the story! The cast of characters is immense, which adds to this series early greatness, but lets be honest it begins and ends with Rand. How you can write an entire book and only dedicate 2, 2 1/2 chapters to the key character, only AFTER 500+ pages of reading about everyone and their grandmother! I am so disgusted right now with WOT, Robert Jordan, and myself for ever getting caught up in this travesty. WOT is just a cash cow now, and myself and all you other suckers are just making RJ and his publishers richer by the moment..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Don't buy this book. Don't even read it. The only thing that happens of note is on the last page. Save the time, and read it in a book store. I think Robert Jordan is one of the best fantasy writers out there, and the Wheel of Time one of the best fantasy series, but this book was just pointless. Of all the threads he is weaving, all of them remain unchanged but one, and that one only slightly. This book is utterly skippable, and I guarantee you won't miss a thing if you never open the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I feel that I have been taken advantage of on this one. Less happens in the almost 700 pages of this book than in 20 of any other. No science fiction, no important political setup, no suspense, no resolution of any issues. My feeling is that Jordan does not know how to tie up all of the loose ends he has created and is stalling for time. My advice is - don't even get the paperback. Go to your local bookstore and read the last 4 pages. This book is a waste of good reading time and I will be sure to read reviews of the next before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rand might as well die now. The last battle is never coming","review":"Have you noticed that since book 5 or so, nothing happens in the first 500 pages of the book? Well book 10 takes it one step further; nothing happens in the last 200 either. The one factor that kept me reading The Wheel of Time to this point was the fact that each book ended with enough action to propel me through the next 500 pages or so of setup until I reached the climax of the next novel. I don't think this will be enought to get me through another novel, however. I may read Robert Jordan's series again one day, but I'll probably read the first 5 books and skip to the last one if I do. File this one under tedium and save yourself the trouble of reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooorrrringggg!!!!!!!","review":"When I finished the first three books and the story had not ended, I thought, ok, this is a little unusual for the genre, but great, let's break some molds with a fourth book! Then the fourth book hadn't ended the story, then the fifth, and so on... It stopped being interesting somewhere around book five, although I've read them all so far - I keep convincing myself that the next book will be the last! And it never is! It's like a 30 minute sitcom that doesn't end after three hours. I think I'll drop it with this one, and give it up. Maybe in ten more years he'll have finally figured out where the story is going, and I'll borrow them all from the library. Or not. He has to have the best author's contract in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-leaze!","review":"I was hooked after reading the first book of this series. The plot moved quickly, it was interesting, the characters well fleshed out. The excellent writing continued for several more books. Mr. Jordan, what happened to you? The last two books are dead in the water. NOTHING, I mean NOTHING interesting happens to the story or the characters! What is the point of writing two entire books which do nothing to advance the plot? Set-up is good and necessary but only the amount of set-up which is relevant and assists the reader. I am extremely disppointed that I just read an entire book in which no plot advancement occurs. I'm sure I'll keep reading, because I do want to know what happens to these characters in the end, but let's get a move on, here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book was a waste of time for the readers and author!","review":"I am a big fan of the Wheel of Time saga, however, this volume added nothing to the story. I just finished reading the book and I feel that it was a complete waste of time! I thought the Prologue chapter of the book was good, but, in my opinion, it was the best part, and the story went flat thereafter. In my opinion, there are at least 400 pages of \\"nothing\\" in this book. I enjoyed reading the previous 9 volumes and I hope volume 11 is significantly better than volume 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"haha","review":"All right. This book stinks. You know, I think that bashing the tenth WoT book has become something of a favorite activity of Robert Jordan fans/Wheel of Time fans. Muahaha. It certainly has for me. I mean, it's all meant in love, you know...I'm a great fan of this series, but when Bob writes an appalling tenth installment....you have to teeeeelllllll him that, and once enough fans have yelled at him, he can say \\"oooooh, you DON'T like it when the whole book is full of tea parties and emotionally unstable women's rantings? OOooookaaaayyy\\".....thankfully he improved on book 11."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yada, yada, yada","review":"No need to expand on the other negative reviews that have already been written, this tome took us nowhere fast. If RJ's not careful the WOT series will turn into a Goodkindesque type of literary quagmire where the author keeps milking the same tired storylines without advancing any, at least until the faithful readers finally give up on the whole quest. The question that really needs to be asked now is whether or not RJ can finish what he started and move on to the sequel instead of the prequel? As the wheel turns so shall we see (hopefully before too many ages pass)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Balefire Jordan!","review":"CoT was so slow, boring, and bad that I now wish I had never started the series. Robert Jordan took a good thing and is milking it for all it's worth. I definitely reached a crossroads after reading this book and I'm choosing not to read any future installments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jordan is milking it!!!","review":"The last three books of this series have seemed like 1 hour episodes from a tv series!! Like 3 things happened in 700 pages!!It was an easy read and really annoying waste of time. You can skip over this book and you will miss practically nothing. I dont know if I'm going to even bother reading any more of Jordan's books until he finishes the series. Because it seems to me that he'll die off before he gets the chance!!!-irritated reader"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only slogged through the first 125 page","review":"So many new character. So little action. The first book captured me, as did many others. I gave this volume away to a friend who made it through 25 more pages than I did before throwing it across the room in a fit of exasperationDon't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marching in place...","review":"You will miss absolutely nothing by skipping this book. *Absolutely nothing*. I like 'background' very well in a storyline, but this is over 600 pages of background and not one thing changes by the end of the book. I will continue to use the library until Jordan produces something worth purchasing, and I recommend the same for others. Then again, maybe the fan sites will do their usual (excellent) summaries, in which case you'll save yourself time as well as frustration by skipping the book altogether and hoping for better in the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book but a little slow","review":"Well, He has done it again. I have read the series twice now from book 1 to book 10. The books flow one into other very nicely. I think what most reviewers are missing here is that he needed to catch up the timelines between all the different groups(Mat, Elayne, Rand, Perrin,.... etc.) Yes this book was a little sluggish and I wish he would have tied up some loose ends that we all have been waiting for. BUT you all have to admint this man is a great writer. I only have one question...... WHAT THE [HECK] IS WITH THE GHOSTS? Any Ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!!","review":"I was completely amazed at how very little Jordan actually developed the plot in this book. In seven hundred pages Jordan progressed the development of his series by only a few days!!!! Nothing changed from the end of the last book. No action took place and the main characters actually did not accomplish a single goal. In fact, you would not miss anything by skipping this book altogether and waiting for the next. Given his last several books I would strongly suggest that those desiring to discover the outcome of the series should get each of the final books at the library when they come out, find a nice couch in the facility, and read the last couple of chapters. You will not miss anything whatsover by doing so. In fact, you could skip this book altogehter and read the summary provided by others and you will not miss a thing!!I would give this book zero stars if that was a possible choice. While I have read all ten books to this point, I am certain that I will not read another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wheel Churns; The Creator Poops","review":"Save your money and just wait until the next installment.

A series of books that should have been done in 4 books has been dragged out to 10 with no end in sight. Mr. Jordan is not a good writer, just one who has stumbled onto a good idea and has managed to waste that as well. He has seen the last of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"One step forward, fifteen steps sideways","review":"I have been an avid reader of this series for many years now, but I must say that this was a big letdown from the previous novel. Sometime around book number 6 or so, Jordan seems to have become mired in a rut where one book advances the plot and then 2 years later another book is issued descibing all the semi-interesting things that were happenning around the same time in other parts of the globe. I understand that there are only so many Forsaken that can be killed off before the series gets dull. However, given the delay in between novels I cannot think of a good reason why every book should not advance the plot. This book was one huge setup for events down the road, and there was simply no payoff. I would reccommend treating Jordan the same way that Star Trek movies are perceived; skip every other one so that you are not frustrated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so sad","review":"To restate what many, many others have already said, this book is incredibly disappointing. I simply could not get through hundreds of pages filled with minor, forgettable characters and no plot advancement.

With this latest addition, I've decided I no longer care to see how it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"crossroads of coma","review":"This installment of the wheel of time saga has pages, off white pages, the color and texture are that of paper.Paper made from the wood of trees, tall trees perhaps, or maybe small, but tree's none the less.

People are so angry about Mr. Jordan's last 5 books since the first 5 were excellent. Unfortunately, their magic has long since vanished, while Mr. Jordan and his editor continue to milk it. Does he realize how horrible things have become? Fortunately, I haven't read any of these books since number 7, which freed up a lot of my time and allowed me to perfect my underwater basket-weaving, macaroni art techniques and my clandestine nose picking skills.Enough already!Finally, is it any wonder that the last three books just sit at my local library? They're free to check out, but have had no takers...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awsome series...............what happened?","review":"I first began reading the Wheel of Time series after it came highly recommended by a friend of mine. To tell the truth I loved every book in the series (1-9) but then came book ten. For others who have read the rest of the series I can see your dissapointed also. No main conflict was ever resolved but instead dragged out. The \\"Rand chapters\\" of this series were my favorite, the ones where all the action and story devolpment took place. This novel had only 2 chapters devoted to Rand and over half the book to meaningless Aes Sedia parts. I was highly disappointed in this book. How can Robert Jordan bring himself to write this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"My sincerest thanks to all previous reviewers!","review":"I have peeked at this book in the bookstore and fully agree that it is NOT a \\"must read\\".IF I live long enough I fully intend to read all of the novels which eventually end up comprising the Wheel of Time series - BUT, SERIOUSLY (and sadly) ... Robert Jordan has finally managed to make it a chore rather than an enjoyable pastime. If ever the final installment comes out in paperback I will buy it, along with any others (after WH) that are needed to complete the set. I should be able to pick them up as cheap used copies by then. Not that I'm stingy - just that I think price should reflect value.Meanwhile, I have found some other excellent authors who focus more on writing and less on marketing.

But in the end, I found that I totally agreed with them. All the book was about was absolutely noting!! I found myself skipping through entire chapters trying to get to a part that got somewhere. Therefore, i got through the book in less than three days. And that was reading only a few hours a day. All in all, I'm not quite sure that I am going to waste my money on the next novel or not. I was the first in line to get this book, and I'll probably be last in line to get the next one. I just wish that the last battle would hurry up and get here so that we can find out what happens and it would all be over with!!

And its not book 11, its a PREQUEL. Why is he writing a prequel when the series everyone is waiting for him ot finish is not finised?Two reasons come to the mind quickly. 1:He does not know how to tie up the series, just look at the last 4 books. Those books covered as much as the first book did by it selfI heard at one point that the series was suppose to be only seven books at the beginning and over time it has encrease which leads to #2:He has sold out adn is after the money.The answer is probable both, and unfortunetly I still do enjoy his writing so I will read this new book.....when it hits the library, 'casue he will not get another dime from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!!!","review":"You can skip this book and read Book 11 when it comes out.

I loved the first 5 books, plodded my way through 6 & 7, and I'm afraid that I've completely given up on 8, 9, 10, and whenever the heck RJ decides to have mercy and end this pathetic series. I skimmed his 800 page book in about an hour at the bookstore, put it back on the shelf, and thanked the heavans that I didn't buy the book.

Unfortunately each installment now takes longer and is more disappointing than the previous one. Crossroads of Twilight is thin on plot and thick on the filling. Robert Jordan appears to be stretching the story out to breaking point, probably in anticipation of the royalties from each book. Unfortunately it seems the less substance he puts into each book the more fans fall by the way side. I would borrow this book or buy it second hand because it is certainly not worth spending your hard earned money on. Lets hope Jordan learns the error of his ways and starts displaying the brilliance that had us all enthralled at the beginning of this epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of boredom and frustration","review":"What a bone-grinding halt to such an exciting (all beit falling off) series. Reading this book was like watching a soap opera. Plenty of detail and filler, but when you're done with it, you realize there was absolutely zero plot movement in the entire book.Can't believe Jordan can write 680 pages of material and describe nothing of consequence. I had read more than half the book until I got an update on the main character. Then guess what happened with him... That's right. Nothing. This series is quickly going from the best I've encountered to the most disappointing.Next time TOR and Jordan will have to earn my money with a few good customer reviews before I buy. Please quit selling me filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossroads of Twilight","review":"Robert Jordan's last book has helped me in two areas. The first was to improve my speed reading; I only had to read every 10th page to understand the plot. Second was the security that I would be saving money in the future, this is the last time I will be duped into buying another one of his books. It's hard to understand how an author could start out so interesting and end up so boring. I wonder if money has anything to do with it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give RJ a laxative","review":"Has there ever been a more constipated writer than Robert Jordan? Virtually zero plot movement takes place in this 672 bag of gas. If Jordan had been writing Lord of the Rings, the hobbits would still be in Rivendell in Book 10. I constantly fought the urge to skim through large sections of the book in hopes of finding some sections that wouldn't put me to sleep.

Not only is the tone entirely loathesome, it is riddled with fabrications and loosely based hear-say. Not only was it poorly researched, it seems as though in many areas the facts were blatantly overlooked, omitted. The author quickly loses credibility with anyone who has access to verifiable facts about Buster Keaton's life.This book was a peculiar waste of time and energy for the author, and more-so for any potential reader.The beautifully done (and seperately researched) discography is the only reason this book received two stars from me.

True he was not educated, but to say he was illiterate is false. I've seen photocopies of his journal he kept during WWI, and it's clear he studied his Army manuals and learned Morse code and practiced it. The author also makes the mistake of relaying to us conversations that took place between Buster and his mother-in-law, both deceased of course. How would she know what was said? These were about things Buster would have discussed with no one else. It's an intro to people unfamiliar with Buster, but by no means accurate.

Any biographer can check this out.)And any reader can purchase a much, much better biography of Buster Keaton.

The illiteracy allegation is particularly foolish--how could a supposedly meticulous researcher have overlooked the existence of Buster's own (very tidy) diary?

(Some nice photos, though.) Biggest lie is that Keaton was illiterate, which is absolutely absurd. A much more acurate picture of Buster's life can be obtained from his own autobiography which is the truth, at least as Buster himself experienced it. The 3-tape video \\"Buster Keaton: A Hard Act to Follow\\" is also recommended by this reviewer as well as the documentary of the making of \\"The Railrodder\\" titled \\"The Life and Times of Buster Keaton.\\" Yes, Buster did some self-destructive things in his life, but they are far outnumbered by the gifts and talent which he made extraordinary use of during at least 65 of his 70 years of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"basildon bounce","review":"This is another maxi-single in a series devoted to givingall aspiringDJ's value for the dollar/pick the mix for thedance floor pulse.There are 4 mixes of \\"Behind the Wheel\\",once of which is by Nile Rodgers (Chic fame).

The stories are mostly cerebral, although you shouldn't expect hard science. Mars and Venus as depicted in these stories contradict what we now know about these planets, but these inaccuracy are largely irrelevent since the themes in many of the stories don't require a science fiction setting. Although it's easy to tell the stories were written fifty years ago, the stories themselves aren't really dated, but it is amusing to read a story where the author didn't put a technology far enough into the future to avoid the popularity of his work. Overall, it's a good book but it doesn't fall into the category of a must read. If you have trouble finding time to read, this is a perfect book for reading a story or two and then putting away for a while without losing any continuity."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Raybury's finest","review":"Although it's not his best work, it is certainly up there. This book is as twisted, thought provoking and ironic as any other of Bradbury's work.

While the first couple of stories may interest you, you will later find yourself bored by repeated subjects, settings, and characters.Ray Bradbury tends to write excessively about space, so if you are a space fanatic, this is the book for you. Otherwise, you will soon realize Bradbury's style, and constantly you will find yourself knowing what will happen on the next page.Bradbury's imagination and vivid descriptions are at times interesting, however. At times his writing style can get to be irritating.

If you have friends, neighbors,brothers, sister, sons, daughters, or all of the above who enjoy nothing more than to sit down for hours inside the world of the game; than you are sure to find a good scare in The Veldt.P.S.

Perhaps this is because I read The Martian Chronicles only months earlier, but it seems as if Bradbury, though a terrific author, dwells on the same ideas in all of his collections.

Masterfully Done. A MUST-HAVE. I truly recomend this series (Incarnations of Immortality) to all readers. Come to think of it... his other books aren't bad either. Might want to check them out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Anthony's finest","review":"This is one of the most thought provoking books I have ever read. Anthony leaves behind the traditional notion that the devil is pure evil and instead attempts to portray Satan as a sort of governor of hell, who is trying to make it better for its denizens. Parry, the character who takes over as the devil is a nice guy who basically starts acting evil once he becomes Satan. Even as Satan however, Parry retains some of his good side. As in all of the books in the Incarnations of Immortality series, this book has superb character development and an enthralling plot. This book was very enjoyable to read and I would recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking...refreshingly different","review":"I've read all of the books in the Incarnations of Immortality Series and I loved every one of them, but this one changed my views about a lot of things more than any of them! Piers Antony 'humanizes' every Incarnation with attention to detail, especially Satan. He takes a very controversial look at life, death, after-life and our beliefs about them which eerily plausible. I also think the friendship between Satan and JHVH is quite interesting. My only problem with this book was the repetitiveness. It was nice to see the connections between the other books and this one, but it didn't have to be the entire dialogue written over again! Overall, I suggest you read this, along with all the others in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and different read","review":"Piers Anthony must have had quite the task to write this book. He had to take Satan that he had written about in the five previous books and give him a history and make sense of what it was that he was trying to achieve.What is given to us is not only a Satan with a clear understanding of Evil, but a Satan who actually cares about others. A Satan who actually cares for humanity. A Satan who is misunderstood by others.A lot of the mysteries of the previous five books are uncovered as a bet is made between Satan and Enoch on the fate of humanity. This also explains why everything happens to Luna and her decendants the way they do. At the end of the book, only one question is left open which is answered by the final book. But this work of fiction was fun and thought-provoking. If you've read the other five, you can't stop before reading this one. If you haven't read the other five, read them first. It makes this book more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!","review":"This book adds character and realisim to Satan, who is normaly shown as the guy who cares about only himself. I sort of felt sorry for Parry, because he lost Jolie, but I figure it turned out okay in the end. I thought that Satan would just be proved a horrible tyrant, but I realized that if Orb could fall in love with Satan, he couldn't be all bad.....or could he?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book couldn't put it down!!","review":"Piers Anthony is a great writer, think he has surpassed anything that he has set for himself. if he writes another book or another ten they will all be uniquely individual. I love his writing he is my all time favorite Author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is the devil really such a bad guy?","review":"For Love of Evil gives us a look at the \\"human\\" side of theevil incarnation. All of the Incarnations of Immortality seriesgive a logical explanation of the \\"gods\\". The evil god {weknow him as the devil} has a purpose. The balance betweengood and evil has stumped philosophers for eons. Perhapsthey should have read For Love of Evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, One of the Worst Books I Have Ever Read","review":"Okay... Piers Anthony cannot write. Actually, he might be able to, but by targeting the book and this series for young male juveniles, he is seriously wasting the lives of the trees that had to die for this publication.I thought the immature and completely tasteless sexual connotations were bad enough in the previous books, but this tops them all, combined! His version of Hell is totally unoriginal (copied Dante) and the plot is confusing, irritating, and boring. But I just got fed up with the sexual content in this book. If it was tasteful, I wouldn't really mind, but it's entirely juvenile and there's just way too much of it.Please, if you value your time, avoid this book and Piers Anthony like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Currently Reading","review":"I have all the other books on ebook format and this book and Book Seven aren't available in that format so purchased \\"old fashioned\\" books ;) ...

A few books were better than others, but ALL of the books were at least 4 stars, and were all excellent reads.I was blown away by this sixth volume of Incarnations of Immortality and the development of Satan's character. It's a fantstic read, exploring good and evil and tackling some hard questions. The revelation that God simply wasn't listening anymore certainly makes a lot of sense when you think about how the world is today. Just like its five predecessors, this book is entertaining and thought-provoking. You just might get a few new views or ideas on things you believe in, these books are that good.Now onward to 'And Eternity', after having just finished this book, I am antsy to see what happens next. How exciting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really 4.5 stars","review":"This book was my second fav book in the series (\\"With a Tangled Skien\\" being my first). I highly recomend if you have not read the other books in the series you at least read \\"Being a Green Mother\\" before this one. Anthony does a superb job of showing a unique version of satan and hell. I will not get into plot specifics, I dont wont to spoil it for those reading the series. I highly recomend this book to readers of the fantasy/sci-fi genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful product","review":"i take this supplement at least once a day. i had alot of urinary problems, so i needed a pill to take daily. great product, fast shipping"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Great product from a great brand. These are the only full-spectrum vitamin e capsules I can find that are free of all allergens. Most vitamin E caps contain only the d-alpha tocopherol isomer or a complex with d-beta,d-delta, and d-gamma tocopherols. MSM Complete-E contains all the tocopherols plus alpha-, beta-, gamma, and delta-tocotrienols, as they occur in nature and which are normally missing in supplements. A balance is needed as tocotrienols serve very specific purposes for cholesterol reduction, brain and heart health, and cancer prevention.

We had all the other DVDs and my daughter is just in love with them from the time she was 3 months and even now likes them at 3 1/2 years old. So, when I saw this one, I thought it would be just as good for my son who is now 9 months. I do not like it as much. The music is not as great and it doesn't hold their attention like Curious Buddies at the Park or on the Farm or on the Beach. In fact, the music is sometimes annoying and I want to turn it off. I wouldn't have bought this if I had previewed it before I bought it. However, for anyone debating on which Curious Buddies DVDs to get, definitely get Curious Buddies at the Park or on the Farm. Those are my kids FAVORITES and I really like the songs on those DVDs. You can probably do without this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big hit in our house","review":"My 2 year old and 1 year old love these movies! I love them too, because they keep my boys entertained, are educational, and have great music.My little boys especially love Let's Build. In addition to teaching different types of construction equipment, this movie teaches about shapes and colors, and encourages kids to keep trying when things are hard. It features live action music videos, and skits with the Curious Buddies puppets.I would recommend any of the Curious Buddies DVDs to parents of toddlers and preschoolers. Your kids will love them, and they won't make you want to pull your hair out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love the curious buddies!!!","review":"my son, husband and i love the curious buddies. we like all the videos, some more than others, but all are good. i can't seem to find \\"storytime\\" or \\"i can do it\\"....will buy them if i can find them."},{"rating":"2","title":"CIA Investigations","review":"Great historic reference to Federal investigation methods.

Soaring over the cliffs in the Grand Cayon and some of the other parks looks very nice. However, the quality of the video transfer to the DVD is not very well done in quite a few of the scenes. Quality looks no better than a low grade VHS tape in the Grand canyon and some other segments, especially the White Sands segment. And there is abolutely no info whatsoever anywhere on the DVD. The only audio is new age music and maybe a little bit of noise from a waterfall. Absolutely no dialogue whatsoever. Not even any captions or titles to allow you to know what you're looking at. Decent DVD if all you want are relaxing videos and music, but avoid it if you want something informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girard Haven understanding of the 4th Way is remarkable","review":"Girard Haven clearly has a very deep understanding of the 4th Way teachings. He seems objective about his observations and also has an extremely positive attitude. I recommend this book because Girard Haven has apparently gone beyond just talking about Gurdjieff's ideas and has become them. He seems to have really separated his sense of Self from his 'machine'. If you want to know what the results are of one man's practical work on himself over many years then this book gives a very clear account of that. His understanding reminds me of Ouspensky himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album I've Heard. Ever.","review":"I heard the single \\"Don't Ask Me How I Know\\" and immediately ran out to by this CD. Each song is so impressive. The lyrics are so powerful and moving, and the way Bobby Pinson sings conveys the the message that he did not just write these songs, he lived them. you can hear the tears in his voice on \\"I Thought that's who I was.\\" Some of the songs may cover similar experiences, but each one justifies why it is on the album and presents the raw emotion of the singer/songwriter. Not only that, but do to his experience in the business prior to his singing debut, the album is well produced and sounds great. The songs may not resonate with everyone, but it will with a large number of people. and it will resonate better than anything they've ever heard before."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"If this isn't a great OST, I don't know what is.

You all remember The Last Shot when it was in the theaters, right? The $30 million opening weekend, the $200 million total gross? No? Good, because this movie, if it ever made it to theaters, lasted about two seconds. I can't imagine how anyone could think a movie with the star power of Matthew Broderick and Alec Baldwin, but which no one saw in a theater, could be any good. It's not. This movie was buried for a reason: it's boring. Broderick is his usual cloying self and Calista Flockhart appears as his whacky girlfriend who hates dogs, which is a running \\"joke\\" in the movie. The script strains for laughs which are not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie","review":"I never saw this movie in the theatre, but happened across it on televison, saw it, and decided to purchase the DVD.No, it's not rocket science, but it is a very fun movie with some great acting and a mind-bending plot.

There's some very racy and very funny dialogue, and the best thing in the film is Joan Cusack.Based on a true story (somewhat), this is a very funny and well-put-together movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found On TV And Now Want To Buy It - FUNNY!","review":"I came across \\"The Last Shot\\" when it ran on the Comedy Channel and am now here on Amazon to buy it!

The long awaited complete score of \\"Midway\\", wth additional music is a film score collectors dream. Williams proves he knows what the film needs and gives it his all, with brass building and drums setting the pace for this all out classic extravaganza.The entire album is thrilling, with two stand outs - MIDWAY MARCH and MEN OF THE YORKTOWN MARCH this is Williams at his finest hour. A standing ovation for the Royal Scottish National Orchestra conducted by Rick Wentworth, capturing the mood and moment of this truly awesome score.Total Time: 35:46 on 23 Tracks/ Varese Sarabande - VSD 5940 (1998)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are references citations in text?","review":"A good web usability book for practitioners.

My favourite mix on here is the Churchapella, it's beautiful. The 12\\" Dance Mix and The 7\\" Remix/Edit were also brilliant. The Dance Mix was the version the Immaculate Collection CD was based on. I recommend you pick up: this single, the Like A Prayer album, the Immaculate Collection album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Club Mixes","review":"If you at all like this song (which is probably the case if you've made it to this page), you should definitely buy this CD. It has a couple of great mixes of \\"Like a Prayer\\" on it. I first heard a DJ playing it at a party, and I knew I had to have it on CD. Basically, these versions add some neat effects to the songs. Madonna's later CD singles have a lot of musical innovations to the songs and borrow lots of different rhythmic styles. She didn't do that with this single, but it's still as good. The \\"Act of Contrition\\" single is a little strange, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remixed Prayers is SOOOO much better","review":"I never thought I'd rate anything by Madonna 1 star, but I had to. \\"Remixed Prayers\\" is much, much better than this.

It is dark and sexy, with lyrics about love, devotion, S&M/B&D, submission, all without sounding pretentious or silly for that matter. There are some dope remixes, my favorite being the Maxi mix. The Blind Mix is cool as well. The piano heavy instrumental \\"PIMPF\\" is also on here, along with a few other mixes that are decent.

But, this one will be always on the top.

The idea is great and it appears that the author was offered a sum of money for a minimum 100 pages about the subject of the origins of Danny Boy. Well, there's no real story behind it so that leaves 99 pages which he fills with name-dropping, Irish history (not bad, but for a different book), and then the capper is a 30 page list of people who have sung the song.

I generally read history books whether delivered as scholarly text, or a more relaxed tone, I expect the author to stick to the topic at hand.

I really do not care how Malachy McCourt feels about the President, but it really has no place in a history of the song Danny Boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, but then, so are leprechauns","review":"Neither scholarly treatise nor lengthy tome, Malachy McCourt's Danny Boy is a short, but sweet, look at a favorite song. He traces, briefly, the history of the tune and the various words that have been sung to it; speculates on who the song's narrator is and what the story refers to; and, has several famous Irish and Irish-American people discuss what the song means to them. This strikes me as a good hostess gift if you're going to a St. Patrick's Day party, or a nice birthday or holiday gift for an Irish-American friend. I wonder why he didn't include a CD with various versions of the song? Maybe for the paperback edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty covers","review":"This item (to call it a \\"book\\" would be an insult to books) has perhaps three pages of information about the history and substance of \\"Danny Boy\\".

Beatings, stabbings, ritualistic murders and a constant peril to children give this film a smutty look highlighted by a bound and gagged group of young girls being dragged across the American southwestern desert. Plot contivances pile up as fast as the dead bodies. Just how much could these kidnapped girls be worth that they are guarded by enough gunmen to rob the Wells Fargo bank? The supernatural elements are an excuse for lack of any dramatic depth. This is a 'C-minus' western with a big glossy shine in which the American Indians are not only savage-like bad guys, but they possess evil powers as well.

She's gagged, and so while Tommy Lee Jones is causing a distraction the Indian sneaks to where all the girls are, takes of Cate's daughter's gag and she starts screaming like a banshee so all the bad dudes come running and gun the good guy down! Again, helping to prevent her escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking","review":"Even the presence of Cate Blanchett couldn't save this one. As a kind of frontier doctor estranged from her father and rearing two children, Blanchett does play a very strong woman with firm convictions-but the film struggled. I could not focus and it did not hold my interest. In the story, the eldest daughter (a very good, strong performance from Evan Rachel Wood) goes missing; Blanchett has to enlist the help of her father, Tommy Lee Jones, to find her again. The actors here all played their roles well, but there was just something lacking in the story and script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Great story set in the old west.

It isn't 2 hours of my life that I won't get back, but it didn't match its ingredients."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Use of Language","review":"While this film is fiction an is more of a drama set in the 1880's than a classic western as such, Ron Howard is to be commended on his use of the Chiricahua Apache language to give realism to the film. Howard (the director) employed the late Berle Kanseah and also Elbys Hugar (great-granddaughter of Cochise), both from the Mescalero Apache reservation in New Mexico, to teach the Native American actors (as well as Tommy Lee Jones)their lines in the Chiricahua language. This gave realism to the film and is the first time actors who portray Chiricahua Apaches have spoken the language (\\"Geronimo:an American Legend\\" used Western Apache language, which is quite different). Also, the movie was filmed in New Mexico and the scenery is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"the missing","review":"This was an excellent movie. The whole family enjoyed. Ages 13 and up.

Then I went to the video store and looked at the back on the packaging. It actually sounded interesting. Then I watched it. Then I discovered that I expected too much.The movie started off okay. I was actually interested by the characters and the cinematography was quite lovely and well, it was quite watchable. This movie doesn't sound too bad. Well, then I watched the movie through the end. That was one of the problems; it never seemed to end. It just kept going and going and all this extra going on just wasn't interesting. The movie just got boring and redundant. Bad guys hit a girl, girl tries to escape, girl in recaught and hit again and daughter and dad find obstacle, surpass it, find obstacle, surpass it. And, none of these obstacles are fun or exciting to watch.I'm going to stop now because I don't want to go on and on. That was the problem of The Missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch the trailer--it's cheaper","review":"i went into this flick expecting something powerful from such a good cast. i blame the plot and script mostly. fine actors had nothing to work with. anti-climatic and predictable. disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Hour Too Long","review":"Decent idea gone awry. Silly dialogue, mediocre direction, horrible editing. In a better director's hands this might have been an interesting film. Not all is bad though. Two stars for the horses. Consider yourself warned; it's 2 1/2 hours you won't recover."},{"rating":"1","title":"'The Searchers' - lite","review":"Reading the premise you could be forgiven for thinking you were onto a winner here: Intriguing characters - sinister rogue Apache 'witch', tough independent frontier mother, estranged father who left to 'go native' - and a potentially engrossing story. But all ingredients sadly come to very little under Ron Howard's undercooked direction. Visually and dramatically the film compares very poorly in toughness, menace and visual power with 'The Searchers' on which it is clearly a riff, a decaffeinated, low-cal one at that.. Kate Blanchett gives a sturdy performance that deserved a better vehicle. Tommy Lee Jones by contrast looks ill-at-ease throughout. Of recent westerns, Kevin Costner's 'Open Range' takes up the reins of the tradition with far more satisfactory results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is Missing Alright","review":"The Missing is based on a similar theme to John Wayne's The Searchers; a family member is kidnapped by renegades and must be recaptured. Unfortunately both movies also suffer from the same central problem, a boring storyline between the capture and re-capture. Both The Searchers and The Missing lose their way in a meandering, underexposed, and disjointed story that seems to have been created just to fill time getting to the final conclusion. The Missing is a tedious movie that lives up to the movie making reputation of Ron Maxwell (Gods & Generals) and not Academy Award winner Ron Howard. It is a step backward after a great movie like A Beautiful Mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left the theater feeling empty","review":"Although I think Jones and Blanchett are easily two of the most talented actors in Hollywood, I was disappointed with this film. I think the screenplay was missing a substantial amount of substance. When I left the movie, I felt empty, like I'd just wasted two hours. The movie isn't BAD, per se, but it's just nothing incredibly outstanding or impressionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Live Up to the Reviews!","review":"I'm a huge fan of Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones, but this film was a real \\"yawner.\\" At more than 2 hours long, it went on for about 40 minutes longer than it needed to and the ending was entirely predictable. Overall, I thought Cate and Tommy did a good job, but Tommy's perpetual whining (even in Chiricahua) grated after a while, as did Cate's harsh western accent which brings to mind the performance of Robin Weigel (?) on Deadwood as Calamity Jane. There were also several plot holes in the story -- for example, Lily giving the gun away during an escape attempt (who didn't know what would happen?), when Dot was brought along to find her sister, etc. Too many instances where this viewer said, \\"Oh, okay...they did that so we can have a problem with it later.\\"I expected more from such talents as TLJ, CB, and Ron Howard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from what I had expected!","review":"Although this movie was not what I had expected at all, It was still a very suspenseful, and somewhat graphic movie. I am never disappointed by a Ron Howard film, however, I didn't give this a 5 star rating only because I was shocked and saddened by the ending. I understand why it was done that way, however, I do like a more \\"upbeat\\" ending, after having to go through all of the violence and gore. The acting was excellent, and the little girl in the movie is fantastic! I hope to see her in future movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleansed version of The Searchers...","review":"At the end of the 19th century Maggie Gilkeson (Cate Blanchett), a rural doctor in the state of New Mexico, has to face the return of her unwanted father Samuel Jones (Tommy Lee Jones). Samuel who ran off with a Native American woman now has to face the music as he is rejected by his own daughter that he abandoned years ago. Maggie is forced to seek Samuel's help as one of her daughters is kidnapped by an evil medicine man to be sold in Mexico. Reunited the family struggles to find a way to get Maggie's daughter back. The Missing has beautiful cinematography and a strong performance by the cast. However, the story fails to connect with the audience as the disturbing elements of the story seem cleansed from indecent material. This leaves the audience with an awkward cinematic experience as the true rudimentary element of the story has been removed."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOMMY LEE JUST KEEPS GOING!","review":"Tommy Lee keeps up his great acting - in keeping with the time period. He had a great villian to track down.There was enough shock and gore for most normal people.

I watched the movie expecting some sort of demon as the evil in the movie. However, I was wrong. Very wrong. The \\"evil\\" they find in this movie is not what you'd think of when you think supernatural. Also, this is not Tommy Lee Jones best acting. :( Although, I was fairly impressed with Cate Blanchett as a pioneer woman in New Mexico. But...you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blanchett's better than the movie itself.","review":"Cate Blanchett's portrayal of a prairie healer in \\"The Missing\\" is, sadly, the only really good thing that comes out of this Ron Howard-directed Western. The rest of it ventures somewhere between \\"implausible\\" to \\"downright unbelievable.\\"Visually, the film is interesting. But the story is hokey and contrived.The film makes the same mistake with Tommy Lee Jones as a lot of his recent films do. They cast him, expect him to play a \\"type\\" and then don't know what to do with him. Jones is pretty good, but only Blanchett is able to elevate herself above the material. Aaron Eckhart, Eric Schweig and promising young actress Evan Rachel Wood are similarly wasted.This is not an above-par Western. It's a hokey, ridiculously plotted B-movie Western whenever Blanchett isn't front-and-center.The ending of the film is formulaic and abrupt.Sadly, I wish I'd missed THE MISSING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy Lee JONES lets watch it!","review":"What a story line!

It seems Ron Howard has a one dimensional view of the Apache indian because he portrayed them as theiving, murdering drunks instead of a group of people that was displaced and murdered by the white man. I lived on a New Mexico reservation with the Apache for one year and I learnt that they are very human and have goals and aspirations besides what is erroneously portrayed in the film. This is a standard fare from Hollywood which has a terrible ending and does nothing to even help the viewer understand the purpose of why this film was made. A complete career spiral for Howard, who didn't do anything good to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grueling!","review":"Ron Howard, Tommy Lee Jones, and Kate Blanchett...you'd think this would be a winning combination.

Sure, it's got some nice description of the Keys and the minor characters and their bickering are lively and sometimes amusing but that doesn't redeem this novel. I couldn't care less about the protagonists - Kelsey and Dane never came to life for me and their romance was far from convincing.

But at least in this book we didn't have characters \\"flexing their fingers\\" on every page as well.The plot is thin, the murderer transparent, and the book a total waste of time.

He captures the mood of the Cold War and gives you a sense of the rude awakening the United States experienced when the USSR beat it into space. Then the book ranges into the responses of the US and the USSR to Sputnik, covering the space race to its end on the moon.All of the material is carefully brought together and conveyed in such a way that you keep reading long after you needed to put the book down and do something else.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys history.

They are pictures taken at random that do not represent - sometimes - the best view of the village.But what is most dissapoiting in this book is the poor information about the villages, its populations, culture and location. In my opinion, every descrition of each village should also contain a map of its location in southern France (for us to know how could one get there), its population (to see how big it is), a some info on the villages picturesque points, etc. The few paragraphs dedicated to each village are too vague.Finally, I think the editor should have made this book differently with half the villages and twice the pictures and info about them.

I guess we'll have to wait for Cardwell to finally publish."},{"rating":"2","title":"coffin clutch","review":"Well I was expecting this to be more like a coffin box, with more width and 3D definition as it seems a little flat and boring/skimmpy. I wanted to use this not only for my vampire costume but also for bringing it out every now and again but I think it's only going to be a one time use. With that being said, it goes nicely with the costume and is big enough to but some cards/ids, small makeup, and a small camera or phone. I wouldn't put anything too heavy in it as I don't trust the material to hold up too well. The jeweled cross is the best thing on this and the clutch looks better farther away (in my opinion) versus close up. There isn't much out there like this, so that's why I gave it four stars, it's not perfect but it will do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not One Recipe Has Gone Wrong!","review":"I've had this book for a few years and just love it.

It's a piece of junk and is going into the garbage as soon as I can find a replacement. You have to push the can over to the left slightly as you press the lever to lower the cutter into the can.

Amazon's exchange/refund policy would not cover it (because it stopped working after a little more than 30 days after I received it, although I wasn't able to actually install/use it for a couple of weeks after it arrived).

Characters are not well-developed, the plot involves a lot of \\"does he like me? moments and descriptions of teens and their problems that just do not ring true. The most interesting story line was the relationship of the wealthy riders and coaches with the Latino grooms. In better hands, it could be an involving story, but on the whole it was too superficial. It's not a bad book for young horse-crazy girls, but it's pretty unsophisticated even for a young reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I absolutely loved The Perfect Distance... I read it in one sitting! It covered the world of high-level junior competition surprisingly well. The only thing it didn't have going for it was that main charachter Francie didn't have a very strong relationship with her horse; but I also know that not many show circuit riders have a deep bond with their steeds.Apart from that one small thing, I found Ablon Whitney's work to be a masterpeice. This is a must-read for horsey teens!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book","review":"I loved this book! As an aspiring equitation rider hoping to do the \\"big eq's\\", or major junior riding competitions, this book gave some great insight into all the hard work involved in riding at the nation's highest levels. The storyline was fun and interesting, and the details about the horses were correct because they were actualy written by a rider, which is hard to come by. Overall, I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The benchmark of all books on Kent State","review":"This book provides the most comprehensive compliation of facts and evidence, providing photographs and eyewitness accounts that lead to an unmistakable, inescapable conclusion: The actions of the Ohio National Guard on May 4, 1970 were completely unprovoked.Unfortunately, those responsible for what could only be called a deliberate, criminal act were never prosecuted. After reading this, I strongly suggest you pick up The Kent State Coverup and read the rest of the story on how individuals within the Ohio National Guard literally got away with murder."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new news","review":"I was disappointed in this book. All it has to offer are the 5 s's which don't take up a whole book to understand. Additionally, if you've taken a child birth class you were most likely taught the 5 s's. Not worth the money. Very wordy and low on information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful but mostly hype - DO NOT BUY!","review":"There is a lot of hype over this movie. Don't get my wrong, the information is helpful, but definitely not worth $10. The Happiest Baby on the Block talks about the 1st three months of a baby's life as being kind of like the '4th trimester'. Don't expect to much out of them and try to create womb-like environments for them. Swaddle them, swing them, shush them, play white noise. Mostly stuff that you would do anyway with a baby. His techqniques for holding, swaddling, and rocking are worth seeing once, but you definitely don't have to buy the movie. Borrow from a friend or just ask someone about it. I received this Dvd as a gift and then re-gifted it because there is no reason to ever watch it more than once. There is definitely some nice information in this video but I never had some kind of sacred, \\"my baby calms down instantly\\" experience. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. It really just depends on your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic but Useful","review":"The Happiest Baby on the Block is something that I read while pregnant to get tips on what to do once the crying begins. I hear from girlfriends that this advice is actually excellent, so rather than just watch the video, I decided to read the book. Maybe not actually a great choice...The author comes across as pedantic and arrogant. I choose to believe that he has reason to feel so strongly about his miraculous calming skills (that's why he has written the book and started the 5 S's movement, after all, right?!), but found it hard to read, precisely because of this style. I am sure the advice will turn out to be right on, however, and I appreciated the in-depth look at why babies cry and how different cultures handle their infants. The video is probably sufficient, however!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old News","review":"I thought a lot of the information in this book is now written about in magazines and websites. I already knew about the S's and the 4th \\"trimester.\\" If you read magazines and websites you probably already know this info also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for new parents","review":"You just don't know what kind of child you are going to have, so this book is a must for first time parents. Anyone can benefit from it, but those of us with fussy babies (guess what, we have one!) will be so glad to have a solution to the shrieking. For anyone who wants to just read the middle two pages - there's a lot of good information in the details, even if some things are repeated. Buy the book; we are glad we did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a lifesaver!!","review":"I wasn't sure that the methods would REALLY work to calm our little girl, but I was willing to try anything. Everything that Dr. Karp said made sense as I was reading. I didn't use the sucking method because we didn't seem to need it. She loved the swaddling and the shushing. We would get weird looks from friends and family until they saw how quickly our little one calmed down. Definately worth the money to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful tips","review":"I really enjoyed the book. Some of the ideas of the \\"cavemen mommies\\" were a little far stretched for me, but overall I really thought it offered some useful advice. I can't wait for my baby to arrive so I can try the techniques on him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, but what he doesn't tell you is . . .","review":"Dr. Karp's tips, especially the 5 S's, are right on. They helped us a great deal with our colicky infant. But it takes him several hundred pages to present a few nuggets of wisdom. And those pages are not always easy or pleasant to read. New parents need succinct, practical advice, not page after page of theory and, \\"Some people think . . . but they're wrong!\\" Honestly, this would make a five-star pamphlet. What he should fill some of those pages with are tips on when and how to wean your baby off the 5 S's."},{"rating":"1","title":"All necessary information could be resumed in 2 pages","review":"While the core information presented in the book is quite interesting and useful, I believe it could have been summarized in two, maximum 10 pages. If the author really wanted to publish a book, he could have added some more information on breastfeeding, or on baby's psychology or anything else. But instead he is just talking about the same things over and over and over....Well, at least I could practice my speed reading skills, skipping pages of unnecessary repetitive information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Baby, Happy Boy","review":"I read this book when my son was a couple weeks old and he is now almost 4 years old. I held my baby almost non-stop for his first three months because of this book and am SO glad I did. It was not very difficult to get him used to not being held so much as I eased out of it after 3 months, and as a result, I had a very happy and confident baby who is the same way as a little boy. I get comments on how happy and well-adjusted he is. As far as sleeping, the book didn't help me much there; Joey has never been a good napper at all. I'm still giving this five stars because he had reflux at the time and our doctor at the time was not treating it aggresively enough. I think that may have had a lot to do with his poor napping. I highly recommend this book to new parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book and DVD have been lifesavers","review":"Dr. Karp's advice has been tremendously helpful! We got the book and DVD several months before our first child was born. We started using his techniques day one in the hospital to calm his crying. He is now 3 months old and still loves to be swaddled - he actually smiles while we wrap him! I don't think he has ever cried more than 5 or 10 minutes at a time when we swaddle him, put him on his side, rock and shhhh him. He usually calms instantly! He now sleeps swaddled for almost 10 hours at night. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a relief!","review":"This book really helped me through the first six weeks of my son's life. I disagree with a previous poster...not all infants become addicted to swaddling. Our son outgrew it around 3 months.Huzzah for Dr. Karp and his book. Even if a child loves being swaddled... is that really so terrible? I think it would be worse to have a crying newborn than a 6+ month old who can't sleep at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the DVD instead","review":"This book contains the advice you're looking for -- namely, now to calm your newborn -- but it's buried in anecdote after anecdote. If you want a helpful tutorial, skip the book and buy the DVD, which contains actual demonstrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this before the baby is born","review":"As other have said this is a very helpful book, especially for the first 6-8 weeks. Good practical tips that work. We ordered it about 3 weeks after our baby was born and wished we'd done it earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Works!","review":"Dr. Karp's techniques are incredible. That being said, the DVD is actually slightly more useful than the book, because it demonstrates exactly how to calm your baby. We have been using his techniques for the past 3 weeks with a newborn and they truly are amazing. I would highly recommend the DVD unless you really want to read another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.","review":"Our child had colic. Yep, we had a screamer. Dr. Harvey Karp's book had some interesting insights on to what colic may actually be. The bottom line, is that his 5 S's method worked for us. It calmed our baby down 99% of the time and rather quickly most of the time. If you are a visual person and not interested in the theories behind calming your newborn, just go for the DVD. It will save you a few hours of increasingly precious time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good core ideas","review":"The core ideas of this book are really good. However, they wasted the readers time with redundancy and fluff. Frankly, the entire book could have provided the same message in 15 pages. Seems like the author was just meeting the publisher's minimal page requirement."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 S's work","review":"Yes, I am a firm believer of 5 S's. However, IMHO, the book is a bit long for me. Too little material to fill 200+ pages. Nevertheless, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most important thing you will give your child: SLEEP","review":"Simply put, applying the principles of this book will ensure you a well-rested, happy child. IMPORTANT: If your child 'hates' swaddling, you are NOT doing it correctly (not tight enough, wrong size cloth {fabric swatches work fine}, etc). I swaddled my son for almost five months--and he was no weakling! He transitioned out of the \\"Five S's\\" easily, and now is a long-sleeping 2 year old.Remember parents, healthy sleep habits must be taught--this is a perfect way to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Miracle","review":"My baby wasn't colicky, but I wanted him to sleep through the night (so I could too).

What a godsend. I will buy this and a \\"miracle blanket\\" for all baby showers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy read","review":"Basic, easy to read in short intervals and before bedtime.

After reading so many different types of books that my head was spinning, the combination of this book and The Baby Whisperer changed my relationship with my newborn. Dr. Karp teaches you strategies to help ease your baby from life in the womb to life in the world. Not all strategies will work with every baby, but it is for certain that if you read this book, you will be more comfortable soothing your fussy baby.

We thought something was horribly wrong. People gave us advice that really didn't work. The doctor said we just had to wait it out and to try Milicon drops. Out of desperation, I went to the bookstore and found Dr. Karp's book and read it all in one night. The techniqes he describes really worked to soothe our baby and get her to fall and stay asleep! We were overjoyed. I only wish we would've found this book sooner, it would've saved us two months of anguish and sleep deprivation. I would recommend it to all pregnant moms/couples, even if your baby does not have colic. It would be extremely helpful in making your baby even happier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the point.","review":"It was nice learning the 5 S's. even though many already know these, seeing them put into an order was nice. However, I expected to learn something I didn't already know or couldn't google for free. This book didn't offer that. Besides the fact I had to skip a bunch of pages to get to the 'how to' and came to find out there's only one main 'how to' and no other options for different styles or personalities. At least it keeps me from investing in a three hour $75 class on the same subject. I do appreciate it being on Kindle so that I can grab my iPad easily if I need to reshare with husband or caregivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank the Gods for Dr. Karp and this Book!!","review":"I bought this book after reading the other reviews of it on amazon.com. It was my baby's third week, and he needed constant, constant holding, nursing and soothing. Now, that constant contact is part of attachment parenting, so it took awhile before I began to notice and accept that my baby was \\"High Need\\" aka colicky (he's my first)! I have never before reviewed a book, but the 5 S's are so gently effective I just had to write. My baby needs shhh-ing and swinging and he's as calm as limp spaghetti. Now he's needing the white noise machine or music in order to calm in the evening, and it's such a blessed relief for the whole family! I don't mind putting in the soothing time now that I can be nearly instantly effective. (Tip: turn on your baby monitor receiver without you monitor on and viola! instant white noise machine!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved my sanity","review":"This was recommended to me by a friend, who said it worked wonders for her son. I bought it two months before I had my daughter. It is a little preachy, but he makes sense and has backed everything in this book with medical studies. The cuddle cure really helped my daughter; she is a very, very happy 11 month old. I am very happy I had the cuddle cure and the education that I received from this book- it made me more confident and happier because I knew how to help my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BABY BOOK EVER","review":"For all you expecting and new parents I have only 4 words for you, BUY THIS BOOK NOW.We have a four-month-old son and I have read or attempted to read every newborn book written. Dr. Karp's book was the only one that truly made a difference in helping to get our son to sleep longer and teach us how to soothe him like experts. Even better is that the book is so very enjoyable to read and had us laughing the entire time. It is so difficult as a new parent to concentrate and focus on a baby care book and Dr. Karp's book was such fun to read and at the same time so unbelievably helpful. Thank you, thank you, thank you Dr. Karp!!!! Abbey Fox"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my sanity","review":"My beautifl baby girl changed at 5 weeks old. She cried for hours every day. She was diagnosed as a sensitive baby with Colic and Reflux. I was given this book as a present and had heard wonderful things about it but I thought that nothing in a book would help me now. I was wrong! I read the book and tried the 5 S's. They really worked. I even bought the video for my husband because I knew he would never read the book. It helped to see his ideas in action. Dr Karp helped me to find the position that was most comfortable for our daughter. I ended up having to hold her for 2 hours each evening but it was better than having her scream. It was really amazing to see her suddenly relax in my arms. She is 15 weeks old now and rarely needs the 5 S's anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Mom","review":"Being new parents, we weren't prepared for the fussy baby that we delivered. After two weeks of endless crying, a friend recommended we buy this book. It worked wonders for our daughter! She is now over two months old and we still swaddle her to allow her to sleep longer and rest more peacefully.I will buy this book for all my friends who are expecting!Thank you Dr. Karp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK advice, but condescending","review":"This book starts out talking about the wisdom of the \\"primitive\\" peoples of the world - I found that very condescending and hard to get past. The advice given is nothing more than what our pediatrician said to us, and a little common sense mixed in - definitely nothing revolutionary and certainly not worth wading through the stuff about the lost fourth trimester. Frankly, swaddle and cuddle your baby. There. Save yourself the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow... worthless","review":"It just said to swaddle the baby turn it on its side and SHHHHH really loudly in her ear! She loved being swaddled, but the SSSHHHHHing...yeah, kids like loud noises like vaccums and SHHHHing. Shocking. Try to match the pitch of your kids cry. you don't need this video. I can't believe i paid for this thing. It's like a 5 min. video. Worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me some practical info!","review":"I was given this book when I was in the hospital giving birth at 35 weeks. I thought this book went into far too much detail about the fourth trimester and how other cultures never put their babies down. I basically never put my baby down his first several months and now he doesn't sleep unless he's in my arms. In the western world, where families may live on the other side of the country, the support network isn't available and this method is not practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete rubbish","review":"We bought this book when we were expecting our first child. The claims it made to being the fool-proof method of calming a crying baby and ensuring sleep-filled nights were very appealing. I have two points to make. First, the techniques it discusses are very simple and can be learnt in less than five minutes. In fact they are widely described in many books and websites on babies. There is no neeed to buy a book specifically to learn these techniques least of all this one which is very long but starts repeating itself after the introduction. Secondly, I can now say from experience there is absolutely no calming technique that is going to work night after night. Sure, we've tried the ones in this book and sometimes they work. But often they don't. Please don't be fooled as we were into believing the author's claims of instant and regular success - this is complete garbage which is where this book belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"THis book is a good explanation of why swaddling and rocking are important but there is no \\"real\\" solution. It felt unnatural and did not make any difference in my child"},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"Received the book in a timely fashion, not in top top condition, but absolutely fine. I am teaching the course & wanted a hardcover book to refer to, not just the paperback provided with the course materials. SO, this one will work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please!","review":"Okay...I haven't read this book, but have heard about it from some young mothers. It is my opinion that the book simply states what most mothers just naturally do. Have you ever seen a mother holding a screaming baby without swaying, rocking, bouncing? And of course, it is written by a man, who has never been a mother, and is making a fortune!"},{"rating":"2","title":"essential for the first weeks at home with a newborn","review":"I only bought this book when my daughter was 1.5 month-old and she was naturally becoming a better sleeper. I reccomend reading it before having the baby, so you can use the techniques from day one at home. Now my daughter is almost 3 months and I barely swaddle her since she doesn't like it anymore. She does still respond to the shshhhhh sound, so I only use some of the 5 \\"s\\" technique with her.It is a good book overall and it approaches topics as the use of the pacifier, if you can spoil a baby by holding him too much, etc.. I feel more confident in what I am doing as a mom after reading it from a well respected pediatrician."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have","review":"We purchased the book, but watched the DVD in our pre-labor class at the hospital. The book provides more detailed information than the DVD, but I really did need to see it on the DVD to understand how all five steps worked together. THIS PROCESS REALLY DOES WORK!!! It will amaze you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Short and Sweet: It Worked","review":"I tend to distrust the so-called \\"experts\\" who suddenly come on the scene with a book and everyone begins raving about it. I, cynic extraordinaire, was watching A Place of Our Own on KCET and listening to the all-too-common wails of my 2-month-old when they announced that Dr. Karp would be appearing on the broadcast to demonstrate his methods for the day's topic: How to Calm a Cranky Baby. I was skeptical, especially when he got through The Five S's and it all seemed so Simple. I thought I had tried all that, but then he gave me the key piece that I'd been missing: a good swaddling technique. It made all the difference, and my son loves it! What's more, I love Dr. Karp's reasoning and approach. He described his research as a re-learning of lost methods that have been proven throughout history and across societies but that have disappeared from mainstream care. I applaud him for re-introducing common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for my screaming newborn","review":"This book was highly recommended to us when I was pregnant with my first baby last year. The first day, we brought our precious newborn home and she wouldn't stop screaming we immediately turned to the book for answers. We desperately read the entire thing and tried all of the suggestions, but nothing made a difference; she still screamed unconsolably. It left us feeling even more helpless and frustrated. She was eventually diagnosed with reflux, but even after we got her on Prevacid she was a fussy, screaming baby.There were a few things in the book that gave us hope that our baby wouldn't be this way forever, but that didn't make up for the fact that there was nothing we could do in the meantime to make the nightmare end. She finally started acting more like a \\"normal\\" baby (sleeping more, less screaming) around 4 months. I'm not sure what we could have done differently, but this book definitely didn't have the answers for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all soon-to-be parents","review":"If you only read one baby book, read this one! I found out about this book when my son was about 1 month old. I wish I had found out about it before he was born. My husband and I both read this and found it indispensable. It helps explain why newborns do what they do and what it all means. It basically explains that the first 3 months of a newborn's life is actually the \\"fourth trimester.\\" You can use the \\"5 S's\\" to help mimic life in the womb which helps baby transition to life outside of the womb. The first 6 weeks with our son was awful--in part because we didn't understand what he needed. He is now 10 weeks old and life is so good! I attribute it to 1) he's getting a little older, 2) THIS BOOK!, and 3) the Woombie. If you have a baby that resists swaddling, I highly recommend the Woombie. The Happiest Baby on the Block explains why swaddling is so important during the first 3 months. Buy this book and the Woombie and you'll be good to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 2nd part of the book","review":"First of all, I have to say this book has really, really helped out. So Thanks Dr. Karp for your teachings. I've been reading all about the 5 S, and what I like most is how confident is has made me feel taking care of my baby.Even though I like the book so much, I only give it 4 stars because it is somewhat tedious to read. The book has double the page it really needs.I recommend this book, it does have a lot of important info and explanation on how to help you and your baby feel happier and less frustrated on those first months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Book-Was so important to us","review":"We are so grateful we got this book. It is so intelligent. The auther talks about there being a \\"fourth Trimester\\" in which your baby needs to be close to you. Basically he says that you need to replicate the woom experience for your baby. You do this by swaddleing him, putting him in a sling, etc...We did all of this and our baby almost never cries because he knows that we know how to sooth him. I put this book on the top of my must have list and give it to all my friends having babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"New way to calm frustrated parents!","review":"This book is a life saver for any parent. I don't care if you're first timers or seasoned veterans, this book is a must! I've recommeded it to every one I know; new parents, grandparents, and parents-to-be. It will be my signature shower gift for the rest of my life. Moms, if you have a husband that wouldn't read a baby book to save his life, get the DVD, it teaches the basics in 20-30 minutes and you won't have to beg!At first you think Dr. Karp is a miracle worker, but after reading the book, everything just makes sense. It's changed my whole understanding of babies. I hope that more people buy this book so there are happy babies and parents all over the world. Thank you Dr. Karp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a dream for a new mom","review":"Based on my friends' and family's experiences, I imagined that, when my daughter was born, I'd have hours of crying to cope with as part of taking care of a baby. Thankfully, I had seen Dr. Karp on television and bought his book before she was born. From her first day, I used the five \\"s's\\". She is now 22 days old, and, I can honestly say, she has never cried more than half a minute since the day she was born, thanks to the techniques taught in this book.Dr. Karp's techniques should be taught to every mother in the country before leaving the hospital. I've given the book to my whole family to read so that our daughter has consistency of care and can be soothed by any of us in an instant."},{"rating":"2","title":"so helpful!","review":"We have twin girls and found this book to be immensely helpful just after they were born. The 5 S's really worked for us (THANK GOD they liked the swings!). Swaddling worked really well for us too. Not all babies are alike, but this book taught us a lot of things about how to soothe newborns very quickly (I was able to read this in the crazy midnight hourse after they were first born and used the information immediately.) We just watched the sequel (Happiest Toddler on the Block) on DVD and also find it useful. We are big fans of Dr. Karp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tried and True Methods","review":"I recommend this book to all new parents. I read this book before my son was born, and it was an eye opener. We all think we \\"know\\" what a baby needs or wants when it's born. Most of us get that a baby will need a clean diaper and a full stomach, but what happens when those two needs are met and baby keeps screaming?The methods that Dr. Karp describes are common sense driven with foundations in science. Before reading this book, it would have never occured to me that being in the outside world is very quiet compared to the noise level in the womb, and that being wrapped up like a burrito while experiencing the \\"jello head jiggle\\" is comforting!!!!This book is a LIFE SAVER!!!! I think it should be handed out at all Obstetrician's offices and in \\"baby boot camps\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT book for new parents","review":"I ordered The Happiest Baby on the Block for a friend after reading it myself when I had my child. I read a few books in preparation for, and during, those first few months, but this one, I found the most helpful. It addressed so many of the things I was feeling and my baby was going through--and gave me multiple solutions and theories (not just one that may or may not work). I appreciated all the advice while still reminding me that there are some things that you may not figure out, and not to worry, your baby WILL grow out of it! It also had some humor in it, which is so important when you are stressed out in those first few months with a newborn.All in all, it is a GREAT book that I HIGHLY recommend to new parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!","review":"Dr. Harvey Karp has come up with a way to help parents deal with their colicky newborns that actually works. He explains everything so clearly and the best part is that this works immediately. No more crying babies, crying parents, or endless walking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"We are expecting our first child and this book has been so helpful. I haven't used any of the techniques yet since our baby is not due until June, but the theory makes sense and I am excited to try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying","review":"I think people love this method which is fine. I'll probably use it but it's not worth buying to read. I heard there was a dvd. This book should simply be an article because that's the length of real content in the book. I am not a fan of books which constantly repeat the same things over and over again. I kept hoping I would read new things as I continued to read, but it was the same stuff throughout the book. It feels like they decided a certain length of book sells for a certain amount so just keep adding filler to get to that price point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basics book","review":"We got this book upon a recommendation from another parent and a therapist with a newborn. It was a fast read and many folks have since to just watch the DVD which is on netflixs. The book is a fast read however, and I will probably refer back to it, so I don't mind having spent a bit more money and time to have read it.The book is well written and straight forward. I'm not sure he needs to sell the method as much as he does in the book - after all, you're reading it because you are interested in what he has to say. Overall, makes a lot of sense and hopefully will give us a different and healthy way to bond with baby when she gets here that will support her continued development and transition to life outside the uterus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for new parents","review":"I enjoyed this book and suggest reading it BEFORE baby gets here. Unlike me who ordered it when he was 2 months old and I was desperate. The tricks/ suggestions in this book totally worked for our baby and he STTN at about 12 weeks. I was stunned. He's still a great sleeper and a happy baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"Great book! It takes things you may already know and puts it in a way that helps you to help your baby. It also brings up points that you may have never thought of to help your baby (and you) rest better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money- get the DVD instead","review":"This book was too confusing. I got the DVD instead and it is worth every penny! The DVD is the best 25 minutes you will spend! It clearly demonstrates the swaddling technique that is not too clear in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happens at 4, 5, 6 months?","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said that the 5 S's worked like a charm for the first three months. I recommended the book to all of my pregnant friends because our baby slept so well and was so easy to soothe. HOWEVER, now our baby is almost 6 months old, and the 5 S's do not work anymore. In the last week, she now takes about 1.5 hours to calm down enough to go to sleep. She screams if I wrap her, and she screams if I unwrap her. Dr. Karp makes the reader feel that all of a sudden at four months, your baby doesn't need a swaddle, can find her thumb and feel secure all on her own. She did seem more like a baby, not like a fetus, at four months, but I really feel she never learned how to self soothe, and the confidence I had when she was a newborn is gone! I really feel like I don't know what I'm doing anymore!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The miracle \\"off switch\\" for crying","review":"Our baby daughter is not colicky, but like all newborns has times when she's screaming like the world is coming to an end. Thanks to the techniques in this book, we discovered the position in which we can hold her, and the two other things we do at the same time, that shut down her crying within 10 seconds. Dr. Karp calls it the calming reflex, but whatever you want to call it, it allows the baby to calm down enough to eat (and hopefully sleep!). New parents will find this book well worth the money. And it makes a great baby shower gift!The DVD is a great companion to the book, because you see visual and auditory proof that the techniques work, and you see a visual demo of proper swaddling technique. We have both and I'm glad we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book for new mom peace of mind","review":"I was very lucky to have an easy baby but when I was pregnant I was terrified of what I would do if he was collicky. This book helped me feel much more confident about how I would deal with problems and when they came up, I did what the book recommended and it worked. My baby is 6 months now and still a very easy, non-collicky baby but i pull some of these tricks out of my bag when I need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"He should have written a pamphlet","review":"I'm actually pretty disappointed with this book. The information he presents is good, as far as the steps to soothing a fussy baby. However, I don't think he needed to write a whole book to share that information. Instead, he could have just written a 10-page pamphlet. Most of the book is repetitive and full of stuff that I, as a mom-to-be, couldn't care less about. Seriously, I don't care why ape babies millions of years ago held on to their mothers; just tell me what to do with my baby now. If you want to know the \\"secrets\\" he offers, look up the youtube videos. You can learn the skills in 5 minutes instead of the hours it takes to read the book. Reading the book is a total waste of time if you're looking for useful information and applicable skills, since most of the pages are filled with fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifesaver!","review":"I swear by this book, the techniques work like magic, and it made me feel okay about letting my baby sleep in the swing. I would not only recommend this book to all new parents, I would say that it is absolutely a requirement to read if you have a new baby or will soon. Don't have a baby without it! It's also a very interesting read. I absolutely loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Karp gives it a five star but... I don't!","review":"I read this book cover to cover, not knowing how to deal with my colicky baby. We tried everything and nothing worked. We saw Dr. Karp and he demonstrated his famous shooshing sound while pounding my then 6 month old baby's back real hard. My son looked at him like \\"what are you doing to me?\\" His suggestion at the end of our appointment was \\"Read my book and call me and tell me what you think, will ya? I need to know if I am brilliant or not.\\" He also thought our son was 6 weeks old (normal healthy well-developed 6 month old!). My husband and I were shocked. We were so unimprssed by both Karp himself and the book! Besides there's nothing new in this book and is extremely poorly written!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I live this book!","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK! I love his common-sense, loving approach to baby care. I have twins, and I don't know how we would have survived it without this book. I've recommended it to every new mom I've met. My babies hardly had to cry, because we were always able to quiet them with these techniques. I hear stories from so many moms whose babies cried and cried, and they were unable to comfort them. I wish they'd known these techniques. I was rarely frustrated. My twins are now 20 months old, and they're doing GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all expectant parents","review":"My daughter is 5 weeks old and I read this and watched the DVD during my pregnancy. You know how people say you can never prepare yourself for parenthood? Well they're wrong...YES YOU CAN with this book!

It's fun and so easy to read that I got through the whole thing in a day and started immediately using the 5 S's with my little son. He wasn't colicky, but as a new parent I really didn't know what I was doing. This book helped me understand WHY my son was crying and taught me EXACTLY how to calm him down (which really helped me stay calm...too). This is the now gift I'm bringing to EVERY baby shower I go to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"This book has been the most helpful book of all! I have told everyone parent I know about it. I used the methods on my then 4 week old son right after I read the book. He became calm in couple of minutes and then asleep within ten minutes. Before using Dr. Karp's techniques my son was having daily crying sessions that lasted five plus hours and nothing worked to calm him. I am just thrilled that there is something so simple to comfort my baby. I am also pleased that he supports breastfeeding and writes about co-sleeping in a positive way.This book is a wonderful tool for any parent. You will not regret this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for new parents!!","review":"I live in the Los Angeles, CA area, and I had heard of Dr. Harvey Karp before I had my daughter. I was given his book when I gave birth to her, and started to read it. I am blessed with a very easy going baby (so far!), so I did not have to do the 5 S's very often. The biggest gift Dr. Karp gave us though was SWADDLING! She would instantly be calmed if we swaddled her. It was amazing! And still is swaddled! She is five and half months old and I still swaddle her! And I will continue as long as she wants it! She has been sleeping through the night for several months and has 3 solid naps a day, I think because of swaddling!I would highly recommend this book and also a \\"Swaddle Me\\" blanket for every new parent. These two things will be baby shower gifts for all my friends having babies. Buy this book now if you have a crying newborn and swaddle away! Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but could be shorter","review":"I haven't had my baby yet, but I know I will be using the 5 S's when I do.

Unfortunately, the author has decide it to wrap his advice in the rather unconvincing idea that evolution has stupidly decided to bring babies into the world before the they are ready to handle it. Swaddling babies is not a new idea and has been successfully practiced in baby care for centuries without the \\"fourth trimester\\" theory.The author also makes frequent general assertions that \\"primitive cultures\\" in Africa and Asia possess inherent cultural wisdom that permits them to always treat their babies right. This idea, although complimentary of those \\"primitive cultures\\" (as he calls them, though with the quotation marks), is inherently racist, and Karp never back up such assertions with actual data or by quoting studies.I wish Dr. Karp would just stick to providing his useful advice and keep his half-baked theories about the fourth trimester and the inherent wisdom of \\"primitive cultures\\" to himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"same ol' stuff","review":"this book was very highly recommended to me from all my girlfriends with new babies, but after reading through it, I found it to be just a whole lot of common sense stuff written the same way in many different chapters. The author seemed to try to re-invent the wheel with his theories about colic and reflux and with each chapter, he just repeated himself.

I think it does have useful information in it, but it could have been writen in a 30 page book as opposed to how it was writen.

I found myself starting to just skim it because I lost interest after the second chapter. It is very repetitive and for me it was nothing that I hadn't already heard before about soothing a fussy baby. I had twin babies - who I believe both were colicky - and I didn't refer to this book once. I think most of the methods described are common knowledge. Also, there is a lot of talk about the missing \\"fourth trimester\\" and how mothers in other countries raise babies. To me, it was not relevant. I would suggest using your instinct, talk to other mothers, and do some research online and you will save yourself time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the money.","review":"I feel that this book should be a must read for all new parents.

I only wish I had read it before our son was born and we were dealing with colic. The \\"5 S's\\" really work! The techniques are simple and if you follow the directions, you can learn to calm the baby down MUCH faster than you could without these techniques. We were at the end of our rope, feeling like we were walking on eggshells wondering if this would be a night that Alex had a colic spell or would we escape for a night? It was miserable, and you feel so helpless when your baby is crying and nothing you do soothes him. Our pediatrician told us we would have to \\"wait it out\\" for several weeks until the colic phase passed. I would have lost my mind if we had not found this book! I have since recommended it to anyone and everyone I know having a baby, because even if the baby doesn't have colic, all babies cry at some point, and this book is invaluable!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver!","review":"Hands down, this was the single most essential baby item we had for our daughter.

This is the best resource I have read as a new Mom. The information is organized in such a way that I was able to easily memorize the five S's to comfort my baby. This book should be given to every new parent. I read it when my son was 3 weeks old, but wished I had the information even sooner. The information is geared for the first 3 months of the baby's life. I have read a lot of baby books, but this one was the best! I highly recommend it. It changed our lives quickly and our son who is almost 3 months old continues to benefit from the information we learned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to help parents with crying & colic","review":"This book is excellent. Dr Karp not only teaches you the techniques to help your infant cry less and be happier, but he also explains the theory & why it works. In addition, he goes into other theories of colic, and explanations about them. As a pediatrician, I found this fascinating and very useful.

I bought this book when she was 5 weeks old and when she fussed I'd do the 5 s's in the book and all of a sudden she was napping for an hour a two. What a miricle! I would almost say you could skip the first half of the book on the history of colic and why there is no such thing and jump straight to the five s's. I've passed my copy along to friends that have all found it very helpful also. One is even a nurse that used it with her second child and told the ob floor at the hospital to start recommending to it new moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You, Dr. Karp","review":"Some of the things Dr. Karp writes seem a bit silly and maybe even extreme, but the 5 S's work for my 8 week old daughter. At 2 weeks, I told my boyfriend that we must just have a colicky baby and we would have to deal with it. Then a neighbor loaned me this book. Now she sleeps 6 hours a night, eats, then sleeps another 3 hours because of these techniques. This book is definately worth reading and at least trying. I bought one each, for 2 of my friends who are expecting and I would recommend it highly to anyone who is having trouble with a fussy baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy one baby book, buy this one!","review":"We LOVE this book. I'd also recommend the DVD/Video, which is very useful in helping to master the practial aspects of baby calming. Our baby is 7 weeks old. At 2 weeks he started having colic symptoms - screaming and seeming to be having digestive pains, particularly at night-time. The pediatrician diagnosed reflux and put him on antacids, and I was also advised to give up dairy products. However the really marked improvement came when we recieved this book and DVD (a kind gift from my Uncle, who is a pediatrician). My husband started doing the 5 Ss very rigorously (strong swaddling, and he even went out and bought a white noise machine). The techniques have never once failed to calm the baby down, even when he is working up quite a storm! All in all, I would say that your book has helped restore the sanity of two very tired new parents, and made one new baby much more contented. We are recommending the book to all the new parents we know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common sense that works","review":"The methods outlined in this book work. We spent the first few weeks with our daughter swaddling, swaying, etc and she was a great newborn. The book is written in an easy to read, informative style. I feel like a lot of books on newborns are basically a list of things to worry about. This book is refreshing because it offers explanations for your newborn's behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Could Not Have Survived Without Dr. Karp","review":"Dr. Karp is wonderful! I only wish I found out about the book before I had my son. Unfortunately I struggled for 5 weeks before someone recommended it. I ran out, bought the book and the first night I had a quiet sleeping baby!!!! I strongly recommend this book to anyone that needs it. Dr. Karp helped us turn our screaming baby into \\"the happiest baby on our block\\"!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the newborn baby whispering book!","review":"My son was not that fussy and was sleeping the normal 3-4 hours at a time. Then my mom gave me this book and I followed the instructions and instantly my baby starting sleeping 6-7 hours consistently at only 6 weeks old. If he did get fussy, I always knew how to calm him down as well. A must read for new parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh. It's OK, but...","review":"This book could easily have been half its published length. There are some good tips, but it's very repetitive. After at least six chapters that began and ended by reminding me that a newborn baby is really a \\"fetus in its fourth trimester\\", I was ready to start screaming uncontrollably myself.Finally, I skipped to the part about how to swaddle, then never referred to the book again. For me, this book was a waste of time. I'd have been better off just Googling \\"swaddling\\" and downloading the instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"One idea, lots of fluff...","review":"I have no idea how come so many intelligent people like this book and talk about it like it's the discovery of the century. There is ONE idea in the book (the fourth trimester) and one practical set of advice summarized in 5 words: swaddle, swing, shush, side and suck. The rest is fluff. The whole amount of information could have been fit on one index card, no need for a book.Maybe the structure of the book works best if you are reading it already sleep deprived and your brain cannot handle complex sentences and you actually need all that repetitive stuff.So, bottom line: swaddle your child, stick a pacifier in his/her mouth, rock the baby in your arms and sooth him/her by shushing (I really don't buy the author's suggestion that a roaring vacuum cleaner is the next best thing to the noises of the womb)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work with us.","review":"One of the 5 steps in this book is swaddling, and my baby HATES this since he was born... so this book was useless for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE. THE BOOK IS IN GREAT CONDITION, IT IS THE EXACT ONE I NEED FOR MY CLASS, AND IT CAME IN TWO DAYS."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"this book helped me alot in those middle of the night \\"she won't stop crying\\" moments his suggestions were dead on and she stopped crying every time. I'd buy it again if I weren't hugging my current copy to my [...]:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr Karp is a GENIUS","review":"No kidding, this doc is a GENIUS. I first saw him on TV and couldn't believe what I was watching: a screaming baby calmed in seconds??? TRUE! I bought this book when I was still pregnant and learned all the techniques so that by the time our baby was born, we knew how to do them all. Then in the hospital, she never cried and has been an ANGEL ever since. This book is as necessary to a new monther's arsenal as diapers. NO KIDDING. I have now got a standard shower gift for anyone I know who is having a baby. It is worth its weight in GOLD. (The DVD is AMAZING too!!!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information","review":"I thought the information and techniques shared were very helpful and they actually work. While I don't have a colicky baby, I definitely have a high needs baby. These techniques seem so simple that I thought none of them would make a difference but they did when done as the author suggest."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Childbirth Educator","review":"Great information to the new parent, some of which I plan to include in my childbirth class. Chipman RN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book every mother should read and only a couple bucks on Amazon!","review":"This is an older book, but the methods still apply. Every mother should read this book. It has been a great help with our newborn. The swaddling and sound machine not only help to put her to sleep, but she stays asleep longer, too. She is one of those infants who doesn't want to miss out on anything and we found that going to a dark room helps to settle her so she can fall asleep much quicker. I highly recommend this book for new parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great baby shower gift","review":"This book and video are the best gift you can give to first time parents. I recommend the video, since you have so little down time with a newborn and you see examples of the techniques. It is amazing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Era in Parenting","review":"Finally, Dr. Karp has exposed the colic \\"poo poo\\" that has driven parents and babies nuts for years. A great read, but if you're too sleep-deprived to focus on a page, buy the video or DVD for a great 38 minute overview."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but methods are not sustainable throughout the day","review":"Like many reviewers have said, this stuff could have filled a pamphlet instead of a whole book. The five S's sometimes work a little to calm my fussy baby, but I can not walk around with a swaddled baby swinging in my arms with white noise following us all day. I suppose if my baby would tolerate the swing, these methods would allow me to eat a meal.The other thing that drives me crazy about this book is the amount of people who ask me if I've read it when they see me and my fussy baby. I've shushed until my teeth were numb, I can swaddle in the dark, and I can't stand anymore without rocking back and forth. Yes, I read the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for all babies","review":"This book gives great suggestions for all types of babies. My son was very difficult to burp and the methods in this book really helped. Also, the shhhhh sound that the book describes soothes a fussy baby. Great to read and in my opinion much better than Baby Wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help for frazzled parents","review":"My son was already 8 weeks old when I came across this bookhe was going through a fussy period nearly every night betweenthe age of 6 to about 14 weeks. I found some techniques on calming my son that really worked. I like this book so muchI will keep buying it for all my friend's baby showers - andsoon I will purchase \\"The Happiest Toddler on the Block\\" too.Just had a hard time finding large blankets to swaddle him,no other complaints!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a lifesaver!","review":"My husband and I saw this video at a childbirth class and now I'm going to buy it for a couple of friends of mine who are expecting. Now that we have our newborn (who's only 2 weeks old) we've tried these techniques and all I have to say is \\"WOW!\\" It's definitely helped us with calming our son during some pretty tough times. I can't say that it works for us 100% of the time since we're still getting used to things, but it has definitely helped. My mom, who never used any of these techniques, was amazed at how easy it was to learn and how quickly you can watch a baby go from screaming to quiet and content. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has a newborn."},{"rating":"2","title":"great help so far","review":"My baby is 5 weeks old and has been fussing since week 1 getting progressively worse each day. My husband and I were getting desperate and also not enjoying parenthood at all, and even worse dreading the next several months. I started using the techniques described in this book just yesterday and last evening was the first evening in quite a while that we did not have to tag team holding a screaming baby while the other one took a break. While it has only been 24 hrs the changes have been quite remarkable so far. Also, I have noticed that my baby when awake and alert is less fussy-it is like the sleep she is getting now is more quality. I highly recommend this book for all parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A happy long flight","review":"I used this technique on a baby on a flight from Europe. The baby had been crying for hours and could not be soothed. Once in the plane I told the flight attendant that I could help....I am a nurse-midwife. I sat next to the father, who spoke no English, took the baby and applied the technique. The baby calmed down within minutes and was quiet for the next 9 hours!!!! After I did this,everyone in the airplane clapped and cheered. I taught the technique to the parents. The flight crew brought me presents!!! My travel companion was totally amazed that the family let me try it with the baby, but the crying was distressful."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolute magic!!!","review":"My wife and I just laughed and laughed over how effective Dr. Karp's calming techniques work. We just couldn't believe it! Our first baby cried and cried, but our new second baby has been a dream come true thanks to this book. And regardless of what an earlier reviewer said, not everything in this book is obvious and already known...in fact, some of it is downright counterintuitive. I can't recommend this book enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE FOR COLIC!!","review":"The combination of the calming techniques in this book did wonders for our colicky baby. Now we can calm her down in minutes, and for the past three nights that we've tried the book's suggestions, she has slept for 5 hour stretches which is amazing to us, never thought we'd see it!We were concerned about swaddling anymore at this age (6 weeks) because 'What to Expect the First Year' says that swaddling after one month can lead to stunting your baby's growth. Not true! I used to think the 'What to Expect...' books were a must-have - now I wouldn't recommend any book for dealing with colic except Dr. Karp's!!! Wish I'd had this book the day our baby was born!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.......","review":"I found this book to be invaluable and would certainly recommend it to anyone who is about to have a baby even if it is not your first."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMFG i needed this book so bad!!","review":"Im a first time dad and I need this book. Good, solid info that will help you thru this whirlwind of shitty piss filled diapers, sleepless nights and nerve shattering sounds of a baby crying. Use the book and you will have a peaceful happy existence with your bundle of joy, dont use the book and you end up like that lady that super glued her kids hand to the wall. Dont be like that lady that super glued her kids hand to the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too repetitive and boring","review":"The book is repetitive and pointlessly wordy to the point of becoming boring and annoying. I agree with the reviewers who wrote that the entire book content could be summarized in a pamphlet. I didn't like the author's writing style either, but this might be just a matter of taste.I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond overrated","review":"This is one of the most overrated books I've ever come across. Skimming the book is all you need to get anything out of it, because it's extremely repetitive - and if you've educated yourself on babies' sleep needs, etc., you won't find anything new in this book. Much better books that worked for us are the Baby Whisperer and Good Night, Sleep Tight - our baby has been sleeping through the night since 2 months without crying - and we trusted ourselves that our son really didn't like having his arms swaddled. The Happiest Baby on the Block methods are not for every baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"My baby has been very colicky in the evenings and this book has been sooo helpful in calming him. It is such a simple easy solution that any parent can use and it always seems to work. It has restored our confidence, calmed our baby and has made our lives easier. My only complaint about this book is that it is such a simple concept that this book could have been written in one chapter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful but sometimes a bit simplistic","review":"While I support what Dr. Karp says about creating a womb-like atmosphere during your baby's \\"fourth trimester,\\" not all of his advice rang true for me. My first baby was very fussy and not easily soothed, and I don't think that anything would have prevented the weeks and weeks of colicky behavior that we endured. I'm a big fan of Dr. Sears' book The Fussy Baby -- the bible for parents like me who were blessed with \\"high needs\\" babies. :-) The main thing to remember is that this too shall pass. Your baby won't always be this fussy and this needy. And some day you will sleep again. (Or at least until baby number two arrives. I'm pregnant again!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for older babies","review":"After reading these reviews I rush-ordered this book. I was disappointed to find that the entire book is for newborn babies only. Once your baby is too old to swaddle this book isn't for you. I purchased several others at the same time and found that The No Cry Sleep Solution has great ideas for all babies and even toddlers.The ideas in this book cannot be applied to a baby that is over about 3 months old. If you look at the main points you'll see they are: swaddling, placing on his side or stomach, saying Shhhh, Swinging, and Sucking. I also suspect that if you always do this with your newborn you may create sleep problems for when you can't do them any more.Beware! If your baby is over 3 months this isn't the book you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"some useful advice but full of clichés and too long","review":"Pro:The book offers useful advice about how to calm your baby.Cons:It is very repetitive and contains a lot of filler pages. The whole thing could (and should) be summarized in about 20 concise pages rather than waste the precious hours of tired new parents with irrelevant case stories.Also, the advice in the book is wrapped in a pseudo-anthropological narrative that fuses dubious speculation about human evolution with highly racialized clichés about child-rearing in non-Western societies. In short, the book contributes to the romantic (and racist) myth that non-Western societies are better at dealing with babies because they are supposedly more in touch with \\"nature\\". The corollary of that argument is of course that non-Western societies are stereotyped as backward and primitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tips for settling a young baby","review":"This core message of this book is the \\"5 S's\\", but it gives lots of information on each one. There isn't much useful information in the introduction chapters, so I would recommend just jumping to the chapters which explain what the 5 S's are and how to use them. The book is easy to read and follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy baby means happy parents","review":"Our 5 weeks old baby started to get fussy at night but we implemented the suggestions of this book and it's been much, much better"},{"rating":"2","title":"It simply works -- Read the 1st chapter and you'll cut 50% of the crying immediately!","review":"I heard about this from a buddy with a recent newborn, and he was swearing by it. I downloaded it on Kindle while we were still in the hospital room, and was implementing the \\"5 S's\\" system immediately for our newborn. I'll be using this system for all of our children."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good idea, 100 pages of padding","review":"Karp's theory about calming newborns -- a good theory, as far as it goes -- could have been stated in about three pages. Since there's no money to be made with a three page book, he has to pad it out some.Unfortunately most of the padding involves either sniping at other techniques for calming newborns or else patting himself on the back for his own genius in having the theory he's got. He seems to be waiting for the phone call from the Nobel Prize people. That part is fairly nasty to read. Skim the book in the bookstore to get the important parts without the fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not help","review":"My daughter has a very colicy baby. I Purchased the book when the baby was 3 months old with hopes we would find something that would help calm him and help him sleep. The advice did not work. In fact, we had already tried everything the book advised. The book may be great for a normal baby but I can't recommend it if your baby has colic."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This book proved to be a complete waste of my money - for pages and pages this guy goes on about reasons why babies cry - wet, hungry, needs to be swaddled etc....I mean the 5 reasons he mentioned can be printed on one page the rest of the book is a waste....What to expect the first year is far more useful of a resource"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my life!!!","review":"This book saved my husband and I! The first night home with our son he cried all night long! Around midnight I could not handle it any more. I had bought this book before the baby was born but hadn't read it yet. I sat down and read the book. At 4 am my baby was still crying with my husband and my husband was at his wits end. I used the 5S's that were explained in the book. Within 20 minutes my son was out like a light. (And so was my husband) We used this method and my son did not have anymore crying fits like that again. He is now 19 months and I have just purchased Dr. Karps The Happiest Toddler. I can't wait to see how it works! Thank you Dr. Karp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaving","review":"I love this book! It saved our lives, we had premature twins and with the help of this book and miracle blankets (found at miracleblanket.com) our babies started sleeping through the night before 8 weeks! Now I buy these two items for all my first time mom-to-be friends!! Great advice that makes sense, easy to use and read, even when you're sleep deprived and unable to see straight!!At first I felt silly trying the calming techniques, but they really work! My mother and mother in law thought I was crazy until they saw the magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Self-Help Book on Understanding Babies","review":"I came across the book when I was pregnant. All I can say is, I have read many books on child care and when my baby was born, I pretty much toss out all the books I read except for this one. I would not know how I would survive if I did not know Dr. Karp's techniques. For all new mothers out there, this book is a godsend. Thanks, Dr. Karp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sleepless in ny","review":"this is one of the many books i bought about sleeping problems and i found this book, to the point and very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading for first time parents","review":"This book was recommended to my wife and I by friends who had a colicky baby. They found it the only way to help their baby calm down (that and a trip to the doctor's to check to allergies, which you should do to rule out food allergies if you suspect colic).So far my wife and I have found the book useful and our infant does not seem to have colic. It is useful for getting the infant back to sleep from hour one of their life. The techniques worked wonders and the reasoning behind the techniques makes perfect sense to this layman. The techniques are also useful for calming your baby. For instance if you need to feed but the baby is too upset to take to the breast.All in all a life saver. Yes, your baby will still cry and sometimes not even the techniques here work, but 95% of the time you and your baby can have peace.I would get this book for anyone who is going to have a baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWESOME book-- but get it from your local library","review":"This book should have been a pamphlet. The information is GREAT-- and specific, but the book repeats itself in every single chapter. Successive chapters are more-or-less the same thing in different words. There is a two page spread at the center of the book that summarizes the whole thing. If you skim the entire book and photocopy the center pages, you have more than enough to practice the technique. If I knew this, I would not have purchased the book, but would have just picked it up from my local library.However, don't let this deter you from reading it-- the author gives EXCELLENT advice on how to make a crying baby happy. he basically argues that \\"colicy\\" infants are a product of how we tend to raise babies-- and have nothing to do with any physical ailment whatsoever. He claims that almost NO other cultures have anything like \\"colic\\" and he answers the question \\"why\\" with a series of steps that restrict, soothe, and make your baby happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a great book","review":"The 5 things he writes are great, ones we've used for generations. So glad they are now written down, but he could have made it into a pamphlet. I think it was deceptive when he said \\"if you do it correctly\\"... There's his out to his claim to make babies stop crying. The fact is, some babies cry. Mom's rock, swaddle, sing, use a binky and they still cry, bless their hearts. The devoted and frustrated mom hasn't done anything incorrectly, it's just how some sweet little ones are. And besides, how does he know what the cave-women thought, anyway? I'm shaking my head at how he made so much money by giving so little advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for First Time Parents!","review":"During my daughter's third week, she began to cry consistently for several hours in the evening. My husband and I were convinced it was colic. My sister-in-law, knowing how exhausted we were, researched information regarding colic on the web and sent it to us. She found an article describing Dr. Karp's techniques and then sent us The Happiest Baby on the Block. We read it and learned how to help our baby, quickly learning that it was first-time parents not aware of how to comfort their baby girl (despite having 16 nieces and nephews!).When a friend of mine had her baby a month later, I recommended that she purchase the book as well (it's actually one of my 'must have books' on a list I give friends who are having their first baby). Her baby truly had colic; following your recommendations, she swore by your book as she saw significant improvement. She now gives The Happiest Baby on the Block as a baby shower gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swaddling - Happiest Baby on the Block","review":"When my son was born this past February, my neighbor lent me the book and video (Happiest Baby on the Block). I started to swaddle my son at approximately 2 weeks old with a sqare blanket. I then learned that babies r us offered a blanket called \\"swaddle me\\" which I immediately purchased. Ever since I started swaddling my son in the \\"swaddle me\\", he started sleeping through the whole entire night at about 9 weeks old (He was able to free himself from the square blanket). He has continued to sleep through the evening and he is 23 weeks old.

Since my 1st child wasn't colicky, the screaming fits I was experiencing with my 2nd was all new to me.I tried the 5 S's 1 night after enduring 2 weeks of screaming fits and I was amazed at the results. My son went from a clenched screaming monster to a sleeping angel within 5 minutes. I could not believe it. Not only can we now eat dinner without the stress of a screaming infant, but he has also started sleeping better at night by using the techniques at bedtime.I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone that has a fussy or colicky baby - it will change your baby in a matter of minutes.This book has been so useful I have told everyone I know about it & recommend it without hesitationTHANK YOU DR KARP!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a lifesaver!","review":"As soon as he was born, our son was an extremely fussy baby. Our biggest problem was that we could not get him to go to sleep and stay asleep for more than 30 minutes. He always seemed very unsettled and he was obviously overly-tired. We had tried everything we could think of, and we were exhausted and at our wits' end. My mother-in-law got us this book after a friend suggested it to her. The first time we tried the 5 S's, it was like a miracle! Our little boy finally seemed comfortable and could sleep peacefully. He is now 1 month old, and is sleeping like a normal baby. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a fussy baby. Dr. Karp is a lifesaver!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for new parents of colicky babies","review":"This book is not only very interesting but also enlightening about the source of colic and steps towards a remedy. After trying everything I read this book about utilizing the \\"five S's\\" and discovered that the method works. The only difficult aspect is trying to swing the baby for long periods of time. This tends to lead to pulled arm muscles if the baby is very fussy. All in all this book is a great resource for all those red-eyed and frustrated parents looking for answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandma's Helper","review":"I just became a grandmother, and a friend (another grandmother) raved about this DVD.

Truly amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book or the class for anyone","review":"I took the happyist baby on the block class. I was very sad by it, first as other people have said it is mostly common sense but he also advocates the use of a pacifier, never once mentioned the calming effects of breastfeeding or wearing your baby. Also this is not a cure all for every single tiny cry the best way to help keep your child from fussing is to HOLD them.A much better book with tons of information is Dr Sear's The Baby Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good if your baby is colicky","review":"I bought this book when I was still pregnant and did my best to get through it. That was difficult because it is incredibly repetitive. I don't need to be told something multiple times. He could tell you everything once and this book would be much more useful and only 10 pages long. I already knew the basics and thought this book would enlighten me. It didn't. It bored me. And, as it turned out, my son wasn't a crier so the information in it was completely useless to me. If you already have a colicky infant and have tried everything else, you might consider this book but otherwise, I'd save yourself some money and avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for new parents","review":"This is the best book for the first three months. Unfortunately, I didn't get it until my daughter was almost three months old. It is incredibly helpful and answers a lot of questions I had as a new mom.

The DVD is also great and shows you step by step what to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it now HATE it!!","review":"AS others have said the first 3 months the 5 S's seem like a life saver.

It would be nice to be able to have others care for her as well but unless I make any care taker read the book they can't get her to sleep. AUGH!!!!! I hate this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant, but some good advices for <3m babies only","review":"It feels that the book could be summarized in 1 chapter only. The writer keeps on repeating the same ideas again, again and again (5S techniques). Also, she presents some irrelevant examples just to extend the length of the book. Better be able to read fast, while baby is crying.Besides, all the tips in the book are only good for up to 3 months baby... title of the book must be changed accordingly.I am puzzled with the strictly positive feedback appearing first in the review webpage, and I honestly question their validity.On a positive note, the description of the 5S techniques is effective and detailed, and very helpful for new parents. Although I am hesitant to use the 2 S (Side / Stomach position sleep for the baby), as I read that stomach position sleeping might be fatal for baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little information.","review":"I consider this book as a waste of money.

I'm a new mother with a 7 week old that has been fussy since day 1. We were trying everything and I was starting to feel as miserable as my son sounded. I read this book (through one of the nights my son had me up) and the next day I used the 5 s's for the first time. I was able to get a bath, some lunch and some relaxation time in for me - for the first time in weeks! I feel like the book paid for itself with that first day of use. Since then I can calm the fussies within a minute or less during the day and the technique works great for getting him settled for the night.If you are going to get expectant parents any gift, this is the one.

It speaks on levels throughout the ages of women who did things that came natural to their indigenous roots. Dr. Karp very naturally brought this all together in a well written and lovely book. It is witty, clever, and so easy to read. Any frustrated parent who can't get their baby soothed will know the tools of satisfaction after reading this book.

I love the transition from the 5th track, which, like most tracks on this CD, is a carefully-orchestred studio production with guitar bass and percussion, to the 6th track, which features a very low-tech sounding recording with just two flutes belting out three terrific single reels with Kevin Henry. The third track, \\"Sean Ryans Hornpipes\\" features whistle and cello to great effect, which I haven't heard before.

Along the way, they enter into a \\"hot\\" relationship; though more brief than I thought. [When you see the looks they give each other at the beginning, you know some-thing's gonna be up.] With Joe Pantoliano (Joey Pants, as some call him, of the Handler and soon Dr. Vegas) and Christopher Meloni (Stabler of Law and Order SVU) as one mean Mafia dude, there is enough suspense to make one wonder if the gals are going to get away with it. Tilly and Gershon are \\"hot\\", Tilly as the soft, sexy voiced, cutesy one and Gershon as snarly lipped, butch, one; with tatoos. As I said, there \\"love\\" scenes are limited, but they are extremely erotic. Not for the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Movie still!","review":"Bound is one of my favorites.

But after the plot is fully revealed I don't feel watching it a second time just to see what happens is necessary or wise. So why I have I watched it more than once? Its all about the lesbian sex scene. *Sigh* Hormones. It's beautifully done and will turn on any girl loving girl or girl loving guy. I mean after all it is the kinda movie that holds you by the seat of the pants to see what happens, and unless you have a memory that's not up to par, it's hard to watch over and over again just to see what happens. The fact Jennifer Tilly is hot helps the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised me.","review":"I really only got it because Jennifer Tilley and Gina Gershon have a hot lesbian sex scene and I wanted to see them naked, but I actually started getting into the plot and it turned out to be a great movie. Really good crime drama. If you like The Sopranos, Goodfellas, Godfather, Scarface, or Casino, you will like this movie. I can't give it the full 5 stars because it is what I dub a one time movie, it's really only good the first time you see it because you don't expect what is to happen next. An example of a movie that does hold up view after view would be Pirates of the Carribean, because of amazing special effects you almost always find something you missed, and it's just a fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"One of my favorite movies of all time.

I don't think I've ever viewed a more breathtaking end to a sensual lesbian love scene than in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the squeamish or straight girls","review":"I must confess that I was looking for something with a stronger rating; but even without hardcore content; this movie was HOT. Jennifer Tilly set me on fire with her ultimate female sensuallity, and there are a couple of scenes that may even make a straight girl wiggle in her seat. I loved every character, including the little weasel that got his face smashed for being a complete punk. This movie lets all the bad guys get WHACKED, and all the HOT girls get WET they deserve, with very realistic; (for the most part), and intriguiging action. It was such a great movie, that I had to watch the DIRECTORS NARRATION VERSION immeditatly afterword, even though I risked missing work for lack of sleep. If you find that you do like this movie, then I also recommend \\"Fingersmiths\\"; it is not quite as HOT but is an excellent movie that you will not be able to turn off until you have seen all 3 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tie me up!","review":"Hilarious, sexy, and definitely witty...this movie has great style that's surely lacking in most cinema features today.

The cinematography is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorite movies ! I've seen numerous films.","review":"Normally, I rarely watch a movie more than once, unless I want to share the experience with someone. However, *this* is one of my favorite movies, and I have seen it several times. In fact, when I worked in a movie store, while in college, I watchedPrey for Rock & Rollspecifically because Gina Gershon was in the flick, due to her role in Bound.Bound is at times loud and violent, but the film also reveals subtle, sensual aspects of the characters that contrast with the angry gangster and the Tarantinoesque aspects of the movie.I do not think that I could ever tire of seeing this film again, or sharing it with others. Whether you enjoy Gangster films, action films, or romantic films, this movie has something for nearly everyone. If you love lesbian erotica, then definitely give this film a viewing. don't rent it, purchase it; you'll want to see it (or at least segments of it) again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"it bound me","review":"cool but strang movie.if you like gina gershon or jennifer tilly or lesbians( and who doesn't?)then you need this flim , trust me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched and overrated","review":"The movie was mildly sexy and a bit clever, but overall I found it to be cliched and pat.

I mean, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"explicit but not tasteful.","review":"I was severely dissapointed with Bound. Its explicit sexuality is not tasteful, but serves to exploit the women in the movie. If you're looking for plot, try again.

She has curves and is proud to flaunt them.So why was I so disappointed in this film? For starters, I hate movies about mafia, or anything of the sort, so only really watched this film for Jennifer Tilly, plus, it was a birthday present. It wasn't good in my opinion. I didn't find the scenes between Jennifer Tilly & Gina Gershon in the slightest bit sexy, and I didn't get turned on. The two actresses certainly had chemistry, I just didn't find the scenes where they progressed to the bedroom sexy. It just didn't do anything for me, which I was quite surprised at.I didn't watch much more of the film, as the start of the film seemed to be mostly Jennifer & Gina getting it on, and then it descended into mafia rubbish. I watched the first 40 minutes, gave up, and will quite happily never watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it","review":"People (mostly guys) think this movie is great because it' centers around two lesbs. They think the romance seen is great because of the lesbs. Yet, people who watched Alexander were so afended because of the homesexual innuendos, so they gave the movie very low socres. This movie is a trash hands down! The only thing good about this movie was the mafia scene and that's it. By the way, if peple can accept two females having sex on the screen, then they should accept the movie Alexander's homosexual scenes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"Just a voice of dissent, here.

The individual talents don't shine through the awful material. How did they dare put this out? Quite simply the worst album ever made by the finest group. I blame Robbie Robertson - who has not produced a note of good music since the band split. Good job they did; he didn't drag the others down with him. Robertson went on to produce drippy Neil Diamond, while Levon and co. continued doing what we all love.I have tried to enjoy this album - just one little bit of it. Knockin' Lost John is pretty good, but that hardly makes up for the rest of it. It was pretty brave of the label (Capitol?) to re-release it. I believe you can buy CCR's \\"Mardi Gras\\" too. I would pay for them both to be obliterated from history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good, Underrated Album","review":"Islands is probably the worst album released by The Band, but it is still far above other albums released at the time. Most songs on Islands are really well done. \\"Knocking Lost John\\", \\"Let the Night Fall\\", and \\"Georgia on My Mind\\" stand out on the album and are worth the price. The title track is interesting, but seems like a throw away. The playing on the album is exceptional. Just listen to the accordion and guitar on \\"Knocking Lost John\\" and listen to the entire band on \\"Saga of Pepote Rouge\\".Islands is not a great album, but it is something worth having if you are a fan of The Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten Island","review":"Of all the albums that the original line-up of The Band released, Islands is by far the least known. Released in 1977 after they had already played their last show, the album is made up of unreleased material. While the album sounds like a throwaway, don't be misled. There is quality work included and some forgotten gems. Songs like \\"Right as Rain\\", \\"The saga Of Pepote Rouge\\", \\"Knockin' Lost John\\", \\"Livin' In A Dream\\" and a great version of \\"Georgia On My Mind\\" are all good songs that deserve a listen. Islands isn't going to make you forget their early work, but it is an enjoyable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mio doesn't take care of customers","review":"Be very careful about installing the mount on the windshield.

Low volume noted by others was not a problem for us (just turn down the radio).

The Mio has never been reliable -- from shutting down for no apparent reason, to requiring me to enter the same destination over and over before it calculates a route, to continually losing its signal, to not recognizing its own map card -- and was not worth a penny of what I paid for it. My advice: spend a little extra money to save yourself a ton of frustration!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't beat it for the price","review":"I bought this GPS about 2 years ago now. For the price I paid this C220 is amazing! I drove truck over the road for a while and everyday was taking cargo to places I had no idea where it was. This Mio got me from loading dock to loading dock, every single time. I'm talking a couple thousand trips. It doesn't have MP3 or Bluetooth capabilities, but I didn't want all of that.

She is not tech savvy, but I thought a GPS system would be easier and safer than following printed directions while driving. I wanted something easy where you can just type in a starting address, an ending address, and then just follow the directions (similar to online map software). Unfortunately, I found this device not user friendly, even for a more tech savvy person like myself. It was not intuitive how to use, and you have to poke keys on a digital keyboard with fingers, which was difficult to do without hitting nearby keys. I found the maps challenging to navigate, and I couldn't figure out how to zoom out/in and easily pan without affecting the route. The user guide was only on the CD, and at 87 pages long, I realized that this product is only for the most patient and determined person. Knowing that my Mom would not go to this much trouble to learn and use it, I returned it. I hope there are easier GPS systems out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Got this as a gift. Works very well. Only problem I have found is that it can take several minutes to acquire the GPS sats.

POIs are easily setup, modified and deleted. Some difficulty with picking the best route over the quickest. However, if you leave the auto rerouting on it quickly reroutes the trip to account for your route preferences. I'm very pleased with this unit. The mounting system sticks very well to the windshields of our vehicles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonable bang for the buck","review":"This device is easy to use, in getting it set up, you basically turn it on. Configuring it is okay since there are only a few options. On/Off button could be protected a bit more for when the devices is not in its holder e.g. when carried around or stored in the glove compartment. The routes it selects are sometimes questionable but its not bad when you have not idea where you are going and need that extra help.

The maps are very up-to-date (April 07) and it hasn't guided me wrong yet. The CNet review warned that the screen was difficult to read. I have had no problem even in bright sunlight - perhaps their reviewer just got a bad one? The only improvement I would like to see is a more convenient way to enter custom Points of Interest.

It failed to do its primary job - consistently getting us to where we wanted to go. Sometimes it did and sometimes it didn't. There were times when we chose a listed POI, saw signs to it, and followed the signs instead of the Mio, which was telling us to go somewhere else. When we got to the POI, the Mio still didn't know it, and kept telling us to go elsewhere. This was not an isolated incident, and I've had similar problems in Wisconsin. I haven't tried to use it for the past few months. I can understand it taking you on a less efficient route occasionally, but if you can't be sure you'll really end up where you want to go, what good is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mio C220 GPS Unit","review":"The unit works okay. Haven't tried it in unfamiliar territory yet but I know it misses roads around here. It isn't easy to set up. I have had to play with it a bit and I still can't get some things like I would like. It probably wasn't the best choice for someone like me who has very little experience with a GPS receiver. The other more important problem is there is no support from the company for getting new maps for the USA. I have not found any place where I can get updated maps for the thing. The Tele Atlas company they mention for maps doesn't do maps for the USA, at least not for this unit and the company itself doesn't supply updates so in that respect it isn't worth the price or maybe it is one of those things, you get what you pay for. Spend the extra and get a Garmin or some other more sophisticated unit and make sure you can get new maps with what ever you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY","review":"The Mio C220 used to be offered at Radio Shack. They seemingly discontinued the product (in their East Coast stores at least) but I was able to purchase one from them at 199.00 before they discontinued it. I have found this navigational system to be very functional, compact and convenient. It is also a very good value in that most navigational systems that come in cars will run you about 1200.00-2000.00 as an option in a new car. Also you cannot walk around with an in-dash system. This product is easy to use and program and if you make a wrong turn it will instantly re-calibrate itself accomodating your mistake. I like the Mio so much that I've bought 3 of them, 2 from Amazon. The only drawback of the product is that the speaker on the unit is small so it does not get very loud even at its max setting. If the car stereo is on or people are talking you may not hear the vocal directions. Otherwise, I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little GPS","review":"For the price this is a great little gadget.It's only downside was it came with 2006 maps.It will still get you where you need to go.I would recomend this product to anyone who just wanted a simple to use GPS. It doesn't have many bells and whistles but that may make it better.It's very easy to use. Take it out the box and go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer service stinks","review":"After a few months my device would not charge consistently. Customer service wanted me to go buy a USB charger for a computer so then I could determine if the problem was the device or the charger. When I said that this was not an acceptaple solution they said I would have to pay shipping and handling to mail the device AND the charger cable back to them. This was the second stike against this device. The first one is that it did not contain my parent's address even though they have lived in their house for 4 years. There is no way to get updated maps so you better hope it has the ones you need. Documentation is also not that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best bang for your buck","review":"I spent a little TOO much time researching various GPS products... but I'm glad I did. This GPS unit picks up satellite signals quick. Thanks to it's WAAS enabled, SIRFstarIII chip. Yes, this is probably the only inexpensive GPS unit which is WAAS enabled. The unit comes with many POI's and everything else you'd look for in a GPS unit. The auto-complete search feature, custom POI's, waypoints, addresses are all very painless.My ONLY problem with this unit was that I was really looking for a GPS unit that can play MP3's and videos.... but thanks to a little Google research, I quickly found out that this unit is easily hackable. I now have a Mio C220 that plays my mp3's, movies, and gives me reliable directions when I need! All for under $200!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of museum","review":"I bought a C220 MIO GPS a year ago, it works fine, but there are no map updates.

They had it on sale for $199, with an additional $25 for a two year replacement plan. I bouth this unit for my trip to Southern California. My heart was stuck on the the Nuvi 360 for its text to speech, but couldn't afford the price tag.The MIO actually surpassed my expectations. It's very accurate and route recalculations were right on. The device came with a 1GB memory disk that has the US map and POI database pre-loaded. The POI database is decent and well categorized.The feature I found most useful and that mitigated the lack of 'text to speech' was the display of next maneuver on the top line. So when the voice says, \\"Take right in 100 yards\\", you can glance over the top line and know what street is being referred to.Not the best GPS out there, but definitely the best GPS for that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windows CE crash proned!","review":"I like most of the users here, thought this is was a great device at a great price. That's until I started to use this a bit more and this thing started to crash very frequently. Yes, crash just like a Windows application. When this happened, the system display a chain of the miogps.exe and mioutil.exe application fatal error messages, of which you can't close or click the \\"X\\" mark. Since this system does not have a pinhole reset button like most other GPS that uses Windows CE, this crash crippled the OS enough so I can't even shutdown the system or perform a soft restart. The only thing to get out of this mode is to let the battery drain and force the system to shut down on its own. This is a major problem if you are visiting an unfamiliar area and relying solely on this device for direction. I find the lack of a hardware/pinhole reset capability is absolutely unacceptable for a device so prone to crash. It really puts your safety at risk!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in this product","review":"We found this system difficult to learn. The instruction manual is 113 pages and on a CD. Without the exact address of a destination the system comes up with multiple answers for a general locale. It is hard to read when driving especially if one wears corrective lens glasses. When in the traveling mode it is not useful unless you know where to go in advance. Would not recommend it or buy it again, and am returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIO C220 GPS","review":"The MIO GPS is an excellent buy. I purchased this unit a month ago for a 500 mile road trip, and it performed better than I expected. The last thing to do on a road trip is to deal with the frustrations of navigating, especially in other cities. It's plenty loud at highway speeds with windows up. Clear and easy to read display with day/night mode (automatic or off). One point that I do agree with the other reviews, the menus are a little strange and do require a little bit of messing around to get comfortable with. Overall, the MIO C220 is the best bang-for-the-buck touch-screen GPS on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unhappy with the Mio C220","review":"The MIO C220 GPS was not easy to use (non-intuitive)and could not figure out a new route when we diverted from the suggested route.

It was a little more accurate than my c310x but Holy Cow.... you could hardly see the screen or hear the voice prompts. The reviews at the CNET website chew it to pieces. I am in awe of the people who say this a great unit. If they ever update the maps of the c310x, it may be the best MIO ever gets. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT AT CIRCUIT CITY!!!

So far it has been very accurate and the routes it chooses are good. Some of the routes around town are not the most direct or quickest, but it quickly recalculates if you don't take its route and will generally pick the route you intend to take. The POI database seems very good. However, this is the first time I have used a product with a POI database, so naturally it has been very helpful.The graphics are very good IMO and the 3D view is very helpful at showing the up-coming streets so you can get a \\"bird's eye\\" view of the area...helpful for taking detours etc.Anyways, for $185 to my door, it is certainly worth that."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for, don't buy it.","review":"you get what you pay for, don't buy it.

Slowly, I became more and more frustrated for various reasons.1. It will tell you the opposite of what you need to do. Meaning, it will say \\"keep left\\" when you actually should keep right. Many times I've had to turn around because of this.2. It will take you on some of the worst possible routes. Obviously, it's not human and doesn't have reason and logic like a human brain, but some routes seem incredibly stupid.3. Maps are VERY out of date. Even if roads have been built a decade ago, they won't be on the GPS and you'll often find yourself driving on what it thinks is an open field.4. Lack of POI's. You can't trust this unit to know where even common and popular locations are.At first, I didn't care that this unit didn't have many bells and whistles.

Practice a week later was also much easier as the cables were streatched and molded to the tires. Getting the outside the wheel cable connectors was expecially difficult because they must be put in the slot at a 90 degree angle, they can then be turned to 180 (straight). If just left partially in the slot, it very difficult to get it disconneded as the two parts get stuck together. More tools, such a pliers to add more leverage are need to disengage.

Provided a great amount of traction under heavy snow. However, one of the chains broke off (must have just been a defective link). I sent it back 2 months ago for a replacement and a brand new one was shipped last week with no problems. Easy to put on and take off. SZ127 was a perfect fit for a 195/60R15 2004 Honda Civic.

They come in a handly carrycase, with decent instructions. To be sure they would be OK, I put one on, and it went on fine. It's a snug fit, and could be done even outside in the cold, but would be more comfortable to put them on when it's dry, so you don't freeze your hands in the cold. Some strength is required to attach the parts together. They do provide some thin lightweight, probably single use, clear plastic gloves. It's a good idea, since these might be hard to string together with regular, thicker winter gloves on.So, if you really need chains occasionally, these should do the job nicely, and they store and attach well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tire chains","review":"Recived product fast but To large for the size chart the .

I am a 52 yr old disabled women and I installed both sides in less then 10 min on my first try, drove short distance, they self adjusted as promised. A big thing for me is that after removing them, they EASILY roll back up to go in the bag. The side cable is more flexible and allow for easy roll up.Cables that are a bit cheaper have really stiff side cables and come in those blue hard plastic carriers are almost impossible to roll back up tight enough to put back in there carrier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely will not fit 08 prius","review":"I bought these chains based on the good reviews and am sending them back.

The cables simply seem too small. It took me about an hour to finally get these installed, and then, after just a few miles at 20 MPH, bam! One of the connectors came unhooked, and they got all tangled up inside the wheel. I had to call AAA for help getting the cables out of the wheel (this is really fun to do in the middle of a snow storm on the mountain pass), and now I have to take my car into the Toyota dealer to find out what all was damaged by this product.

I get an excellent tight fit, and very good traction.But \\"Fast easy installation with no need to move the vehicle\\" ad did not work for me. Don't get me wrong - they are relatively easy to install, you \\"just\\" wrap them, connect and install tightener. But I could not do it without moving the vehicle. The video shows connecting the inner side at the top, but for my vehicle (and probably other low clearance vehicles) this is impossible - not enough space. So I can either try to connect them at the very bottom behind the tire, which is the harderst point to reach, and you would have to wrap your arms around the wheel, or moving the vehicle. I had better results after driving over them about quarter length, and connecting them at about half the height of the tire. Tightener requires a good pull to install, but I think this is good, as it guarantees cables will stay on the tire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Security Chain Company Super Z6, SZ143, Cable Chain for Passenger Cars, Pickups & SUVs - Set of 2","review":"Initially sent wrong size (perhaps the cause of some reviews saying this item could not be installed - too small).

Let's see... one was in Las Vegas(the desert) and the other was in Southern California (also the desert). With tire chains not something they regularly use in that neck of the woods, these flimsy little tire chains might actually work. Even when properly sized, faced with a New England snowfall, these strings with springs broke on the very first rotation of the tire. Do not use these chains in any environment in which you might need to rely on them for traction or safety as they are sure to disappoint and you could conceivably put yourself at risk.These are going back to Amazon - a complete disappointment and waste of money for those who need strong, reliable tire chains."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell off within 10 minutes","review":"I actually like the product, buy my chains fell off withing 10 minutes and caused over $1500 of damage to my Honda Pilot.

Just like the picture, this is a much tamer version of the flat duo jets. The songs just don't have the same energy as the earlier material.

If that was a feeble attempt to draw in people who like their country music real, it failed miserably. Maybe he should try practicing what he preaches instead of trying to make a quick buck off of sappy, pop-laden songs.Oh, and by the way... why is McGraw catergorized as being a new traditionalist/outlaw according to amazon.com? I don't know what they've been listening to, but he's about as far from traditional/outlaw country as you can get. Get it right and catergorize him with the artificial bubblegum pop acts where he belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tim, what happend?","review":"I absolutely love Tim McGraw and his music! I have ALL of his CDs and have loved every single one of them with the exception of his current CD. I have to ask, what happened? I was expecting this to be such a great CD since the last CD was my favorite of his so far...I was extrememly dissapointed and I could barely make it through all 16 tracks. I did give it a second listen and it didn't change my mind. I love the title track, it is an awesome song but the other tracks on the CD are extremely dissapointing. I can't wait for his next CD to come out, it has got to be better than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!","review":"I just bought this album, and what a mistake. The title track is an awesome piece of music, and I was hoping that Tim was getting back to the upbeat type of country that made him good when he first started recording.Bad assumption. The rest of this CD is absolutely terrible. The upbeat songs are unbearably slow, plodding along with all the energy of a sloth on nyquil. The lyrics are, almost without exception, simple, hokey, and unintelligent. Back When is perhaps the best example of this, but believe me, there are plenty of other tracks to provide competition.Bottom line - do NOT waste a penny on this miserable excuse for a country record. Maybe if his sales drop off, Tim will someday get back to recording quality music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs not as good...","review":"I'm not sure if Tim McGraw is looking to get away from his \\"regular\\" style of songs, but I found that this album was not as good as former albums of his. \\"Live Like You Were Dying\\" is the standout song on the album, but there were other songs that were a bit quirky such as \\"Drugs or Jesus\\" and \\"Do you want Fries With that.\\" However, McGraw can be commended for keeping the \\"twang in country.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Album","review":"This particular album was terribly boring to me.

And well needless to say, I struggled to listen to it once through. Compared to previous material, this is by far the most lackluster of anything Tim has done. There are no truly catchy singles. Every song seems to get more bland and lyrically trite as the CD progresses. Tim has had some amazing singles, but there are none to be found on this CD. I really like Tim and own several of his albums, but honestly I'm very disappointed with this one. It just doesn't live up to the standards his previous albums have set."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Really Mixed Bag","review":"The CD's too long for its own good. I'd rather have six great songs than 16 mediocre ones. McGraw's quality control instincts took the week off here. The good songs are surrounded by maudlin or hokey tracks. For instance, a funny song is funny exactly once, and there's too many funny songs here, giving the whole effort a \\"Hee-Haw\\" feeling. Overall the ballads fare better than the country-rockers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck In A Rut","review":"I was really looking forward to this new CD, hoping with anticipation that I would hear some of the old magic of some of Tim's earlier career releases. This CD is full of carbon copy material of his last few outings. He is a multi-faceted artist, capable of so much, yet chooses to labor on depressing songs like, \\"Kill Myself\\", \\"Drugs or Jesus\\" and \\"Open Season on My Heart\\". There is only 1 song out of the 16 that I liked immediately, and that one is \\"Just Be Your Tear\\". I prefer to look back and listen to what I think is one of his best projects, \\"All I Want\\".

There are even great ones, like the title track, Live like you were Dying, but it just did not kick (...) from start to finish.Tim's other albumns sit in my CD player and every song is fantastic. This one is not the case. In fact, there were actually songs that I don't like and will now skip over.

Over in England this artist is unknown , which is a real shame. A great album which is well worth the money. The best tracks being; 'My old friend', 'Just be your tear', 'Open season on my heart', 'Walk like a man' and 'Drugs or Jesus'. All of these would top the billboard chart in the US.

I can sing better than McGraw and that's not saying much.

Singing heartfelt tender songs that have nothing to do with him and he's just a poser trying to reap more millions? Check.5. A talantless hack who survives the music business thanks to sheep who buy it? Check.6. Still crooning pop songs but calling it country? Check.Yep guess that about covers it. Tim is Tim and he'll always be Tim. As long as there are idiots in the world with no taste at all in music, Tim will continue to live a lifestyle that he never deserved. Maybe one day America will wake up and throw away all their country pop albums and return to the days when country was real. So-called 'New Country' is a joke, and Tim McGraw is the lead Jester."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I liked the music.... but the lyrics were not up to par. Most of the songs had bad rhymes, simple rhymes. My sister could have written better songs and shes 10.

It just didnt sound like a Tim Mcgraw CD. I was definitaley dissappointed with the quality of songs compared to his last CDs.

Set This Circus Down and A Place in the Sun have better songs on them, but Live Like You Were Dying has 16 songs, and there are some great ones.I love How Bad Do You Want It. Tim's voice is perfect for it, and that song describes exactly what he went through trying to make it to the top. Drugs or Jesus is another great song that has a lot of meaning and is very well done, although it hasn't moved up the country charts very fast.One of my very favorite songs turned out to be Kill Myself.

I couldn't wait to get this album. Wow...what a waste of time and money. The title track is exceptional and that's where he earned his one star. The rest is boring, formulaic, and highly forgettable. McGraw is known, in the past, for his ability to select hit songs. There is not a song on this CD that I could hum even if Faith Hill held a gun to my head. He needs to kick it up a notch and get the \\"hitch out of his git-a-long\\". Fun, danceable music is what the country needs right now, especially right now. Not depressing songs that drone on and say nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"McGraw's best","review":"I liked the album and all -- I think it's McGraw's best in years -- but I'm really writing to let Brian Estill know that \\"Remember When\\" is an Alan Jackson song."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD stops in mid-play","review":"I paid a low price and apparently got an inferior product.

Okay, I thought to myself, there's 16 tracks, and it'll get better...Live Like You Were Dying can't be the only decent track. WRONG! Am I listening to the right artist? Yes, it sounds like McGraw but, the lyrics are terrible, the buy-in \\"chorses\\" are bad, and I can't get in to any the tracks.

Cause real country music is dead! Americans are loving this mushy, mellow crap.Tim McGraw just bought a $6.4 million dollar mansion in Beverly Hills. He's about as country as Diana Ross.Oh..and that Album cover with him sitting backwards on a horse is totally fitting.

The title track is the only song I think is really awesome, the melodies aren't all that strong in most of the other 15 songs, except for perhaps \\"Blank sheet of paper\\" and \\"My old friend\\". But songs like \\"We carry on\\" \\"Drugs or Jesus\\" may hit closer to home for some people than it did for me. That still doesn't make it a great song though.

Within a short period of time, she's already the chief suspect in a murder investigation, which also involves a number of near-and-dear friends of hers. 'A Love to Die For' is the first in the Stella the Stargazer series and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a quick, light read with all the elements one hopes for in a cozy. Unusual characters, witty prose, and most of all, a juicy murder (or two)... I haven't read the other books in this series yet, but am certainly looking forward to! If you're in the market for a nice, easy read, give Stella a try.

What makes this badmouthing all the more unpleasant is the fact that most of her targets were deceased at the time of its publication and unable to present their side of the story.While the recurring instances of charcter assasination are the book's biggest liability, the First Lady of the American Theater also comes off as somewhat self-centered and shallow.Those who respect the many noble actions which typified Helen Hayes' final decades will be disappointed and likely disturbed by this autobiography that does not do her memory justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"When I received the item it was broken.

Every point is repeated several times, and the author is incredibly wordy. As a professional writer, it astounds me that someone could go on about usability without having the faintest idea of how to make his own writing usable. If edited properly, this volume could be reduced to half the size and give exactly the same information. The passive voice just about slaughters this book. One gets the impression that the author thinks he must write in this boring, textbook style in order to be considered \\"The Book\\" in the industry.

I wasn't disappointed.It was refreshing to find a writer who wrote about a story about a police detective who happens to be a lesbian, rather than a lesbian who happens to be a police detective. The mystery is compelling, the characters are well written, and the descriptions paint a vivid picture of a city and its inhabitants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor plot and character development","review":"Characters come and go without making much of an impression or advancing the plot. The most intense part of the story - a chance sexual encounter in a lesbian bar - occurs in the third chapter. The reader should really dislike the bad guys and root for the good guys. There is an evil boss, but he's a cartoon character - utterly predictable, speaking dreadful dialogue. He gets his due \\"off stage\\" and not at the hands of our hero. The author invested little in the way of defining the bomber's actions, motivations, or pathology. The protagonist's love interests are neurotic, controlling women. This odd treatment - no definition of the antognist, pathological characters supporting the protagonist - left this reader with no sympathy for the hero or the outcome of the book. Rather than write an ending, the protagonist falls unconscious and it remains for minor characters to finish the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was thrilled from the beginning of this tale-Loved it!!!","review":"I really got into this book as I love a love story wrapped around a mystery. I found Marki to be the perfect solution to Tru's depression. From the beginning as I found the \\"Bar Scene Lovemaking\\" I was thrilled with Ms.McClellan's ability to describe the scene as if I was a part of it or wished I were. I was so happy she had not jumped as I thought she might in the beginning,somewhere in the story. I found the Capt.Rohn to be a real louse and was happy he got his in the end.

The plot does start out rather rocky, and at times, it it difficult to distinguish between a character's flashback and the present events. As the book progresses, the children of the story reveal just how deeply their mother's marriage to a film director is affecting them. Set in rural Italy, it's a very exotic setting, which contributes to the intrigue of the story. Humorous at times, very dramatic at others, the mood of this book is excellent. There are many instances of symbolism throughout the book, each presented clearly yet subtly. Toward the end of the book, I was beginning to realize how a divorce can affect a family, and how it can hurt the children more than the adults. Like the children of the Villa Fiortia, I was horrified, startled, and angered at the adults' immature decisions, and I was entertained by the children's insufferable \\"battle plans.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"needs remixing","review":"This sounds like it was recorded and mixed in someone's garage.There also were no liner notes and pictures.Save your money for another Asia cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as their BATMAN Trilogy","review":"This recording lacks the power of the Royal Scottish's powerful Batman Trilogy.

My favorite part was the show jumping. Dressage seems tough at first but then you get the hang of it and you end up loving it. Cross country is great but it seems that in one part the horse will always refuse. It is in the 4 star stage I think the second competition down on the list. The 18th jump, you approach the horse will refuse even if you speed up, slow down, aim straight at it. I think it helps to go at it in an angle. But besides that I really enjoyed the game a lot and it will be many hours of fun for anyone who loves horses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good graphics, boring game","review":"I purchased this game a while ago because I love horse games. From the description, and screen shots, it looked like a fun game. I was disappointed to see that you really have no freedom in the game. You can't walk around the barn or outside, like I thought. There is a menu where you choose what event you want to do, or which horse you want to ride. That's as intricate as it gets! Riding in the events are pretty fun: again, there are really good graphics. I wouldn't recommend this game if you like exciting games."},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"This book is the story of a man who wins back his fortune and life from very difficult circumstances. He faces incredible storms and temperatures to salvage a boat with passengers off the coast of Antartica. He next saves an oil tanker who is also carrying his ex-wife and son.As usual, Wilbur Smith writes in excesive detail, but makes every scene, every place and situation seems very real. The characters are also very life-like and you warm up to them imediately.If there was anything I could say against this book, it would be that the author seems to spend too much time describing every scene during the storms and salvages, when it is hard to follow because it gets very technical. Also, the ending is a little disappointing because after he has warmed you up to his ex-wife and son you are left not knowing what happens to them.However, it is overall a very good book and always a pleasure to read a book that is entertaining, alive and written in such a complete way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man vs Sea","review":"A classic tale of man vs sea with a predictable ending.

These include On Liberty by J. S. Mill, Leviathan by T. Hobbes, Capital by K. Marx, and The Social Contract by Frenchman Jean Jacques Rousseau. This book examines the origins, nature, logic, and inner workings of relationships between three entities. These entities are man the individual, men as in a collection of individuals, and the state, where the state includes laws, government, and other institutions. I first read this book in a high school class. I tried to read it later when in college. I could not finish this book either time; this is the most difficult book I have ever read.

The second specious argument is in the creation of a General Will. The third is that the general will will not do anything to harm any of the individuals within the collective.The collectivist social contract was most assured well intentioned, but it's opposition to individualism has obviously anti-individualist consequences.This is evident in his support of democratic censorship. If the general will is offended, then censorship is justified.In his desire to create equality, he justifies both socialism and communism, and democracy in its purest form - majority rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear and real look into the theory of society","review":"Anyone wishing to study political philosophy should read this for sure. It sets up the standard theory for the structure of society as the social contract or pact that is made up of the passive state and active sovereign. Within this The Prince rules. Jean-Jacques Rousseau adheres to his political beliefs and especially his strengths in knowledge of the state of nature of sociey that must turn to its general will and its body politic to achieve its goals. All is brilliant in this book except the end, and although Rousseau has an extremely strong point of view, it criticizes Christianity a bit too harshly without giving enough merit for what it represents. There is much knowledge to be gained in reading this book as Jean-Jacques Rousseau shows he is a master in politics and an important figure in World history due to his implicit wisdom and authority on the subject.

These guys never wanted to or pretended to be Paul Stanley & Gene Simmons. If you don't like Trower or Cream don't buy this! But if you like great freak'n music played by consummate professionals, then by all means buy this. I own over 400 concerts on DVD and this on fits in just fine, I would buy it again in a second if I lost it, and that's about as good as any music DVD gets.Peace, Out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes Age Matters","review":"This is disapointing. Its sad to see your heroes age. Of course aging is no sin, and of course inevitable, yet seeing and hearing the weak vocals dirge-like tempos and generally lackluster performance underscores the sad reality. There is no spark and no joy in this concert, and the songs, the new ones are feeble. The old warhorses, just, depressing. Trower attempts to breathe some life but ultimately it all falls dreadfully flat. A real drag man."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a scleroderma victim, a comprehensive overview","review":"I purchased this for my niece who was just diagnosed with scleroderma and her medical team were not educating her as to the long term affects and prognosis associated with this disease. After reading the book, she was able to quiz her physicians on those points she needed clarified and has been very satisfied with this book's comprehensive overview for the newly diagnosed scleroderma patient. Highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scleroderma","review":"This Book was such an easy read, easy to follow and has helped me understand this condition which I have. A must read if you have Scleroderma!!! Very imformative!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was not helpful to me. There was very little medical information and also very little first-hand patient information. For instance, I found a white bump on my arm and wondered if it was calcinosis, this book had no information regarding calcinosis other than it is white bumps. I do not recommend this book. There is nothing in the book that can not be found on the internet, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rendell does it yet again","review":"Her previous Wexford novel 'Road Rage' was always going to be hard to follow, but once again Ruth Rendell has demonstrated why she has been dubbed the modern 'Queen of Crime'. 'Harm Done' broaches the subjects of paedophilia, domestic violence and abduction, managing to be as addictive as it is disturbing. In the end is left to the reader to decide whether the end result of the major crime is justified by the means - and the novel is as suspenseful as ever. Wexford continues to delight, and it is difficult to imagine Rendell ever writing a less than superb thriller. Right out of the top drawer - in other words, a normal day at the office for Ruth Rendell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I had never read one of Ruth Rendell's works before, and based on this one, I probably never will again. I thought her book was infinitely boring, the plot developed so slowly it was like watching paint dry. In addition the characters were two-dimensional, and Rendell's (too) many plot lines were disjointed, the abduction of the two girls having absolutely nothing to do with her main theme of domestic abuse. The only reason I kept reading was that I expected it, or hoped that it would get better. Needless to say I was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded","review":"My first Ruth Rendell novel, listened to on CD. The reading is very good, but the novel is longwinded and relatively boring. Between spousal abuse, bigotry, low life prejudice and multiple police cases, Rendell has taken on way too much here and done a satisfactory job of little. What stands out and suprised me most, tho, is her portrait of the British provincial police as small-minded and not particularly bright. A strange sort of detective fiction that left me wondering if she is really mocking the police. Part of what makes for the longwindedness is how many obviously false leads the police conjur up in long discussions, that then have to be played out in visits to imagined suspects.One thing about some of the reviews. It strikes me that those who complain about her \\"political correctness\\" ought to quit whining and just come out and say they think spousal abuse, lynch mobs bigotry, etc., are unworthy subjects for policiers (and other types of fiction?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest disappointment yet","review":"If there is ever a place where the political correctness does not belong, it's mystery. Ruth Rendell has sold out to the PC crowd - the book is bland and preachy. I think the damage is irreversible, at least for me. Mystery will never be the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"The Inspector Wexford series is one of my favorites. Rendell is at her best with this character. I was hungry for a mystery and bought it in hardback as soon as it appeared on the shelves and was glad to see how long it was. High expectation added to disappoinment. I agree with the other reviewers who found the book disappointing, politically correct, overwritten, and tedious. I would add that Inspector Wexford is not himself in No Harm Done-- readers who have not read any of the other Wexford mysteries will be pleasantly surprised to find a richer and less moralistic character. Don't give up because of No Harm Done."},{"rating":"1","title":"full text or abridged?!","review":"I was unpleasantly surprised to discover that the audio CD of Harm Done I recently bought turned out to be an abridged version. I was wonderng why it seemed to include a lot less detail than I recalled from reading the book a few years ago. A clue to do with knives--which emphasized the book's themes--simply wasn't there, for example.I don't see mention of abridged vs. entire story (unabridged) on the descriptions of this product that are currently online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read one other Rendell book and enjoyed it. However, this one left me disappointed. As several other reviewers noted, the three plot lines about the abductions of two young girls, the pedophile and the wife beater never come together. I also felt both the social commentary and characters were shallow. The book would have been better if one or more of the plot lines were dropped and the remaining plot lines followed in greater depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Harm Done","review":"I really liked this book. Other reviewers have written that they thought there were too many unconnected stories. I think it just shows you what a mix of people there are in this small town in England. Crime touched all neigborhoods it seems.The explanation for two of the disappearing girls was touching. What would you do in Vicky's situation?I even liked the part about the lost raincoat. The author has a nice, typically English sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and slow","review":"I read all the available Wexfords and most of the other Rendells years ago and I thought I'd go back and catch up on the stuff she'd written since then. Ugh, was this one a stinker. Not a person in the book is interesting enough to keep you reading and the pace is slow, circular and monotonously unenthralling. The author's notion of \\"casting a cold eye, on life, on death\\" is simply to disapprove of everyone, their housekeeping, their child-rearing and their lifestyles. And social outrage -- nomatter how sympathetic -- does not human interest make. Dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harm Done","review":"Typical of Rundell, a well crafted story with a moral.

My home is not wired for cable and I didn't want to go to the effort. I saw plenty of cheaper units out there, but their poor reviews turned me off. This unit was twice the cost but the good reviews intrigued me. I took a chance and bought it and cannot be more pleased. It works great ! One caveat, though. It was my intent to hook the receiver to an older color tv. This unit doesn't possess an rf modulator output. IE, it doesn't wire into the cable jack on the tv. It only wires to RCA jacks. I had to purchase a channel 3 modulator at RS for $15 to wire between my tv and this device. Most newer TVs will have RCA inputs and this shouldn't be a problem - just something to be aware of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I have to concur with the other reviews here. I would have given this product 5 stars had it not been for the static that occurs when someone walks in between the two antennas. This does come with the transmitter and receiver. I have had these for over 6 months and I am very happy with the results. Recently we have had to move to an apartment while our new home is being built and I have had a little more interference. One strange thing, the transmitter on Ch3 and receiver on ch2; shouldn't work but it does. Thanks for reading my 2 cents.UPDATE: Just sent this off to manufacturer, they said they would check the whole \\"wrong channel\\" thing and repair or replace it for free. Still waiting on it to actually get to them via UPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Static, But Not Bad","review":"I have this thing hooked up to a TV tuner card on my PC so I can watch ballgames in a little window when I'm on the PC. Same problem with the IR extender. I've done several trial and error tests on it. It seems to work if the receiver is within 5 feet of the sender. When the distance is more, I only got it to work when I pointed the remote at a 45-degree angle to the right (from dead center) of the unit. I have the IR thingy about 3 inches from my cable box pointing up at the cable box IR hole at a 45 degreee angle. I just programmed my favorites in the remote and click like crazy until it finally hits the channel I want. It seems when I want channel 44 or something, it'll only catch one number - the first or last - so this is easier. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead while the calendar ticked off 6o days on Amazon","review":"The Seller told my husband that we must have bought a defective unit and could we please just send back for testing.

However, after receiving the item, I found out that I need another $70 PC to TV converter in order to accomplish this. While this was doable, the product is rather large and unwieldly compared to similarly priced products. I am returning this item and buying a Western Digital TV Live Plus instead, which is smaller, runs for a similar price, and does everything I wanted this product to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value for money","review":"We purchased this product more than a year ago and we never had an issue with the quality of audio and video signals. We sometimes have to readjust the antenna because our cat likes to throw things of tables including the rf-link receiver.

There is a slight delay between the original and the transmission, but it's only noticeable when the sound on the other TV is up high. I have a 5.8 GHz phone and have used it while watching the TV and have noticed no static or loss in signal. My only issue has to do with the fact that I am watching the transmitted signal on an HD screen with no HD channels so the image is a little fuzzy. I haven't set up the IR repeater because I haven't quite figured out where the receptor on my DirectTV box is yet, so I can't comment on that.

It worked well in my previous residence, but not so well in my current residence, likely due to the high density of neighboring devices (e.g., wireless phones, wireless networks, etc.).So, I tried the 5.8GHz version, and it works PERFECTLY, passing a clean signal through one wall and one door--a distance of about 25 feet. I even have an 802.11n wireless router (Apple Time Capsule) and 5.8 GHz wireless phones, but they all functionally co-exist. Just getting out of the crowded 2.4GHz spectrum did the trick!Finally, the price was right.

The RF Link will only broadcast the signal selected on another device, so you can't watch different programs on the primary TV and the wirelessly-connected set. AngelTrax, on the other hand, has its own TV tuner so it will broadcast any cable channel and, at the push of a button, a signal from an AV device (like digital cable or a DVD Player). The remote for the RF Link is barely functional, relying on an infrared \\"mouse\\" to send a channel change to the primary device, while the AngelTrax very effectively controls channel, power, and volume on its own tuner. Both worked fine (minimal interference) in my home in the presence of a 5.8 ghz phone and a wireless network.The RF Link is really quite inferior to the AngelTrax, and it costs more.

There is *no* interference at all, and the quality of the video is substantially improved. It looks like a closed-circuit wired connection to my Tivo unit. I can now view live cable content or my recorded Tivo content from my home office, cutting right through the 4 walls that separate me from my living room.

I was never happy with the Terk 2.4, it seemed like everything interfered with the signal (the microwave, the cordless phone, my son's xbox, etc.). In addition the Terk seemed a bit flimsy, so when the antenna broke on the transmitter, I decided to but the RF-Link unit.Out of the box it is very easy to set up (it took less than three minutes to have it up and working). I did not use the remote control extender as the signal only needs to travel about 25 feet. Overall, the picture quality is very good (not full HD so you might notice degradation on a 60 inch screen but on a smaller screen it is fine). The sound quality is also very good as well although there is a slight static sound (perfectly acceptable just not dead silent).

The receiver and transmitter are only 30 feet apart (transmitting through walls and floor - but certainly in the stated range) and I get very annoying, intermittent static that would really prevent me from using this with any kind of continuous use like watching television or a movie. Switching channels doesn't help. I can't tell if it's a defect or interference but I am likely returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"RF Link AVS-5811","review":"Purchased this unit to transmit TV signal from the second to a first floor. Signal gets transmitted however the quality is really poor. If somebody walk in the area close to sender or receiver, it results in a lot off noise to the TV signal.

No signal on any channel and no amount of adjustment brought helped in any way.Of course it is about 2 weeks past the return window with amazon. I have requested a refund anyway and we'll see if amazon supports their customers. A $102.00 piece of electronic equipment should not be dead after a month of use.Save your money.Edited to add that amazon quickly agreed to make an exception to their return policy under the circumstances. So although the product I received is clearly defective, kudos to amazon for their professionalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works OK But Don't Expect Much Range","review":"Based on the other reviews I purchased this unit to remotely control my DirecTV Tivo from the basement. With the sender and receiver separated by only eight feet and one floor, the unit works perfectly.The units would not operate, however, when separated by about 30 feet and going through three walls, even after much trial and error aligning of the antenna. Sometimes I could see parts of the picture and hear bits of sound, but the 30 feet was just too far for satisfactory results. I even tried different locations in case nearby electrical wiring might be causing the problem, but always the 30 feet and a couple of walls was just too far.So I can recommend this device only if your sending unit and receiving unit will be no more than 15-20 feet apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as well as expected","review":"I was very nervous on buying this product, as some of the reviews are not favorable and I was installing this in a basement TV. It works fine, through insulated walls and the floor with no distortion or sound issues (this save me adding an expensive DirecTV receiver).

All in all a really great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subject to interference","review":"This product worked as advertised except for a very loud burst of noise and blacking out of TV picture at random intervals, several times in an evening.

That night, I pulled the TERK out and put the RF-Link in. Installation was trivial; I had everything worked correctly within a few minutes. Better yet, the video stayed clear when I used the microwave or the Wi-Fi. And Wi-Fi performance improved dramatically both in throughput and range.I had some issues initially where it would stop working (and then start). I suspect interference from other folks living near me. Whatever they were doing before seems to have stopped as I've had no issues after the first month. Good product overall.

Then you've got the sense of just how true the devotion of a Mother to her child/children is. Not to mention that you always \\"just have to read one more page\\".This story makes you realise how terrifying it would be to have amnesia and sets you into a spiral of confusion and fear.

Approx. 1-2 padded cloth \\"pages\\" with very little text - no story at all! All I can say it is good for is for gumming. It says hardcover, but don't let that fool you; the only paper is the flimsy cardboard it comes in. Not the classic we brought our children up with - very disappointed that I had to return.

Touching, yet simple, never cloyingly sweet. The brief good-nights are easy for young children to remember, and the phrases tend to stick with you into adulthood, carrying with them sweet childhood memories (I say that, and I'm a die-hard cynic).I'm writing more to recommend this board book edition as a great baby gift. For that kid who's going to have everything he or she NEEDS and who's had a hundred baby showers already, a book is a PERFECT gift. And, as a librarian, I can vouch for the fact that board books are multi-purpose items: for whatever reason, toddlers love to carry these things around like a favorite stuffed animal. And what better way to get them started on the path to reading?So, there you have it: a timeless children's classic in the ultimate child-friendly form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Bedtime Read","review":"This was the first book I bought for my nephew when I learned that my sister was pregnant. It is also the last book I read to him every night before bed when he sleeps over at my house. He just loves the calming rythme and the soothing words. At 2-years-old, he is beginning to recite the words on his own. It is so wonderful to see him loving something that is not noisy and battery-charged! I know that he will love this for some time to come, and perhaps even pass it on someday. As for me, I love the classicly drawn illustrations (alternating black and white with color) and the coziness of it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 month old son enjoys it!!","review":"The book has pictures in both color and black&white.

The pages of the book are also big and thin which made it quite difficult to flip the pages. I found the colors very dull but I guess there might be a purpose to it as it is a goodnight book.

But i gave it a shot and got it for my 2 year old daughter. The first time I read it to her right before her bedtime, she was fascinated by the illustrations and sat on my lap. She hardly would sit for a book. But she would for this book and she even followed me and repeated what I read in the book. Many words like, mittens and kittens, house and mouse rhymed so it was easy for her to copy. She even woke up in the morning and asked me to read \\"goodnight moon\\".

He loves books, and mostly longer books that tell a story. I saw this at the library and decided to see what the hype was about. I was so confused as to why this is rated so high. My son asked me \\"Mama, what's mush?\\" Um.....I didn't know what to say. What is mush? Is that even a noun? I know mushy is adjective of course. Then the \\"old lady\\" aka a rabbit - so confusing! My son again asked \\"what's an old lady?\\" Well an old lady ISN'T a knitting rabbit. He clearly knows what a rabbit/bunny is. He knows what a noise is, since he always asks \\"What's that noise?\\" when he hears something. At the end when the author writes \\"Goodnight noises everywhere\\" makes no sense.All in all, I think this book is confusing and detrimental to a toddlers vocabulary.

Some parts don't even make sense (i.e. \\"Goodnight nothing.\\" ?????). The only good thing about this book is that it is a board book and a good size for smaller hands. One other good thing is my infant likes to chew on it. :) This book was included in a baby wash and lotion set that was gifted to us.

The bunny isn't anything too special really, but as anyone with a toddler, or anyone who has ever bought a happy meal know, it needn't be.

After ordering the book, I wondered why. It's poorly written, and the colors are wierd. But as I read it to my 8 1/2 month old son, both of us are soothed by the rhythm of the words, and he is fascinated by the illustrations, which seem to have just enough detail to be interesting but not so much as to be overwhelming. Works for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful--a classic not to be missed!","review":"Goodnight Moon--another one of those books that absorbs you into the world of great children's literature.

Beautiful prints. Easy to read and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kyler's favorite","review":"My two year old grandson loves being read to. He has many books but this one is his very favorite.

BUT this cloth version excludes a large portion of the text & images of the original. I suggest buying the original hardcover, & not the cloth cover version."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love This book","review":"This is by far my kid's favorite baby/toddler book. I have read this to them since before they were born and still every night we go to bed as a matter of routine. It has such a harmony and flow about it and so soothing and calming for bedtime. I am sure when they outgrow this stage and I reread this book much later on in life, I will just bawl buckets over this one. Its such a classic and such a bonding book for parents and little ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Goodnight Moon Bunny is our daughter's favorite Lovey","review":"We received this book/plush bunny set as a gift. We love the Goodnight Moon story, and read it almost every night. Our 8 month old daughter, while she thinks the board book is delicious, has adopted the 5\\" Bunny as her very favorite Lovey, and won't go to sleep without him. He is just the right size for an infant. He has a grey faux-fur head and \\"hands\\", and wears blue-striped pajamas with textured feet. His eyes are the bead-type, rather than embroidered, but they are very well attached. The ears are long enough to get into her mouth for serious sucking, and the arms are well-stuffed, making for good gnawing. His body is stuffed with the microbeads, and my only complaint (thus 4 stars, not 5) is that he is labelled \\"surface wash only\\". I have, due to the daily baby-spit, given him many baths, and he seems to dry out just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a terrific book, the whole family loves it.","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my sixteen month old and hefell in love with it.

It's only 3 pages with about 10 lines of words! (The information says 8 pages because it's counting each side of each page, including covers.) And the drawing was kind of old fasioned and not even very cute.But it completely changed my mind after reading it to my 3 month old son once. He was very interested in this book, looked at it intensely, and by the time I finish those short verses, he is already sleepy! It's almost magical!Now this book has become part of his sleeping routine and I read it to him every night. I add good night mom / dad / Snoopy / everybody... at the end and it really sets him into the sleeping mode. Now I think this book is the perfect length because you can't read a full complex story to a baby trying to get him to sleep. Also love the cover material, it's very soft. Now my son is 4 month old and he starts to grab the book when I read it to him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a wonderful classic!","review":"\\"Goodnight Moon\\" is a classic and a \\"must\\" for new parents to read to their newborn immediately upon their arrival home from the hospital.After our evening ritual of reading to our children before bed, this book was used in our house as a signal to our children that the day wasdrawing to a close and that it was time for bed. As we strongly believe in the value of reading to young children, we now give this book as agift to anyone whom we know who is becoming a parent or grandparent. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" belongs in your children's library, and to be savedby them to read to their children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's fave!","review":"I personally didn't care much for the book when I received it as a gift fom my 1 year old. However, this book became his absolute favorite from day one! He loved to point at pictures (cats, ballons, moon, etc) and LOVES (to my great surprise) black and white drawings. For the past 8-9 months we've been reading this book daily, at least 5 times before he goes to bed, and sometimes just because. He LOVES the moon and stars, always points to them if we are reading something else, or if there is one to be seen from the window. \\"Moon\\" was one of his first words!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Idea!","review":"My bestfriend is having a baby in April and for her baby shower, instead of giving cards, we were all instructed to buy a book to start \\"Baby's\\" library.

It's a definite must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good for going to sleep","review":"I had never heard of Goodnight Moon until my niece was born but since then it has become a favorite. I read this to my little one as a signal that the end of the day is near and it's time for bed. This book has a lulling quality that is soothing and calming. At times I still can't see the hype but my little one loves this book so that's all that matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and white pages","review":"The book was recommended as a great children's book. I haven't read the story so I'm not sure about it as a children's book. I can speak to the quality of this book. I bought the paperback because I prefer that over hardcover, but the pages are all in black and white, which is very disappointing for a children's book. I think the best part of children's books are the large colorful images."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"This is a wonderful children's book, a classic that endures.

It's a wonderful book to read before nap time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I have never read this book before, but knew I wanted to read it to my daughter Ryan, especially since our last name is Moon.

The colorful pictures will help keep him or her involved, and you'll both love this book as a tool for bedtime preparation.On par with \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\"? You betcha! \\"Make Way...\\" is for a slightly older reader, but the same connections of pictures and words, though in very different styles, can be found.I fully recommend \\"Goodnight Moon\\" by Margaret Wise Brown, Clement Hurd.Anthony Trendl"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son is obsessed with the moon!","review":"My cousin bought this book for my son when he was just a couple months old, we have been reading it to him since then...he is now 18 months. He has been saying moon since before he was a year, and still is obsessed with moons...in books, on clothes, in the sky...anywhere he sees the moon.

It came in a package with 2 other books and they were fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't have to understand","review":"ok, so we first got this book as a gift @ the hospital. I read it to my baby once, thought it was stupid and never thought about it again. He's two now and LOVES this book. We got him the oversized (lap) version, and he won't put it down. I don't know why kids loves this book so much...Who says \\"Goodnight Nobody\\"...?..Whatever...If he likes it, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a classic, but a kid pleaser","review":"My 13 month old daughter loves this book. She is so attracted to the illustrations and studies them intently.

Thankfully I didn't waste money on it. I know it's one of the most popular baby books out there, but I don't get it. There are a million better books... this one is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"According to my mom I loved this book when I was a baby. She thinks that the one I had was all color and more vibrant than this edition. Half of the pages of this new edition are black and white. Very uninspiring. Out of 100+ books that my 17 month old son has, this is his least favorite. I read it to him a few times but his eyes seemed to glaze over with boredom (in a way it's actually kind of cool to see him discriminate between good and bad \\"literature\\"). Now it is gathering dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong product / no refund","review":"This is not a board book, it is a regular copy of Goodnight Moon, and frayed around the edges to boot. We sent it back and were told that they would refund our money, but it has been a few weeks and we haven't heard a word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put down the kool-aid...","review":"Never heard of this book before about 10 years ago. It was never on my bookshelf as a child (I'm 32) or any of my older siblings. Got it as a gift, and simply don't see what the fuss is about. There are more engaging bedtime books (Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book, and Sandra Boynton's Pajama Time! and The Going to Bed Book among them). Or, look around the room and make up your own, e.g. Goodnight walls/floors, windows/doors, smoke detector, etc. There--just saved you the cost of this book.Ultimately, it probably doesn't matter *what* you read/sing to your kids to wind them down, but *how* you read/sing it to them. Slower, repetitive, deep, more drawn out you-are-getting-sleeeeeepy delivery, etc. Not rocket science. This book fits that pattern, but coupled with the bizarre coloring of the illustrations, mismatched repetition, and hard to read in dim light printing, it's just not worthy of the hype, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it","review":"We were given this books as a gift. I really dislike it--there seems to be an upleasant undertone: \\"bowl full of mush\\", \\"goodnight nobody\\". I find the illustrations equally unpleasant (or maybe that's why I find the book unpleasant). I recycled it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't imagine why this is a classic","review":"Everyone told us we had to get this book and someone even bought it for us at our shower. Neither my husband nor I can figure out why this is such a classic. It is inane. Ridiculous. No cute story, no message, not even a good rhyme. Millions of people have been hoodwinked in to buying this book. Please, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"I still haven't received the book \\"Goodnight Moon.\\" I ordered it over a month ago. Can you tell me why it's taking so long?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding.","review":"I cannot believe the number of positive reviews about this book. This is a case of nobody being able to see that the emperor is naked except the little boy. This book was so obviously poorly written and illustrated. Most authors of children's' books have a special talent. I think most anyone could have written this one. It's even a little creepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring... even for a bedtime story","review":"I cannot believe most reviewers say it's a classic. It's so boring my 20-month old son refuses to be near the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Classic","review":"This book is a great bedtime classic that stands the test of time. I remember fondly and vividly having this book read to me as a child and the warm and cozy feelings of being safe and sound and ready to be tucked away to bed that it evoked. Rereading it now, as an adult to my son, I've noticed that part of the appeal may be the contrast and back and forth between the simple black and white pages and the detailed colorful (yet nighttime muted) room. This seems to capture my son's attention. On a humorous note, someone pointed out to me recently that the old lady whispering hush (rhymes with mush) is really a large rabbit in a dress. Just makes this great classic all the more whimsical and appealling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodnight Mood","review":"This is a great book for small children, toddlers. The kids are drawn to the book and they can point to objects in the book when prompted by the parent. Both of my children love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Bedtime Story!","review":"My son and I have enjoyed this book for years.

It is her favorite book. It is also lots of fun to read. I don't know why something so simply written is so good, but it just is. The pictures do alot to keep her attention and stir her growing imagination. I highly recommend this book for young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bedtime book ever!","review":"I first had this book read to me at a public library when I was 4. I never owned it growing up, but I would borrow it and force my parents to read it to me.I bought this book for my dear friend who is about to give birth as I write this for her little one. I think it is an integral part of the bedtime routine and it can be fun to have your child say goodnight to their room as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Favorite!","review":"I have read this book to my baby nearly every night since she was born. I was using an old paperback copy I had, but my 7 month old wants to turn the pages herself. So glad it's available as a board book. It's a timeless classic and a favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affirms the delicacy of some emotions","review":"This book is soft on the mind and soft on the feelings. I've read it to all 7 of my children and passed out copies to many friends. It does not stimulate or activate. It does not make noise. Rather it penetrates. It honors the things around us and some of the things that aren't quite things. It reminds us that we are part of something larger and that we can rest and sleep in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Board book - details too small","review":"The pictures in this board book are cropped, which is just sad because the artwork is such an integral part of the story! In addition, it's very difficult to see the details such as the \\"young mouse\\" on each page.My mom has one of the original printings, so she's very cautious to read it to my little girl and then hide it away on a high shelf. My little girl now goes after the original book, and tries to climb the shelving, so I had to get her a new full-size hardcover edition. She reaches for this book every night before bed, leaves the antique edition alone, and ignores the board book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"From when I was a baby, untill modern day, his book has always been a charming read. I love the simple plot, colorful pictures, and the message reaches even the youngest readers. I recomend this book to parents, babysitters abd siblings alike. Truely a picture book classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a classic!","review":"This is a super book for young children. This one is a board book, so it's sturdy & friendly for little hands. Besides the book, you get a cute little pair of socks, all for one low price. We got this set for some friends of ours who were expecting their first child. The father immediately wanted to open the package and read the book. He said that it had been one of his favorite books as a child. It's a fun classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first book for children under 1 year old.","review":"After perchasing several different books for my now 8 month old daughter. I have found the one she loves the most, Good Night Moon. I started reading to her right after birth, but at 5 months I could tell if she was enjoying it or not. It wasn't until I started reading Good Night Moon, that she became very interested and facinated by the pictures. It is the first book she has really become interested in, with the other books she just gets restless and usually knocks the book off my hands, which tells me she is not ready for them, although they are recommended for the same age group. Every night before I put her to bed I read her this lovely book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moons don't sleep!","review":"When I first read this, I was a little confused, but then I realized that the BUNNY is going to sleep, not the moon. That changed things to the point where I would definitely consider this among my Top 16 favorite books of all-time. I would recommend the pop-up version, though. The mechanics of the red balloon garner sheer delight! So all in all, I think children will get a big kick out the rhyming (perfect meter, and effective use of repitition), and that the concepts of sleep and primary colors will grow on them more and more with each read. As long as he or she goes into the book knowing that moons don't sleep, I think this is an educational tool alerting children to the benefits of sleep indulgence."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"and neither does my 2-year-old daughter. She enjoyed it for about a month, but once she memorized it, she started telling me \\"no thanks\\" when I brought it out at bedtime. I received four copies of this book as gifts from friends who raved about it, but it's definitely not a favorite in our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 2-Year Old's Pleaser","review":"I sent this to my 2-1/2 yr old granddaughter. She loves it. Her Mom or Dad reads it to her every night at her insistance and she had it memorized within the week. It must have been the first time she had heard a story being told in rhyming poetry. By the time she recites to the end of the story she's (almost) ready for bed. Grandma was a hit with this little treasure of a present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was the small sized book","review":"Only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because I thought it was the small miniature version of the book, rather than a very large copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice strong board book","review":"I would definitely recommend this item to other parents. It is a nice traditional board book which I am sure my little one will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Ten for Baby's Library","review":"30 years ago I bought this book for my baby daughters and now it is \\"my go to book\\" for my new grandson.

My wife is better. His grandparents are much better. He doesn't much care for some books and I can easily understand why. It just seems to take a special knack to reach some children. Well, one book he really loves is \\"Midnight Moon\\" by Margaret Wise Brown. He likes to go over it again and again, even on his own. It's amazing. Plus, it's helped him to recognize all sorts of things around the house and in his external environment. When he points upward and says \\"Moon\\" at night I know exactly where it came from. Interesting! Personally, I think it's really corny, but I'm not the one to judge. Based on his continuing interest, I'd say this is positively one of his better books.Gary Peterson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the mouse?","review":"We have this must-have classic children's book in English and in Spanish, and we love it. Somewhere around 18 months, my son began the hunt for the mouse, which cleverly appears somewhere different in every picture of the room... including one where he's snacking on the oatmeal.And we call the old lady bunny Grandma Bunny which (for some reason) is also hilarious.The book is full of objects that children see every day, and the pages with the object pictures help them learn what those things are (also great to learn Spanish). And, of course, it's a natural segwey to saying good night to everything in the room and going to bed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Stood the Test of Time","review":"This book has certainly stood the test of time.My nieces read this book as children and now they are adults.I like this book.Although it may seem somewhat simplistic to some adults it is for a young child. As one reviewer commented \\"it put me to sleep\\", isn't that what it is supposed to do? It is a book about going to bed.To me, it de-mystifies the the things in a child's room that may seem scary to them once the lights are out. If you help the child identify the items in their room, then they are not so frightening in the dark. Of course, this is only my perception.Haven't so many of us experienced seeing an object in our room as a child, in the dark and it looks like something it's not? Then you turn the light on and discover it is only your teddy bear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and enchanting","review":"\\"In the great green room, there was a telephone and red balloon . . .\\" This was the first book that I read to my daughter. She continued to enjoy it until she was two and a half years old, and now, at the ripe old age of four, although she has advanced to books of much greater complexity, she still asks for it from time to time. Goodnight Moon is quietly entertaining, from the simple, rhythmic text (which lends itself more to chanting than to reading) to the marvelous illustrations of the strangely soothing \\"great green room\\" which grow darker as the story progresses and the bunny gets closer bed time.As your child grows older, he or she will enjoy finding the elusive baby mouse on each of the colored illustrations. The appeal of this book is somewhat inexplicable, but it is both timeless and enchanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't understand it, but I love it!","review":"My 18 month old son absolutely ADORES this book. I'll have to admit, I find the colors garish, and the illustrations I might have doodled myself, but this is by far my kid's favorite book. The cadence is soft and musical, and I can't believe that my son can point out the mouse on every single page. Point it out? He practically bashes the book out of my hands trying to show it to me. He always wants this book before he goes to sleep at night, and it's a joy to read to him. An absolute MUST for any nursery shelf. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Bedtime Book","review":"\\"Goodnight Moon\\" is the book my nephews always ask for before they go to bed, and I don't blame them.

I have given many copies to friends with small children to ease the end of the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Now that I have a son I realize why this book was given to me 5 times. It is so sweet and simple with beautiful colors. The book is soothing. My son always hands it to me to read. A real classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true childhood classic","review":"To those of us who raised our children on this book, nudging them toward sleep each night with one more, please Mommy, just one more book and please Mommy, please make it Goodnight Moon, the opening lines will always be familiar: In the great green room there was a red balloon - - - and finally there was a spoon and a brush and a bowl full of mush, and a quiet old lady whispering \`Hush.'As you slowly turn the pages, drinking in the images, you begin to notice things. The room gets darker with each page, the hands of the clock progress. The mouse is always there, but it is sometimes hard to find him. The kittens get drowsy, and so does the bunny. There's less mush in the bowl. And most of all the moon rises; in each picture it's a little higher above the windowsill.Simply brilliant.Always enough to make a tired parent drowsy, for sure, and usually it works for the child, too! This classic book should be given to every first-time pregnant mom at her baby shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Night Moon, cloth book box","review":"I was disappointed in the number of pages and the limited reading material in the book. Should have ordered a different version without the cloth box, which is really useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I purchased this book for my 3 year old great granddaughter. Kaydencce Le-ann loves it and we have read it over and over...first I read it to her and then she \\"reads\\" it back to me. The words and illustrations are great for her age group. I would recommend this book to anyone with young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"I love this book. It was given to me years ago when I had my first child. Each of my kids have enjoyed the book and have found great interactive fun in searching for the mouse on each colored page.

Excited to share similar memories with my little girl now too :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"This book tells of a bunny saying goodnight to all the things around him before he sleeps. The simple manner by which the story is told really catches my daughter's attention that it becomes easy for her to memorize the book by heart.The illustrations are cute (especially the mouse --- seen in almost every page!) and the voices behind the songs (audio cassette) make my baby fall asleep faster!A truly delightful book for babies and moms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect 1st book","review":"My sister had kids before me and always mentioned Goodnight Moon. Of course, I ignored her. Now being a mother of two, I can't stop singing the praises of this book. From the time by daughters were about 6 months old they loved this book. The way your voice sounds with the cadence of the story. I buy it for all my friends who are having kids. It's a must for every mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodnight Moon","review":"The little ones seem to love the simplicity and bright colors.

I've always loved the quiet comfort of the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your child loves the original, they'll love this as well","review":"My 21 mo old daughter loves the original \\"Goodnight Moon\\" and loves to play with the little acessories and popout features in this book. The story is the same and there is \\"lots to do\\" while turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic must have","review":"You know that feeling when you go on vacation and towards the end you just long to be in your own comfortable home and get back to your regular routine. Then once you finally arrive home you feel a sigh of relief. This book seems to give children that type of comfort and feeling every time they hear it. They love the pictures and never seem to tire of the story. It's such a simple book but kids love it and that's what matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"True classic","review":"I still remember the feeling I had the first time I read this book to my daughter. She was 2 1/2 at the time. Captivated and excited, she wanted to read it over and over again. There is something about this book that keeps kids interested. I didn't see what the big deal was about the book, which is why I waited till she was over 2 before finally buying the book. I should have bought it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Goodnight Moon is a childrens classic. My son loves reading this book every night. Book was in good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodnight Moon Children's Book","review":"This book helped us to wind down our children when they were babies. It helped them to get used to the idea that it was bedtime and time to settle down for the night. Being able to point to the objects in the book as we are reading helped them to build their vocabulary of common items in the house. I recommend this wonderful book for all parents with babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This book rocked my world. I laughed, I cried, It moved me. A true classic. Words cannot express the deep passion I feel for this book. I will cherish this book for my lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magical Must-Read","review":"Don't know what the special quality is in this simple little book about going to bed, but it is one of the sweetest and most precious memories of my kids' childhood. Each night from infancy to toddlerhood I would read it to them while rocking them to sleep. They would first start pointing to items and then, as they could talk, would softly say \\"Goodnight\\" to the characters as I read. It has a definitively calming effect. I just purchased a copy for my first granddaughter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pictures are scary","review":"I got this book because of the rave reviews. When I read this to my 1st child and I think he was about 18 months old at the time, he was scared looking at the pictures. The sleepy 'rabbit' looked so small in the huge room and there where shadows everywhere.My child could be very sensitive because he was scared when I read 'Cat in the Hat' because the story is about a stranger in the house with the kids! I think at that time, he was between 1 to 2 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this a classic?","review":"I never even heard of this book until about 10 years ago, when suddenly it appeared on every \\"must read\\" list going. I like children's stories, even those most would deem boring, but this has got to be one of the most BORING books ever written, and the muted black and white illistrations just make it worse! My two boys like everything, including technical books and three word baby books, but THEY HATE THIS BOOK! They beg me NOT to read it to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaches children flawed natural order","review":"This book, though highly regarded, sets the stage for something awful in childhood development. It teaches children to anthropomorphise (and on top of that show respect to!) all sorts of random aspects of creation. I didn't climb to the top of the food chain to have my child concern himself with pleasantries to objects. The room serves us, not the other way around! It should thank us for building it and giving it a purpose, not expect us to wish it well at night. It's this type of nonsense that will have my child on the dole after dropping out of high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, I didn't know it was possible to hate a children's book","review":"We got this book as a gift at my baby shower. Having heard so many great things about this \\"classic,\\" I was expecting a wonderful children's book. Maybe these high expectations were part of the problem, but I was extremely disappointed. I just don't see what the fuss is about-- just because something has a reputation for being a classic, doesn't mean it's good. The story is not interesting at all, but worse, the illustations are completely unengaging. I do not like that some of the pictures are really tiny, and the fact that every other page is in black and white seems unfitting for a children's book. My daughter is only 6 months old so I don't know her opinion of this book yet, but I can't get myself to read it to her. My mother-in-law can't understand how I don't consider this book to be a wonderful classic, but I think she's just being sentimental since she read it to her kids and can't see beyond this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodnight Mush","review":"I would never dare to say any of this if I were running for office, but .....I was given Goodnight Moon by a well-meaning enthusiast who felt I could be no parent or claim to know children's literature unless I owned the book. Sure, Goodnight Moon is popular; it's had staying power. But the same could be said for pork rinds and \\"The Dukes of Hazzard.\\" Goodnight Moon is a tired catalogue of meaningless objects, to each one of which I used to say \\"goodnight\\" three or four times a week. My kid has it memorized, but she can also recognize a Home Depot sign, so that's a wash. Moreover, the shrilly colored, crudely drawn, flatly artless illustrations irritate my eyes. My daughter and I have moved on to something else now--actual books."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's the appeal?","review":"I don't see why all these people have rated this as such a great book. There are so many other really great books. I got 5 copies for baby presents. They have a permanent place on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"My baby won't look at it and he LOVES books!","review":"Perhaps he is too young, 1 1/2 years, but my son will not even look at this book. And he probably has 100 others that he loves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"I am soooo disappointed with this book. After reading all the glowing reviews, I expected more. The story is boring. It just points out various things in a room, then proceeds to say \\"good night\\" to all the objects in the room. The illustrations not impressive, and every 2 pages alternate between black/white and color. I've been reading this to my daughter since she was very young (now 14 months old), but she's never really been that interested in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"We all dislike this book","review":"Me, my husband and my young son all have no use for this book. The words and pictures do not hold my son's attention. He's clever enough to need more than just repetition to engage him. My husband finds the colors of the illustrations (the half that have color, anyway) to be jarring, and while the colors don't bother me I think the drawings are rather ordinary. Worst of all, I find it creepy that the rabbits own a cat. My family said goodbye to \\"Goodnight, Moon\\" after a few readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 18-month-old daughter hates this!","review":"I bought this due to all the raving reviews. My daughter loves to be read to. She has a great attention span for a 18-month old. She would sit through 4 to 5 Dr Seuss' books (The Cat in the Hat, Green Eggs and Ham, etc) in one reading session. When I read Goodnight Moon to her the first time, she didn't let me finish, closed the book herself and tossed it. Every time I tried to read this to her, she said \\"No!\\" I'd say this book is not a keeper. I don't even like it myself! Is there a way to rate something no even a star?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does this book get good reviews?","review":"I am sorry, I can not give this book a good review. It is just very boring. We ordered this because it has so many good reviews and when we received it and read it, I am afraid we were left scratching our heads as to why all the good reviews????? There are so many other entertaining books out there, with much better illustrations for the very young..........don't spend your money on this one, it's is NOT worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOO BORING,GREY & WHITE PICS-GOODBYE MONEY!!!","review":"This book is not visually stimulating nor is there any real prose.

We have read it to him before bed since he was 5 months old. He is now 19 months old and still loves it! We usually read 2-3 books each night, saving \\"Goodnight Moon\\" for the finale. He sings \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\" on the Goodnight Stars page. When we travel, this book is never left behind. A must-have for every baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"DECENT FOR A PULP NOVEL BUT BELOW THOMPSON","review":"This is one of the few letdowns I've had reading Jim Thompson.

The second was the correct book but used, and from the Marion Public Library in Ohio."},{"rating":"1","title":"wind in the willows","review":"This book review is about the book wind in the willows. The author of this book is Kenneth Graham. This book is about a water mouse and a mole who made friends on the side of a river bed. In the storie they have many daring adventures together.

But I think it was actually a nice step-up from Exit English (which was a total disappointments after Change Is A Sound). This album actually has fast songs again. And where as til this day, I still can't tell the difference between songs on Exit English, Dead FM has a lot of dynamics to it. The vocals are a little less abrasive. But the album is still energetic. The lyrics are still well-crafted political hymns (much unlike Against Me or Anti-Flag who have very simple cliche lyrics). Cool guitar work. Fast songs, slow songs. Most the tracks are have an upbeat feel. Decent drum sound. Bad bass sound. Thin guitar sound is pretty thin and low in the mix. But in the final process, the album sounds really together. Probably one of the best mixes, considering the vintage equipment used. Its a good album. Go buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up radio, this is the music for the repressed rock masses","review":"The FM airwaves wouldn't be so dead if they were injected with this commanding collection of politically & social charged punk rock anthems.

He claims that he is in fact a perfect man in the chapter on Marx, and uses a totally flawed understanding of evolution to try to disprove Darwin's theory of evolution. Prabuhpada writes with an arrogant tone throughout, using nonsense examples of perfect Vedic knowledge and is condescending and ignorant in his approach to the work of others.Good if you want to study religious or cult propaganda, but otherwise a distorted and probably unhealthy discussion on Western philosophy by a man who insists you should be doing what he says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mo' Better Blues","review":"If you don't get this CD for anything else, treat yourself to the sheer pleasure of listening to Branford Marsalis playing \\"MO BETTER BLUES\\"!!!!!

I recently used the Catskill for making both our Thanksgiving and Christmas meals. It was great because of its large surface area, I could cut multiple items and push them into neat little piles on the edge of the cutting board and continue cutting even more. The Catskill came through some heavy duty work without any stains or deep cuts. This is now, officially my favorite cutting board in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped","review":"I purchased this to replace a well used board which became so warped and distorted that it made chopping and cutting difficult, I was pleased to finally get it replaced.

Not too happy, and will likely have to replace it as I continue to wash it in the dishwasher. I would purchase a thicker board if you plan on washing it in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best progressive albums you've never heard!","review":"Face To Face, Barclay James Harvest's 1984 studio album, is an absolute gem! It blends the familiar BJH themes of socially conscious lyrics with great harmonies and superb musicianship. The mid 80's were a transitional period for progressive rock, and BJH were changing along with the genre. \\"He said love\\" is the most overtly religious song the band has done, being esentially a musical retelling of the Gospel. \\"African\\" is a powerful anti-apartheid statement with chilling lyrics. \\"Kiev\\" is a lovely song lamenting the Chernobyl disaster. If you are already a Barclay James Harvest fan, you will want to add this CD to your collection. If you are not a current fan, this would be a good CD to introduce you to this outstanding group."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's wrong with this picture?","review":"I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.

'My Fair Share' from 'One to One', 'Here's Another Fine Mess' from 'The End' and 'This Strange New Feeling' which appeared in Bugsy Malone entitled 'I'm Feeling Fine'.The album also includes beautiful love ballards like 'Save Me A Dream' to up tempo numbers like 'Brand New Song'.As usual with Paul's albums, it is the combination of Paul's unique vocal style, and song writing, which stand out.

Each book gets a little better each time.. Thanks Pearl again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right up my alley!","review":"The first chapter is a real attention grabber and on the whole the plot is good, smudged a bit when the author takes the reader down a path of past lives and supernatural issues and the ocean blue eyes of Blue Hamilton. Too bad becasue her story about living in a safe, secure neighbourhood where a woman doesn't have to \\"notice a man coming up behind her and it's okay\\" (pg 282) is right on.The author excelled in the many nuances throughout the story. On page 23 I found this African proverb very interesting. \\"The hunter is always the good guy until the story is told by the lion.\\" Then on page 193 the author criticizes a pop culture \\"in which manhood is defined by cars and clothes and random sex and money made by any means necessary\\" rather than being tied to family and community by \\"ribbons of love and protection and responsibility and caring.\\" Excellently put and I agree with her wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"PEARL CLEAGE DOES IT AGAIN","review":"SOME THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D DO is a riveting modern-day fairy tale. Cleage challenges readers to imagine what life could be like if we all took charge of our lives and our communities. In many ways this is a work of speculative fiction-- a novel that asks \\"What if?\\"What if we protected our children from predators? What if we harnessed our political and economic power to change our reality? What if brothers and sisters could come together to make love and make change and make peace?This is a love story, a romance. But like all of Cleage's stories, there is powerful message intermingled with the sweetness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance is still alive","review":"Blue Hamilton is the quentessential woman's man. He is strong, intelligent, sexy, but most of all, determined to protect his woman and all of the women around him. Once again, Pearl Cleage gifts her reader's with a strong, electrifying black male character. He is Prince Charming wrapped up in nubian wrapping paper.The story flows and moves with a fluidity that is only surpassed by the strong dialogue and the extremely believable characters. Even though Blue and other males in the book represent what many of us would like to see among our \\"menfolk\\" Cleage leaves hope for the reader that this doesn't have to be fiction. She leaves the door open for her readers to believe that real men do exist and are just waiting to be the men that they can be. Cleage restores hope for those hopeless romantics who believe chivalry is dead. Well it is not. It is alive and well and living in the mind and pen of Ms. Cleage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"This book was a good interesting, steady read..I love Pearl Cleage's characters in all her novels because they are so strong.

The broad strokes of the book are engaging and the first third is inviting with dynamic characters in an urgent Southern California environment. And then nothing interesting happens from there...

But...\\"kicked the crap out of?\\" I mean, the fact remains that families in the North had a lot more graves to visit after the war was over. Despite having about 1,500,000 more men enlisted than the South had, the North still managed to have about 16,000 more combat casualties. But when a side has over 2.5 million men going up against 1 million, they SHOULD win the war for crying out loud. The South had arguably better generals though... It shouldn't have even been a fight.

I must say that I was disappointed in the realism of the battles and strategy. Changing alternate history to make Southern Generals extra smart and making Northern Generals is NOT a concept for alternate history. It's more like a parody without humor. This could have been a good book and what ruined it for me was a plot that was just too far fetched.

You feel their exhaustion and excitement, as you are both propelled into the \\"fiery hell!\\" of those hot days of July 1863.

It is as good as any written by the greats in this field such as Harry Turtledove and Harry Harrison. As an amature historian and reenactor, I have studied this war quite a bit and always enjoy pondering \\"what ifs\\". This book is based on a very possible senerio unlike \\"Guns of the South\\". While \\"Guns of the South\\" was a very entertaining book it had little basis in what might truly have been possible. Mr. Gringrich and Mr. Forstchen did their home work on this book. They created a very possible senrio rooted in historically fact and brought it to life.

It well written, but it is so far off from the true history of Gettysburg that I found it annoying, even offensive in light of the true events of July 1863.To me history, although it can be told and often explained very well in fictionalized stories (Killer Angels for one) should not be so changed as to taint the reality of what occurred. Especially when using the names of those who were part of the actual event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad. . .a pretty good read","review":"Purchasing this book on a whim I thought it was entertaining (but not as good as The Killing Angels) and until I discovered that it was one of those \\"what if\\" history books. I almost gave up reading it, but am I glad I did not. It ended up being a very good read. In fact, I could hardly put it down. I do not want to give the plot away, but Gingrich and Forstchen give a very good \\"what if\\" scenario if history had taken a different turn that day.What makes this book especially good in the insight the authors give concerning the life of the everyday solider. They bring us back through history, to the killing fields of Gettysburg, the horrific wounds the soldiers received and the sheer terror of being a foot solider in that great and terrible war.Is it a great book? No, not really, but it is a very good book and worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring beyond belief","review":"I bought this book at Gettysburg. I had just toured the place, and love alternate timeline fiction, so I was really excited by the possibilities. However, after plodding through 100 pages of mind-numbing recitation of generals names without any interesting character development, I gave up and threw it away before even getting to anything that could be called intriguing. In my own alternate history, I might have read this whole book and found something good to say. But in this timeline, nada."},{"rating":"2","title":"very well written historical fiction","review":"The War of Northern Aggression comes to light in this historical fiction. The authors showcase their knowledge of true history including details of the brave men who fought and died in this bloodiest of times. As they say, history is written by the winners, meaning all we learn in school has a Northern slant. It was refreshing to see light shed on some Southern heroes. The book puts you in contact with one of the world's greatest heroes...Robert E. Lee. He was a great Christian, a great leader and a true southern gentleman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't think politics; Gingrich hits the bullseye","review":"I know alot of people would be turned off of this book solely based on the author, I was for a bit myself.

Obviously complete fantasy, do not waste your time reading this book, there are way too many good books out there that you need to read before you die. I read a review by someone else and have to agree, in this book everything goes perfectly for the South and the North has everything go wrong, not to mention all the Northern generals that are killed or wounded. The book is a complete joke. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. By the way the South is never going to rise...it was and is a lost cause and an evil cause..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story but.......","review":"I must admit that I was thorougly enjoying this book until I got to the part where Buford was killed south of Gettysburg. (He actually died in December of 1863 from and illness.) I was flabbergasted by the audacity of anyone who would try to improve on the actual history of the Battle of Gettysburg. There could never have been a more compelling story written that would trump what actually took place there and to try and pull it off was disheartening. No battle of Little Round Top, are you kidding me? No final charge by Pickett, are you kidding me? I do not fully understand the idea behind alternative history. Don't we have enough of that going on in our public schools now? History is what happened, not what you wished would have happened. Come on Newt and William.

This process, if done well, makes one think out the actual history then what could have been if... The success of this process rests on the fact that the writer takes an event and reshapes it via a turn of events that did not, but could have happened. When a writer makes characters change their personalities, this loses its credibility. Gingrich and Forstchen made such a change in Robert E. Lee's personality. There was never a chance that REL would have listened to Longstreet's idea of flanking. REL never could conceive of losing a battle with the north, at this point. He could, however, conceive losing the war, due to attrition but not this battle. The tactical changes post-Jackson were never the same for the Army of Northern Va., as they were prior to Chancellorsville. With 100 pages to go, I put this book down. I just could not get past the issue of Lee's personality.The Killer Angels book by Sharra puts Gettysburg to shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book","review":"This is 3 pages long because the pictures are not included.

Poorly written, badly edited, no follow through on any of the ideas presented and basically just shallow material. You can't even really call them stories cuz they are all only about 2-3 pages long. All of the tales in this mini-book are completely formulaic. I was really disapointed with this one. For a good zombie/apocalypse story read, \\"Every Sigh, the End\\" .

To start with, it is only 80 pages, and 30 pages are taken up discussing the research history from which our knowledge of Aztec and Mayan myths derive. The 50 pages of mythology offer only a broad overview of myths (broader even than the excellent World Mythology: An Anthology of Great Myths and Epics by Donna Rosenberg).

I bought these t-shirts because they are solid color and aren't paper thin like those expensive t-shirts you find at places like banana republic.They are a nice heavy weight material. I will say that they do shrink so you might want to order one size large than normal. I am usually a medium in everything and I found the medium size to be perfect when new but shrank a bit after a few washes.

Hate to do it; I love those shirts. But after maybe eight years of wear I guess it's time. So I ordered 4 replacements and they arrived today. Hanes should be pretty red-faced about continuing to call these Beefy-T shirts. Nothing beefy about them, they are pretty lightweight. Certainly not as heavy as the old shirts. But worse, and why I'm sending them back, is the uneven stitching in the shoulder. One badly stitched shoulder on each of two shirts. The material doesn't lie flat but appears to \\"bubble\\" up near the collar. Looks bad. Sorry, Hanes, you had it but you lost it. I guess a $7 tee shirt is too much to hope for anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware the sizing","review":"I'm an average build size medium; not overweight nor athletic build. I used to buy a Hanes pocket t-shirt which fit just great; a generous cut which allowed freedom of arm motion and a slight drape off the shoulder which didn't cling to the body, allowing some air space between the shirt and my skin. This size is not the same as the medium of these beefy t-shirts. These newer Hanes products are very form fitting and more of an athletic cut; tight around the shoulders and chest and draping close to the skin. The chest width as measured at the armpit is 20\\" whereas the older version was 21-21.5\\", resulting in a big difference in fit. The old size is in between the new medium and large. The newer medium is too tight and the large is, well, too roomy for a good look. The color palette is super but the fit is not the same as it used to be for size medium; the older size doesn't exist anymore so be aware of that when you order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware...","review":"I ordered this shirt and it showed up rolled up into a ball and stuffed into a clear plastic bag. No original Hanes packaging at all. After opening there was a bunch of loose threads hanging off. Definitely makes me suspect of the whole thing. There is a Hanes logo screen printed in it, but since there's no packaging, who knows if it really is Hanes or not. I also found the neck hole larger than other tshirts I own.

This is premise that drives Rashid's book. A wonderful concept segregated in categories of relevance that make it a fun and simple read at first blush. Upon futher investigation, one begins to decipher Rashid's intent to taking on design as a lifestyle as well as a concept that is applied to tangible goods. Brilliant at times, waxing poetic other time, and slightly sterotypical in his opinions (but then again, he is entitled to them), I have to say that I adore this book. It is a wonderful reference book for daily living and it is a great source for reminding oneself to be present and how to create an environment that fosters being present. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in re-vamping, organizing and enjoying their life vis a vis their lifestyle design."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was hoping to find more inspiration in this book. It seems a bit random and self-absorbed. I just get the impression that because he's very successful as a designer that he thinks he's tapped into some sort of universal truths about style, which just isn't true. It started out alright, with some positive, energetic outlooks on life and making it your own, but then he also tells you to copy his style. Shouldn't we be finding what makes us feel most positive? Perhaps bright candy colors aren't for everyone? or wearing all white? Also he seems totally unconcerned with what happens to all this stuff after you're done with it.. he encourages you to upgrade things all the time, but what happens to it then? We can't all afford to and even if we could, how much waste do we really need to create? it's irresponsible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Tubing","review":"Tubing is very important to me and I must say, this is really good tubing!

This novel was trying to cover three different cases, instead of just focusing on the case regarding the stalker of the lead female, Mia Wilde. I think the only reason she spent time going into detail for Cameron's investigating a potential cheating woman, was so she could work in Ashley St. Clair (from another book).

Cameron was a sexy, shell of a man while Mia appeared to be exactly what she didn't want to be labeled ~ a tramp.All of the Wilde stories are the same. The characters agree to a short affair and the result is always the same. I wish Denison would give us something new. I'm barely interested in Joel's story, which is next.

Longford/Broadbent is inspirational in his pursuit of \\"thinking the best of people\\" no matter what they have done and in his pursuit of \\"forgiveness\\" despite being personally hurt and wronged.

Unlike Judo, these throws aren't dependent on grabbing your opponents gi.

The main point is the explanation of throwing techniques very different from the ones coming from the Japanese tradition. Very fast, quite simple and very effective, really the highest result with the less effort. From a technical point of view I found that these techniques just throw the opponent away making the landing not controlled. For this reason I highly recommend to not to tray the techniques if you don't already have specific training. Good to buy but be careful on applying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent author, great information.","review":"Having studied judo, I was really attracted to this art and bought the book to learn. I find a lot of excellent information, very good photography but not very good explanations/layout. An accompanying DVD would be very helpful, in order to master the solo exercises (judo has limited katas, Chuai Shiao has excellent solo work) and throws. Described by some as ' bad judo', this system shows a unique way of shearing the opponents as opposed to only unbalancing as in judo. Unfortunately there are not enough qualified teachers of this system, a real shame as it is an ancient art but very applicable to self defense and combat. This book has excellent information which one can make one's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Wrestlers and Grappling Artists","review":"Anyone with a background in Judo, jujitsu or wrestling will recognize many of these techniques and appreciate studying the variations presented. I agree with other reviewers that some techniques are not practical against a larger, stronger or skilled opponent. One disadvantage with grappling arts is that a technique can literally tie you up with one person. Nevertheless, there are several moves demonstrated in this book that can be applied and/or modified to off-balance and \\"direct\\" one opponent quickly into others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Frank Remembered","review":"I thought this video documentary with Miep Gies, was a very insightful tribute to not only a girl, but a time in history that should never be forgotten or misunderstood.

I am Syrian and have a hard time understanding Egyptians because they slur and speak quickly. Here is an example of dialect: An Egyptian may say Kahwa for coffee but a Syrian would say Ahwa. The K is considered harsh and is softened. An Egyptian may saw Farewa for strawberry but we say Fraise like in French. One disc would be repetitive to teach all dialects.

It stills creeps me out. The overall feeling of the film is what Wonderland is suppose be like, dark, dreamy, at times brooding, and altogether strange. The fx make-up is greatly done.

I have to say that I agree with the majority of viewers, and lets hope a proper salvation happens someday. Unlike most who love this version because they saw it as a child, I first saw this as a teenager and it went right along with my Syd Barrett records, my paisly shirt and my rose tinted shades (Mid-80s LA was a little on the retro weird side). The only version that doezzzzn't get just plain dull. Though other versions have great moments, this is the only one I could ever get all the way through still smiling and was a great way to start or round up an evening. And Dude! Fiona is a babe! John Barry's score is nice and subtle if a bit unambitious (maybe) I actually like the way Alice seems to just sing song to herself instead of big musical numbers. It just seems to fit its own inspiration better.I'm so happy I found this, and suffice to say, low quality?... this movie always was a bit submerged and fuzzy. Like a yellow submarine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting all-star British adaptation, but DVD transfer is unwatchable","review":"This is a very interesting adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, featuring a plethora of major British actors from the time this movie was made. Note that today's younger audience, weened on an MTV diet of rapid cuts and incredible CGI, may find this slow. But if one can get beyond that, it's most definitely worth a watch.That said, this DVD transfer is basically UNWATCHABLE. It's not clear what source they used for the transfer, but there are TERRIBLE audio pitch problems throughout the movie, with wow and flutter horribly apparent. This is particularly problematic for a movie like this with a significant orchestral and vocal score. If you have any sense of pitch, you'll find yourself pulling your hair out listening to the off-key strings! The video quality is pretty horrible, as well--worse than standard cable.

I knew it had to an older version as Dudley Moore is dead now but nowhere on the dvd packaging did it say 1972. If it had I wouldn't have bought it.

However, I saw plenty of movies in my childhood and none stands out as haunting as this version of Alice in Wonderland. Its hazy dreamlike atmosphere thrilled me as a boy and any version I saw afterwards was a grave disappointment --especially Disney's which came out about 20 years before. I still remember this film very much and was excited to see it again only this time I noticed things that were very adultlike.

The costumes and sets are perfect. The make-up is magnificent. The acting is A+. Songs have even been added to Carroll's masterpiece, and they are a perfect match.

Great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite worth it","review":"I am one of those who bought the movie for the privelege of seeing a young Michael Crawford (Phantom of the Opera) running around in a rabbit suit. Once I got it in the VCR, not even that motivation could induce me to sit through the entire movie. None of the actors are memorable, and the general feeling one gets is of boredom and irritation. The movie does follow the book it is based on very closely, making use of special effects to make a live- action \\"Alice\\" believable, the costumes are remarkable, and Dudley Moore lends a kind of charm to the Dormouse, but the movie loses the magic of the Disney film. This version of the Lewis Carroll classic would be good for \\"Alice\\" buffs and possibly tolerant children with large attention spans, but it is less than adequate as a form of entertainment during a boring afternoon and hardly does the charming book justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it","review":"I love Alice, and I love low-budget works full of heart, but this production was so relentlessly mediocre that I just couldn't bear to finish it. The songs are lifeless and as poorly paced as the rest of the performance, and the script lacks any spirit; overall this production adds nothing new to the story, yet fails to convey the charm of the book (or, for that matter, nearly any other production I've seen). As another reviewer mentioned, the DVD itself is unimpressive - the chapters are, as near as I could tell, either random or simply timed, without regard to content. If this production is a familiar favorite from your childhood, it may be worth something (unless the DVD transfer is as disappointing as it seemed to me); if you're looking for something new, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"the WORST produced DVD ever","review":"I loved this movie as a child so I thought I'd buy the DVD. I saw one review about the picture quality being prety bad but I went ahead and bought it anyways. I figured a slightly scratchy print would be better than a used video tape with picture rot.I was not prepaired for how wrong I could be.It basicaly looks like they struck this copy from a mutilated 16mm projector print. The print has bad sprocket damage which causes the image to shake on the screen. It seems like they used the bulb from an easy bake oven to project this print. To call the picture muddy would be a compliment. All the life and color has been sucked out of this film. Did I mention that the film wasn't even focused. The sound was pretty bad as well but I'm not much of an audiophile to realy talk about that.Do yourself a favor and look for the VHS version.

The book alternates through stories of school boy life in Burundi, running, and genocide. I am a runner in Austin Texas who hears great things about Gilbert Tuhabonye (now a running coach in Austin), but this is not a running book. This is a book about a man's dream to do well in school in order to get a U.S. college track scholarship. Despite being a victim of unthinkable horror he succeeds in doing so.

This DVD is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't intrigue my son","review":"I bought it for my stay-at-home toddler, 2 years old, so that we could have a fun DVD that he could move around to while he was stuck inside during the long cold and rainy/snowy winter. Despite raving reviews stating otherwise, he'd look at the screen maybe once or twice then run off and go do something else. It's not difficult to hold my son's attention (Dora, Thomas, and Team Umizoomi command his participation wonderfully), but for whatever reason he finds this DVD very boring and not worth his time. I don't know what makes other kids love it so much, but I had to put it out there that my son has no interest in it in the slightest. We'll try it again with my second child that's due in a few months, but for now it was a wasted purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my daughter's favorite video","review":"My 16-month-old loves this video and has been mesmerized by it since she was a year old. Now she loves to dance and wiggle along with the children in the video. The puppet and yoga portions lost her attention at first, but she has learned to march and do yoga poses from watching it. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!!! Do not buy!","review":"This was the first kiddie DVD that I've noticed my son showing disinterest for. He loved the Baby Einstein series. Loved the Mommy and Me DVD. This one had boring puppets \\"stretching\\" and kids at a park setting dancing. The yoga moves were too quick to copy. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian parents beware!

The rest of the family had to make do with the Equate store brand.Despite carefully following all the Nix instructions there were still loads of live lice in the hair immediately after treatment. The store brand (much cheaper with more active ingredients) worked great and those heads were still nit free a week later.Treating a whole family for lice is very expensive so pick something that is going to work first time, and that is not Nix. Then comb, comb, comb and comb again, daily for at least 10 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another favorite","review":"Ok who wouldn't love this movie?

It might be silly and stupid, but not really bad. The story was okay, but the execution was lacking. Now, I will call the editing BAD. It seems like half-way through the movie there is a need to \\"cut and paste\\" some scenes just to get to a drawn out ending. I am also not real sure the casting director did much work picking the \\"kids\\" for this film. Hollywood must be short on talented child actors.

I think I might have laughed twice throughout the whole movie. Owen Wilson plays the bum that is hired to protect three geeks in high school from being bullied.

Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait until it comes on cable TV","review":"I thought this movie would be hilarious because of Seth Rogen's involvement with writing the story but I was wrong. Owen Wilson is okay and you rarely get laughs from the teenage kids.

It had a lot of funny parts to it but overall, it was not a family movie. And even if they were not aiming for a family movie it still was not the best. They had some really good actors. They had a good plot and it was original ideas in there. But I think where they messed up is they had too many themes going on at once. If they would have stucki to the idea of hiring a homeless man to help them play pranks on the bullies it would have been better. But, I could get through the movie, it started off funny but I just wish they would have put more time and ideas in the movie and it would have really been a movie you could keep and watch over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY","review":"I was extremely surprised at how quickly it arrived.

This book was really Thuged Out and it relly had some serious stuff.I loved the first few pages of this book, and then the guy changed gears and took another road that I didn't enjoy. The book became made for TV writing, with all the stuff, funny dialoge and serious plot. Mr. Quinonez has talent, but he's giving it to Hollywood. If you like pop film, you may love this book. The scenes that made this for T.V was the parts with the drug deals and the parts of stealing and robbing. My favorite character was Sapo, I like him because hese relly thuged-out.

It was not. To say the least, it falls far short of the hype. To compare it to Gatsby is like comparing the NY Yankees to the Toledo Mudhens. Quinones shows skill as a writer only when he is describing Spanish Harlem. His passages about nicknames and his description of a Pentecostal Church are especially on the mark. But the rest of the book simply sags. The plot is flimsy, the writing sometimes sounds amateurish (who edited this?), and the ending is almost laughable (although it is intended to be anything but). Ernesto, I think you've got talent, but stick to what you know, and stay away from the sensational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clicheville","review":"I hoped this book would be good; Quinones has received a lot of acclaim for it. Unfortunately, this book is bad. Instead of subtlely or finely discussing the oppression, racism, and harsh reality his characters faced, Quinones preaches and divulges information in a totally unbeleivable way. There are the occasional well crafted phrases and sections, but they are drowned out by the horribly cliche plot and unbeleivable story line. I'm sure the numerous references to Spanish Harlem will ring true for those from that area, for me though, they didn't add much. Instead of just mentioning \\"la marqueta\\", why not reveal the nature of it? Reference after reference seemed to have only one purpose, \\"name dropping\\". As such, it grew tiresome. Notwithstanding the fact that my review is negative, I appreciate the fact that people are writing stories from the urban Latino perspective; I just think we can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"my third attempt","review":"................. The writer is clearly capable of terrific evocative writing, his Spanish Harlem is right on the mark, but the plot and dialogue are at times downright embarrassing and cliche ridden. I would have preferred a book with no plot or talking at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks big time, mad stupid, another slum novel.","review":"I hate this novel, superficial, misleading and full of despair. Noir in the worst taste. The hero never realizes that once you dishonor yourself you have hurt yourself and your community. The reparations are not to set up detox clinics while still selling drugs. The hero \\"takes down\\" the lawer and the cunning Vera but he does it because they killed Willie Bodega, a \\"nice\\" organized crime hancho, from whom the hero had gotten favors. The hero, a college student speaks spanglish ghetto ebonics, hmmm. All the time. There is that marvelous twist toward the end but the reader has no hint at it, it just comes out of the blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read 'The Great Gatsby' too.","review":"While Quinonez deserves props for articulating a vision of Spanish Harlem (and for selling a first novel about it!), he has simply taken every element of 'The Great Gatsby', from plot to use of narrator, to the ending. This, I'm sorry to say, is not original writing. I'm amazed it was published. For an authentic, original take on this subject, I recommend 'Always Running', about the LA barrio. But if you liked this book, perhaps you'll love Quinonez' next novel: it's a tale of a Puerto Rican prince who can't decide whether or not to kill his uncle, who murdered his father."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it better...","review":"I was really looking forward to reading something different, something authentic and real, and all of the buzz suggested this was it. But aside from the really wonderful descriptions of the neighborhood and ways people live, the book was a let down. The dialouge was corny and the plot was derivative. But I can't argue that the author has talent, I just hope he puts it to better use next time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for the Movie Rights","review":"This book is too heavy handed in its political message to be taken seriously. Quinonez obviously wrote Bodega Dreams with the aim to broker a movie deal. The characters are uninteresting which is really amazing because there is so much potential for great dialogue and suspense. Quinonez's weak writing style is magnified by his insistence to endlessly spell everything out for the reader. Bodega Dreams offers nothing new to the discussion of the urban environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Stepleton Bodega Dreams by Ernesto Quinonez","review":"This story is about the trials and tribulations of a young spanish man Chino, and his wife Blanca, as they try to survive in Spanish Harlem.Money is very tight for Chino and Blanca since both are enrolled in the city college. Sapo who is Chino best friend, introduces Chino to Willie Bodega, a drug lord of the nieghborhood kingpin. Willie Bodega re-builds spanish harlem by buying the old apartments, re-building them, then he gives them back to his own people. He takes a liking in Chino and sends Sapo, who already works for him, to set it up. This book takes you on a ride thru some crazy lifestyles, and for some people, it is thier lifetsyle. This book showed me how some people are still living in the U.S. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who wants to see what life is like for the poverty struckin'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable Debut Novel","review":"Ernesto Quinones weaves a tale of deception and greed that is exceptional for a first novel. Bodega dreams has a strong plot, intriguing characters , an unusual setting in East Harlem and a well executed surprise ending. I found it to be a very entertaining and compelling story. Neighborhood loyalty gets turned on it's head as the story progresses. Very well done and I look forward to seeing what Quinones does next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot of Promise","review":"I was lucky enough read an advanced copy of the book and was surprised to know that the author visited one of my favorite stomping grounds - the International Salas Museum on 116th and 3rd Avenue. The Author describes the owner and location in terrific detail (with the exception of the ties explained in the book). It was exciting to read about it and meeting the author was thrilling.The book was great. There are a few faults but nevertheless it is a great read. Ernesto is a promising writer who I look forward to reading again soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, better ending","review":"Overall I have to say that I'm impressed with the way that Bodega Dreams came out in the end. Although some parts of the book are more fillers and don't really have much to do with the plot, I liked how the chain of events eventually led to a surprise ending that reveals characters' true motives, as well as secret betrayals. While action didn't play a major part in Quinonez's storytelling, the raw speech and interactions between those involved in the story created tension that builds throughout the novel. This was a pretty quick and decent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"they should make a movie on this!","review":"i had to read this book for my latino literature class. my teacher told us that we were going to LOVE this book and she AIN'T kidding!!! best book i have ever read so far!!! it had me kept turning the pages! i am in love with it!!! it's officially being added to my book collection. the character sapo is very funny but vulgar while chino is a good guy who just happens to get involved with the wrong kind of people. i had a great time reading about the characters and the east harlem setting. the street language hits closer to home so i wasn't bothered by it. i am so impressed with this book that i would like to delve in more of the author's other work. i hope that someday this novel will be turn into a movie. definitely recommend for people who are interested in boricua/latino literature or new york."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved, loved, loved it","review":"I loved this novel.

That is simply the best track on this six song EP. Ani also reworked a few of her own songs and tha result was an better-than-album version of \\"to the teeth\\" the title track of her previous album. the other four songs are icing on the cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better buy a new CD player","review":"'Cause you're going wear your old one out, especially the repeat button.

The raw energy of the band's live sound shines through on the set as does the technical brilliance of the late Terry Kath's guitar work. Cuts such as \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" and \\"Liberation\\" cook, but suffer from the poor sound quality that dogs the entire album. For the Chicago-phile, this is a must-buy (if only for the historical value--it is the first live recording from the band), but for the average listener, this is definitely a \\"should-pass.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"I love Hellboy!

Japan still has an Emperor and England has a Queen... their customs and traditions remain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mishima's most accessible novel","review":"Fifteen years ago I read this while on a Jap. lit. binge; I have since read all of Mishima's novels available in English (are there others not translated?), and this one remains one of my top two with Temple of the Golden Pavilion. I just re-read it over the past two days, and it has not lost any of its appeal.The characters and setting are reminiscent of Steinbeck, as in The Pearl, The Red Pony, and Tortilla Flats, yet the narrative has a pathos and philosophical sensitivity that provide insight into a deeper Japanese identity crisis as one prominent review detailed earlier. With a light touch of classic Mishima eroticism, this is an engaging read of the \\"root for the good guy\\" type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"Mishima was such a great writer and this story is such a beautiful tale and full of nature and the angry sea. True love conquers all in the end I guess even if it's a cliche. This is easy to read and can appeal to any age from middle school to senior citizen. I recommend it as a gift to someone you love. This is so tame compared to his other darker but great other books. I'm sorry the world has lost this man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something more than love","review":"This book is a great example of the perfect romance/love story; guy falls for girl, girl falls for guy, they get married, etc. However, Shinji and Hatsue had a lot of obstacles to overcome before they could be together. The characters did this with will power and personal strength, which I think is also major theme of the book. Not only Shinji and Hatsue show examples of this theme, but will power is also displayed by Shinji's mother and the mistress of the lighthouse. This theme is not immediately obvious, but many retorical devices of the book symbolize it, so there is an essance of it there, under the surface. The book shows a great tale of love; however, will power is what helped the characters obtain their happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Opinion","review":"The book Sound of Waves is a book my classmates and I are reading for our English 1 class.

Usually I don't like romances, but this one made a lot of sense. It gave a sense of innocence; gave actual typical adolescent behavior; coming to terms with infatuation, sexuality, and pride; and a great moral in the end. Beautifully described about village islanders' situations and everyday life.

In the book Sound Of Waves, the most memorable part was the letter writing between Hatsue and Shinji. Shinji and Hatsue meet at the light house and Shinji gives Hatsue a seashell. My favorite character is Hatsue because she knows how to defend herself from others. She is not a type of person that likes to be pushed around by others. What I liked about the book was when Shinji and Hatsue met each other at the light house and Shinji pretended to be asleep while watching Hatsue getting undressed. The part I didn't like was that Hatsue's father prohibits her from seeing her boyfriend. Hatsue's father would not see Shinji's mother. The book has a happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva, Heather!","review":"I was thrilled to read this book to my daughter.

Harrowing in its depiction of the pain that fills the suicidal mind, deeply moving in its stories of overcoming that pain and living beyond it, this book is an invaluable resource.

The excessive plot twists are propped up by awkward explanation opportunities that inhibit what little flow there is and dispel any suspension of disbelief that the reader may have enjoyed.Hammett's reputation is deserved, but this novel is not worthy of that reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic detective fiction, but not the best Hammett","review":"\\"The Dain Curse\\" is a great read ; the dialogue is crisp and the story zings along at a great pace. The main problem with the book is the disjointed storyline ; the plot is subdivided into three sections, each with a self-contained storyline, linked up by the supposed curse around the leading female character, Gabrielle Leggett. The denoument of the book feels contrived ; I felt that Hammett had probably thought up the three separate plots and had (not completely successfully) attempted to link them together. However, this is a minor quibble ; the book is a great read and I would recommend it to all fans of detective fiction, although this may be a disappointment to those who have previously read \\"Red Harvest\\" or \\"The Maltese Falcon\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you're into it","review":"If you get all soft and runny at the mere sound of the words \\"fashion\\" or \\"style,\\" and these things have the significance of religious cultism in your life - then this is for you!

Turns out the album is exceptional nonetheless. A 'no frills', hard rockin', hard hittin' album created by talented, dare I say \\"veteran\\" musicians. The singer is equally explosive, soulful, and has a swagger about him that is missing in many of these indie pop/rock darlings. But don't be confused, The Shining are (were? I think they split up) not \\"indie\\" but rather hard rock with a classic rock appeal that I so beg for in recent years of over-pollinization. Every song on here is excellent, or like in the case of \\"Until The End,\\" epic. (The rhythm on \\"Find Your Way Home\\" is brilliantly fluid.) An album for the casual rock fan as well as Verve fans. A buried gem I will be going back to again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"...even worse","review":"Ravin should stop compiling buddha-bar cds !! his best remains vol 3, there is no more inspiration, making the last two buddha-bar less than average.Visan or Popat or even a new DJ should make the next one. i hope this gets read by the georges V people ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buddha Great als always!","review":"Well...it is still One of the Best chillout compilations and this One is a great one, too.If you like to get to Know another Great chillout compilation you should Listen to\\"Dolomiti Super Chill\\".This Compilation has its Origin in Italy Europe and you will Love it also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What do you want more than this?","review":"Amazing and wonderful are the right words to describe it.

But, perhaps, a book written by someone interested in the man's flaws as well as his accomplishments, his failures as well as his triumphs, might have been better reading. Cristine Conrad says in her author's note that she was Robbins' friend for more than 30 years. To my way of thinking, her friendship gets in the way of good reporting. I'm not necessarily looking for a hatchet job on Robbins, but a writer less interested in (what we used to call) brown-nosing, would, most likely, have written a richer book.Why did I give it even four stars? The huge, varied collection of photographs in this book is fascinating and invaluable for anyone interested in Musical Theatre or 20th Century American Ballet.The real, full version of Robbins' life is yet to be written/published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 2 days","review":"The remote worked only for 2 days.

It provides more lateral support than just a knee \\"sleeve\\" -- but not substantially more. I would definitely not recommend it for anyone with significant knee weakness. By itself this would merit a 3 or 4 star rating. Unfortunately, on my third use of the brace the top portion tore. I cannot tell if this is due to the relatively light material out of which it is constructed, a design flaw, or a flaw in the manufacturing process (or some combination of the three). Given that the brace is tight (it must be to serve its function), it should be built substantially enough to hold up to more than three pulls (which are required to put it on). Not a horrible item, but there must be something better on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Brace","review":"I suffered from weak and painful knees. This brace is just amazing.

If they're as young as Little Sal is, it might be better to wait a year before reading :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first Robert McCloskey book","review":"Robert McCloskey, author of the classic \\"Make Way for Ducklings\\" is one of the greatest American children's authors. Blueberries for Sal is a great introduction to this author for the younger listener who might not have the patience or understanding for \\"Ducklings\\" or \\"One Morning in Maine,\\" another beautiful McCloskey book. My two-and-a-half year old just adores this story and could hear it over and over. Here, little Sal (who is much older in \\"Maine\\") goes with her mother to pick blueberries to can for the winter and finds herself all mixed with a bear mother and child who have come to gorge themselves on blueberries. Sal's and Little Bear's frustration at being expected to keep up with their busy mothers rings true with toddlers and they adore the hilarious mother-child mix-up that ensues. Every child should read this one, if only so that children learn that people used to can their own food!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Loving Old Classic","review":"The classic, very old picture book from 1948 has lost nothing of its charm, and the illustrations are very laboriously drawn with great eye for the detail (little Sal's too big bib'n'braces falling from her small shoulders, for example). The inside cover illustration where Sal plays with the rubber rings for the preserve glasses reminded me of my own childhood when my mum made jellies and preserves.There's lots of text so I recommend from 3 years up and probably more for girls (as they tend to have a longer attention span). Also, I'd rather get the hardcover version because really, besides being a beautiful picture book, this little gem could be a perfect hand-me-down for generations to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Berries For Sal","review":"I did not like it that much because bears do not talk because bears are bad.The pictures do not have color.I like it a little bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story!","review":"Being from Maine, I may be a little biased, but I think this is one of the best children's books ever written.

When Sal and Little Bear end up following each other's mothers instead of their own, the story and its illustrations only get cuter.As with all of McCloskey's books, the illustrations are charming and speak as loudly as the well-written words.To read more of my children's book recommendations, visit larsenreviews.org."},{"rating":"2","title":"about a little girl and a bear who get mixed up","review":"My 4 year old son loves this story about blueberry picking.

I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mothers are special!","review":"Robert McCloskey is perhaps one of my favorite children's authors. Every one of his books speak of a simpler time when life seemed to be easier. In this book, as in the others, it also shows that life is supposed to be fun and full of adventure.Little Sal has her own adventure when she goes blueberry picking with her mother. As she's eating blueberries along the way, she becomes separated from her mother. Her separation becomes a true adventure when she encounters a baby bear picking his own blueberries. A delightful reunion with her mother takes place at the same time that Mama Bear finds her own cub.Your children will be delighted as I was when this book was read to me by my mother when I was a child. That warm memory still lingers after so many years. I would suggest that you create your own child's memory by reading the book to them.

For me, the album lacks one important thing: tunes.It is possible that the album is a complex masterpiece that will grow over time, but I've listened to it a dozen times now and it still does nothing for me.

Usually I really enjoy this type of flick; I'm patient & easily seduced by atmosphere and pretty scenes. And the shots of Stirling, Scotland really are pretty (this area was home to William Wallace, aka Braveheart, in the 13th century).But MONROE is long... I mean really long. And slow, really slow. So by the time the end slowly crept up on me, I was oh so sleepy. For me, there's just a little too much careful pacing and atmosphere. Once in awhile, something (anything!) needs to happen... besides another elegantly-framed, bloodless death (there are a bunch of those).I watched to the end, but I was pretty bored by then. Maybe that's just me... or maybe you, if you're not up for a long (two-part) BBC mystery that unfolds... slowly.You decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update: Happened again!

I don't know how these guys have avoided becoming rich and famous. Probably because the mainstream media is afraid to play anything on the cutting edge. The media moguls got gun shy when they saw what happened when Dan Rather stood up and told us that George Bush was a deserter from the Air National Guard long before he transformed it into the International Guard. Chris Chandler and David Roe courageously proclaim with very strong voices that there's something happening here and that the American people need to wake up and pay attention.

In this film she is alluring and complete eye candy in her bangles and beads! She also adds an exotic touch as an Egyptian trader with high ideals, who places her own life in danger by playing along with German gun runners in order to help the British in their efforts to keep North Africa free at the beginning of WWII. The story is certainly dated, the quality of the DVD fair but watchable. For Tierney fans, a real delight to see her in an early starring role using her sensuality to manipulate the men around her.

The Steroe's sound was very pop/emo influenced, as opposed to the Impossibles' previous work, which could be considered to be ska-core punk. The Impossibles' new CD borrows from The Stereo more than the Impossibles of old, but something totally new is also thrown in there. Return has a highly emo/melodic sound to it, similar to bands such as the Alkaline Trio or Weezer. However, if you listen hard enough, you can tell there are bits of Impossibles still in there, especially in the painful cries, usually provoked by a girl, or the rock solid guitar riffs. The only down side about this album is its length. With Anthology by the Impossibles being over 20 songs long, just 12 songs on a new CD is quite short. Other than that the Impossibles have made a completely successful return, even if their sound has completely changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad to see them back","review":"I just wanted to say that this album is a must.

Not all of the cases included fit the criteria, though; for example, included was the case of Chester Gillette, who killed his pregnant girlfriend. Gillette at first said her death was an accident, then that it was a crime of passion, but it turned out he'd murdered her in cold blood because he didn't want to marry her or support their child.If you want a good grounding in any of these cases but don't have a lot of time, this book would be a good place to start.

Her writing is heavily narrative with little character development. For instance, she'll introduce a scene that describes in great detail the location or activities of her characters while only briefly stating what they are feeling.I was surprised by the very dry style of Zorro because I'm also reading her novel, \\"Portrait in Sepia\\", in Spanish. In \\"Portrait\\" she writes very expressively and imaginatively.

Plenty of interesting detail strung to a frame made of more detail. If you want to know general history about early California, what it was like to cut across Panama in the days before the canal, the Spanish Inquisition, and so on, then it is okay. But it is generally told from such a distant and obtuse point of view that the characters lack any zest. Thus, the encyclopedia analogy. I say make a wide berth around this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book","review":"I found this book fun to read after reading more serious books in the past.Fun story, too bad there is no sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please...","review":"If you are a Zorro fan for as long as I have been, you probably bought this book looking for fun, light reading of swashbuckling adventure and the colorful characters we all know and love. If that's the case, you really won't like it. I mean... Senora De la Vega was a Spanish noblewoman, and we all know it - not a native Anerican or a lady of mixed birth. To think of Diego and Bernardo as brothers is almost laughable, and even annoying. Diego is so unappealing that he makes me sick. Why does everyone want to try and fix what ain't been broke? Forget this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Isabel Allende is a wonderful, magnetic author. Zorro is a must read (or hear via audio). Beginning with Zorro's childhood Allende develops a magnetic character in a hero-in-process. Zorro's life and development into a folk hero take us into many vibrant \\"historical\\" situations, and we meet marveious and intriquing characters in the Native Americans of California, the gypsies of Spain, pirates of New Orleans and just plain rogues of early California. Like the other Allende books I've read, Zorro moves quickly; it was very hard to \\"put down.\\" I listened to the audio version and shared it with three others who thought it equally marvelous.

I'm surprised to read that theAuthor, born in Peru? is now an american citizen living inSan Francisco. She is a good writer and probably has anexcellent translator. The book is about how Zorro came tobeing, how he was born in California, leared how unfairinjustice is, was educated in spain in riding and fencingand returned to California to save his father and motherfrom opression.

I gave this book 2 stars because I expected a lot more from Isabel Allende. This book is very put-downable. There is no exciting development as far as I'm concerned. She's definitely got the talent but the story just flows so effortlessly in her previous novels that this one seems very far-fetched. But then again, I didn't like the Daughter of Fortune either, so I guess it's not just that I don't like a male hero.

Dont buy it is my advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Early Life of Zorro","review":"Zorro is a long narrative detailing the early life of the hero. the length works against the action scenes, but succeeds in filling out Diago's character and presenting the reader with a plausible explanation of how he metamorphized from Diego into the mythic hero, Zorro. Also offers good background of Spanish history during the early 1800s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zorro Begins!","review":"What a wonderful story told by a brilliant author. This Zorro origin tale reminds me of one of my favorite movies from last year, \\"Batman Begins.\\" Like this novel, that movie provided a fresh new look at a familiar hero. That movie developed the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman through dark cinematic images and flashbacks in the same way that Allende develops Diego de la Vega/Zorro through her beautiful prose. It is no wonder that the creator of Batman was influenced by Johnston McCulley's Zorro. My one disappointment was that this book had to end. This sorrow not only came from the fascinating and imaginative tale ending, but also from the lack of true Zorro adventures (as the legendary hero fighting injustice in old California). I had hoped to read more swashbuckling once Allende established Diego as Zorro. Perhaps Allende will save these tales for further novels. One can only hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful story telling","review":"I can't really write anything original here -- it has all been well said by other reviewers. I have loved all of Isabelle Allende's books, and this is another true charmer. I listened to the unabridged audio version of this book during my commute. Blair Brown does a phenomenal job on the story. I loved the fact that it picks up before he was born and tells how he became \\"the fox.\\" It was incredibly entertaining, well written, fun, with a hero you could truly root for...I was even rooting for Jean Lafitte (sp?) to win the beautiful Julianna. I was sorry when it was over. There was a void in my car when it was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zorra, the Dull Blade","review":"I'd have thought it impossible to write a dull Zorro story. A bad one, sure, but one that's dull as well?Allende's Zorro is a harmless, ineffectual, hormone-hobbled fop. The story has a few bold moments, but I soon began to wish the hero would grow up. I wonder if Allende had any respect left for her character when she finished writing. If you want to know Zorro's origins, read Mark of Zorro, McCulley's original serialization. It, like its hero, is bolder, more daring, and less pathetic than Allende's Zorro, who is somehow made less interesting than a mute character. McCulley recalled the basic principle: heroes should be admirable. Allende's Zorro is a narcissistic adolescent who would be more at home in the mall, or endlessly reading self-help books.The paperback has this going for it: the cover is more appropriate to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not normally one to post bad reviews","review":"I'm not a guy who dosen't like something and then posts how bad it is..To each their own as far as I see it.But,the fact that this book is a bestseller is just WRONG.I've been PLODDING through this mess for a good month and a half and am literally counting the days until I'm free.I'm convinced the author watched \\"The Mask of Zorro\\" and had dreams about Antonio and then decided to write a book.How interesting that one of the characters is named Isabel?If you're a Zorro fan..STAY AWAY from this absolute waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Looking for the dash and adventure of Johnston McCulley's pulp hero Zorro? Then don't look here!Allende's attempt to produce an origin for Zorro has less excitment than one of those .99 romance novels with Fabio on the cover. Yes, it is written better than that type of work, slightly, but as Allende struggles so much to be politically correct with multiculturalism and feminism this book is simply dull. Even her attempts to weave real historical action into the story fall flat. The novel is nothing but page after page of nothing happening. There is no fun in reading it, which is supposed to the point of picking up something with Zorro in it. Indeed, finishing Allende's Zorro was a chore.If you want to read of the adventures of Zorro, find reprints of McCulley's pulp novels, or find Alex Toth's or Don MacGregor's collected comic works on \\"the Fox\\". In those works, as it should, in the name of justice the sword sings and the whip snaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, poor construction","review":"I purchased this item, even after seeing a cheaper model at Walmart, because my Amazon usually doesn't sell junk.

The full title is \\"The Ropers: a biographical Record from circa 1300 to 1982\\", but of more than 800 pages a scant 13 deal with the period before 1637 when John Roper of Buckenham, Norfolk sailed to Massachusetts and became the first of the American Ropers. Thus the English Ropers are disposed of hastily with absolutely no biographical information, and there is no attempt to show the connection of John Roper the American settler with the English family. The remainder of the book deals exhaustively with the American Ropers and will be of interest to those who don't care how they arrived in the colonies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groove Machine","review":"While certainly very listenable, this collection is most interesting for the way it reflects Zawinul's feelings about his old band. He's obviously recast Weather Report in the role of groove machine and chooses tracks that reflect this bias. The early Weather Report that emphasized free improvisation is totally MIA. That said, these tracks groove REALLY hard. The rhythm sections, particularly that of Alphonso Johnson, Chester Thompson and Alex Acuna, are a revelation. The featured soloists get a chance to stretch out, too, which is nice. I'm subtracting one star because sometimes the tempos can be a bit rushed and lyricism, normally one of the strong suits of Weather Report, is notably lacking. One thing for sure: Live & Unreleased blows the timid and tepid \\"greatest hits\\" package 8:30 out of the water.

Electric and harmonically advanced tunes imbued in African and South American sytles shape this 2-CD set. The only quibble lies in the less than excellent recording quality. If your a Weather Report fan, this surely is the CD set you have been waiting for...if your new to this group, starting out with some of their previous releases would be advisable ( e.g. Black Market, Heavy Weather, Mysterious Traveler ).

To do this, however, he must deceive them, by pretending to be Patrick, who supposedly commited suicide at the age of 13.Many suspenseful situations ensue, especially between Brat and Simon, Patrick's jealous twin brother. These conflicts, along with Tey's excellent writing, make the book a real page-turner. The depth of the characters also adds to the book.I am usually not a fan of mysteries, but I really enjoyed this book, and heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictably good.","review":"The best evidence of the fine writing in this novel is a back cover blurb that gives away much of the plot, yet in no way diminishes the pleasure of reading the book.Basically the story follows Brat Farrar, who successfully assumes the identity of long presumed dead Patrick Ashby to inherit a fortune. What sets the book apart is the development of Brat's character. His feeling and motivation is examined sympathetically, and in many ways that is what drives the novel.There are a number of minor shortcomings to the book. In contrast to the wonderful development of Bee and Brat, the character of Simon is drawn fairly shallowly. He seems to be a bit of a stock villain and his motivations are never examined. Also, the ending was a little to pat. It doesn't seem likely that the scenario could be wrapped up as cleanly and quickly as indicated in the book. But apart from those quibbles it was, all in, an excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nah.","review":"Too bad as I heard good things about this author but for myself, I found the writing slow.

Doubt I'll read another one by Tey."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 1 cent book","review":"Sent for a copy of Brat Farrar by Josephine Tey. In the middle of this mystery story, the book was missing about 100 pages! I had to find another book to end the suspense.Beware of good deals."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I picked this book at the bookstore to while time away, and I'm very glad I didn't buy it. the outline of the plot was appealing but in the end it was mediocre. I didn't like the main character all that much, and mostly he stayed in the shadow, as unknown to us as he was to the family. It's also hard to believe that he wasn't revealed as the impostor. the odds of pulling that off are very low. The story went on at a slugglish pace, and the mystery took a backseat most of the time. Most of the time it was Brat going around the estate and meeting people. The suspense was nonexistent. I think Agatha Christie is much more interesting. Also, the mystery in this book was weak and quite predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I don't agree with the many people who raved about this book. The plot synopsis hooked me, but the manner in which the lead character determines that a murder took place, and the manner in which he determines the murderer, is very simplistic, and unimaginative.Further, the \\"mystery\\" is really secondary to the plot of how the lead character is going to deceive those around them that he is the long-lost brother.Exceptionally disappointing - with a plot like that, the writer could have truly done much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"as W. C. would say \\"a little on the side\\"!!","review":"I would recommend this to any fan of W. C. Fields. While it looks at the great comedian from his mistress's perspective and takes some degree of latitude with that - it is nonetheless a part of his overall persona. Simply take it with the proverbial grain, or tablespoon, of salt! Miss Monti's perspective is obviously slanted and defensive of her life with him. But, taken into account with some of the other, more objective approaches to presenting Fields this adds its portion to the full view of the man. But, do, read other works available if you have not already. A tip of the hat to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it... wish the movie were available to play at home...","review":"The first time I went to see the movie, I did so to watch Rod Steiger fall flat on his face; having never played a lick of humor before this movie. A couple minutes into it, I lost sight of Fields; it was like watching Fields playing himself, so well did Steiger invoke the great comic.I loved the movie and am totally p*ssed they never put it out on any media I can buy and play at home. The studio says it didn't do well enough at the box office to warrant putting it on recorded media for commercial sales.I just wish there were a way to convince the studio to at least allow Amazon to sell digital images of the movie; that way the studio has no investment in stock, and can make 100% profit from the commission they charge Amazon to publish it digitally. Anyone who agrees with me, write Amazon.Maybe if enough aficionados write them, they'll get in touch with the studio and make arrangements."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely poor quality item","review":"This so called thumb stabilizer is not even worth being called a glove.

In Jug - A - Rum, it talks about Polly Kemp and her wish. In The Tree Man, it talks about Rowena Jervis and her wish. In Water, Water Everywhere, it talks about Adam Fiske and his wish.

I felt that the characters weren't fully developed and if they were they were antagonists. Though the protagonist seemed to be a static character.

Their names were Poly Kemp, Stew Meat, Rowena Jervis, Adam Fiske, and Thaddues. Thaddues gives them a card with a red dot on it. Thaddues Blinn said, \\" When you are ready put your thumb on the red dot and wish wisely because there is only one wish and the wish will come true the way you say it.\\" They took the cards home and one by one they wished, and they learned a lesson from their wish.

The author described what was going on with great detail. I could picture every chapter in my head. Since the book was a fantasy it's harder to get the reader to picture it, but Bill Brittain did a good job. For this book I always wanted to read more and see how the next wish was going to turn out. The book told how three people had the chance to make one wish. They made their wish, but it wasn't exactly what they wished for."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wish Giver was a funny book.","review":"The Wish Giver was a funny book because Bill Brittain expressed the characters as if they were from real life.

Hey Now was the single that pulled me in but the problem with it lies within its very weak chorus. The only good song on this album is Hero.

It not only explained the purpose of each piece but gave an insiders view on its application as well as a host of other tips. This book is allmost the complete opposite. For the price, I received what amounts to a reprint of some general information from the grip book, plus some reproduced catalog information from the various manufacturers of camera mounts, cranes, trusses, etc. What I expected to find: how to rig a camera to a vehicle, how to rig equipment to structures, scaffolding, etc., how to build rigs or to adapt commercially available equipment. A skinny little book, hardly worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little for Too Much","review":"I totaly concur with the other review. Not enough real GRIP info.

Ummm not Grip Dept. I'm just getting more into rigging and wanted to see more real world stuff, not even a mention of speedrail/nurail in the Index or Glossary, and barely a page in between brings it up and we know how important it is in rigging and on the spot ingenuity.The most important part of this book is \\"The Big Break\\", how to act on set for noobs, pretty much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as Described","review":"Something this simple, yet so useful.

I seem to recall at the time we were pretty impressed by the animation, after all it was 1995/97. It's premise is fairly along the same lines for the games (though there are several MKII game references in the movie), and it is pretty predictable (it's based on a fighting video game, you want hard core story, this is not necessarily the right genre) and it's an enjoyable watch. Nothing epic, obviously. The only downside is that MK:A definitely was no where near as good at MK, in both visuals, plotline (they seemed to be all over the place), and acting. I really wish they had gotten Christopher Lambert again for Raiden, and I thought Bridgette Wilson played a better (more stoic, I'm tough girl) Sonya than Sandra Hess.

They make your life hell if you let them. So, after watching the first 30 minutes, I finished watching in fastforward until the last 10 or so minutes.My story turned out with the bully getting a super-sized dose of karma but I know that that doesn't always happen--in this life."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely awful","review":"\\"black comedy\\", \\"dark comedy\\"? i don't think so. it was awful. kevin spacey certainly has his moments, but not enough of them to warrant renting it. don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolting","review":"This movie is very difficult to watch after awhile. Its about a psycho boss but its not funny at all. I didn't laugh through any of the movie. I love dark comedies like election, heathers, to die for, etc but this just didn't work for me. I hated it so much I returned it (lied and said it was a gift).

This was a depressing movie with sick torture scenes. In the movie 9 to 5 they tortured their boss too but it was light and funny. This was dark and depressing. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great actor, horrible movie!","review":"I only gave it 2 stars because Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor. Had he not been in it, i would have shut it off half way through. i don't know why this movie is classified as a comedy?? Kevin Spacey insults that guy & screams at him, and that is funny when Kevin acts like that. But the whole movie is more of a drama, about a guy who holds his boss hostage. And the end of the movie is just plain STUPID! It was a straight to video movie, i now know why. I have went to the theatre and seen AMERICAN BEAUTY, and that is now my all time favorite movie, it's Kevin Spacey back at his best! also, other GOOD Kevin movies are, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, SEVEN, THE NEGOTIATOR, and THE REF is even better than this movie! So save your money for when AMERICAN BEAUTY comes to tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I must have watched this movie like six times already; Kevin Spacey is just brilliant in this! He's the sort of person in this film that you really want to hate, but the fact that he is just so powerful just in his office, you have to love him! Any Kevin Spacey fan should watch this movie; you will get a kick out of every minute of this! As for the thriller part, there are some parts where I'm not surprised why the actor who portrays Guy is the same actor who portrayed Mason in Vacancy. He comes off as an innocent man, but there is a dark vengeful animal beneath that nervous exterior.I watched this because I saw that Kevin is quite a sadistic man, and all of his characters are brilliant, and this was more than what I bargained for!Excellent, just excellent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This movie is hilarious. This movie which involves an egotisitcal bigwig of Keystone Pictures - Buddy Ackerman(Spacey) and his new assistant - Guy(Frank Whaley). Buddy treats guy basically like a piece of meat..go get this go get that. He back stabs him and doesn't give him the credit he deserves. But, sure enough, Guy turns the tables on Buddy is a weird series of tortures and insults. The movie has a twist at the end that will surprise you.Kevin Spacey is incredible with the part of Buddy Ackerman. He deserves better than what the critics have said about this movie. It is a must see for anyone who like black comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nah, grating and irritating without payoff","review":"Nothing much going on here in any sort of clever, witty, or probing way. I'm going to disagree with most here and say that the implausible storyline is exacerbated by Spacey, overacting and chewing scenery without restraint, nuance, or anything that allows other characters to work with successfully. He's immeasurably better as the heartless boss in Glengarry Glen Ross, a role played expertly (and of course helped by brilliant writing and story, two elements absent from Swimming With Sharks). You can feel that he \\"thinks\\" he's really doing it up right, but it's wanker stuff all the way down the line. Yawn. Many excellent office/workplace/boss films out there to see before bothering with this mediocre effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swimming With Sharks - Kevin Spacey","review":"This film is beautifully acted by Kevin Spacey, but far too dark and gloomy for comfortable viewing.It may indeed depict what the writer thought of the film world, but why inflict this depiction on the world I ask.The story is cynical, cruel and I found the last half of the film very uncomfortable to watch. Not a favourite."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as American Beauty","review":"American Beauty is by far one of my favorite films to watch, and the main reason is because it is so fun watching Spacey play with his characters. That is what Swimming with Sharks was like. I saw it a few weeks after A.B. came out, thinking that it wouldn't be much since it was before Spacey was really famous and it was a low budget movie. I was wrong. This movie equals to American Beauty in the sense that Kevin Spacey creates a character that you will never forget. Even if you hate this movie, you will have fun just watching Spacey get into his character, such as the jackass in this movie, Buddy Ackerman. This movie keeps you watching it the whole time and the dialogue is very funny and memorable!

The plot becomes predictable and the repetitive way in which the story unfolds in tiresome. Acting is great, the way the film was put together is a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Would You Rather Work For Buddy Ackerman Or Ari Gold?","review":"Why is Guy working for Buddy? Probably because Ari was not around in 1995. Why does Dawn want to be with Guy? For access to Buddy. Why does she stay with Guy? I am not sure.There are bunch of things about this movie that I am not sure about. But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman - and totally believable because he is a great actor.Frank Whaley's Guy is certainly out of his element working for Buddy - he wants to write and make meaningful movies, not be a gofer that is verbally abused for getting Equal instead of Sweet & Low.Michelle Forbes' Dawn, who also wants to make meaningful movies, seems way out of Guy's league.The ending leaves a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Film...Clearly one of Spacey's best performances","review":"What I found curious though, was how they packaged this film on the cover. Hilarious?! This is not a comedy, trust me. It's a very dark, twisted drama if anything. Kevin Spacey plays a demanding studio boss who acquires a new intern, played sheepishly by actor Frank Whaley. Look for a cameo by BenicioDel Toro, long before his Traffic film. What makes this film worth owning is the outstanding dialogue, highly quotable cutdowns, and belittlement that Spacey inflicts on his poor intern.The intern feels that these are the things he must go through to be a big time sudio boss himself one day. However, when a woman comes between boss and intern, the intern snaps and kidnaps his boss. The intern then tortures him, and makes him realize all the humiliation he inflicted. This film also has a great plot twist you'll never see coming. For me, this film just solidified in my mind what an outstanding actor Kevin Spacey really is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unpleasant","review":"Watching this film, I could only wonder what sane person would work for Buddy (Spacey). I could not imagine anyone working with him for more than one day unless their life depended on it. I hate to think that real life is this way in the film industry. Granted the movie is competently made. I would not see it again. It made me a little sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"Hated it. I will say the acting is good, but this movie was so painful to watch I fast forwaded through some of the scenes. I think from the reviews it is supposed to be a dark comedy; however, I did not laugh once. None of the characters were likeable the way they are written, so in the end you will be left with a vague depressed feeling, ie, \\"that sucked.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Spacey knockout","review":"Whenever my husband is having a bad day at work, all he needs to hear is two words...BUDDY ACKERMAN! I am a diehard Spacey fan, but this movie put him over the top for my husband. He seldom mentions more than a couple of times if he enjoys a movie, but he couldn't stop talking about this one.

It seems that these so-called scholars are perfectly in line with American Policy to delay the establishment of an islamic state. The discourse is academic and lacks the ability to motivate muslims to re-establish Islam. These orientalists, such as Jackson and Fadl don't give the muslims any incentive to work to re-establish the state. In fact the book is very discouraging. I would expect such an attack against the political infrastructure of islam to come from non-muslims. Who knows, these guys may be CIA...May Allah (SBT) protect us from these uncle toms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is an invaluable study on Islamic law","review":"Rarely has a book been published which not only entices the reader with a fascinating subject matter, but challenges one's mind so thoroughly and completely.

It is refreshingly original sounding, while at the same time evoking a feeling of familiarity - like they'd been there all the time in your sub-conscious mind, though you'd never even heard them. Its the music you always suspected someone could make if they just really were very good at it. \\"Sweeping The Nation\\" is probably the most well know track here, from once being single of the week in NME. Its quite good, though I like the singles \\"We're going Out\\" and \\"A Trip Into Space\\" even better. Almost every track here is excellent. The only ones I skip regularly are the few that use a certain profane word, because thats not my thing. But I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip, Hip, Hurray or Fury Beach","review":"Fury Beach by Ray Edinger combines thorough research with a rousing good story. The lengthy bibliography and index suggest the extensive research that went into producing this book. Well written, it is actually two stories for the price of one: a tale of an Arctic voyage of discovery and scientific research and the heart-warming story of the interaction of two cultures, an Inuit tribe and Englishmen, meeting for the first time and things actually go right. People treat each other with kindness and respect. Friendships result.

Not the worst idea in the world, but this movie is just not executed all that well. The action isn't all that exciting, the girls aren't all that likable, and the villain isn't all that charismatic. You can see why this didn't catch on and become a success. I got this because I was curious about the show, whose premise I liked, but... no.

The book is great for persons without any knowledge of commercial real estate and is a good reference book for persons with experience in commercial real estate.It is worth noting, however, that the much of the author's experience with investment real estate seemed to be during the 1970's decade. During that period of time there was hyper inflation in the real estate market. Often values and prices paid for real estate did not make much sense.Some of the examples in the book refer to properties indicated to be worth several million dollars - and not exactly what you would call a small investment property.However, the financial scenarios in this book are based on reasonably sound financial and economic theory.

Using the logic in this book, Masters gets up to a 43% long-term annual return on real estate investments. In CH5 where Masters describes the source of real estate profits, the author includes paydown of a mortgage loans principal as one of the sources. In fact principle payments increase the amount invested in the property and reduces the return rather than increases it. This is just where the errors begin.Masters targets this book at neophyte small investers. My advice is that neophytes who don't have a sound understanding of finance should stay far away from this book.

I especially love the Yolanda Adams duet \\"The Prayer.\\" The reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the fact that most of the songs are slow and it is a studio album.

With all of today's technology, it's hard to believe they couldn't manufacture something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless!!","review":"My wife bought these for our two sons (4 and 3 years old) also a set for my nephews (8 and 5 years old). We thought we better test them before we gave them as gifts. They are worthless. At 15 feet I could barely hear my wife. The static is so loud when you are not pushing the talk button that you can't even stand to have them on for more than a minute or two. Don't waste you time with these. We are taking back both pairs in the next day of two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....","review":"I was also very disappointed with these Walkie-talkies. I bought one pair and only the 'call' button would work. Exchanged them and even the second pair wouldn't work- you could only barely hear each others voices only feet away from each other and certainly not recognize the words spoken, the static was the only thing that was loud. Even for the low price, they are a waste of money. I cannot understand either why National Geographic would put their name behind these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy These","review":"I wish I could give these walkie talkies 0 stars. The feedback is obnoxious. You can not hear the person on the other end anyway. Just buy something else - anything else!I had to take them away only minutes after putting the batteries in (tears & screaming followed). Not a good way to start Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work","review":"I bought these today, tried them out, and they're going back tomorrow.Couldn't get rid of the loud hum when pressing the talk button.

Glad I tried them out before giving them to my grandson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The title song \\"The Men In My Little Girls Life\\" is a nice little collectable tune that was a hit in the mid-sixties, but the Collectable label has not done it recording justice. This whole album was recorded at a much less than dynamic level and the title track has 2 very audible pops in it; not unlike a used LP. I collect old music on CD, but have always been wary of the Collectable brand. Whether or not you will get a good copy from them has always be a toss of the dice. Buy the other album by Mike Douglas here."},{"rating":"2","title":"mike douglas","review":"great sounding cd & source of mike douglas music it's tough to top the song \\"the men in my little girl's life\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songs and Voice","review":"I purchased this CD for the song, \\"The Men in My Little Girl's Life,\\" but I found I enjoyed every one of the songs.

It claims 'Billy Elliot' was nominated for a single award, when it actually received three nominations, and says the last time a sweep occured before 'LOTR: Return of the King' was 'Gigi' in 1958, when in fact it was 1987's 'The Last Emperor'.If it can get details like this wrong, it's easy to believe that other, less checkable, stories might be false as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun at the Oscars","review":"Not sure about the \\"Dirty Dealings\\"...but this is a great behind-the-scenes look at the annual event.

And it does not have 7 different remixes. One is an a cappella version (of the remix). Three are dubs/instrumentals. The last track is another song (which I did not enjoy). Do the math [8 - 1 - 3 - 1 = 3] and what remains is 3 versions that are not accommodating to a trip down early-1990s-music memory lane, and are not that different from one another. So again, unless the remixes are what U want - DON'T BUY THIS CD. If I already had the original version, this Maxi-single would not have been such a waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more powder spills!","review":"Finish Powerball Tablets are easy to use, pre-measured capsule/cubes that fit into your detergent dispenser.

That made choosing this version of Finish a piece of cake. The orange scent and cleaning power makes Finish even better than ever. This is a simple choice. If you want your dishes to be cleaner than ever before, and you want that citrus splash, add this product to your list! You will not be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works to Some Degree","review":"I have been using these and the Quantum tablets made by the same company, and to be honest I don't notice much of a difference. These tablets here have a higher chance of an incomplete dissolving occurrence than the Quantums, but they also cost less. They always get my dishes much cleaner than traditional dish detergent. By not allowing food to cement on dishes and arranging them so the dishwasher spray can reach the surfaces, I have not had many issues of having to rewash a dish. The scent isn't overpowering, and I am glad because who would want scented dishes? They do have trouble dealing with my extremely hard water, 18gpg, but I would expect it to handle that much hardness in the water. Differentially worth trying this product to compare to your current brand, and I bet you will like these ones more. Quantum is slightly better, but also slightly more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tablets are easy to use.","review":"Ive been gettting these through Subscribe and Save for a while. Does a great job cleaning the dishes. Couple it with Finish drying agent and you are in great shape.

Would definitely order again at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Detergent Around","review":"I used to be loyal to the Costco Kirkland liquid dishwasher detergent, but for some reason just stopped working. I tried other brands, same result: had to basically wash the dishes by hand before putting them in the dishwasher, otherwise they never got clean. I thought there was something wrong with the dishwasher until someone recommended I try \\"Finish\\". Wow, amazing difference -- dishes are clean again without needing a pre-dishwasher handwash!My only nitpicky gripe is that I wish each \\"powerball\\" weren't individually wrapped, but I guess that's to keep the moisture out or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier but not as clean","review":"This product really makes doing the dishes easy. Just open the wrapper and pop the tablet in the dishwasher. It's so much less messy than using liquid dishwasher detergent. However, sometimes it seems like these leave a bit of a residue and don't get dishes as clean as liquid Cascade Complete did. I will still continue to use this product because I like the ease of use, but I think the Cascade does do a somewhat better job getting dishes clean. This is still a great and easy product, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works better than the gel I was using","review":"Finish Powerball Tablets work very well. I have noticed a definite improvement in the cleanliness of my dishes. I was used to rinsing and removing most of the soil on my dishes before I put them into the dishwasher, and now I have to do that a lot less. It says it will remove even stuck-on foods, but on things like potatoes or oatmeal, the results weren't as good. I had to rewash a bowl that had held mashed potatoes, and a pan that had cooked oatmeal. Other than that, it seems to remove food from dishes quite well, at least compared to the gel I was using. The tablets are individually wrapped and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised","review":"This item was advertised as \\"90 times faster\\". Of course it didn't say faster than what, but it is not faster than any other flash drive made and sold by Verbatim and it is priced MUCH higher than the red Store N Go series. The packaging is a cheap brittle blue plastic rather than the rugged metal construction used on the red Store N Go series. It does have one redeeming feature if you are a techie doing troubleshooting. When the unit is plugged into a USB 1 connection the LED flashes red and when it is plugged into a USB 2 connection the LED flashes blue thereby providing a transfer rate measuring tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"I have a confession. I'm fascinated by the sociological study called Millionaire Matchmaker. Millionaires shouldn't need help finding a spouse, right? At least that's what I thought at first. But this show makes you realize that the rich are often too spoiled and self-entitled to maintain a health relationship. And that's where Patti really comes in. Sure, she introduces the millionaires to several members of the opposite sex who meet their requested list of requirements (which is often long and shallow at the same time), but the real work usually comes in Patti challenging the millionaires to be more open and tolerant and giving. And, I'm not going to lie, it's also nice to see Patti give the occasional millionaire the tongue-lashing that they so desperately deserve!I love the sneak peak into the \\"real\\" lives of the rich . . . because in some ways, they are much more poor than the rest of us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrow Straps T72","review":"Compared to powerfast straps, I like the width and the durability of the plastic covering; however, the straps do not drive in all the way, when you try to sink them with a hammer, they just mash up.

A lot of sax behind her and honky tonk piano orchestrated during the 30s. Billie is not Sarah Vaughan or Ella Fitzgerald. But she has a flair for \\"swing\\" music. There are some classic love songs on this album sure to bring about nostalgia. \\"Body and Soul\\", \\"Night and Day\\" are examples. If you want 30s \\"swing\\", this is the perfect album.

It stresses pronounciation of words and making your tones match the speakers on the disc, but tells you nothing about the four tones of Chinese (found that out the hard way). It also does not go much into sentence construction, only forming a pre-meditated sentence.I give it 4 stars because as a beginner with no prior experience in Mandarin, it let me get a grasp of what I would be studying in more in-depth lessons. So if you know absolutely --nothing-- about Mandarin then I recommend Pimsleur.P.S. Don't get the four disc version. The eight disc-er has the first four and nothing's different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Met my expectations","review":"I did a lot of research on the Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone products prior to making this purchase. The Pimsleur program is a very good value, and it is just what I was looking for. It's perfect to take with on a long trip as most of the half hour lessons will require you to go through more than once. I wish there was at least some printed material with it, but I am learning without it. In buying the first 16 lessons in Conversational Mandarin Chinese, Simon and Schuster offers a credit on the next package that has 32 lessons (the first 16 plus 16 more).This is exactly the product I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"unclear description","review":"I thought it has a book, but instead it's just a couple of CDs, not that the quality is bad.

It is difficult to sleep with it next to me at night, since I have to turn it up so loud just to be able to hear her, but then have to listen to all that background noise (even though it is not coming from her room). It happens regardless of what channel it is set on. Also, switch to select change channels (there are only 2) is very touchy, and easily changed. I found this out when somehow it got changed and I couldn't hear my baby all night. It was awful. I'm ready to chuck this thing as soon as I get a new model.

It has constant static when I walk around with it on battery power and even blacks out sometimes where it stops working. The static is the biggest down fall.

It appears to be an issue with how the contact for the batteries is made, so if you only used them on AC power this would not apply to you. They work just fine when they work, but when this little piece of metal in the battery compartment isn't making contact the unit won't work at all. Just a poor design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for what I need","review":"I live in a small apartment so I didn't require a really good long distance monitor. I like the fact that this works from the mains and I am not using up loads of batteries. I have had no issues with switching on the parts etc. There is a little amount of static that comes over on the monitors but I have still been able to hear my baby over the monitor. I have found it great at picking up the stirring noises my child makes so I am able to get to my Little One before the real crying begins. I have relied on it at night with my little one sleeping in another room and I have not been let down. I only gave four stars due to the white noise that can be heard over the speaker and also I would want a better one if I was in a bigger house, but for my apartment it is great!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well - NOT portable","review":"PROs:- good price for a two receiver monitor- good reception with little static in a 3300 sq. ft. houseCONs:- child unit doesn't use batteries so this is NOT portableA decent monitor with little static interferrence but we are out and about often and need the portability of battery operation for both child and parent units. The child unti only uses the AC adapter. Because of this, we are returning this and looking for a fully portable set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static","review":"I have had this monitor for 7 months + now, and I loved it at first. It is super sensitive and the range is good for my house. BUT the static is now so bad that I can't hear him as well as I used to. I am now looking for another monitor and I am not happy about it. I recommend buying a different one from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Monitor --- Even after a drop in the pool","review":"This monitor was rated well by consumer reports, I liked that it came with two recievers, so I asked for it last year. The reception is great!!!! I can go outside and any place in the house and it always works. I can hear her stir no problem. I have had the monitor(s) for over a year and they still work great. I even accidently dropped one in the pool---ooops down it went to the bottom, but after I poured the water out of the battery compartment and let it dry it worked fine. That reciever is prone to more static than the one that never went for a swim, but at least it still works. I would and have recommended this monitor to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static is too loud","review":"This monitor's static interference is so loud that it drives you crazy. And, you can't hear the actual sounds you bought it for over the static so its useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"We tried this monitor for the first time during nap time in his crib as he currently still sleeps in a bassinet in our room. The monitor did NOT pick up any noise, not even his stuffed toy that sings. The static just being in the next room was so loud we had to turn down the volume, but then didn't hear him when he was crying. My husband went in the room, talked and messed with the monitor and it didn't pick up anything. This will be returned. (yes we tried batteries, plugging it in, checking channels and different positions)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I ordered this because of the positive reviews. I shouldn't have bothered. I opened the box and immediately the receivers did not work with batteries - fresh batteries from two separate packages. I figured it wouldn't be that big of a deal to just plug the receivers in. I did finally get them working plugged in BUT there was a horrendous humming sound that was just too loud to even be tolerable. I couldn't even hear another adult speaking into the transmitter because of the humming!So, I recommend passing on this one and ordering a different brand. I'm returning this one tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - static, static & more static","review":"I would return this product - but my partner threw out the packaging - so we are stuck with it. I thought our old monitor (a Graco) was bad, but this has 3x as much static. I've tried both channels - and both are bad. I can't return mine, but maybe I can save someone else the trouble - get something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, economical monitor","review":"We have been using this monitor for about 4 months now and have found it to be reliable. If you can, it is preferable to plug it in because it drains batteries pretty quickly. I agree with other reviews that it is sensitive. We can hear our son moving a lot, but that doesn't bother me. I would rather hear more than not enough.We also get some static but it seems like we get it when there is nothing between the base and the receiver. For examle, if our son's door is closed, there is no issue. If we go in to check on him, we usually turn the receiver off or down because there is interference.It is an inexpensive monitor and none of the cons are a big deal for me. For the price and features, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud static","review":"I received this monitor at my baby shower. The monitor worked well for a few months, then suddenly the static appeared just for no reason. We tried to play with it, plugged into different outlet, switched channels, ect. with no luck. Because of the loud continuous buzzing this thing is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Babysit","review":"Good value for money, the audio is very good, you can escultar loud and clear the noises of her son, even over long distances. However it has some INTERFERENCE depending on the distance from the base. Injured recommend the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure static","review":"This monitor is awful. All I hear is static. The threshold for hearing baby is quite high (meaning he has to make a lot of noise before I hear him). With my old monitor, I could hear every sound without static, but it was unreliable, while this one is quite reliable so far. It doesn't switch channels or beep incessantly like my old monitor. But for it's primary purpose, to pick up and transmit sound, it fails miserably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for all ages!","review":"If you like sorrow, action, and adventure, you will love the book The Lantern Bearers. It is one of many great historical fiction books by Rosemary Sutcliff. This is a wonderful book about Aquila, a man in the Middle Ages, who fights alongside Ambrosis, the prince of Britain.There were many different settings in The Lantern Bearers. They were all in Britain during the Anglo-Saxon period like Ullasfjord with its harsh winters, and Arfon with its beautiful mountains. Some of these settings put me \\"in the book\\". For example, when Aquila was in Ullasfjord, I could almost feel the blizzards!I liked some parts of this book more than others. In some parts of the book it is a little too slow. I liked the book because most parts are exciting, like when Aquila gets married. Also it is descriptive: the author describes the characters well, like the detail of the dolphin on Aquila's shoulder. You may or may not like this book, but you will still want to read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have never forgotten this book.","review":"With this book I began my search and exploration of the Roman world. I heartily recommend it for any brave teen wishing to join himself to that faraway world. It has been over forty years since I have read this book, however, it seems just like yesterday. I thank Ms. Sutcoliffe for this pleasure for it has propelled me on a wondrous avocation. Ave, Avila."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Adult Reading!!!","review":"I am an avid adult reader of Arthurian legends. I read this book after hearing it is a prequel to The Sword at Sunset, also by Rosemary Sutcliff, and I loved it. I am captivated by the romance and chivalry of this passionate era in our history - and also by the great battle scenes as described by the better authors of this legend (Bernard Cornwell in particular). This book kept my adult interest and made me more anxious than ever to get to The Sword of Sunset...a continuation of the story line in The Lantern Bearers where a young Artos is introduced to us - and by the end of the book can be recognized as the great King Arthur to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely powerful","review":"A powerful presentation.This extremely graphic presentation is one of the most effective and affecting presentation on the dangers of drug use and abuse that I have ever seen.Its intensly graphic nature serves to highlight the commen age fallacy that drug use can be a fleeting and harmless flirtation.This guide illustrates the underlying compund cyclic nature of drug use that can quickly thrust the user into a network of unforseen problems.Most of us are familiar with burn outs but one would be surprised at how many drug users and pushers started out as mere burnouts until they become trapped beyond what they could bear, usually taking their own lives.Its a shocking wake up call to the misleading information society that suggests drug use is a personal choice that does not interfere with the safety of society.One would be amazed at how erroneous that type of subjective argument is, especially after coming away from this highly detailed presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up people!","review":"Should be an eye opener to anyone who has a heart and half a brain.While the film does not concentrate enough on the government cover-up it shows enough that should alarm any 'true' GOD fearing (and patriotic American citizen) that the government is out of control and cannot be trusted. Escapegoats and patsies are a real part of US history. It sickens me everytime I see a Bush/Cheney sticker as they should be replaced with impeachment stickers for the LYING-self proclaimed believer-in-GOD man. Which GOD I am not sure......as 'my' God and savior through Jesus Christ would NEVER believe in torture!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgrace","review":"I am not sure what is more disgraceful: the soldier's behavior at Abu Ghraib or Rory Kennedy's attempts to rationalize and frame their actions. They knew the law as all soldiers do. The Law of Land Warfare and basic Geneva are taught to every soldier in Basic Training. MPs receive even more training in the subject. I am tired of hearing excuses for their abuses and I am not exactly sure what Kennedy wants to achieve by putting the soldiers on camera. In doing so, they look like the victims of \\"policy\\" rather than the prisoners (who largely remain nameless and faceless).A far better film is the recently released \\"The Prisoner or: How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair\\" which tells the story of man wrongly sent to Abu Ghraib and that of his guards (who knew right from wrong).Kennedy would be well served to go to Iraq to see the day to day stresses that soldiers face and how the majority correctly and morally deal with those stresses.The Prisoner or: How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair"},{"rating":"2","title":"The American Mind in the Mid-Nineteenth Century","review":"Irving H. Bartlett's contribution to the American History Series is a sound and brief look at the ideas that dominated the period of time in American history that is overlook by most history classes, the 50 years from the War of 1812 to the American Civil War. From religion to reformers to showmen, Bartlett turns a critical eye to them all. A large section of the book deals with the minds of the Jacksonians and the mind of the South. Emerson, Thoreau, the Grimke sisters, Webster, Calhoun, Howthorne and others have their influence over the way Americans think analyzed. My personal favorite is the chapter on P.T. Barnum and the begining of entertainment in the United States.This is a great book for a college class or any lover of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Adorable Winnie the Pooh Cake\\"","review":"This cake is really adorable and easy to make, the clamp/clips that come with it need to be placed carefully so that the pan is sealed together tight. As with all 3-D pans, this is a necessary step, I have even used extra clamp-clips from other pans to make sure that my 3-D cakes are extra tight during baking time. The \\"Winnie the Pooh Stand Up Cake\\" will draw a lot of attention; it's truly unique and fun to decorate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid, but the talking goes on for a bit too much","review":"I buy these DVDs for senior citizens (~75 years old) who are looking to exercise. One of my seniors has back pain, so this was a very intriguing DVD. Overall, Dr. Lam does a good job. But there is way too much talking interspersed throughout and this actually annoys the one senior citizen I got this DVD for. So at least from her, she did not like it. I personally liked his gentle techniques. Overall, I'd hope that someone else produces another DVD for people with back pain (so many of us are out there) that is a bit more movement centered rather than talking centered."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I use these cards three times a week in my classroom. it is so easy to make a yoga program just by picking out the cards.

Then all we have to do is follow the steps and the short story on each cards. the picutres are simple too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I bought these for my niece and nephew.

I am extremely disappointed in this deck. The title clearly states that there are games in the deck. 3 of us--2 adults and 1 child--have searched the deck for any type of games. Not a single one can be found!!! If you're looking for very basic poses on decent quality card stock, this is fine. However, if it's games involving yoga that you'd like, then save your money and don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard audio makes unknown quantity a worthless streaming product..","review":"The audio is too low on the stream to hear the film. Amazon Prime reinforces what Netflix has proven thus far; that subscription-based streaming at this point in time simply isn't a worthwhile service."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN","review":"This movie is really boring and seems like it was made by someone who has lost their way. While the film Trust is a great, great movie, stuff like Fay Grim that has followed is junk in comparison. A lot of Hartley films since Trust have been mediocre at best, mostly junk. There's a ton of Hal Hartley books and fluff about how great he is supposed to be, with striking \\"I'm an artist\\" poses on the cover, but this is just self indulgent dross. It seems like Hartley got too full of himself with the underground success of Trust, and has been assuming that anything he does is some great masterpiece, all the while failing to see that it sucks. With a fan base that won't tell the truth, how would he know? I'm just saying what any true honest fan should say, and I'll probably get shot down by others on this review. This will only prove my point however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really awful","review":"After reading good reviews for this movie, I was expecting a good, offbeat movie with Jeff Goldblum and Parker Posie. I was really disappointed. The acting is horrible and the movie is hilarious in a cheesy bad way. The characters are unbelieveable (Jeff Goldblum trying to be a straight G-man) and one fails to feel any attachment to any of them. The action sequences are laughably bad and the score is distractingly low budget - I'm not sure if they were supposed to be funny (?). The ending is abrupt and disappointing. One of the worst produced movies I've seen in awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapponting, not in the same league as\\"Indecent Exposure\\"","review":"I was thrilled to find a new Tom Sharpe when looking through the shelves at the airport. Just what I needed for a week on the beach in Fiji. Sadly though it stuttered and fired here and there but never really lived up to his earlier classics. Characters of interest were developed and then disappeared leaving many questions unanswered. It was a shame that I finished this book so quickly then left Captain Carelli's Mandolin on the plane unfinished. I will just have to buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"grasping at straws","review":"As an ex brit who was raised in a british boarding school in the 50's and who is painfully familiar with the foibles, follies and general demented attitudes of the british upper classes,i found this novel to be extraordinarily dull. There are traces of Sharpe in it,but i feel Sharpe has succumbed to what i gratutiously call the \\"Hollywood\\" syndrome. Find something which appeals to the masses, then flog it to death. This book is really nothing more than nastiness without a real purpose to it; money and sales seem to be the motive behind it. The constant emphasis on lesbianism and sexual escapism (and i am not a prude) are simply crude and unamusing. Shame on you Mr Sharpe for descending from brilliance into mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I've long been a Tom Sharpe fan, but \\"The Midden\\" just doesn't live up to his previous books. Three specific criticisms:(1) it's just not very funny. Sure, there are occasional amusing passages, but nothing that gives rise to the uncontrollable laughter we've come to expect from Sharpe.(2) a lot of the writing is gratitously nasty. Sharpe's writing has always been 'edgy', and that's okay ... but here he includes long irrelevant passages, filled with unnecessarily coarse language. The personal attacks on Margaret Thatcher and John Major strike an unpleasant note, too.(3) much of the book reads like a badly done pastiche of \\"Blott on the Landscape\\" and \\"Riotous Assembly\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing novel","review":"\\"Old Ties\\" is truly one of the worst novels I have read in recent memory. The plot was transparent from the beginning, and the book was nothing but predictable. Saxon Bennett's prose reminds one of a poor writer who has been published by a vanity press. If this is indicative of the author's talents, I would hesitate to read another of her works."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very poorly written novel","review":"I have read many novels in this genre and was very disappointed not only in the writing but that the Naiad Press would place it's name on it.

I am a student and I have to do a paragraph about bull riding and rodeos. I actually feel that this book will be a great resource to use.Also the book itself sounds amazing and full of interesting facts about bulls and their position as they do their dance in the ring.

The individual biographies and the overall picture of Chinese history that emerges are very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial Boredom","review":"Casey Donovan is a talented performer and has an excellent singing voice, that said, this album is trash. The songs are faultless, but bland and forgettable as well. The album reeks of a mainstream playing-it-safe sound which is exacerbated by the rushed recording. These things are no fault of Casey's, they just highlight how the Idol method of fast production and no-depth leave shallow, indifferent footprints on the music landscape. Maybe Casey is a talented songwriter, in both music and lyrics.

I can do without sleep when a book is this good!The plot, characters......Heck the entire book was just perfect. I wouldn't change a word. Casey Jones kicks some major butt in this one. :) I was so pleased to get a glimpse into Casey's past life, and I really liked the way she handled it. These books are darned good mysteries, but they are just flat-out great fiction. If you are in the mood for humor in a PERFECT book, buy this book now.

It remains a fascinating take on what it would be like to be captured by cannibals. Immediately, I thought of the parallels between this film and the true story of Herman Melville's capture by the vicious cannibal Typees (Chronicled in his awesome first novel \\"Typee\\".) But the sense of tension and fear are constant and effective. At every moment you find yourself aware that this Frenchman is going to be eaten. Later in the movie, we even learn that the woman who became his \\"wife\\" did so partly because that would ensure her a choice bit of the Frenchman's meat. This is just a fascinating movie that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little movie","review":"I found this movie very entertaining, although I don't know how historically accurate it may have been.The only thing I didn't like about it was the fact that only the men were completely naked not the women and to my taste it should have been the other way around.R"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say - probably \\"the\\" Journey Album to have","review":"Actually I'm sure there are people that would recommend one of the best of collections but to me this was always \\"the sound\\" of Journey with the high voice of Steve and Neil's crunchy guitar and Greg's keyboards, not to mention the rhythm section keeping the whole thing anchored.There are some great songs (lights, Wheel in the Sky, Feeling That way/Any Time) and whenever I listen to this album I'm always transported by to a better time (or forward to my current relationships :D )Anyway - you might be like a \\"best of\\" album better than this but Infinity is probably the best journey album from composition, songs, performance, etc. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This came in perfect condition and fast!

Perry's voice is a sweet sounding clear tenor on this album without the raspy voice in subsequent albums. The 2006 edition is in the collectible digipak cardboard case with a commemorative booklet listing tour dates and old pictures. The album is a classic and the song Lights is one of Journey's best songs. Patiently is a beautiful heartfelt song.

I suspect it's because this INFINITY and EVOLUTION have no bonus material added to them, so they got lazy and just repackaged them. All of the other Journey cd's that have the bonus material sound better than the 1996 versions, and along with the remastered Steve Perry solo cd's they are worth buying. If you have the 1996 versions of the above two cd's INFINITY and EVOLUTION don't repurchase these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Perry albums","review":"This album is a very good example of the genre - polished stadium rock - that was to burn itself out a few years later. I like this more than the later mega-sellers because it was before the style became near self-parody. Is it just me or could this do with a remix? Some of the vocals leap out at you - try Wheel In the Sky at the beginning. Interesting that Aynsley Dunbar jumped ship after this album - good timing. Perry wasn't exactly prog rock. Incidentally, I like plenty of Journey's supposed musical opposites too, I'm a fan of practically any style when it's done well, and this one pretty much nails it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reissue, not rematered","review":"Buyer beware.

If they didn't, then they probably picked up their \\"Santana\\" albums and went home. The vocal talent of Steve Perry really made the Journey songs pop - before they didn't even sizzle for me. I didn't even replace my old old Journey albums on my current quest to replace all the albums of days past. \\"Feeling That Way\\" sort of shows the fusion of old old Journey and old Journey.

Steve Perry's voice sounds crisp and pure. Neal Schon's guitar playing is revolutionary for it's time, and Gregg Rolie is/was one of the best keyboardists from that era. You can still hear songs such as: Lights, Wheel In The Sky, and Patiently on the radio today. The only reason I gave this CD 4 stars and not 5 is that it is a little heavy on the ballads.

I have had lot of problems playing this album and other similars, in older CD players (Home/portable/car).This \\"Infinity\\" is a real milestone of American Rock music...

Journey puts it all together and comes out with Infinity one of their best albums to date. Every song on here is great. But my favoites have to be \\"Lights\\", \\"Can Do\\", \\"Faithfully\\", \\"LA DO DA\\", \\"Wheel In The Sky\\", and \\"Patiently\\". All of the other songs on this album are great too. I mean \\"Lights\\" is my favorite Journey song and that one song alone is without a doubt what makes this whole album worth buying. This is a great collection of music by one of the greatest bands of all-time. I highly recommend it to anyone.

Taking various pairs of confusable words she ostensively offers the reader a better understanding of their true differences. Unfortunately, not only does she fall short of this goal but far too often gets her facts wrong. For example: There are now five, not \\"three great kingdoms into which all natural objects have been classified.\\" (P.209). A supernova is not a \\"nova that that suddenly explodes into dazzling brilliance.\\" (p. 218). The alpaca is not a \\"domesticated llama.\\" (p. 198). Scorpions are not \\"insects\\" (p.206). And, tidal waves are not \\"any destructive sea wave caused by strong winds.\\" (p. 227). These are inexcusable errors of fact.

It is however an excellent album. It has somewhat of a dark almost depressing sound to it. If your thinking about buying it based on hearing \\"Tha Crossroads\\" be warned that much of the album sounds very different than that song and you might be better off buying Bones greatest hits album which has a more mainstream sound to it.

I'm beginning to look into purchasing the other albums by this group."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's tight, a true masterpeice.","review":"Anybody who says they aren't musicians are dead wrong. If you listen to the lyrics they are actually not that ruthless. They are certainly thugsters, but they are also very religious. Probably more so than most people. Krayzie is a witness for example.

One reason All previous albums by the group failed (Art Of War, BTNH Ressurection, TWO) is because they couldn't recapture teh blue collar feel of this album and the EP. Even the artwork on the albums showed you that stardom had changed the group. On cover to Creepin on Ah Come Up, Bizzy is actually wearing a carhartt hat, and on both, they show a workmanlike, streetedge manner, where on the other albums, they simply come across as johnny-come-lately rappers. Alos, on all previous albums they recycle a lot of content, whereas here it sounds fresh. Granted, they don't cover a lot of ground (weed, guns, homies) but in 1995 it was a new style of rapping, however, the constant repetition of these themes on all following albums, (as well as many of the Bone solo albums) flattened this group."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is sick!","review":"This album has got to be the best rap album I own.

Bone-Thugs-N-Harmony I think is nothing special. They are a group who for some reason has been shone on with too much attention and praise. The lyrics are nothing special they are predictable like Eminem and horrible like Steven Segeals acting. The beatz are pretty good, but i'd rather listen to another boring J.LO Collabration then this supposed classic album. In short this album leaves alot to be desired.

This is one of those special albums that just happened at a certain time and place and could probably never be duplicated or replicated again.

A whole Cd that you can roll with in your car. Every song on here is tight...mo murder, the getaway,East 1999 eternal,die die die,eternal....every song on here.Basically why I wrote this review was to say that after buying there lastest album \\"The Reserection\\" that sounded so much different than what I expected. It was weak and nothing new...people liked there new album but that is the whackest Cd I have heard and was quite...... when I actually heard it. 1999 Eternal is the #1 bone thugs album to buy.

This is somewhat of an anomaly in the solo Beatles catalogue, consisting as it does of song fragments, spliced together pastiches and a multitude of ideas that never really make up a whole package...and yet, that is the charm of it all. Schizo that it is, it is still musical. \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\" sums it up perfectly... Who knows what the hell it means but it sure is cool the way those different segments come in. Other cool tunes are \\"3 Legs\\" ( a kind of psychedelic blues pastiche), \\"Too Many People\\" (a big \\"F...YOU\\" to percieved political phonies) and \\"Dear Boy\\" (straight off the White Album).

Some of the songs have dumb lyrics, some have painfully awful musical moments, but it's all very slight and weak compared to the Beatles works from just a few years earlier. It's a dramatic dropoff in quality from Paul's songs on Abbey Road and Let It Be and the White Album, to this music. Compared to his songs on the Beatles albums, these songs sound like rejects. Some of the songs sound a lot like children's music.

It is raw in construction and recording quality but it is fresh in imagination. The album \\"McCartney\\" showed that he could go solo but this album really shows off his creativity and musical genious. The harmonies in \\"Dear Boy\\" are beautifully simple but engaging at the same time.

Like all Paul (or Beatles) albums, it's got such incredible diversity and depth. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Paul's Best Album, Ever","review":"This joyful album has it all. Admiral Halsey is almost like a children tune, Long Haired Lady is pure romance and Ram On is Paul in an acoustic setting produced yet like he's in outer space. It is worthwhile listening to the opener, Too Many People, and study the \\"FCK the Beatles\\" picture on the sleeve. Paul was not only having fun but was also being extremely funny.Unlike some of his other material, this album has aged remarkably well and sounds today fresh as ever. Recorded at his farm in Scotland, one can sense the organic nature of it. He went on making some really good music (also some really bad one too) but he never came close to captivating the originality, which is special since its structure is mostly simple, of what he did on Ram.This is definitely among his best work, if not his best album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Paul and Linda this is a must have","review":"Right after the Beatles, this light hearted but very melodious album contains some of the catchiest melodies among Paul's original songs and Linda is quite strong of her vocals, definitely one of her best efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps his best solo work","review":"Uncle Albert sounds great!! Paul had it all going on back on this 1971 release. His vocals are varied and smooth. There is no pappish sentimentality on Ram. It actually sounds better now than it did then. How is that possible?

I don't think he says the word \\"love\\" more than 5 times on the whole album,and they don't like it! So then he forms wings and writes a bunch of sugary songs about love, the critics love him and he's labeled by yuppies as a bubble gum songwriter.And the critics still don't get this album. Oh well, you can't please everyone. Now, I'm not saying that this album is a classic, it would have been better if he had anyone else produce this record and erased Linda's vocals. But songwise, with the exception of \\"Smile Away\\" and \\"Long haired Lady\\" this album comes closest to his \\"Beatle\\" sound than any other McCartney or Wings album ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music, what more is there to say?","review":"Forget all the semantic ravings, who cares if there's a message in the music, if you like it listen to it.

There are still plenty of silly love songs here, but musically the compositions are boldly eccentric. Unlike his previous \\"McCartney\\" the production is layered and sophisticated, but the tone is decidedly informal. It may not be as stunningly brilliant as his Beatles' work and it's certainly not as smoothly easy listening as a lot of his later stuff. But \\"Ram\\" does provide a unique snapshot of musical genius at its most raw and unfettered. It is definitely among of the three or four great post-Beatles solo albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Then, Great Now","review":"John Lennon excepted, this was a great album when I bought it way back when grieving the Beatles split. Paul was so much a part of the Beatles success, as this album demonstrates. However, one must wonder, how great would these songs have been with John's suggestions and the Beatles playing them. But with that said, this is a great album, playful, fun, and just plain great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"Paul McCartney is one of mine favorit. This is one of his first records.I can really recommend it.You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly underated","review":"Great remastering...2 bonus tracks...original cover art...great songs...but the booklet leaves a little to be desired. No lyrics or liner notes. Surely it could have been a bit more 'interesting', especially for an artist like McCartney. But, that aside, this is certainly an album that belongs in any fan's collection. If you are going to get \\"Ram\\", then this is the version that you should buy, on the basis of the remastering and bonus tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best solo Beatle album bar none!","review":"Not only McCartney's best album but probably the best solo album by any ex-Beatle. To echo a previous poster's comment, this is a far superior piece of work to the 'Band On The Run'.This album has never been off my playlist since I bought it on the day of release in 1971. It has withstood the test of time and the vagaries of musical fashions and changing tastes.As much musical variety as any Beatles album with a breadth of melodic invention and more top class musical hooks than most artists manage in their entire career. Heck, the track 'Back seat of My Car' on its own contains more superb hooks than most performers manage in a career!Forty-odd minutes of musical genius that completely blows apart the myth that McCartney \\"lost it\\" after the break up of The Beatles."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best....","review":"Next to the classic Band On The Run, I think this is McCartney's best album.Musically speaking, it contains various instruments as ukalele, congas, acoustic guitars, honky tonk piano, horns, etc. The writing (athough not superb), is really good. Most of the material on this would fit in the Beatles catalog nicely.Highlights include the single Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey, Too Many People, 3 Legs, Heart of The Country, In The Back Seat of My Car.It is all great though. Again, next to BOTR and London Town, this is my favorite Paul McCartney album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ram On","review":"Paul McCartney's second solo album after the breakup of the Beatles offers an energetic collection for any die-hard McCartney fan. This album is not Paul's best work, but it is still a classic with the inclusion of such timeless songs as \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\" and \\"Dear Boy.\\" The inclusion of \\"Another Day\\" as a bonus track makes the album even better. I highly recomend this album to any Beatle or Paul McCartney fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not yet appalling Paul","review":"Though \\"Ram\\" is fundamentally flawed and ultimately unsatisfying I suppose it to be Paul McCartney's best record. I'm sorry to report that this is saying very little. I can remember how appalled we were when we heard the record that immediately succeeded \\"Ram\\" (I can't think of its name just now--one's mind has a way of protecting itself). In any case, if you've got all the Beatles records in your collection, and you absolutely need more Paul McCartney, I recommend you buy this. Just don't set your hopes too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think of something else.","review":"Amid the obnoxious posturing and preening, the unadulterated stupidity (\\"Smile Away\\", \\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\"), and Linda McCartney's shrill, discordant, abrasive, and way, way out-of-tune \\"singing\\", there is much melodic fecundity here. That doesn't make it worth sifting through. There is no question that Paul McCartney has talent, but talent without taste and artistic vision is nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, this is not very good","review":"I love McCartney and consider him to be a true musical genius and one of the towering figures in 20th and 21th century music, but despite his genius this material is mediocre at best. I was really looking forward to listening to this re-release, having never previously listened to the entire album/CD, but the experience was an extremely disappointing one for me. There are a few \\"great\\" songs, but overall the songs are bland, boring and trite. I can appreciate Paul's love for his wife, but Linda McCartney is a disaster, and should have been excised from this remaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Remastering Job So Far","review":"When I bought the remasters for BOTR, McCartney, and McCartney II they all sounded pretty good when compared to the original, but nothing really blew me away. This, however, did. It's the best remastering job I ever heard on an album connected to Paul McCartney. The drums, cymbals, and the orchestrations never sounded so crisp and clear as they do now. And if there was one post Beatles album I didn't think could be improved upon with 21st century technology it was \\"Ram\\". I was wrong and I'm so glad I was because the listening experience was such a pleasent surprise.If you're a die hard fan this remaster is a must have. If you're a casual fan buy it anyway you won't regret it. Now I have to get the deluxe set to finally hear the mono version that people have been raving about for more years than I care to count."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for a day at home.","review":"I'm a big Beatles fan, and have also enjoyed their solo work. I first heard \\"Admiral Halsey\\" on a camping trip and the song brings back great memories. I was looking for great sound to go along with the great music. I almost got it. The sound on the CD is very good, but falls just a bit short of what I think it could have been, judging from other re-masterings. The surprise is the second CD, featuring unreleased songs, a single, and alternate versions. I really enjoyed it, especially \\"A Love for You\\". The purchase is worth it just for these extra songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul is my favorite Beatle","review":"This is my favorite album from Paul. I think it has a hint of the Beatles sound with progression and growth. Songs like Dear Boy and Uncle albert really show off Paul's versatility. I have to say, my favorite track is Heart of the Country. So soulful and catchy and has that good ol fashion folk sound that Paul is known for. Great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Deluxe Edition with Some Good Bonus Material","review":"The RAM Deluxed Book Edition (4CD+1DVD) is an absolute deluxe edition, but the DVD is not as good as the rest of the things included in the box. The recordings are incredibly good, even the \\"Thrillinton\\" CD -Paul's first attempt of recording with an orchestra I ha ve to say that the other CD's are awesome. I think this shows Paul at his best, but I'm still waiting for \\"Wings Over America\\" Deluxe Edition.I strongly recommend this Deluxe Edition, although I was a bit disappointed with the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure bliss in musical form","review":"I'm a huge Beatles fan, but not so much a solo-era McCartney guy. A lot of it just comes off as generic or mushy. This album, however, is just pure bliss. McCartney sounds like he's having an absolute blast on every track, and the whole album is just so incessantly happy and upbeat, it's impossible not to love it! I literally listed to this album on loop for several days at work once I got it. It's also probably the closest thing to a Beatles album there's been since the breakup. I can imagine almost every song on here appearing on a Beatles album. Great stuff, pure pop bliss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the way that RAM should be heard!","review":"Pure and Amazing MONO! different Experience! THE DEFINITIVE VERSION! Congratulation Mr.McCartney! i hope that the coming soon released of the Archives Collection will be so perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the 70's","review":"I remember this album from when I was in high school. It's just so great to hear it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is nostalgic.","review":"I've listened the LP of this album too many years ago when I was a young boy. Finding on a CD was a surprise for me to remind me the good old days. I remember \\"Uncle Albert / Admiral Halsey\\" and \\"Monkberry Moon Delight\\" very well in spite of passing years. I remember the memories of the songs on me. If you hadn't have any previous experiences or memories with this album, this may not be expressive for you. It is worth to buy for me to remember my youth."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"Of all of Sir Paul's music, beyond the beatle. I'd have to say this was one of his best. UNCLE ALBERT!! EXCELLENT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul's and Linda's Best Fun Recording","review":"This is one of the Top 10 Albums of my Time ... Born in the 50's with Rock and Roll ... Blessed and Cursed in the 60's with Everything ... To the Stars in the 70's ... To Hell in the 80's ... Reality in the 90's and , oh well , Nostalgia and let's get a little more in the Zeros ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCartney's Second","review":"Ram is officially credited to Paul & Linda McCartney, but to no one's surprise, Mr. McCartney dominates it. The album has a slicker, more studio sound than his first album, but the songs follow the same simple formula. The songs all sound like he could have written the entire album in a couple of hours. But Mr. McCartney sings them wholeheartedly and puts his trademark charm into them, that you can't help but enjoy them. \\"Too Many People\\" is a pleasant, acoustic number and \\"Three Legs\\" has a blues riff. \\"Eat At Home\\" has a Buddy Holly influence while \\"The Back Seat Of My Car\\" is a pure pop pleasure. \\"Smile Away\\" has an infectious chorus. \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\" is an eccentric number that sounds like a left over from Sgt. Peppers. It is the best song on the album and it became his first solo number one hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitars and solos","review":"There is nothing better than a Santana CD at lunch ime to make the day seem better, this one did not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh man... DON'T tell me you don't have this CD yet!","review":"I just got done looking at some pretty sad, one star reviews of Santana and I'm sad. I'm sure all the kids need this CD because Rob, Ms. Hill, Wyclef, Everlast, Dave and all the names they know are doing a song with \\"this guy that plays awesome guitar!\\" I've seen the other generations buying it because they need to hear Carlos and his guitar! For whatever reason you buy this CD, you will probably be surprised and yet oh-so happy for purchasing this! What more do you want? He won like a billion awards for this CD! So what are you waiting for, man?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I had read your customer reviews 'fore I bought it.","review":"Only Smooth is worth. I bought it only for it. Both those stars I have given it are for smooth alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Santana Disappoints","review":"I was looking forward to an alternative/rock album. Instead what I got was a latin/rap album with a couple of rock songs (which are the ones I had heard on the radio). A great tactical move by Santana, but a major disappointment for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shake your BOM-BOM ............................... to Smooth","review":"I got this album for the HIT single 'Smooth', and ever since I listened to it the first time, I wasn't able to get my CD player off 'Repeat'.. I didn't get a chance to listen to the rest of the album - I love this song too much to let go! ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea... Terrible product","review":"Carlos must be deaf to let this out. The sound is so compressed that it only sounds good on boom boxes and in cars. If you have a good quality sound system, you probably won't listen to this disk long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for insomnia","review":"This album mostly sounds like really, really good background lounge music. Much of it sounds the same. I know Carlos Santana plays a mean guitar, but I often feel he is technically skilled, but the emotion of his playing is lost on me. The song with Everlast is pretty good, but \\"Smooth\\" is an inexplicable hit to me. I played this CD twice, and I'll be taking it to the local Hastings to sell to them. I'm sure I'm just missing out on what everyone else loves about this CD, but I have to be honest...I wasted my money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural it is","review":"Incredible music, wondrous melodies and great teamwork make up this fabulous album. Young artists, veteran guitarist and imaginative songs all help spark this musical recipe that reaches across ages and genres. Santana proved beyond a doubt that the Latinization of American music is more a transformation than a trend as writes music reporter Ramiro Burr, author of \\"The Billboard Guide to Tejano and regional Mexican music,\\" Billboard Books. This is a new era dawning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supernatural","review":"Oh boy. Santana brings me back to being 15 and slow dancing at the Cove in Burien, WA during those awesome guitar riffs of \\"Black Magic Woman\\". But this album, except for a few songs, is enormously boring. I love Carlos and wanted to love the CD, but it just all sounds the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana beat","review":"Typical Santana rhythm complete with drums, jazzy tunes with a latin beat. Most of his cuts are haunting and enduring in that they become engraved in your mind and you hum the tune while at work. There's only two cuts I did not like and they were performed by the other stars in his CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is pants","review":"This is pants ... worst Santana album ever ... and that includes the one he did with Alice Coltrane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carlos, what happened?","review":"This is sad. Santana used to have a SOUND and PASSION. Now poor Carlos sounds like he's a guest on other peoples' albums.The current formula seems to be, get whoever is flavor of the month (\\"hot\\") and get the whole bunch on a salable but forgettable and artistically bankrupt \\"product\\".Of course a year or two down the line the truth is evident (Matchbox 20 anyone?).Ditto for Shaman.The truth is that after Michelle Branch has finally pudged out and dissapeared along with all the other pop tinsel and fluff Santana insists on \\"collaborating\\" with Carlos will still be around. Carlos, YOU are the future. PLease move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smooth Good, CD Bad","review":"Once I heard Santana's new song with Rob Thomas (Smooth) I was very excited to see that Santana was back on the charts with a great song. I raced to the nearest CD store and bought \\"Supernatural\\" After I listened to \\"Smooth\\" I went through the rest of the CD and it was definately not the Santana of old, the guitar master of classic albums like \\"Abraxis.\\" It was like listening to a combination of Tito Puente, Bob Marley, and Lauren Hill. Absolutely terrible stuff for any rock fans. My advice: buy the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Audio Disaster","review":"Although I generally like the music from this album - the DVD Audio is good example of how the record labels managed to kill this format. I bought this specifically for the higher quality STEREO ... but this disc is defaulted to 5.1 and it's extremely cumbersome and frustrating if all you want to do is listen to the album in higher res on your main stereo setup. 5.1 usually means home cinema (lower quality sound as it's also designed for movies) and in most cases awful 5.1 mixes of the original. If you like this album buy the CD and save yourself the grief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Genius","review":"Pure Genius. The greatest Rock/Pop album in 20 years.The content on this CD could easily have made 4 No.1 albums.Supernatural was a 'Classic Album' the moment it hit the shelves.Off the top of my head, the only comparisons:- The Blues Brothers, Rumors, Tapestry, Machine Head, Abbey Road.The song 'Smooth' could easily have been written by Lennon/McCartney it is so exciting.Carlos played at Woodstock alongside the greatest Rock guitaristever, Jimi Hendrix.On studio guitar, Santana is the closest thing to Jimi Hendrixleft on the planet.Carlos makes Eric Clapton look Arthritic.Unfortunately the only way forward from here is DOWN!Their following album, SHAMAN had just 1 hit.It is unlikely we will see another 'Supernatural' from anyonefor another 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana's no sell out","review":"I have been a long time Santana fan, and I planned on boycotting this album because I felt that he was \\"selling out.\\"This was a huge mistake. I finally bought the album, and found that his magic remains intact. Besides the radio time songs, the album is chock full of entertaining music. When I got over my snobbiness, I came to think of this album not as a sellout, but more of a sharing of Santana so that more people would enjoy his talents.If you weren't a Santana fan before, Supernatural will sell you. If you were a Santana fan, don't be a dolt (like me). Buy the album you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth","review":"Loved it nice to have Santana back and yes it have change but how can the offer new song without offering a new style. So in defenitive like it all past and present. It show a great alternative to my kid and show them what their Dad was listening and might push them to go for his past music too."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Pop with Latin Overtones ...","review":"It is a good CD, -but can't stand the fact that Carlos is selling womens shoes and ties???? Now THAT is selling out, not because he has a pop CD. Get the picture ??? We knew you would !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed emotions...","review":"Ok.. was anyone surprised when the Grammys ate this one up, and (as usual) for the wrong reasons? I knew it would happen the first time I saw the names Rob Thomas and Lauryn Hill on the list. It was just as I expected: the album is fantastic except for two abominable songs, and guess what made it so popular... I'm thrilled Carlos has made such a spirited and creative effort. Matthews and Clapton are fantastic on their tracks, the other guests are at least tolerable, and the band's own songs make possibly the best album they've done in a decade. However, I'm ashamed he even considered working with someone like Rob T. An honest attempt to diversify, or a shameless marketing ploy.. who can say? Knowing Santana's attitude to music, I can believe he was trying to do some new things. I'm glad to see a few people are still taking chances out there. It's just a shame Rob and Lauryn Hill weren't up to the challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana Will Always Rock on the Guitar!","review":"I love listening to Carlos Santana play the guitar! Just listen to Migra and Corazon Espinado. One star short for Rob Thomas and G&B trying to sing w/ Latin-American accents, good try guys, but no...Santana keeps it real with a band of instruments (drums, piano, horns, etc.) instead of a keyboard...Way to go Carlos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carlos made \\"safe\\" for lite-rock & lite-jazz radio","review":"I can understand Santana's desire to reach a different, younger crown - but this? Any one cut on his 1st 3 albums (or the 80's \\"Havana Moon\\") kicks this whole album out to the curb. Carlos' trademark was complex rhythms and musicality - this sounds like music from \\"Your Local Weather\\" on the Weather Channel! On the positive side, maybe some folks will buy his older stuff again - but if you're expecting more of this \\"music to pop Valium and drink herbal tea to\\" you won't be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"gota have","review":"has a lot of my favorite artist on it, and the songs are all good. My Uncle has borrowed it from me miss it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Another excellent album from Santana. I like every song on the album, even if the duet with Clapton is a little long and hard to sit still through (it is a great backround song though). I particularly like the collaborations with Lauryn Hill and Everlast. Definatly one for the CD collection. Now if they just put it out in a DVD form..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carlos is the man!","review":"Friend Santana has been making me dance and smile since the seventies, I personally, never thought he would record again. Thank the Lord he has! If I ignore track 6, (the Lauryn Hill/Cee-Lo collaboration) the CD ranks as one of my favorites of all time. God bless Carlos Santana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carlos Santana rules!","review":"I love this CD by Santana. It is a wonderful mix of all sorts of music styles. There is rap, pop, hard rock, and even soft rock. Carlos Santana seems to be the only guitar player I know who can change his style to accompany whomever he is joined by. An example of this would be on the song \\"Put Your Lights On\\" with Everlast. Santana uses a definite hard edged playing style when he accompanys Everlast's dark, dreary vocals. It is one of the best songs on the CD. It is not the best, however. That title would have to go to \\"Corazon Espinado\\" with Mana. It has that original Latin beat. Once you have heard it, you never want to let go of it. It is simply amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Rocks!","review":"Santana is a god. This CD has music from many different genres, from Latin, to Groove, to Blues, to Hip Hop. But it has Santana's rockin guitar, bluesy with a great latin feel. Corazon Espinado is the best song on the CD. This song grabs you by the guts and makes your hips start swinging. You can't help but dance. It's involuntary! Buy it, Smoke up and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana Soars","review":"Carlos Santana has evolved in the last 30 years to be a consumate musician and performer.In \\"Supernatural\\", his distinctive guitar sound is heard in an energetic mix of tracks with some of todays brightest stars. No, this is not just Santana. As well it shouldn't be.Santana has the verve to share his talent. He is respected and plays with musicians from hip hop to rock. When a man of music is acclaimed by such a wide breadth of musical genre.....we all are rewarded. \\"Maria, Maria\\" is the 1st song my teenage sons & I have ever enjoyed together!

I'm fifteen years old and have liked Santana ever since my parents played it for me. So, when I heard all the talk about his new album and how great it was supposed to be, I thought to myself, 'Hey! Maybe I should go out and buy that!' So I did. Oh dear. I look at the track listing, and EIGHT of the thirteen songs are \\"featuring\\" another artist. Weeeee! It's too bad that those songs aren't any good. Most of the songs that have gotten air time on the radio sound NOTHING like Santana, and a lot like they should be on the featured artist's album. I give this album two stars for the songs that aren't featuring anyone, like Yaleo and Africa Bamba. If you want good music, get Abraxas or Santana or Moonflower. If you want stuff that sounds like everything else out there, get Supernatural!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is not Santana","review":"Well, first of all let me tell you why I bought this album. I bought this cd the day it came out just because is from Carlos Santana. All of his cds that I have are pure music, beautifull stuff with real passion. This is cd was made only for comercial purpose. Seeing Santana with Rob Thomas is like seeing Clapton (god) with Fred Durzt. Their styles are completely different and the music doesn't sound the way Santana, the REAL Santana sounds like. Sorry but this is not the Santana I know, is just some comercial-MTV-pop-culture ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE IS CARLOS?","review":"This is what happens when you take ego-centric music executives and a classic rock icon, whip up a few million dollars in marketing, and spit it out to the public. A package of songs that are neither sung nor written by the person whose name appears on the album. If it were not for the powers that be in the music industry, this would be just another tribute album that would soon be dusty from sitting too long on the shelf. While \\"Smooth\\" is a bonafide hit, none of the other songs on this compilation come even close. It's a shame that Carlos has to be a puppet of the music industry's corporate marketing strategies. With the exception of his guitar solos, nothing on this album has either the spirit or soul of Carlos Santana. Although, it's nice to see his peers finally recognize his contributions to music."},{"rating":"2","title":"i listen to punk- but this cd is just amazing","review":"my dad used to listen to this alot when it came out...and i have just recently picked it up..wow! this is an amzing piece, i mean anyone can like this. The cuban-african rythms and the guitar work will blow you away. I highly recommned this to anyone. Viva Santana!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Work Of Art","review":"I've had a couple of weeks to listen and to digest Carlos' new album. Even though he hasn't released a new album in a few years the constant touring has kept us in contact with his new music and kept some of the classics fresh. As for Supernatural this album cooks on so many different levels. Yaleo is as good a song as Carlos has recorded in the last 20 years (and it absolutely smokes live). The combinations with Dave Matthews, Everlast and Rob Thomas are good examples of Carlos being able to take a commercial sound and make it his own and the track with Mana is great. My 14 year old daughter thinks Maria Maria is the best song on the album. The only dissapointing song is the collaboration with Clapton that just doesn't seem to go anywhere. I'm not sure if this will hold up in the long run with Abraxas and Caravanserai, but it is certainly one of the best albums this legend has recorded (and his best in 15 years). That alone should make it a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School meets New School!!!!","review":"All the music lovers at our house will own their own copy of this one, 'cause mom's tired of sharing! Those slick guitar riffs from Carlos that rock the house and bring out the air guitar in everyone, tropical latin tracks that make you want move, rap, soul and more... It's probably one of the most diverse CDs we own and one of Carlos' best ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All those Grammys for this?","review":"My wife bought this CD for me after the Grammy awards. I must say that I am extremely disappointed with it. I have enjoyed Santana's music ever since Woodstock although I am not a hard-core fan. I can only listen to one or two tracks before turning it off. I have worked my way through it four times, but cannot find much to rave about. The straight Santana tracks are OK, but the collaborations are drivel. Maybe I just do not understand the current music scene. Neither genre on any of the cuts finds anything new or innovative in the joint effort. They just seem to be singing(?) or playing at the same time. It is oil and water to me. Carlos, now that you are making the big bucks, do it right with people who care about your music and you theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Album? I don't think so...","review":"Okay, I grew up with Santana....I dug his sound. Only, I must admit, it is hard to find Carlos here. I mean, I was more impressed with his liner notes - indicative of a soulful man with a lot of gratitude for the love and art in his life - than the tunes. I conclude that this is not a Santana album, but a Pop Artists of the 90's disc, with Santana's name on it. I suppose that if you had no clue of his earlier works, you wouldn't know the diff and would enjoy the POP sounds of this work, but....I DON'T! Hey, Carlos....call me when you make your own music.And when you get 8 grammies for that, I'll be Superimpressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Santana, I'm sadly surprised !","review":"This was a true dissappointment ! There are a few good songs here and the rest is poor stuff. This is a collection of various music and I say that litely ! If you are looking for THE Santana music then this is not the album you want. If you want a sample of what a lot of groups are calling music today then this may be for you. The awards people are a bunch of know nothing of music anyway. Maybe this was for publicity !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah...horrible.","review":"Santana is a very limited guitarist on the face of it. True, the pentatonic scale sounds very guitar heroish coming from his ornate Paul Reed Smith, but the whole amounts to something very sophomoric and immature.The songs on the record, all written by other guys, are mediocre at best. Clive Davis put together a nice package, commissioning songwriters when needed (and that's quite often) and producers to tailor the sound to the frail and one-dimensional ears of the typical Top 40 listener and the typical Grammy voter.But what are you going to do? Santana's new record SUPERNATURAL has put him where he apparently wants to be: next to Limp Bizkit, Britney Spears, N Sync and the rest of 'em on the charts: seemingly diverse in sound, but horrifyingly homogenous in mentality."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame songs and it's grammy time","review":"Santana motivated me to start playing guitar over 10 years ago when I saw him in concert. I bought handfulls of his releases around that time. He deserved his first grammys back in the 'black magic woman' days, but I doubt back then such music by a non-anglo would be allowed to champion the awards scene. I figure that's the only way you can explain it. How else do you explain how 'smooth' was such a hot hit? I cringed every time I came across that stupid song in my day to day life. Lots of canned music on this release and will not buy anymore Santana that are collaberations.I'll cut Santana slack if this is a case of needing to pay the bills, but other than that, Carlos, please leave the cheesy pop music for the Britanys, Matchboxes, and Backstreets of the world.Get back to Milagro, Dancing in the Flesh of Spirits, and Blues for ElSalvador. PLEASE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated, under performed","review":"Very disappointed in this album, Way over hyped. Only a couple of cuts are real Santana. Don't recommend it at all.

What was he thinking, let's make a fast buck and sacrifice all artistic integrity? The album ranges from good to bad to just plain ugly, the good being Yaleo and El Farol - most reminiscent of classic Santana, the bad being Primavera and Love of My Life and the ugly being Put Your Lights On, Maria Maria, and just about everything else with rappers on it - I wonder what happened there, the band walked out on him? The poppy Smooth is soooo NOT Santana. The Calling is filler, so soporiphic that it will make you snore in the first 2 minutes, and there's like 8 of 'em. Does this stuff come from the same man who produced Abraxas, Caravanserai, Swing Of Delight, Santana III and Amigos? No way. I mean, all artists want to try new things from time to time, but it looks like here Mr. Santana forgot himself completely..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural","review":"Hearing \\"Smooth\\" for the first time i didn't knew that it is santana's track.when i heard it thought that he has gone so much commerical.but really \\"Supernatural\\" is not a bad album.Eventhough it is far from epic \\"Abraxas\\" and it brings a lot of modern r and b flavour, Santana created pleasent music for evenings with friends,for listening in car or for listening whenever you want to.some great guitar parts will even make the \\"Cheesiness\\" of Wyclef Jean's appearance go away.if oyu like Santana and modern pop music then try this one.if all pop songs would sound like that i would be in sevent heaven"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal CD!!!","review":"If you haven't gotten this CD yet, you should buy it now! I origianlly bought it for the Santana / Rob Thomas collaboration, \\"Smooth\\", because I am a huge Rob Thomas fan. I was pleasantly surprised that this cd has several more amazing tracks to its credit! I really liked the Dave Matthews song \\"Love of My Life\\" as well as all of the instrumentals!! Incredible talent is showcased on this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in so many ways!","review":"This is one of the most diverse and beautiful albums I've heard this year. I am a big fan of Africa Bamba (with the Toure Kunde riff here, for people who know Toure Kunde), Smooth is very nice and I have never heard Rob Thomas sound any better, and Maria Maria is one heck of a song with a catchy hook and, as usual on EVERY song, great gituar by Carlos. This cd is worth the effort. But for a few songs like The Calling and Wishing It Was, who gave me no excitement or inspiring feelings like the others, there is no better album this year, so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for the next generations!","review":"I disagreed about the comments of Editor's review about this last work of Carlos Santana. This isn't two discs in one.This is a thousands of rythms in one disc.Santana is one of the most complete musics i've hearded in my life. This 'Supernatural',is this new kind of music that only few musicians as Carlos,play so well! This is the music of a new era,mixing rythms of all the world.Santana goes from the latin,to rock'n roll;from salsa to world music;from jazz to blues......All we must do is to reverence this great man,and clap our hands,so loud! One of the best cds of the year,sensual,hot,full of intense energy,really 'GREAT WORK'! All of the tracks are '10',but i liked 'Smooth' & 'Corazón Espinado'....... Santana usted vive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana's eclectic ear candy.","review":"For over thirty years Santana has infused his masterful guitar virtousity with vocalists who complement his music. This album does it again. A true confection for the ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good song...","review":"I thought that this album was really going to be good, Carlos has an excellent style and some great songs in his history. I found the album lacking a presence or feeling. I do like \\"Smooth\\", but without Rob Thomas, the song wouldn't be that great... I just thought the ablum was a letdown considering the potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 and a half stars! Who rates these things?!?","review":"The only reason I bought this CD was because everyone praised it. Thats the last time I will listen to the critics. Don't buy it. It's a waste of time listening to, and a waste of money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bad but very commercial","review":"This album is very commercial. Santana has understood how to make money with songs that are devoted to the people fond of the music of MTV but not surely to the listeners of Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis or Tito Puente. If you wish to listen some real genuine latin music, buy the first album of Ibrahim Ferrer or the last of Compay Segundo. Luckily, in this album Santana shows that he has not forgotten how to play the guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say, I really hated it","review":"I bought this album because I love \\"Smooth\\" but the rest of the CD is absolutely nothing like it. There's not one other song on the CD that I like. It's a whole mix of latin-rap (who would have guessed those went together?), latin-rock, latin-traditional, and latin-who-knows-what. There's not one Santana style, it's more Carlos + the famous artist in some other category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk the CD,Artist etcetc","review":"Give me a break man Smooth is fine but his new one Maria Maria oh please If I hear that song 1 more I am gonna PUKE I mean come on I know of music far better and yes that Includes 80's music etcetc the fact Mr Satana sweeped the Grammys give me a break thats' like giving Shania Twain awards and trust me she ain't got no right to em other then those Candian Awards I mean totally unfair Pop sinks to another low first It's woman that think there music wont' sell unless they show there belly button GIVE ME A BREAK THAT IS DOWN RIGHT NASTY no one should have to see that In public anyhow so to end I say this sorry Mr Santana u gotta go I mean I know of Artists that made good music back then and Its' still good today,example Harry Chapin still one I like..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Santana's 'Supernatural' is one of the greatest CD's I have ever purchased! It has a quality that allows it to go from study music to party music to conversational music. I love it, and would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Masterpiece from Carlos Santana.","review":"Not much to say: get it now. Santana again at his very best. Great melodies, great texts, great sessions. My absolute favorite: Love of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no!","review":"Greetings,Track 2 of the album starts with a rapper introducing our friend Carlos.

I like Santana in every way, and I'm not into being boring stubbern refusing-to-play-new-stuff-of-old-masters... I just HONESTLY like their old stuff better. But hey! Go ahead and get this CD, offcourse, it's Santana, so it is worth the money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BARBARA'S SUPERNATURAL REVIEW","review":"I BOUGHT THIS CD WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE FIRST SANTANA CD I'VE BOUGHT. I LIKE ALL THE TRACKS ESPECIALLY BONUS TRACK-DAY OF CELEBRATION AND DO YOU LIKE THE WAY, VERY SOULFUL, R& B SOUND WITH SOME RAP BY LAURYN HILL. SANTANA'S CD HAS SOMETHING FOR JUST ABOUT EVERY KIND OF LISTENER, JAZZ, RAP, R&B, ROCK, ALTERNATIVE. AN ECLECTIC, JOY TO THE LISTENER. THAT'S WHY IT HAS SOLD OVER 10 MILLION COPIES. IT HAS MASS APPEAL, A TRULY SUPERNATURAL MASTERPIECE OF JOY."},{"rating":"2","title":"santana...recycled","review":"Yes, Carlos as another reviewer put it,\\"on Supernatural, is pure\\". He has a gift, just ask Clapton or Jeff Beck...they will tell you. He has always stood with the best and as Clapton...was long overdue. Go back to his Inner Secrets Album. That collection of music should have won every award there was.I am just pleased he finally recieved the recognition he deserves.Anyone who knows guitar playing will know that those rich tones with forever sustain will warm the coldest soul.If this is the first you have noticed Carlos, and I say this for the very young audiophile.Because if you are over 30 years old and listen to music and do not know who he is...glad you came out of your coma!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Santana.....but now a Fan","review":"If you're like me and never listened to Santana before this is the CD to buy. Most of us have heard \\"Smooth\\" on the radio but it isn't the best song on here. There are so many fantastic tracks on here. The best part is the fact that Santana plays with musicians we know and love such as Dave Matthews and Rob Thomas. I highly recommend the CD. The only reason why I didn't rate it 5 stars is the fact that I didn't like the songs that were soley instrumental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but OVERRATED","review":"It's true.... I really tried to like this album. I mean, it isn't terrible, but it certainly is not the classic that all the sheep are calling it. As you listen to it, and try to keep an open mind to all the diverse influences that are present, it quickly becomes apparent that what you have here is a mediocre song from nearly every guest-star and Carlos himself. I'm sorry again, but it needs to be said. OVERRATED. If you must hear \\"Smooth\\" (as though you don't hear it enough on the radio) save a few bucks and buy the single. The rest of the album feels disjointed and incoherent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial and depressing","review":"His guitar still sounds like no one else. But the rest of this travesty of a CD with its Vegas-styled Latin rhythms and slicker than slick production, plus those desperate collaborations make Santana sound as compelling as Hootie and the Blowfish. This is what the Beach Boys' \\"Kokomo\\" was to \\"Good Vibrations\\" or Grace Slick singing \\"White Rabbit\\" versus \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now.\\" I'm happy for Carlos Santana's success, but did it have to happen with such an innocuous and calculated group of songs? A corporate record and totally dispensable. Many Grammy's are sure to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Supernatural combination of artists and music!","review":"This new one form Carlos Santana is nothing less of classic. I never used to listen to santana. i heard his songs before but never paid any attention to him. Now? ...I play this cd whenever I get the chance. I know that If I like this,...then true fans of santana and any of the artists on this cd will like this.Don't hesitate on this one....just get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are zero stars not possible?","review":"I had eagerly anticipated the release of this. Initially, I did not get to hear it, and was even more excited after the hype. By recruiting artists from a variety of sub-genres to work with a man w/ great name recognition, Sr. Santana and the label tried to and succeeded in selling a zillion albums. Great marketing ploy. Bad music ploy. Well, it goes to show that hype doesn't mean a hill of beans. This CD was extremely disappointing. After all, Eric Krapton's (no coincidence that this washed-up Anglo retread guitarist helped Carlos with a track) \\"If I See You In Heaven\\" also received hype and awards, and it was a terrible CD. Eric Krapton should have hung up his guitar in the early 70s. At least Carlos has still got the skills. He needs to get Greg Rollie and a tight band back, and produce more consistent music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth a listen","review":"I listened to my wife's CD to see what this was all about. Interesting arrangement of guests, but I will probably never voluntarily listen to this again. Lots of interesting beats. Lots of notes. That's about it. I was not stirred."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning! warning!","review":"If you are considering buying this CD, then please, save your money. I have to say that this is the worst CD I have ever bought. I got it because I love the single, \\"Smooth\\" and thought that the rest of the songs would be of simalar quality. If you want to know the truth, most of it just sounded like elevator music to me. I gave it to my mother, who usually likes that kind of \\"easy listening\\" music, but she listened to it once through and had pretty much the same opinion as I did. Some people may like the kind of music that is on here, but if you are expecting the rest of the songs on here to sound like \\"Smooth\\", then you will be terribly dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"bravo!","review":"i bought the cd because of the single \\"smooth\\", but the rest of the album did not dissappoint. the tracks not featuring guest vocalists are santana at his best - smooth, soulful and sufficiently modern. guest performers put their own stamp on the tracks (sometimes too much so, making you forget whose album it is), but the songs featuring the dave mathews band, everlast, and rob thomas are terrific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible! 1st Santana CD I've ever bought. I love it.","review":"It is groooovy. It makes me want to dance around my house. I didn't realize that Santana was so good. Plus, he has a lot of guest performers on this CD that totally rock. Dave Matthews is a GOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought","review":"I was expecting more from santana because the songs \\"Maria Maria\\" And offcorse \\"Smooth\\" But the other songs are boring and have not life at all. They have none if singing in it then thre is hardley any."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here","review":"I've been a major Santana fan since the begining of his career. Rock, jazz, freeform, Latin..they all sounded great but this album's hip hop is too far for me. I don't know if the effort is commercial or just trendy but there's no room on my shelf to add this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD!","review":"THIS CD IS DA BOMB! I LOVE IT SO MUCH! SMOOTH AND LEAVE YOUR LIGHTS ON ARE THE BEST SONGS IN THE WORLD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I was disappointed with this CD after all the hype. How can one go from being one of the premier guitar legends of this century in 1969 to recording music thirty years later with an \\"artist\\" who calls himself \\"Eagle-Eyed Cherry?\\" It's time to grow up, Mr. Santana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gift","review":"Bought it as a gift. I LOVE Santana, and Carlos was brilliant to merge himself with todays top artists, BUT, I think todays artists suck, and so the album isnt good. However Santana made a great career move on this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop goes Santana","review":"Pull out/borrow/buy a copy of Santana\`s 1972 masterpiece \\"Caravanserai\\", pay close attention to the track titled \\"Song Of The Wind\\", and then compare it with the absolute DRECK on this 'popsy'-nonsense, and then ask yourself whether this is even the same guitarist. I recommend the old stuff-- before Carlos felt the need to become a mainstream pop star, for some reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it should be...","review":"Call me a naysayer, pessimist, what you will, but I really have to agree with fellow \\"party poopers\\" who \\"just like to ruin a good thing,\\" or so they say, that Carlos has sold his soul to mainstream pop. Upon first hearing that Santana was signing onto pop label Arista, my immediate first response was \\"Uh, Oh.\\" And having pop producer Clive Davis on board didn't help things much, either. Don't get me wrong, this album has it's moments (such as his collabrations with Eric Clapton and the Dave Matthews Band), but for the most part, I would much rather remember Santana for \\"Black Magic Woman\\" rather than for \\"Smooth.\\" It's okay, but the money's better well spent on Santana's first three albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Example of El Jefe's Versatility","review":"I've been a rabid fan of Santana from the beginning and I feel this album, with the collaboration of artists like Dave Matthews is just another example of how ecelctic and timeless his music really is. May Santana continue to provide those wonderful sounds that span generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure genius! The return of the Great Santana!!","review":"A must for all music lovers... if you buy just one album this year, make it this one!! Carlos is just phenomenal... just like good wine, gets better with age!! Been waiting for this baby for a long time...Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic for all to enjoy","review":"As Santana fan for 30 years, this release was a sure hit for me. I bought another copy since my wife took possesion of mine. These are complex songs, masterfully performed. I can close my eyes and visualize the artists laying the tracks down. I have seen Santana live 6 or 7 times and can't wait to see him again.The value of this CD is that a new generation and those not normally Santana fans are now \\"hooked\\". To say this is a hit crossover recording really misses the mark. This is a CD that is a mezcla, a blending of various musical traditions. Corazon Espinado is classic old school Santana -- it conjures visions of the old days with Greg Rolie, Chepito Areas and Coke Escobedo. Yet, this CD is as contemporary as it is varied. The Santana band is as tight as ever, and the guest artists are all really great.Congratulations, Carlos. Viva Santana!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks mega, Santana ascends to new heights of jammin'","review":"The music is awesome. Head and shoulders above anything else you hear coming out these days. Play it loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the best","review":"One of the best albums I have EVER heard, probably the best that I own. No matter how long its been since I last heard it, I can put it in my CD player and get right back into the groove of the songs. Smooth is just amazing, Maria Maria has a great urban feel, and the collabos with Everlast, Dave Matthews, and Eric Clapton really work well. I remember when I saw him perform at Jones Beach three summers ago -- this music was great then and its just as good now."},{"rating":"1","title":"sellout...","review":"I think it is VERY dissapointing that in the generations of Santana's GENIUS music, he has to produce a poppy album with artists that have a fraction of Santana's talent in order to recieve a Grammy. I am actually sorry that I purchased this album because it is DEFINATELY not real Santana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Latino","review":"When I bought this album in February or March of this year I thought that it was going to be an oldies album because I knew Santana had been around from 1969. I was wrong. It was Latin. I would have never guessed from Smooth, a nice rock song which features Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20, the reason I bought this album. I had also heard Put Your Lights On and Maria Maria. I liked Put Your Lights On but I had to grow into Maria Maria, which I like now. I didn't know all the songs that he did by himself (and the song with Mana) were all in Spanish. He brought in a lot of talented artists such as Lauryn Hill, Rob Thomas, Everlast, Eagle-Eye Cherry, and many more. My favorites are Put Your Lights On(featuring Everlast), Smooth (featuring Rob Thomas), Do You Like The Way (featuring Lauryn Hill and Cee-Lo, and Maria Maria (featuting The Product G&B. I liked this album a lot and you will too. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for everyone","review":"First of all, its old school. If you dont like this kind of music in the first place, this CD wont make you like it. The songs are nothing to get excited about or anything. If you are fan of Santana and his style of music, go get it because it sounds just like it did back 30 yrs ago. But if you're not a die-hard fan, save your money, i cant imagine how it possible got the best album award last year, its not good, its boring. Simple as that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supernaturally Bad Various Artists Record","review":"This is the single-most overrated album of the past 10 years.
