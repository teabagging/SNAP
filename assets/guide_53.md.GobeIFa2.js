It's the best COMPLETE album of the 80's. We all know \\"Your Love\\" (or you should anyway - \\"Josies on a vacation far away, come around and talk it over...\\"), but there are songs on this disc like \\"61 Seconds\\" and \\"Say It Isn't So\\" that are just phenomenal. I put this CD in my top three of all time (U2's \\"Joshua Tree\\" & Tom Petty's \\"Damn the Torpedos\\" are my other two). I don't know what else to say other than this band is one of the most underrated bands of the 80's and sadly, overlooked in the 90's.

There really isn't one weak song here and \\"I Don't Need Her\\" which received very little airplay may be the best song on the entire CD.

Unfortunately, I found it to be a huge disappointment. While there are certainly some very interesting anecdotes on how elite restaurants operate as well as some great cooking tips and ideas, the vast majority of the book is dull and repetitive. The books is effectively a journal of daily life in the restaurant and the author is probably the only person not to realize that most days in a kitchen (just like at any job) are pretty much the same. Nonetheless, she doesn't hesitate to point out each time a customer order a soup or if (brace yourselves) a table of four decides to order five appetizers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but frustrating","review":"Lots of interesting details about running a high quality restaurant in New York, but overall the content is a bit thin. The book is very padded with many blow by blow accounts of a typical dinner or lunch service at Daniel. It's interesting the first few times or when the author recounts a dinner for President Clinton, but by the tenth dinner you begin to flip the pages. I was disappointed that there was almost no insight into Daniel Boulud, how he and his staff create new dishes, what actions he took to elevate the restaurant to 4 stars or what really sets his restaurant apart from other top quality restaurants in the US.

Marnus is a child of the white, brutal culture and the system of the apartheid. He lives a seemingly happy life, influenced by his father, who is a general in the South African army. Against a background of racial prejudices, the reader gets to know the reality of the Erasmus family, including the sexual molestation of Marnus's best friend (Frikkie) by his father and an love-affair between his mother and a visiting Chilean general. Although I found the novel's shocking ending less than credible, the gradual uncovering of the enormous pressures on this family gives this novel a brooding tension.Mark Behr has created a lyrical and memorable child narrator, along with a really great background-story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Smell of Apples","review":"In his novel \\"The Smell of Apples\\" Mark Behr deals with problems of Apartheid by telling the story of a white South-African boy called Marnus Erasmus.Throughout the book the strong relation to his father becomes obvious. Although Mr. Erasmus is really strict and authoritarian, Marnus regards him as a hero, especially because he is a general in the South African Army. Nevertheless the reader believes that Marnus's father is very considerate concerning his family, but this illusion gets destroyed when Marnus observes that his best friend Frikkie is raped.The end of the novel is really shocking, but exactly that makes the book so interesting and readable. Telling the story through the eyes of a 10-year old boy makes the story even more dramatic.I like the story and the characters, although the parts of the novel concerning Marnus's time in war are sometimes hard to understand"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drugs are bad?!?

Likewise, the world that was created was >ehh< not particularly interesting or engaging -- yeah, a couple of dwarfs, some elves, a few \\"dark folk\\" that are thrown in -- but they don't really enhance the plot. And, worst of all, the enemy never comes across as evil, but instead seem to invade just because they need reasources -- kind of hard to really hate them. Boring, boring, boring, boring.

He comes back with his \\"sword\\" all covered with gew and princess carline can't a that grin off her face."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable!!!","review":"I started reading this series with one of my friend's advice..I do not want to be overly critical but I just did not like the first two books, then quit reading the series. the main problem about the book is the storytelling. the dialogues are dull and childish, the storyline is sooooo much predictable. on every page of this book someone makes some silly mistake and apologise for it..the whole story is based on mistakes and apologizes. also there are no bad guy until the tsuranis come into scene. there are many many better books..get some salvatore or weiss&hickman!!! they are far greater than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastique","review":"What an awesome book! Pug is a very interesting character you can't wait to see what happens to him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magician: Apprentice","review":"One of my high school teachers introduced me to this book after discussing the other types of books that I love to read. That was nearly seven years ago. I have read this book about seven times over and have found new things to enlighten my imagination. The detail in which Feist describes seens from the open page to the last does entitle him to be named one of Tolkein's successors. I hadn't read Tolkein until after I had read Feist and am suprised on how similar their writing styles are. If you like Tolkein, you would love any of Feist's masterpieces. Apprentice gives the foundation to the other 18 books that have come after it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Magician:Apprentice is a fantastic fantasy novel. Mr. Deists does use some clinches but uses them so well you won't care. First time reading a Raymond E. Feist novel and I have to say.. I really enjoy his writing style. Pug is a good underdog protagonist. Interesting rift concept. Good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding start to the Riftwar Cycle","review":"I have just re-read Magician: Apprentice for the first time in over 20 years, and it still stands up after all this time. Even though the beginning may seem like a typical damsel in distress (Carline rescued by Pug from the troll), both characters quickly break out of their stereotypes. The appearance of the Tsurani near Crydee immediately sets fantasy tropes on their ear, and allows the Riftwar Saga to set its own path in the fantasy genre.Feist does a good job of introducing and laying the foundation with the central characters of the Riftwar Saga in Pug,Tomas, Macros and Arutha. This is a fun read, and I'm planning to read the entire Riftwar Cycle (about 30 books long now) before the release of Magician's End next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginning to a promising Saga","review":"I really like the way this series begins and I am looking forward to all of the books in this series - I am a huge fan of Sagas, and the goods ones are the ones that follow you forever - I picked up the first book after looking for it for months, and I couldn't put it down - that is a great beginning to a great series in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this book is the best book I have ever read!","review":"This is the best book I have ever read because it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, action packed and full of adventure and a lot of magic.

At first it was promising (though you were waiting for the characters to grow up from their teens for the book to gain some substance, which it didn't really). I have to say that I am 38 so maybe this is a great book for teens. But in my opinion this is not Tolkien, The Wheel of Time (TWOT), Fire&Ice, Name of the Wind or any other great fantasy book (I am a big fan of those as you can see). This can help you pass the time if you can't find anything else to read. When I was a beggining of the book it seemed like it could be quite good and since I couldn't wait to order the last book of TWOT, I went ahead and ordered the next 2 books of the Riftwar Saga. And now that I've finished The Magician I don't feel like reading them at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Top 100 book","review":"I bought this book because I noticed it on NPR's Top 100 Science Fiction and Fantasy books list (#66), and because a friend recommended it. Perhaps I have been spoiled by reading George R. R. Martin lately, but everything about Feist's book rang untrue: the plot devices, the character actions and dialog, the jarring names. There were a few too many similarities to Tolkien (dwarven mines, elven tree cities, a golden talking dragon). I wondered whether it was supposed to be young adult fiction, but even in that case the writing would have to be considered poor.To be fair, the NPR list cites \\"The Riftwar Saga\\" and not this specific book, so maybe the author's writing improves in later books of the series. Unfortunately this book was not compelling enough for me to continue with the rest of the saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series/Great author","review":"Raymond Feist is one of the best authors when it comes to Sci-Fi/Fantasy. The Riftwar books were excellent books that kept me riveted. I am not one to read books more than once, but I have actually read this series twice.If you are looking for a fun series with a great story Magician Apprentice/Master, Silverthorn and A Darkness at Sethanon are a must read. The books that came after: Prince of the Blood and The King's Buccaneer were also a great read.If you are a fantasy fan you would be missing out if you did not read these books from Raymond Feist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Main character not used for 200 pages.","review":"As the title states...Near the end of the book, Pug is not mentioned and that tends to make the book really drag.

While not that bad, not exactly what I had hoped for."},{"rating":"1","title":"writer: apprentice","review":"After all the glowing reviews I expected more, but was thoroughly disappointed with the pedestrian writing style and mundane situations - I haven't been able to get past 100 pages or so and this is going to mold on the shelf on which I keep my amazonian disappointments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Draining","review":"Reading Magician took a lot out of me. I could only read it in 50 page bursts. There are so many threads to the plot that are woven, unraveled and rewoven together. For all of its details, descriptions, characters and plot developments, many of the most interesting threads I fear are left dangling. Book 1 held my attention better than Book 2. By about page 400 I was ready for the book to be over but I felt I had enough invested in it to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOK!!!","review":"I've read it twice and have enjoyed it just as much the second time. It pulls you in, wraps you up, and sets your mind free with thoughts of fantasy and magic!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was Awsome","review":"I have to say, this book is the most awsome book ive ever read, and with the rest of the series, it blows away all competition, with only Tolkiens \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"The Hobbit\\" standing firm, but i recomment anyone who loves fantasy to read this book, it has got everything you could ask for, and tons of it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding adventure of epic proportions.","review":"I must admit that I have read the rift war saga several times and still become swept away into a land of fantasy every time. Character development and plot are superb with the flow of action nonstop. For anyone who loves sword and sorcerery , this is a must read. Begin an epic journey of fantastical proportions following two young boys as they discover their own unique skills in an ever changing world or worlds. One as a warrior and the other as a mage, both of mystical proportions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice start","review":"There fascinating thing about this book is not the similarities with Tolkien, or the sci-fi elements in the book. Feist, at least in this initial outing, is still working on form. The characters are more developed and vivid than traditional sword-and-sorcery, while the epic philosophical depth that many enjoy in Tolkien or Jordan is not present. That being said, the story is paramount to anything else in the book - it hooks you in, making you care about the characters, making you interesting in what's going to happen next. This is not as easy a thing in a book as might be imagined. One leaves reading this first book hungry for more, more stories about the characters, more stories about the world. Watch for the subtle introspection and wry humor, both easy to miss but deeply appreciated when found. A good mid-level selection for fantasy readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"Just finished Magician Apprentice (part1) of the Rift War Saga.And I instantly fell in love with the story. The world is deep with mystery and magic.

It was my first fantasy novel since the Lord of the Rings, and I loved every bit of it. Even after almost fifteen years, my enjoyment of this book hasn't dimmed, and I periodically re-read it every few years.I would definitely recommend it to any new readers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"This is a fun read. It is similar to Lord of the Rings.. i.e.- castles, wizards, elfs, dwarfs, battles etc. This is the first of three books and I have already ordered the second two books. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivals Jordan, Goodkind, and Tolkien. Check it out.","review":"This book is very superbly crafted. You never get bored with the characters or the plot. The wrld building is great. I always hear that in fantasy novel descriptions but I am not just throwing that word out here. This one is great! If you are waiting for some of the other series to finish up read this Riftwar Series. It is not just a filler between great fantasy books but one that you will remember for a long time. May make those other books seem like fillers with Feist's new series coming out. In any case, the bottom line is that if you like fantasy get this book because it will not disappoint"},{"rating":"1","title":"The saturday morning cartoon of Lord of the Rings","review":"This book is alright as youth fiction; it's not entirely dissimilar to a Heinlein youth novel. The kids in the book drink beer, so it's got that against it, but other than that, it's spot-on for teen fantasy.But the reviews don't paint it as such.From the *incredibly* cliche dialogue to the entire scene and setting, it's sort of like Feist quit making cartoons for Hanna-Barbera in the mid-80's, and then went on to write this book.Meanwhile, it's enormously derivative of Tolkien. It's entirely Tolkien's world that the characters inhabit. The only twist is the parallel world, but they don't see much of that in this book at all.3-stars, if you like predictable pulp fantasy with dialogue cliche enough to be youth fiction. 2-stars, otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"No filler","review":"This may not be for the technically minded. It is however for the reader who longs for a sense of magic once felt while young. The magic lost in real life. This book made me want to look for more interesting biology and science books. It is a great leap ahead of his book \\"the lives of a cell\\". Many people will equate this with Tolkien. There are many hints at great back story lines and quite a few events that will become legend in this universe. The scene with the dying dragon will stick with me throughout the series and after.The best part for me was the exclusion of ultra realistic descriptions of every horse, castle, cart, tree etc. as some of the other fantasy writers tend to do. All in all this is great read full of promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, But Skips Around...","review":"The story is well told and it's about one race invading a fantasy realm full of humans, dwarves, and elves. (War of the Worlds - Fantasy Style)The characters are likeable, funny at times, and inspiring.The battle scenes are well written and exciting.The setting is fairly standard, but good.I only have one gripe and that some chapters skip months or years ahead. Feist always catches the reader up to speed in the first couple of pages, but you end up saying, \\"huh?\\" and checking to see if you skipped a page at times.Overall, the book is a good one, and I'll be picking up the second book of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best fantasy book on the globe","review":"Magician is definetly the ultimate book in the fantasy world. It covers all the essential parts, that form a tremendous book. Magician has it all: thrilling battle scenes, a sensible love story and a gripping main story. The imagination of Feist is simply overwhelming. He really creates his own new world! The adventures in Midkemia and Kelewan are definetly worth reading. Both, for fantasy-enthuasiatics and newcomers to this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Whining on how it Compares with Tolkien!!!!!","review":"I think I have just about heard enough about how it is just another one of Tolkien's ideas; how Midkemia resembles Middle-Earth and so on. Tolkien practically INVENTED the Fantasy genre. For this reason we could say EVERY Fantasy novel ever written after Tolkien is garbage and that no one will ever be able to compare to Tolkien yata yata yata...Well stop the comparison..so what if Midkemia resembles Middle-Earth? It would have to..just as almost every other novel bears SOME resemblance to Tolkien..He set the Standard...It is the STYLE the author uses and different techniques of writing that counts just as much as the story itself. And if you like Tolkien why couldn't you like any other who resembles him? Feist has a talent, he is a good storyteller, and all of you out there who don't like him because he is a 'so-called' Tolkien rip off GROW UP! If you liked Tolkien, and Feist resembles Tolkien, then you should like Feist as well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant,just try to put it down!","review":"This story gives me the feeling of familiarity and closeness to characters that is also indicative of works by Tolkien.Believable characters like Pug and Thomas help the reader grasp some of the difficulty issues and plots with a childlike simplicity.Not too much narrative allows the reader to become engrossed but not bored by the background events. Magician started it all for me,the series still continues to amaze!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start.. gets much better.","review":"Okay, you have to read this one since it's the background story of everyone, but I think the second (Master) and third (Silverthorn) - i have not yet read the fourth - get better and better. Definately a different sort of fantasy novel (I have read some crap and it's rather difficult to find the good stuff) - it's original, whole, yet a pretty easy read so youth should also enjoy it (it does not have highly graphic adult scenes), but it's also not over-the-top d&d (I didn't realize a lot of the books I bought were until my friends saw them and giggled). So I recommend these books highly - they are not Tolkien, but who is?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"This book is the type of book that you will not want to put down, and it continues through the series to be just as interesting.

Especially enjoyed Pug and Tomas.","review":"This book is an unbelievably spectacular conglomeration of words into beautiful prose. Every scene has perfect images, it's like you're there when they're eating meat pies and getting drunk on ale, and also you can Pug's horror when he meets the crazy king Rodric and Tomas' internal struggle is commendable.

It was really, REALLY good, but there were some things I didn't get. (The history, etc.)So I decided to read the Riftwar Saga, starting with Magician, and so far it rules!Fiest's books are a lot like Tolkien's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid stuff","review":"Raymond Feist knows how to tell a story.Don't expect deep and meaningful literature, expect to be entertained by a great story.These are books from my childhood that I've re-read since and liked just as much the second time through.As I said with David Edding's \\"Belgariad\\", the books have everything that most fanasy readers want, the move along nicely, you like the characters and the struggles are titanic and you get to see the many different levels of the conflict, from one person's small problems, to armies in the field, to the cosmic struggle between gods.The \\"Rift War\\" is Feist's best and in my opinion, he hasn't yet matched it with his subsequent novels except perhaps his \\"Daughter of the Empire\\" series with Janny Wurts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like CliffsNotes (does not live up to the hype)","review":"Sure, the current rule of fantasy writing seems to be that books must be 800+ pages and be part of a 3 - 10 novel series. That can be great, but it can also be tedious so I'm always on the look out for shorter novels that are well ranked by Amazon. There are a few out there that I've been impressed by and I was hoping that Magician Apprentice and Master would be the same. Unfortunately, they weren't. Both novels feel rushed and lacking in the detail that makes other fantasy worlds feel real. As a result, the characters ring hollow and while there are interesting ideas, execution is poor. If you want something better read the original Shannara trilogy, the first 4 Malazan novels, the first 3 or so Wheel of Time novels, the first Recluce novel, Friedman, Farlan, Harris. You get the idea. Just don't burn your time here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tired plot, but gripping story","review":"As everyone has said here before, you won't find anything new or original in the plot line. But what the novel lacks in plot it more than makes up for in story. It definitely keeps you captivated from page one up until about 100 pages from the end. And that's probably the biggest downfall of the book, the last, rather boring, 100 pages of the novel. The author pretty much abandons the main character, along with Tomas, and sets up an absurd 100 pages of the defense of Crydee. And those final 100 pages can be summed up as, Crydee wins, the enemy is tough and Pug no longer has to worry about the princesses' affections. In other words, the last 100 pages should have been trimmed to 40 pages and if you skipped them entirely I wouldn't blame you at all.Aside from that shortcoming I did enjoy the rest of the novel and do look forward to finishing the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you read the Magician:Apprentice you are hooked!","review":"Wow! I have read each book in this series multiple times. They are impossible to put down once you have started reading them. Feist has created a world full of interesting characters and great plots. Each book is full of action. At no point is the reader bored. Magician:Apprentice and any other book by Feist is a must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a copy of Tolkein","review":"The thought that Feist was simply copying Tolkein is absurd. While Feist does use the same stereotypes of many of the fantasy creatures that Tolkein does, the characters and plots are unique. I suggest that anyone who enjoys fantasy read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, it was ok","review":"I liked this a lot the first time I read it. Unfortunately it doesn't hold up as well on successive readings. Sadly, anything in the genre inevitably gets compared to Lord of the Rings. LOTR this ain't; while the concept of a \\"believable\\" fantasy novel may seem ludicrous, there are situations in Magician that just left me scratching my head, saying, \\"well, that's a bit far fetched...\\" Maybe I'm over the whole fantasy-epic thing, but next time I'll just pull out my other well worn novels and read them again....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring, stupid story.","review":"It's hard to believe that the writer of \\"Faerie Tale,\\" an excellent, hard-to-put-down book, could write this drivel.

To compare this to the excellent \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" or \\"The Belgariad\\" would be insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close But No Cookie","review":"I'll sum it up as quickly as I can. After reading about 2/3 of this book, I wasn't sure I wanted to finish, and I don't plan on getting the next book in the series.Pros: a couple of interesting ideas; Pug is a likeable character and the best developedCons: lots of re-tread ideas, especially from Tolkien; reads like a beach novel (lots of starch, not much protein); some completely unbelievable character exchanges (teenage boys don't act like that); some pretty saccharine dialogue and descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sssshhyeaahhh Right !!

Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book has NO plot","review":"The whole thing had the originality of a second-rate chick flick. Their is no antagonist and not clear protagonist. The system of magic is never really explained so it leaves the reader whith a feeling of confusion. The plot is more of a random series of events that have no climax. The magical armor was a good idea but we never got to really see what lasting effect it had on Tomas. The \\"enemies\\" are from another world. Enough said. The main character, \\"Pug\\" was absolutely non-essential until the last bit where he was more convienient than nescessary (they probably could have negotiated the portal closed). The time flows about as smoothly as sand paper and the Magician owns a pet dragon(a little one).

Stacey is my favorite of the young jazz vocalists around today. Being based in the UK, she isn't as well known in the States as she should be. If you like Diana Krall and Jane Monheit, you should check her out.

This new edition is preceded by an even more brilliant 57-page preface which emphatically exposes the radicalism Strauss transmitted to his students. They now surround President Bush. His catastrophic policies show that Strauss' near-fascist teachings have infected their advice to him. Absolutely a must read for everyone who wants to know the political doctrines behind our present disaster in Iraq.

In any case, a good counterpoint to many of her frightening claims (and selective editing) with respect to Strauss' work can be found, of course, in a good variety of places, but perhaps Harry Jaffa's article \\"Dear Professor Drury\\" is the best place to begin because of its precision and relatively short length."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author Should Study Leo Strauss More Carefully","review":"I read this book and every book that Leo Strauss ever wrote; therefore I realized that this was a very poor and inaccurate book and that is the best that I can say.

I liked some of the random thoughts of the obviously mentally ill main character, like him wanting to count to 180,000 by 17s, things like that kept the book entertaining and gave it a bit more personality. Outside of that, the story itself was kind of ho hum with a plot twist that was very obvious from the beginning and when revealed, it was done so matter of factly that it was almost as if the author was saying \\"of course you saw this coming, I meant for you to\\" (which I actually kind of enjoyed). I also almost liked the way it ended until it went just that one step too far and became almost cartoonish.

It messed with my mind because I didn't think his friend Andy died in the Tuttle place. I thought he was alive the whole time cause of how he talked to him and he wasn't really there. Is he like schizophrenic or something? I think that that was pretty mean to put him in an all boys school I didn't thing that it was where he belonged. But he's crazy and sick in the mind because he used to look into Melissa room at night. This book really didn't make much sense. All it was pretty much was a guy writing down really long lie.

Normal easy outs would not work. The casting where the bolt broke was distorted and if not for that, the bolts would have come out easily.

You really need to hammer these into the hole you drill in the broken bolt then use a socket wrench to turn the bolt out. A few bolts were very tight and I was concerned the smaller bit I was using would break. It didnt. Removing the bolt from the bit can be tricky. I clamped the remains of the bolt in a vise and wiggled the bit with pliers to free it.

I had forgotten until I read this book how much I enjoy the editorial additions to the prose, i.e. \\"Turkeys? No, no turkeys in this issue--but there's another sort of jailbird waiting in the wings.\\" Also, the cartoony thought bubbles that aren't used in comics anymore to depict what's on a characters mind, i.e. \\"I wish Silver would answer the phone when I call! She's been gone all day!\\" Those old school comic tools are abundant in this reading. But much more than that makes this a great book. Guest stars abound as Dick Grayson returns from college to help Batman, Silver St. Cloud makes her first appearance (I think) as the second love of Batman's life. Penguin, Joker, Deadshot, Hugo Strange and others make this a wonderful story. I was sad when it was over. Maybe DC will publish more runs from this era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, it hasn't aged well . . .","review":"Batman has been a favorite of mine for many years, but I can only recommend this title to readers with a great deal of unsatisfied nostalgia for 70's-style comics.If your aesthetics have grown with you since the 1970s, you might be disappointed with BATMAN: STRANGE APPARITIONS.

For example where a supposed ghost is making you move your arms against your will and the other person sitting with you has no idea why your are doing it. That is what makes me laugh.

It sheds no light on the world of Professional Wrestling that any FAQ on the Internet couldn't share. And most FAQs on the Internet go into much more detail than this travesty of a book. Mr. Flood should cease writing his \\"The X-pert X-plains\\" series right now until he actually finds an expert to help him out. The $20 price tag is horribly high for such an amatuerish attempt at writing. Aside from the mispellings and gramatical errors (which really, really bug me), some of his facts are wrong. As well, professional wrestling tends to have a couple of levels of \\"kayfabe\\", one for the smart marks, and one for those who are actually in the business. Mr. Flood is obviously *not* in the business. Of course, this is made perfectly clear in his biography page, where he admits to not being much of an \\"X-pert\\" on anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the uninformed","review":"This book was not what I expected.

No pictures, and it's all in large, double-spaced printing. A rather thin, small book for the price tag.

This film, made in the mid-1960s, when the traditional Western genre was undergoing radical (and in some cases, not too favorable) change, \\"Johnny Reno\\" is an entertaining--at times a bit nostalgic---throwback to an earlier time when Westerns dominated at box offices and every kid wanted to grow up like Randy Scott and Wild Bill Elliott. Look for numerous familiar faces---A. C. Lyles and R.G. Springsteen peopled this film, and the other 11 or 12 made by them during the same period, with familiar Western faces and characters. It's all very enjoyable, and well worth the small investment. Go for it, and sit back and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been Titled \\"Johnny Rehab\\"","review":"I bought \\"Johnny Reno\\" because I like westerns and the cast had impressive credentials. Little did I suspect that this was almost certainly the one picture the whole cast yearned to burn every single copy of.Dana Andrews staggers through his performace as if he had just left a saloon - even in the desert, and never quite masters balance with the ground. Ms. Russell had definitely seen better days, I like to remember her in \\"Tall Man\\" with Gable. Only Lyle Bettinger(sp?), second banana bad guy, displayed barely enough acting chops to drag this sleep-inducer UP to the level of mental chewing gum.Unconvincing story, lame casting, mediocre dialog, performances off cue-cards, and absolutely no noticible direction anywhere in the film. The director apparently allowed the uncommitted bored cast to erratically mumble through the entire script on their own.It's not one of those 'so bad its funny' films, its just stultifyingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only For Diehards","review":"Here's proof that some die-hard fans will watch (and rate highly) anything Western.

It was a very good game and I enjoyed it alot. If you have a PS2, get this game instead of Equestriad 2001. The sound works better. However, the only thing you can do is 3-day eventing, practice, and multiplayer- the same with Equestriad. I like games where you care for the horses a little better. The graphics were cool, though.

I tried theirs and found the stick worked much better than mine. I did some research and despite the fact that mine came in a nintendo branded box from amazon WITH the gold Nintendo seal of approval it is in fact a Chinese knockoff.

I ended up dropping this one for an official Wii Nunchuk.And to make it more stable, I now have a stretchy hair band, like women use to make a ponytail, wrapped twice around the base of my Wii Remote Plus, with the Nunchuk wire snugly in place against the side of the WR+.

I hooked it in the Wiimote and started to play. It DID NOT sync in! In my game, it kept on saying, (There is no Nunchuk connected to the Wii remote 1.)

From day one, the cord would not lock into the remote, so it would come out at inopportune moments of game play. I would recommend spending your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imitation part, not made by Nintendo","review":"The product came in what looks like a genuine Nintendo product's box, but the item itself is definitely not legitimate. It feels cheap; the stick is off-center and does not have smooth action; the screws are not the tamper-proof style that Nintendo uses; most damningly, the Nintendo logo is not present anywhere on the item itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply, a MUST HAVE!","review":"The bottom line is that if you own a Wii, you should have one nunchuk for every Wii remote. Not every Wii game requires a nunchuk, but you don't want to be stuck with out it when a game comes along that offers greater precision and control through use of the nunchuk.In general, the control stick on the nunchuk will allow you to control your on-screen character (ex. Mario Galaxy). However, because the nunchuk also features motion sensitive controls it can serve as your left hand in games such as boxing.Wii is very enjoyable with just a Wii remote, but if you intend to get the most out of your Wii, make sure to have 4 Nunchuks and 4 Wii Remotes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the real one!","review":"Don't waste your money on buying the cheaper fake ones! You'll end up having to buy the original one from Nintendo! Don't make the same mistake I did especially if you have kids because the fakes ones will stop working in a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have, sometimes","review":"I bought this because I was told you absolutely need this to play. And for some games that is true. Not for most of the ones I have though. So yeah, you need it for the second controller you had to buy, but I don't know why they don't package them right. Two controllers and 2 nunchuks in the box with the system. They know you need them anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than original","review":"Nunchuk functions well just like the originals,but underside has matte finnish that improves grip. Very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good and good price","review":"Purchased on Amazon as the price was great and free shipping. Works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I bought this Wii Nunchuk and two days after receiving it it did not work at all. It just went completely dead - it didn't work at all! It was also hard to attach to the Wii remote and stuck horrible while trying to take it out. I would not recommend this product for anyone. I would buy it from somewhere else - it's definitely not worth the headache of returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks for big handed people + it's a ripoff","review":"My main complaint about the Nunchuk is that it is extremely hard to press in the triggers and use the joystick. Nintendo is notoriously bad for this and it is similarly impossible on all their other controllers. For games that make you hold down the z button constantly this makes the game totally unenjoyable. This may be because of the size of my hands, but because I know many people who have this problem it is still a concern. This is a non issue on the Wii mote because there is no stick and so I am much happier with that.My secondary complaint is on the fact that it is not included with the wii mote. Most games require it and I think it's a ripoff that their separate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nunchuk for more players","review":"We got this to be able to have more players.Was disappointed that I could only order 1 from Amazon asthey had a limit - but got another one from our local store.Works great and it's fun to play the games with 4 people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong with Nintendo Wii","review":"There is nothing to say bad about this product-- if you are used to handheld vidoe game controllers (PlayStation 2, etc) then they do take some time to get used to - but its great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Add-on","review":"The Wii is fun and healthy. But it now only comes with one remote and one nunchuk so you need to purchase a second set seperately. It is much more fun playing with a second person.

This is not one of those cases.After having this controller for only a few weeks, it rapidly became loose in its movement and spring, to the point that it began to misfire or get stuck in one direction, making delicate character movement nearly impossible. While the reseller was very responsive--when I complained he sent me two more for free--it didn't help that the replacement units also suffered the same fate. Within a month or so, they too lost responsiveness and became worthless.Keep in mind that these were used by a 4-year-old and 7-year-old, playing maybe 3 hours a week, not exactly power gamers. And while you may excuse the problems with the nunchuk due to their youthful exuberance, we used these alongside a \\"real\\" Nintendo nunchuk that had already been in use for the previous 6 months or so. It kept on going strong while the knock-off controllers failed miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knock-off controllers- DO NOT BUY","review":"I bought two of these back in April of 2012; it's now January 2013 and both have failed. My kids rarely use the nunchuk and I am present while they are in use. I believe these failed several months ago because I noticed they had only been using our white nunchuk and only one of them playing at a time (the Lego adventure series games). The white nunchuk is genuine Nintendo and the difference is notable. The joystick has a lot of play in it where the genuine nunchuk has none. The joystick is unresponsive in both of the controllers I purchased from this seller- very disappointing. I DO NOT recommend this product.My kids don't abuse their Wii or accessories and the genuine nunchuk has had no issues so I believe this to be a result of a poor quality (read: FRAUDULENT) product."},{"rating":"2","title":"wii Nunchuk controller","review":"Purchased this as a christmas gift for my son he wanted an extra one for when his friends came over to play.

We've gone through about 10 of them in two years. They work for a few months, then you need to buy a new one.

It is well constructed and will last as long as you be nice to it and not to rough with it.

It was returned to Amazon for replacement. The replacement controller Z button failed after about 4 hours of gameplay.1 had an extremely stiff stick I hoped would loosen over time. It did not, eventually sticking in the down position.2 have had sticks that break loose and eventually become non-responsive.I have purchased the y-wing screwdriver to disassembe Wii controllers in hopes to repair any of these to no avail.

The game really makes no sense. All you do is fly around and pick up things. And the controls make it too hard for my kids to do this so they just fly around and get bored in about 3 mintues. Plus it's boring to anyone who CAN work the controls(You have to use the R1 button I think to pick stuff up). Why not make it either easy enough for kids or interesting enough for adults or both? Anyway there really is nothing good about this game, and I love games. My 7 year old has more fun with Tony Hawk and Twisted Metal Black. This is just not fun at all for anyone.

Keep Rocking Cheap Trick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd made me go out and complete my collection","review":"great cd. although, i was a bit disapointed at the first listening due to the sound quality, but i soon got over it, and i dont even notice it anylonger. after purchasing this cd, i soon realized that i wanted to purchase all of the past cds. i now own them all, including the box set. they are amazing. i really havent follwed the band during the 80's but now i am all caught up.amazing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down the best live Rock N Roll band!","review":"I travel overseas for business quite a bit and always take a CT cd or two with me. Whenever I get home sick and miss hearing some good American Rock...I slip one of their discs in the player. This new disc will definately be making the next trip with me. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face; I defy you to sit still while you listen! The toned down version of \\"Oh Caroline\\" is delicious and showcases the great songwriting and performances of this band. If you want to know where the Goo Goo Dolls and so many of your other contemporary favorites got their inspiration, check out this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Trick at its finest","review":"I just got the album, and only one word can describe it: FANTASTIC. Hopefully this album will place Cheap Trick on the rock and roll pedastal that they deserve. They are truly one of the greatest rock and roll bands ever. Unlike most elder frontmen, Robin Zander's voice has only gotten better with time (a unimaginal thought considering the beauty and power it had on the band's first albums). Every song on the album explodes with an energy that makes me want to get up and run around my tiny dorm room. Thank you Cheap Trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you hate live albums as much as I do...","review":"BUY THIS ONE!!! Incredible. I've loved these guys since I was about 10, I'm 32 now, they still give me the chills! Makes every other live album, by anybody, obsolete. \\"Mandocello\\" is outstanding, a cool \\"acoustic\\" version of \\"Oh Caroline\\", \\"Hot Love\\" blows away even the fine studio version. This album is so great because the performances are technically so good, but there is tremendous energy in them as well and much more depth than other live recordings I've heard.

Fondly remembered from high school, but come on, not now, especially after covering Don't Be Cruel and Magical Mystery Tour. But.....Wow! What a disc. Pump up the volume from the first crunching chords of Oh Claire, through the teenage bliss of Surrender and off you go. There's a great version of I Want You to Want Me, and a rockin' version of Dream Police. If you Want My Love live is wonderful, and so is all the rest.It's amazing how well this music, more than 20 years old, stands up to today's. It's all much better than the \\"boy bands\\" out there today.Rock On Cheap Trick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Trick can still 'bring it'.","review":"As a lucky attendee of the four-night Metro shows from whence this gem of a CD was mined, cut, and polished, I can attest that they did a great job of capturning the energy and power of those shows.Let me sum it up like this - when a song named \\"Gonna Raise Hell\\" can leave a 38 year-old man in tears, you still got it. Bun E and Tom definitely steal the show for this bring-the-house-down finale - a rolling wall of thunder you'll hear nowhere else.I think the disc sounds just great. I've heard comments about some of the songs sounding muddy, or tinny. Rick Nielsen once said that producers don't understand that we (Cheap Trick) actually like to sound a little bit off. Well, if this is off, hey it works for me! I love the sound - it's raw, it's hot, it's heavy, it's Cheap Trick at their live best.Music For Hangovers is the next best thing to being there, and proves that the boys can still 'bring it'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music For Hangovers-What a Cure!!!!!","review":"After the four night performances by Cheap Trick at Chicago's Metro, I thought what in the world could possibly cap those roaring, feavered nights I spent having my ears blasted out by the worlds greatest rock band!Well this album \\"Cheap Trick - Music For Hangovers\\" is it! This is an album that all fans of Cheap Trick should grab right now! Even if you didn't make the shows, you will soon hear the absolute unmatched power Cheap Trick has made world famous at all it's live shows.The selection of songs are just great and the production and order of the songs takes you on one wild ride!I may have to buy another copy of this CD because I'm sure I will wear my first copy right out.Rick, Robin, Bun E., and Tom-Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Simply find any of his reviews and read backwards and you will quickly spot patterns. He generally uses history as a crutch and typically attacks directors and actors directly rather than addressing the actual films - ESPECIALLY when the films might be more politically oriented.His examples are generally trite and frankly you'd be better finding out about this guy's politics before you bother reading anything he writes claiming to be \\"political\\".

The rest depict various nobles and lords, including Edward III and Jean II, even though their armor is not at all indicative of what the rest of the armies were wearing. Worse still, these nobles are shown in fancy types of armor, like crested helms, that even the text admits they would not have been wearing on the battlefield. The text does include some interesting details on command and control and supply logistics, but as a reference on the actual field armies it is thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best bad diving movie ever","review":"Ok, this movie sucks, bad! However, if you are a commercial deep sea diver, or know one you should at least see it once. There is a lot of liberty taken with the way it really is, the laws of physics, and, well, its a movie. That being said, it is the closest thing to the real world of commercial diving in the gulf of mexico that I have seen.

It arrived within 2 days of ordering! Unfortunately, it arrived a total mess. The box was smashed up and had obviously been opened and retaped poorly. The first thing I noticed when I removed Brian from the Amazon box was a rattling noise. Two screws were simply rolling around inside of his clear plastic head! The screws that hold his head together are proprietary and impossible to open, so I have no choice but to ship him back. I did get to try his Demo function, which was OK. His voice is hard to understand due to an inadequate speaker. Ugh!!! It seems clear that this company is selling refurbished products as new. While they might list the \\"refurb\\" part somewhere on Amazon, I have been unable to find it. Is that even legal?? Anyway, it seems like a neat product, and I plan to order another one.

The toy is defective and doesn't recognize or respond to any spoken commands or requests. 2. Brian's personality is obnoxious and bossy. Lets teach a child by insulting them seems to be Brian's main teaching method. \\"I can't understand you.

He is personalized by the owner and has lots of funny jokes and games. I read a review by a person who did not like its attitude but our children are 10 and 13 so the light harted jokes & sarcasm were taken with a very good attitude. (He will tell you that he thinks you must have marbles in your mouth if he cant understand you and ask you to say it again.) He also told our son at 11:30pm he thought it was kind of late and shouldn't he be asleep or some sort. We think he is funny and an incredible teaching toy for this age group too.(we all know it is very hard to find a toy that kids will learn from in the age groups of 10-13yrs!

Last weekend on a trip to Washington DC I got to take alot of shots alonside my sisters Canon DSLR XTI. She has a 10MB super fast 133X speed card compared to the 4GB SDII I use. The 6x optical zoom was plent even in long shots where she was using a large Canan zoom lens. Using medium fine setting the computer viewed shots compared easilt to her Large files. The A710 screen is great and the features are jam packed. This camera easily accomomdates the picky photographer. Next step up is a Digital SLR but I do not see the need unless I wanteds to take lots of shots in succesion. That is were the speed of an DSLR sets them apart.

I tried to restart it a zillion times, only for it to say the same thing. I went on line and found that this is a problem with some canon cameras and now, instead of being excited about having this particular camera, I am completely disappointed.I'm glad others have had such good luck with their cameras.

I gave up having a really small camera for some of the features of the a710 IS. The image stabilization works really well and I love being able to take pictures and video in black and white, and sepia. I think my favorite feature is the color accent.

After using it extensively for the past two weeks I can only assume they must have been comparing it to a Canon 5D. The pictures are excellent. I have compared the pictures to my Canon 30D and I was very impressed. Obviously Canon never designed this camera to be a replacement to a SLR camera with a lens that cost 3 times the price of the A710IS.

I purchased a 2 GB card separately and with 300+ photos at the highest resolution, I have not found it's outer limit. Also, definitely purchase the rechargable battery kit. Their longevity is exponential compared with regular AA batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little camera","review":"We bought this as a \\"toy\\" camera to take candids when out with our young children. Our main camera is a full size Nikon D70 DSLR, which we use for serious photography.This camera certainly fits the bill and holds up well against our reference D70. Although higher resolution (the D70 is only 6MP), picture quality is definitely not as good, but that is to be expected with the smaller lenses and image sensor. Still, colors are accurate, shutter speed is quick, and the pictures are nicely detailed.The image stabilization is remarkably good, nearly eliminating shake blur in quick handheld shots. The video quality is also surprisingly good. The video won't compete with a decent camcorder, but is perfect for catching quick clips of the kids doing something cute.For a reasonably-priced camera that easily tosses into a purse or diaper bag and still produces good pictures with little shutter lag, this is a perfect fit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Camera","review":"Bought this camera to replace an older Canon S30. The S30 is my only experience with digital cameras, so I do not have many comparison points. Our biggest issue with the S30 was that battery life had diminision and buying a new OEM Canon battery was expensive. I did a lot of research prior to selecting this camera and narrowed my search down to the Canon SD630 and A710. We selected the A710 because it takes AA batteries and because of the better zoom. My wife and I are happy with the purchase. The A710 takes nice pictures, we like the extra zoom and we are getting good battery life out of regular Energizer AA rechargable batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy with this camera!","review":"I bought this camera about 2 weeks ago and I'm very happy with the camera so far. It's easy to use right out of the box and the picture quality is very good. I like the 6x optical zoom and the IS really helps with the camera shake, especially when using the zoom. The movie mode is very nice as well. The camera is big enough to feel right in my hand yet small enough to easily slip into a sweatshirt pocket or purse. My two complaints are: the camera ships with a 16 MB SD card-which is a joke, and battery life seems fairly short. Investing in rechargables would be a good idea. I'm now using a 1 GB Ultra II SD card with great results. Overall, I'm very happy with the camera and I'm still getting to know it.I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon A710 IS - does what it is supposed to","review":"Quick response time.

There were no blurry pics and when I printed all my pics- they were crystal clear and the colors so vibrant.The camera is a good size-fits comfortably in your hand but not too small like some of the cameras out there. The flash charging time between pics is pretty fast, a few seconds in between. The LCD screen is more than enough-you don't need any bigger than it.A great camera for its price. I recommend buying a larger memory card though- the one included w/ the camera only hold about 16 pics."},{"rating":"1","title":"black screen failure","review":"I ordered one in December 06 it arrived with a black viewfinder.

While it worked it made nice pictures. Most of the time however, it did not take pictures. It just made black rectangles. Incredibly I recommended it to a friend. After a few weeks, theirs also stopped taking pictures and only made black rectangles.

That's my \\"get serious\\" camera. But I can't always lug that thing around. Besides, people are even more camera shy when they see something that looks like serious equipment pointed their way.I needed a small camera to take with me when my full-sized SLR wouldn't be practical. Amusement parks with high-speed rides and mountain trails come to mind. But I didn't want to go too small, because really tiny cameras tend to be fully automated. I want to have some degree of control over the shots I take. This camera fills the void quite well.As an IT person, computer equipment getting smaller and cheaper all the time doesn't surprise me. But for some reason (cameras enjoy the same trend as do other electronic products), it amazes me that this camera is way better than my old digital Olympus Ultrazoom (2.1 Mpix), which cost me a couple hundred more way back when.Conclusion: It's great for the price. No complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera great price","review":"This camera works very well. The IS helps a lot. The resolution is plenty. The camera is fast when not using the flash, otherwise there is a 3 second delay between shots when using the flash. The batteries seem to last a long time. I was surprised by this. I've taken a couple hundred in the last month and I changed the batteries but I bet I could have kept them in there longer than I did. Just two batteries which helps the wait.

The picture quality is amazing and the camera is very easy to figure out how to use. I like the fact it has AA batteries so it's easy to replace when you're on the go. It does go through them farely quickly, but it's worth the extra couple bucks on the batteries. We have rechargable ones so when we are at home or something, we can just charge them up when they get low. I/we LOVE this camera! It's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good But Not Excellent","review":"I went through the G-series of PowerShot cameras and was probably an owner of one of the first batch of G1s that were imported. Still love them, especially with a 420EX Speedlight mounted on top. Alas, I needed a pocketable digital camera so went with the A710IS. I get excellent pictures from it, even on Auto, and the several non-photographers I've suggested it to are amazed how many more excellent shots they get. ITS THAT GOOD.I have two beefs with it. Pocketable means pocketable: 1) the need for an add-on flash because the built-in one is only good for 11 feet instead of 18 feet. 2) the need for a case because the LCD doesn't reverse for storage like others in the Canon product line. Canon does not have it quite right yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"20 minutes of use = \\"lens error, restart camera\\" DOA","review":"I was really excited to receive the camera after doing several months of research.

I bought it because I wanted to use rechargeable AA batteries; the battery life is very good. The stability control works very well, pictures taken from within a moving car were not blurry at all. I also like the manual mode. You can set it on a tripod and take pictures with long exposures, in near darkness, that come out great. With 7 MP you can really enlarge the image without loosing detail.

Gotta read it's User's manuals...it does have some lags, I give it a 4 stars but all in all...it has been fun using it. The zoom, the image-stablizer, the different photo shoots... easy for the inexperinced photographer.

I was really worried about buying a new one, as the reviews are all over the place.I am so pleased with this camera! The features are awesome. I LOVE the features and am having fun using it.The only problem I have with the camera is the lag time between pictures which gets longer as the batteries get worn down. But with just about every camera I have tried out, in this prices range, they all have a longer lag than I would like having a fast toddler to try to capture :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good General Use/Enthusiast Camera","review":"The A710IS is a really nice camera in that it really packs a ton of features into a relatively small body. It is not tiny but still small enough to fit into a winter coat pocket. It has all manual overides or can be set in the auto manner for full automatic usage for those not familiar with photography. The IS feature is very helpful, allowing about 1-3 more stops. A nice feature is the \\"grid\\" overlay on the viewing screen allowing for better composition and leveling of images.Image quality is good, not great.All in all, for a point and shoot that has some advanced features, I would rate this a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very blurry Optical viewfinder","review":"The Canon Powershot A710 IS that I received had a horribly blurry optical viewfinder. I wondered if it was just mine, so I visited some local stores. The A710 at the local stores also had blurry viewfinders, but not quite as bad as the one that I received. I searched the internet and found others who experienced the same problem.I've looked at Pentaxs, Sonys, Kodaks, and Fugifilms, and all their viewfinders are very sharp.It looks like Canon has a quality control problem with this camera.I returned mine for refund due to the defective viewfinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a Grip!","review":"I picked this camera for a lot of reasons, not the least of these being that I have rather large hands and needed something to \\"HOLD ON TO\\".

It could be a little bigger for ease of handling, but I am getting used to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good bang for the buck, but keep extra batteries handy","review":"I was originally going to get the A630 but then Canon introduced this camera that had better optical zoom plus the Image Stabilizer feature. I also like that it has a bigger LCD screen than my old A75. The buttons are placed a little differently, and it feels slightly flimsier but overal it's a good little point-and-shoot with a great deal of features that I'll probably never use.My only real complaint is that it uses only two AA batteries instead of the four that my A75 had. That means that the flash recycle time is much slower. It also means that the camera runs out of power much quicker. Keep extra batteries handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera, hard on batteries","review":"Overall a great camera and glad I bought it from Amazon. Came in during the Christmas Holidays with no problems at a great price. My only recommendation is anyone buying this camera should strongly consider geting the NiMH batteries and charger. I have been using regular Alkaline batteries and they don't last very long, in the first week I burned through 10 normal batteries. It is my option the camera should have been designed for LiPolymer and too bad it can't be adapted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Wonderful camera with one big mistake: The viewfinder is separate and not through the objective/lens. Due to the resulting parallax it is not at all suited for close up or macro photos.I had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Camera / Great Price","review":"This is my third digital camera, and it's by far the best. Great set of features with aperture and shutter priority, full manual, 6X optical zoom, 7 MP, and image stabilization. There just isn't another camera out there with the same features. Feels good in the hand too. I'm particularly impressed with the speed of operation, especially when using a high-speed SD card, and with the image stabilization feature. I've been able to take good quality shots without a tripod at the 6X optical zoom setting and the shutter speed as slow as 1/30 of a second. That would be impossible without stabilization. All in all, I think it's a great camera for anyone who doesn't need a SLR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"I had to return this camera because it only worked for two days, then would not turn on.

I did not want one that would overwhelm me. I read the reviews that Amazon had and decided on the Power Shot A710IS. My camera has all kinds of extras - but, what I love about is that it came with a very easy to understand \\"Basic Camera User Guide\\" and also an \\"Advanced Camera User Guide\\". I will probably never pick up the Advanced to read, but I did read the Basic in a few minutes and was up and running with my Camera. It takes great pictures!! Downloads easily to my computer, etc. It is wonderful. Very easy to install the software on my computer for downloading. The only thing I didn't know was that it came with a small 16M memory card for pictures - so when I started taking pictures, it told me \\"insufficient memory\\" with only 6 or 7 pictures taken. I thought I had done something wrong. But, I bought a card with lots of memory and am having a ball!!

I can see all my handbag options easily and they aren't piled up in my closet floor.The only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the product could stand to be another 3-5 inches wider. Since my handbags are slightly wider than the opening, I simply put the empty ones in upside down so that they don't collect dust inside them.

I have large bags because I have a baby and a preschooler so I always have diapers, snacks, first aid, change of clothes etc along with my personal items. This holds most of my bags, except for my super huge mama purses. For example, I wear COACH purses, the \\"glam totes\\" of course are way too large, my duffles are too large, but my kristin hobos, chelsea ashlyn hobo, legacy ali, those are all large bags that fit.

(of course we had to do something to warrant a spanking.) after a couple of years when we'd get them we wouldn't use them. my mom would put it in the drawer, anyway, and tear the ball off when it was time for a spanking.this is a terrible toy. mean kids used it to hit the ball against little kids [my sister was 5 years older then me]. even when you use it properly the ball will sometimes hit you, and sooner or later it will find your eye.this toy is an accident waiting to happen. you wouldn't give broken glass to an infant so why would you give this to a young child. it's not really even a toy. it may have been created by a dungeon master."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE !

The circle they have to put your finger and open the tap is at the bottom of the present making impossible to open it without damaging the paper.I managed to open it and my son was happy until we reached pages 8 and 9 where Spongebob gives a present to Sandy. The door at Sandy's place was bend and there was glue under the flap. As soon we tried to open the flap I discovered the paper was not attached to the book! There was glue keeping it there. On page 8 again the flap for the card is not attached but glued and when you remove it you can't read everything because the second layer of paper in not correct positioned.

This may have been the correct decision for her (I hope that it was) but I find it unconscionable for her to suggest that other women do the same.

Their sound was unique and different with their edgy blend of pop-rock,reggae, some faint punk-ska and various audio samples.There was a definite underlying tone of the Clash (Mick Jones) with a more pop vein geared towards a tamer version of the Red Hot Chili Peppers without crossing into Beastie Boys territory. You have to admire a group of guys who did take experimental bounds and leaps to create a unique and different sound that did not fit the typical new romantic or new wave format drowning the airwaves during that time period !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten Greatness","review":"I never understood why this album(it was vinyl when I first owned it) was not more appreciated. The sampling was terrific, though it's probably illegal or too expensive to do today. They had a great sound and provocative lyrics. Electronic music has evolved way beyond what was possible when BAD was made, but to my ears, it still holds up pretty well.

I haven't had any durability problems, and I have brought them to Europe twice and across the US several times with no problems.I think they are fairly light for their size. They do get a bit uncomfortable after several hours on a long flight, but i think any over the ear headphone would for me.I have only two complaints, both minor. First of all. the headphone plug is a bit large; I would have designed it differently. This may seem minor, but in an airplane seat it does get in the way, and I worry about bending it if I move.

The outlined and user-friendly layout of the syllabus, with its boxed-in/bolded/starred points really made a huge difference and we saw the starred points ALL over the exam.

The book is just corny and colored with silly statements, like \\"super secret spy agency\\" and \\"Rei, you're the chosen one\\", that make the book even more ridiculous. I'm a big fan of Sujata Massey, but I think she really made a wrong turn in choosing to change Rei Shimura's adventures so drastically. I barely made it through Typhoon Lover because of the \\"spy\\" element. Rei is an antiques dealer not a super agent.

Rei's character is growing older and more complex. Yes she has made a lot of mistakes, but to me that is what makes her more interesting and fresh...i never know how she is going to react! That is what keeps me reading.There is something to be said about the careful description of garment labels.

Limited course selection: I understand that you have to work your way up to the advanced courses but the courses that are available as a default get repetitive after a while.I could probably keep going with this list but after all is said and done, I was disappointed with this game overall. Overall grade: C+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect, Not Quite","review":"I've read all of Emerson's books, and this one just wasn't quite as great as the rest of them. It's hard to find fault with this writer since his protagonist is such a likeable character, living and working in my favorite city, but this was just kind of a downer for me. Eagerly awaiting Earl's next effort. Where in the damp Northwest will Thomas have his next (mis)adventure? I'd like to write Mr. Emerson personally, but don't know how. Please keep us up to date on coming books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, unimaginative, and not at all challenging.","review":"I wish that I had read the Kirkus Review before I read this book. I couldn't have said it better myself. I have to wonder if Earl Emerson is running out of ideas. I have enjoyed all of his books in the Thomas Black series, except for this one and the Million Dollar Tattoo, and this one was a major disappointment. The \\"twists\\" were predictable and too easy, and the \\"who-dun-it\\" left me saying \\"Who cares?\\" I found it to be a very weak story, and hope that Mr. Emerson has some better plotlines still up his sleeve. This one wasn't worth the time I spent, not only reading it, but waiting for it to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"This is the first book I have read by Emerson. Although it's a small book, it was a difficult read. The writing was a bit stale and uninteresting. There's not a lot going on in this book besides rather straight and to-the-point storytelling. There were a lot of characters--too many to keep track of--suffering from under-development.In some parts of the novel, I found it difficult to track who was saying what because the thoughts and/or actions of one character were contained in the same paragraph as the dialogue of another character. A small complaint, maybe. But when carried on over a few pages, this style of dialogue writing is unnecessarily confusing and cramps the novel's flow.I may read another Emerson book, to give him a fair \\"shake\\", but it will be much lower on my reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"It is not a easy and friendly product... it is cost low, but it does not fit the expectations that i had when i saw the details of the product, i do not recommended it"},{"rating":"1","title":"insatifecho","review":"Este arciulo NO CUMPLE CON MIS ESPECTATIVAS,HAY QUE ESTAR CONTINUAMENTE CARGANDOLO.LA DURACION DE GARGA DURA MUY POCO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back","review":"The product was very hard to set up and the set-up disk that came with it was infected with a virus that downloaded on to my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"In love with a CASANOVA!","review":"This book is truly a LOVE story.

He is a big chewer, and he loves to get to work on the quado bone. I get the ginormous. It lasts him about 35-45 minutes (which is good for him).

Also, with rawhide, he has a tendency to chew for a little while and then swallow a big section without having chewed it. Not good upon exit. =0)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone in under ten minutes","review":"While my dog enjoyed this chew very much, he devoured the whole thing in under ten minutes. 40 pound Australian Shepherd that I would not describe as a particularly aggressive chewer, finished the 'average' says much faster than I expected.

It's probably great for small dogs, but too much money for something I wanted to last for much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"dog's favorite chew","review":"This may be an expensive chew (as other reviewers have mentioned), but it is still cheaper than furniture or shoes.

I wanted to add something so I bought this item and it worked! Reaction to sound is great, but you have to adjust it when turning the volume up or down. It filled the dance floor with flashing light which increased the party feeling. The thing gets hot, but that's normal because of the four 60W lights inside. For a better effect and use in bigger rooms just buy 2 or more and they will lighten up your party. There's also a version with led lights but that's a least twice as expensive.

Some of the material is amusing and all of it is infectiously fun. It is interesting to hear him sing 'Palisades Park', the hit song he wrote that started him on the road to fame. Less stellar, is his 'Old Mother Trucker', which is just plain bad, 'Don't Think Twice', a Bob Dylan song that doesn't sound even remotely correct with Chuck's nasal Philadelphia voice and an upbeat tempo, and there is nothing on the planet that anyone, even Chuck, can do to make 'Mr. Sandman' a tolerable piece of music (although it's no less grating than when anyone else performs it.)It is great to know that Chuck is still out there and having fun, and the reunion with Milton DeLugg (\\"and the Band With a Thug\\") was wonderful. Now if he would only bring back 'The Gong Show!'"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good package","review":"This is the latest special limited edition released in the US.

After viewing the film though, i must say i am very dissapointed. Sure the visuals are unparalled and the score is up there with epics such as star wars, but jesus christ what went wrong with the plot. it seems that the main reason of the film is to cram as much reference from the game as possible to keep the fans happy. the story is confused and the action scenes are completely over the top. it was nice to see my favourite characters from the game in 2 minute cameos though. This had the potential to be huge. pity...roll on dirge of cerebus."},{"rating":"2","title":"FFVII:AC... wow... just...wow.","review":"I think it's hilarious that after all the times the release has been delayed, Amazon.com listed the final release date to the year 2025!

In the Japanese version, there's an extra 30min hand-animated (an in not CG) prequel, that was absolutely excellent. It was much better than the main feture imo. Unfortunately, Squeenix (Square/Enix) has decided to screw us over, and not release it over here. Well, to that I say SCREW YOU Squeenix!!

New characters are unoriginal and look like girls. All Previous characters fail to make a decent appearance in the movie. It was short and unexciting. Unfaithful to the game. The beginning tells about the game yet the whole movie leaves unanswered questions to both people who played the game and who haven't. The whole movie is based around Cloud and and a new character Kadaj. Obviously and expectedly he got the movie was about him but he was practicly the only character in the whole movie. This movie is the greatest upset to Final Fantasy. JUST PLEASE LET THE SERIES DIE HERE AND MOVE ON WITH FF. Final Fantasy seven was a great game but please let the ff7 series die off and continue with future ff titles and let final fantasy 7 be FINAL.l"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Not too happy about disc audio.

It's good. The story was confusing as hell because I didn't really play the game, but it's on my wish list now.The action in this movie was amazing. I dug the realistic visuals, but they still weren't afraid to make the action unrealistic. It does defeat the point to try to make fiction so close to reality. That's what messed un Spirits Within. Even though I liked that movie too the second time around with no expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more head scratching.","review":"This edition of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children fills in the blanks of the original DVD release. Plus, violence is not removed in this version. Blood takes its place in this film, and the final Sephiroth battle is downright brutal, yet awesome. I recommend this movie instead of the first release. Plus, the Blu-Ray transfer is awesome to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Special features are not special.","review":"Please note, the bonus features are mostly just documentary footage about the artwork and the music and what makes it Final Fantasy.

Hopefully they do not cut parts out like they mangle a lot of other good foreign films. (blame our wussy fcc, other countries have more violence in movies but less violent crime -- go figure).I will not give away the plot, but if you love FFVII you will enjoy this movie.It was like reentering the game with the familiar characters.The fight scenes were marvelous.I have import films from Anime to Romance and this film is one of my all tiem favorites. Stunnign graphics and cool storyline.Until they bring out a Street Fighter CG movie with AKUMA, make mine Final Fantasy VII.P.S.

I love the extras that the 2 disc comes with but there is something people don't know.The japanese version 2 disc special edition has something that any fan of FF would love to have, it has the short animated film of Final Fantasy VII: Lost Order plus other extras like commentary and such.I feel the U.S market is being shafted a little because of this extras that don't come with ours and I don't like that at all.

The graphics are incredible and the story is true to the FFVII game - it's a far cry from the 'FF: Spirits Within' movie all the Final Fantasy gaming fans were duped into watching.Contrary to another reviewer though, I think it's probably incredibly helpful to have played the game to understand the movie. However, since there is a special feature recapping the game, those who haven't had the pleasure of playing yet (and I highly recommend it - the graphics of FFVII may be outdated but it is one of the best RPG's ever made) will still get the gist of what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great visuals-Horrible story","review":"Like too many modern animated features, this one puts all its creative energy into visuals, which are stunning, while not bothering to have even a semidecent plot or characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning","review":"I'm new to Final Fantasy series and I don't know how the old story was, but this movie is the most amazing animation I've seen for years.

The only thing I'll say about the movie is that if you're a huge FF7 fan, you'll love this movie for sure.I just want to give a warning about the Blu Ray version.It seems that Sony is using very cheap Blu Ray disc cases now. They're called \\"Vortex Eco-Lite\\" cases. These are VERY VERY low quality. They're made of a very flimsy plastic, and the one that specifically arrived to me seemed to be damaged in production, as the case was VERY scratched up and ripped underneath the vacuum-sealed plastic and the front of the case seemed deformed because it bent inwards towards the actual disc.If you're a die-hard Blu Ray collector who wants your discs to be perfectly protected and/or wants a clean looking movie shelf, these new disc cases will disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete Blu-ray","review":"It's Amazing .. so Sharp and looks detail than your DVD.

The plot line is explained better and the transfer for Blu-Ray is freakin' spectacular. Even if you've never seen this movie and don't care for sci-fi that much, get it anyway.

Dont approach this as a \\"movie\\" or rate it really as one. It's an hour and twenty minutes of Nostalgia for hardcore FF7 fans. This film brought the world of FF7 into the new age of technology showing off the beauty that it truly should of been. The way the beginning starts off from the ending, to the tons of easter egg references that make any core FF7 lover chuckle. But like all videogame movies you have to have prior knowlege to understand, and this movie requires you to know every detail to appreciate its value.Try AC out anyway for its fast pace action and overall eye candy visuals.

I have literally watched it 40 or more times and it still hasn't gotten old. I first bought this movie in UMD format for my PSP (original). But finally I decided to buy the dvd format because I have pretty much always wanted to see it on a bigger screen. I would buy the blue-ray version (Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete, I think), however I'm in no mood to pay a bit extra even though my PS3 (original) would play it very nicely. Plus its not really worth the extra money just to get better quality when the movie is great in any format. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves fantasy and role play games. Even if you have not played a single Final Fantasy game in your life, the movie is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"charlesyellow@hotmail.com","review":"This is one of the best dvds out at the moment - a must buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very big dissapointment.","review":"You'll be getting all the information on Fnial Fantasy 7 from most of the other writers, so I'll go straight for the gut. The largest flaws in this movie are the action sequences which are poorly directed and often difficult to follow. I know FF7 has always sported some incredibly bombastic moves and \\"Limits\\" from its characters but this film presents its fight sequences as if they were Dragon Ball Z (which isnt a show anyone should be emmulating in the first place) knock offs. I truly hated these choppy fight sequences, they really marred the rest of this otherwise good film. The poor translation on the subtitles just add to the corny vibe of the fight scenes. I say watch this with this in mind and try to enjoy our FF7 character in updated graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a review of our new release date","review":"Okay, I was fine waiting through October, and even through December when they moved back the date to January 10th of this year. NOW after waiting over 2 years for this thing to come out, I learn I have to wait 4 more years to see it. Square-Enix can kiss my @ss if they think I am going to wait that long. Amazon should pull this item and refuse to sell it. Tell Square to stop screwing with its customer base - I'll be boycotting a lot of their crap until they learn how to deliver in a reasonable time. I mean, in 4 years? They could shoot 20 movies in that time never mind just translate this one. IDIOTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to look at, but boring.","review":"Ok, so we all pretty much have seen this already, why even release it on DVD over here? duh........anyway, I found this movie to be really boring and it didn't make too much sense. The visuals are extremely good however. I'm also not a huge Final Fantasy fan, so maybe that factors into my rating as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"MATRIX XII","review":"ONE MORE movie PLAGUIARISING THE MATRIX.Hence, it's again mainly Matrix fight scenes. Mimicing MATRIX, trying to be THE MATRIX.Dooming what should be a most original cinema experience to the worst FAILURE of STUDIO dumbing-down for commercialism.As soon as I watched the FF7 game scenes, 'Reminiscence,' I took a breath and said: That's it, where was it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This was the worst thing I've ever bought. What I got wasn't even close to what you showed it was. This was just a double pack feature. Nothing like the pictures, packaging, cards of the characters. It was truly disappointing and made me really angry"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST SEE!!!","review":"When I first played the final fantasy series...Final Fantasy VII was the one...It got me hooked on RPG's for the rest of my life!!!I have ALMOST all of their titles starting from VII except for IX...Now about the movie...It is truly sectacular, the fight scenes are breathtaking, the music is flawless, and ths storyline follows up on the game...so if you've never played the game, and watched the movie, i suggest you get yourself a copy and get cracking!!!then it'll all come together...This movie is worth watching, especially for FFVII fans!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Final Fantasy Fans","review":"Hello! I don't reguarly write reviews, but I decided to start since I purchase so many items from Amazon!In my opinion this movie is great for anyone who enjoys the Final Fantasy video game series. It is visually beautiful, the storyline is decent, the music is enchanting (I bought the soundtrack as well), and it's great to see all the characters from FFVII brought to life. If you loved the video game it's sort of a reminicent travel back in time as well, with a few scenes staring Aerith.If you haven't played FFVII and/or not a FF fan in general you might not get as excited as I was about this. My fiance sort of likes some FF games, but hasn't played VII himself, and I'm not sure he would enjoy this DVD as much as I. Some knowledge of the game is helpful in understanding the movie - lifestream, materia, who Sephiroth is, etc. etc.Overall, very beautiful visually and aurally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"I will never regret buying this epic movie! The graphics are insane and the story line just tells you what kind of company Square Enix is: An excellent company that spends several years creating intensely epic story lines that will not falter in years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More is good, but not necessarily better.","review":"First of all, let me say I own the DVD version of Advent Children and love it. So, after finally getting a Blu-Ray player, this was one of the first titles I picked up. I thought the new scenes added to the story and gave it a little more body, which had been lacking from the original. However, they also killed the pace of the movie - I felt that some of the quieter scenes were just jarring where they were placed and broke up the overall flow. Still, great to watch the new stuff, like Tifa getting a bit more action time (at Cid's expense.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Complete\\" Makes a Difference","review":"Advent Children was sort of entertaining when it was first released about 4 or 5 years ago, but in retrospect it was somewhat of a mess. The Advent Children \\"Complete\\" edition does just that, it completes whatever sort of jagged edges the original left behind. There's actually more of a coherent story this time around, and it is quite enjoyable. The bonus features aren't too much to really gawk at, but they are nice. I felt more satisfied with the completedness of the movie so that the lackluster bonus features didn't bother me too much.Seems like the only way one could enjoy the original version was with nostalgia goggles or fanboy goggles. FFVII Advent Children Complete can be enjoyed as its own entity while also appealing to individuals who are enthused with the franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"FFVII: Advent Children Blu-Ray","review":"This is a must have for all Final Fantasy fanatics such as myself! The action is amazing, especially when Cloud faces off against Kadaj/Sephiroth and the music during that sequence is absolutely riveting! Would recommend this a million times over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's finally a real movie now","review":"... as opposed to a really long cinematic. The time added to this version of Advent Children in my opinion does wonders for it. Little more action thrown in which is always nice, but most importantly there's some much needed character and story development.And Red XIII STILL didn't get any more lines, darn it all.If you love FF7 and liked Advent Children at all, or if you DIDN'T like AV because of what it lacked, AV: Complete throws in what the original didn't have and it's all the better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"final fantasy 7 advent children review","review":"this is a amazing movie with so beautiful graphique, event wall disney can't do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Having this movie on bluray was one of the best purchases I've made in a white - great price, fast shipment - very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty","review":"It is a very pretty movie and I enjoyed learning about the FFVII characters. I couldn't quite figure out the point/moral of the story though. It seemed like Cloud was struggling with something, but the ending didn't really make me feel like he'd made progress resolving his issues. Just a big fight scene. Meh. Still a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"One small problem...","review":"This movie is perfect, at least the Japanese version of it. A must for any fan regardless, but the one problem is the english voice overs. I must say, they're horrible. The japanese voices were different and a little more appropriate. Too bad they just couldn't use the same voice actors if they would have known english. The character sound a little stupid in the english version and makes it seem like a cheesy after school special, but the movie itself is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily in my Top 10 movies of all time.","review":"First off let me say this, this movie was meant to bring closure to the game. In a movie like that you shouldn't expect tons of character development.I thought the action scenes were fantastic, very well choreographed. There were many jaw dropping moments. It is true it is very fast paced, but if you watch it twice or don't sit miles away you can catch it all.Also i've never actually played the game, but I plan on playing it now that I saw the movie. There is a nice feature on the dvd for those who haven't played the game. Basically it will run through all the dialog scenes in the game and give you the gist of the story. Also lets you see some of the key scenes and understand the importance of them.In the end, this movie is easily the best cgi flick i've ever seen. I've watched it about 10 times so far and will continue to watch. I could only wish that other companies would take the time and dedication to their fans to come out with a movie like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review Of The English Version","review":"Okay, I do not have a PSP but whnever I try to review the same thing it won't let me. I had reviewed AC on DVD so here I am to rate the english version. I had seen the Japanese version.STEVE BURTON AS CLOUD: Good choice for him. Although he kinda sounded like a valley-girl, he still fit Cloud.QUINTON FLYNN AS RENO: Not bad either. He had some of the worst quotes, though. (Mother schmother it's jenova's friggin head)RACHEL LEIGH COOK AS TIFA: Terrible! I mean \\"dilly dally shilly shally!\\"? Plus she kinda sounded \\"waspy\\".MENA SUVARI AS AERITH: WAY BETTER than her craptastic job at Aerith in Kingdom Hearts 2.BENJAMIN BRYAN AS DENZEL: Pretty good except when he yelled Son of a b**ch at Bahamut.DAVID WITTENBERG AS KADAJ: Hilarious!STEPHEN BLUM AS VINCENT: sweet. cool voice! I wish my voice was as low as his... well mines kind of.SO not bad english dub. Still prefer the Japanese version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting for fanboys and action lovers","review":"While film looks and sounds amazing, the plot is mediocre at best. Fun to watch, but would be boring for those not familiar with Final Fantasy VII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't play FF7, but...uh...THIS ROCKS!","review":"This seems to be in a love-it-or-hate-it category. Myself, I LOVED IT! Amazing CGI, flowing score, and some of the best action scenes since...well..ever. Sometimes the DVD glitched (DAMN YOU, BLOCKBUSTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) but other than that, nothing tore me away from this movie than to get some popcorn. I'd never even heard of FF before I watched the movie, but I got the general gist of it all enough to love it. Square Enix has a very good thing going for them and should probably keep this momentum strong before releasing FF12 (I did some research, OK?) ROCK ON, SQUARE ENIX!! Peace out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too good! Best ive seen","review":"Well this just kicks ass, some ones been watching the matrix. I am so glad they gave this to the guy who made the game, from the first fight the movie just gets better and better. You think how can they out do the last fight scene and then bang, they do, right down to the hour or so long fight that just does not end, i am a computer animation student and create CG for a living , this is by a mile the best i have seen, dreamworks etc are so far behind Square Enix in fact everyone is. I cant just explain what your missing if you dont get this, its just brilliant and pure genious of the imagination, buy it, u wont regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only two words... The Best!","review":"It was very sad when I read in a P.S.M. (PlayStation Magazine)that it comes out in August I went to the store... The Cashier laughed at me! and said \\" It comes out next year!\\" So I waited, and waited, and waited. Then Finally... April 25th! I got it and put it in my bose and watched it. Astounding Graphics that will leave you in Awe. And also pro voice overs and some of the best Actors.(Steve Burton, Rachael Leigh Cook, etc.) And does follow the game, and you even get a fantastic veiw of Jenova, unlike in the game when you see about a minute total in the whole game. I was amzed after the movie was over. I couldn't belive what I just saw. The best movie ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"If you have ever played the game, you probably had a few questions at the end. This box set contains some of the answers...a must for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need understanding of FF VII, but great movie","review":"This CGI movie is a superb presentation of the legendary Final Fantasy genre. Below are my minuses and pluses (minor spoilers ahead):Minus: Movie focuses almost exclusively on Squall and Tifa, others (Barrett, Yuffie, etc.) have primarily cameos. While the movie explains the backstory, it can be confusing without an understanding the FF VII plot.Pluses: 5.1 Dolby Digital Sound. Lots of bonus features. Superb CGI graphics. Great Nobuo Uematsu soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"English version out March of 2006?","review":"This is a stunning movie any way you look at it. I spent more than 100 hours on the game but think this is stil a good movie even if you're not an origional fan. I have it in direct tranlation, 'correct enlish grammar' translation, and heard the fully english version will be out in early 2006. They are redoing all the lip animation so it will not be an english dub. Can't wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had no idea what was going on","review":"I played through 1/2 of the game a few years ago (it crashed half way through). The DVD comes with a recap of sorts for those who want to refamiliarize themselves with the original plot, or for those who didn't play the game. After that, you are thrown into a flimsy (if not absent) plot with no character developement (the hallmark of Final Fantasy games). The musical Score was amazing, and I highly recommend the CD, but as for the movie, I watched it, and have no idea what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, this movie sucked.","review":"I can't beleive a lot of people were waiting years for this piece of junk. This could of been released in a week. Don't they know the Matrix got old already? This is nothing but stupid unrealistic action with people literally flying and the slow motion to boot. Advent Children is no where near as cool as it thinks it is.Bottom line, this movie has disappointment written all over it. And even hardcore Final Fantasy 7 fans who won't admit it, will get bored of it soon. There is one scene that stands out as even more ridiculous than the rest and that's hard to accomplish trust me. It's where cloud jumpes into the air and flys up for miles and miles I mean the scene takes like 5 minutes. It gets better the other FFVII characters all happend to be on higher ground and as cloud reaches each one of them, they give him a hand by grabbing his hand and tossing him up higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Recommended","review":"If you want a beautifully animated movie with no sensical plot whatsoever, then this is for you. Don't get me wrong: I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan, and have been awaiting this with bated breath. However, it was a sorry disappointment. The plot was awful. I don't want to go into detail for fear of ruining it for those who haven't seen it, but they rarely discussed the plot with any detail and barely brushed the surface of it, which caused a lot of confusion for me and the others who watched it with me. By the end of the movie, I still didn't quite understand what had happened.All in all, I don't think it was very well thought out. It just seemed like an excuse for cheesy battle scenes and to grab a bit of cash from Final Fantasy VII fans. If you're still interested, I suggest renting it first, because I feel like I totally wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"So absurd","review":"instead of using a PSP emulator on the PC... noinstead of remaking the game on a new console or PC with added values ,noit's all ridiculous, that's my opinion...more consoles then games i always say..."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 star CGI, and NO storyline","review":"If you are a PS2 Final Fnatasy gamer, then you'll most likely understand this movie.Otherwise... continue reading.The CGI in this movie is just amazing. Of course. It was done with Maya 7 Unlimited with custom plug-ins. But, the storyline was so weak that it didn't make sense in making a movie.Even Appleseed which had \\"3D anime\\" concepts, had a better storyline. It was average, but 100 better than \\"Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children.\\"I give this movie 2 stars because of the CGI. If that wasn't a factor most likely would be 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"There were way too many pointless and utterly unrealistic action sequences and not enough plot development. It felt like it was just thrown together, as it hardly made any sense. The CG is very nice to look at, and the music was good, but that's about all AC has going for it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE TO LOOK AT, BUT THATS IT!!!!!!!!","review":"No doubt this is one beautiful movie to look at, that's where it ends. Fight scenes are so fast and all over the place you cant even keep up, it's flashing pictures going so fast it gives you a headache!!!!! And the plot, let's not even go there, because unless your some Final Fantasy Zombie Fanatic you dont know whats going on, you feel like you walked in the middle of a story and your job is to figure it out. Sorry but unless your part of the Final Fantasy Zombie Fanatic FAN BASE you might wan't to stay clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good actions scenes, but a very Retarded storyline","review":"I am honestly a persons who likes sci-fi movies, but the bad storyline and stupid script in Advent Children makes it a total waste of your money.There are MANY parts in the movie that will make you question whats is going on ? and what is the motive for evil characters actions ? You will leave this movie still scratching your head for answers !!!I recomend that you buy Kung-Fu Hustle instead. Its a lot better and it has some CG animation in it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in stupidity.","review":"I have played final fantasy 7 for hundreds of hours, loved it and consider it one of the greatest story driven games ever. Final Fantasy 7 stands taller than any other turn-based RPG. So, I had high expectations for the movie. It was a huge letdown. The characters seem to have far less personality and dimension than the game's characters. The events seem to have no cohesiveness - even understanding who the characters were it wasn't clear what their motivation was. The CG was superb technically but it seemed like some of the environments were inspired by later Final Fantasy games (too heavily doused in Japanese pop culture). In the end it just seemed like the director tried to generate interest by blasting the screen with ridiculous fight scenes where no one cares of the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone understand any of it?","review":"Sure it was visually stunning and more movies should be made like this, but the story went pretty much nowhere. I am not a fan of the FF franchise, but one of my best friends is and loved FF7 the game, and even he agrees that this movie made absolutely no F'ing sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"If You have never played the game Don't bother watching the movie The Reminiscence of \\"Final Fantasy VII\\" featurette sucks it tells you the story but shows no boss battles The battles I wanted to see were the battles with Bizarro Sephiroth and the One Winged angel Safer Sephiroth. I'm also a little disapointed they Didnt show Bizarro and Safer in CGI either but other than that it's a great movie So Go get some popcorn and take a ride down memory lane with Cloud and His Friendsthis movie is great for teens too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"play the game and then watch the movie","review":"Most people will not know what is going on like some of the comments that were posted already because they have not played the game and find it confusing. However fans who have played it will be able to pick-up from where they left off from the game.Even though each FF series is basically the same but the characters are different and definitely better than the latter FF series. Since this is a sequel to the game FFVII it brings finally brings closure to the story for those of us who were left trying to find more info on it. Also there is an anime included. The anime tells beginnings of Cloud in the militia. This movie is awesome hopefully they'll have one ready for HD. But I recommend everyone to play the game it's available on pc or ps2, do a search."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD DEAL!","review":"AT $9.49, this is a smoking deal!!

The differences aren't very big, but the inclusions of Last Order and the \\"Novels\\" for Denzel and Tifa which up until now were released in Japanese only, plus an all-new novel based on Barrett just for North America are just too much for the FF fan to resist."},{"rating":"1","title":"why?","review":"...........thats really all i can say about this. it hasn't even been a year since the special edition came out and they are already trying to milk it for all its worth. from reading the item description all your getting is a new cover and a couple of cheap little bonus items, like postcards, amazing. i'm a big ff fan, but i just can't recommend this. just save some money and buy the special edition. you can probably buy it for about $10 and get the exact same experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is this suppossed movie?","review":"This is total(place imaginative word here)! Where is the movie? I ordered it before it was to come out in 2006 and now it says 2010! Thats NOT what I ordered. Who orders a movie 4 YEARS BEFORE ITS PUT OUT!? No one! Thats why it is incredibly stupid that they pushed it back! I urge others who ordered it to write and ask whats going on. Dont order this movie from Amazon because you could probly find it out EARLIER somewhere else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Fantastic, but where is the plot?","review":"The visuals in this film are astounding. Everything else is awful. The plot is pretty much nonsense and full of holes, the script is terrible and cheesey all the way through. The acting is just as bad. There are a few tiny redeeming features but the badness of this film by far exceeds everything else. The characters couldn't be any more self-involved unless they were in a soap opera.Don't even try to show it to people who haven't played the game, they won't get any of the in-jokes and will only understand 1% of the film.The biggest wasted opportunity of recent times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously vapid fan service","review":"This is just a CGI display of anime cliches and pointless fan service. FF7 is one of the most overrated things, ever. The story is about as captivating as the lyrics of a Helloween song. The characters are soulless, cardboard-like creatures, masquerading in hideous costumes and spikey hair to influence thousands of cosplayers to further fail at life. There was this scene where the characters were throwing Cloud in the air to hit some flying monster or something, as they issued him sunny encouragement like \\"no giving up!\\" I just sat there in awe of the stupidity on display, wondering how this cinematic jello inspired its own subculture."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie's a mess","review":"The animation is great but the film has no story. I purchased this to view the graphic beauty but came away empty. It is not too deep to understand, just disjointed sort of like a group of clips put together as outtakes and assembled to make a sort of story. It may make a good rental if you're really into animation but don't expect to see Final Fantasy The Spirit Within which has a superior story and voice acting but not quite as realistic an animation style. I would give Final Fantasy VII Advent Children five stars for animation and just about zero for story. That equally a one star movie to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's only a movie ... not a game","review":"This is just bad as a movie and you can't play it like a game. (I'm a big fan of the games.)Is there a plot here somewhere? It seems like the Final Fantasy games have more plot.There are lots of battles and chase scenes, but they are just fluff.It seems like the big draw of this is supposed to be remembering the game and the characters from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. What a waste of time.","review":"Seriously, The Spirits Within was a better film than this circle-jerk fanservice fluff. One-dimensional characters, a paper-thin plot, and action sequences that could cause even the most lacadasical person to go into epileptic fits.Your money is *much* better spent on the awesome soundtrack by series composer Nobuo Uematsu and his band The Black Mages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"This movie is horrible. You wait so long and it's this disappointing. The graphics are amazing and that's about it. The storyline is horrible and it is BORING.

I would not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"I have had this movie for only one day, and I've watched it three times. It brings some closure for fans of the game, but people who haven't played the game can enjoy it too. The Cinematography is amazing, and beautiful. The music is enjoyable, too. The fight scenes are intense. I'll never get sick of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for FF7 Fans","review":"If you haven't played the game at all, or even worse, have never played an FF game in your entire life, then this film will be terribly confusing for you. But on the other hand, if you are one of those fans who possible loves the game more than any other one you own, and does understand what happened in it, then it should be perfect for you, as it was perfect for me ^^As for those who say it has no plot.. please either actually play the game or try and watch it again to get a clearer idea of what's going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love FF7...","review":"This film rocks on so many levels. I'm so happy it's finally being released in the US. I dled a copy and watched it 2 times in one nite. The graphics are amazing, and the story is top notch. Thank God they didn't fall into the Spirits Within conundrum. The characters are strong and the effects are amazing. If you like movies with crazy fighting sequences this is one for you.

The detail of the CG is simply lost in translation to DVD and kind of ruins the effort and time put in by the animators to make this worth such a long wait. If you're going to watch Advent Children, you HAVE to see this version or you simply will not have the full experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusingly pretty","review":"I'm not a fan of the Final Fantasy games, so this film was not a trip into a familiar fantasy world for me. I DID see the previous deeply flawed \\"Final Fantasy\\" motion picture. Like that film, this one has a number of story and pacing problems.I tried. I really did. I have a number of friends who absolutely LOVE the FFVII game that this film expands upon. I'm afraid it just didn't keep my attention.Sure, the animation is top notch, and many of the film's moments are arrestingly unique; but I just never connected to the dozen or so central characters. Too many subplots, too many characters, no central focus to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"I don't really know anything about Final Fantasy, but I LOVED this movie!

Go see this movie, you wont regret it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to Midgar","review":"With Advent children you return to the city of Midgar and get to see old reunions come once again, and it is sooo good to see the old folks in a new style. This is one GREAT movie, what Square might have lost with Spirts, they will make up for it with the Children. This is the movie SquareEnix should have released first. Everything is great, and the battles are simply...AMAZIN! Must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but disappointing.","review":"I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy. Need to say that first. But I'm also a huge fan of film. And aside from Advent Children's technical brilliance, the story and dialogue are sorely lacking.The dialogue is in places laughably bad. The story straightforward and its metaphors cumbersome and obvious. Its creators somehow made me feel LESS invested in the characters I loved while playing the game.It's a brilliant technical achievement, but so little attention was paid to telling a coherent story or crafting entertaining dialogue that in the end I was just hoping it would stop.I can't imagine anyone who hadn't played the game understanding or caring about this at all. As someone who did play the game, I'm left sorely disappointed.For anyone who loved FF7 and just wants to see the characters again, it might be worth a viewing. For everyone else? Meh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I was really excited about this as I grew up playing FF7 on the original PlayStation when it came out. Unfortunately like a lot of Anime this suffers from a complete separation from the game besides character names. The art was ok but I expected better, and the story is disjointed and doesn't make a lot of sense, and the characters are rather undefined. I've spent my life playing FF games so I expect the disjointedness between FF games but this was billed as FF VII so I expected it to tie in a lot better instead I felt completely let down by this."},{"rating":"1","title":"nope,no way!","review":"this really is.......rubbish! im a big fan of all the final fantasy games and i so loved ff7. but the film was a bitter dissapointment.bad-points:- the fighting sequences was just to fast to see what was happining and who was being hit.....bit like kung-fu-hustle with people flying though the air and all other bizzare things! theres no or little magic no summons(which i was expecting) you see very little of sepheroth?all in all i would wait till its in the ?3.99 bin at your local off-licence!! and even then its a rip-off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for every FF7 fan","review":"The only thing that would be better is, if the movie were on a BlueRay-Disc and not on a DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely entertaining for fans with extras!","review":"Well if you haven't already seen the movie then definitely watch it if you played the Play Station game.

And we thought with some of the other big names in it, it would be extra good. Even most of the amazon.com reviewers liked it. What a mistake! This is one of the most \\"going nowhere\\" plots of ANY film we have ever watched. There is absolutely no character development, which is a shame because Coburn's and O'Conner's characters could have been outstanding. Even the score by Roger Miller didn't work well. It struck us that it was trying to be another \\"Cat Ballou,\\" but just didn't make it.

It was created in the 19th century, when costume history was at its beginning and it reflects all major faults of the researchers of that time. Many things, claimed to be true at that time, are now proven to be completely wrong. Personally, I have found some blunders in this book. So, if you want to do a thorough and accurate research for your costume, refer to the modern researchers, authentic paintings and manuscripts. Definitely not this book. It is like using 14th century manuscripts for studying modern English.But if you want to compare the work of modern and Victorian authors - go ahead, this is a wonderful example.This book can also be quite suitable for those, who are interested in theatrical costume, where looks come first and authenticity does not matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for collages, not for research","review":"This book is a picture-book of nineteenth century visions of historic costumes, possibly aimed at nineteenth century people interested in costume parties or plays.Do not be fooled by the detailed nineteenth century engraving work or the look of these images. They are not old. They are not accurate. They are perniciously, convincingly realistic-looking, thanks to Victorian obsessiveness about fussy little ersatz details. They are not to be relied upon.Thanks to that very fussy nineteenth century engraving style, they are very useful for collage art. They might also make a fun coloring book.But rely on them as history? Only if you are interested in the history of late nineteenth century German romantic fantasies about the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please remember that this is an inexpensive picture-book, not a comprehensive reference","review":"Seems like you either love this book, or you hate it. I appreciate it for what it is: cheap. It's a Dover book, which means that it throws a bunch of pictures at you for a relatively small price. While I would love to own a full-color copy (with complete text translated to English) of \\"Die Geschichte...,\\" I have yet to find one. I would imagine that it would be pricey. It is true that this book is not 100% accurate. It is, however, beautifully illustrated and it gives you an idea of the general style of the time period, and (perhaps more importantly) the region.

On the way they run into some trouble, with a guy who looks like Fidel Castro after them and some bar thugs try to stir up trouble. There isn't really a hijack in the whole movie, but there are plenty of pointless action sequences, like when a random blue pickup tries to run a semi off the road. Notice the pointless two bales of hay in the back of the truck. Also notice how it randomly explodes after being run off the road!

This book is so interesting and accessible and I immediately clicked with his ideas and approach. Yalom comes across as very knowledgeable, explaining and challenging theories of psychology and how they support or contrast to the existential approach. He offers much practical advice and food for thought. The book is very enlighting for parents in regards to how children perceive and deal with death. There has not been enough written on that subject. I have almost finished reading the book and when I do I plan to start reading it all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yalom's diluted existentialism","review":"Yalom is a fine writer, but his encounter with existentialism is piecemeal and often un-understanding. He seems to think that just dealing with certain *themes*- death, meaninglessness, etc. makes him existential. It doesn't. Existentialism is not just a school of thought that looks at these things, but it also includes a very special *way* of looking at them called *phenomenology.* Phenomenology is a research method and way of understanding human beings that is indispensible for true existential thought. It is phenomenology that makes existential psychology *better* at understanding human beings than other psychologies, and without phenomenology, \\"existential psychology\\" is nothing more than, as Yalom himself suggests, a psychodynamic theory with a different clinical focus. This is pretty watered-down stuff, and readers would be better off reading true existential psychologists like Medard Boss, and, more recently, Louis Sass."},{"rating":"1","title":"George Jones Collection","review":"Just a poor collection.

Chaz Palminteri was good, almost too good to be Paul Castellano. I was disappointed about the use of old film from the 30's to represent the past. It had Carlo Gambino working for Vito Genevese, which is totally untrue! Plus Gotti's character was wac. Its an ok movie if ur that bored, but I should've known better than to buy it...I know one thing, I'll never trust u people and ur reviews again cause ur all crazy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why bother","review":"The title for my review says it all this movie is shocking. chaz wots his name doesnt look a tad like castellano. The movie makes out as tho neil dellacroce and castellano are best friends where in fact they didnt like each other. How can people watch this movie. I saw it on sky and I didnt like it one little bit.Apart from castellano not looking 1 bit like chaz wots his name, gotti didnt have a big part in this movie I mean after all the guy killed castellano he shud have co stared in the movie. Also gambino looks a lot fatter than the real don carlo.There are so many points i cud pick at but why shud i bother abusing this movie when it wasnt even worh having the idea for this movie. one good idea go back to storyboards u lowlife movie writers and think to ourselves were u either stoned or drunk or simply off your rocker.JUST DON'T BOTHER"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This is a made for TV movie. Do not expect accuracy or good acting, aside from Chaz in the lead role. The movie focuses a lot on the romance with his housekeeper...in addition to being inaccurate (noteably the details surrounding his assassination) it also jumps around too much and ends up covering virtually no details in process."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GUY LOOKS NOTHING LIKE BIG PAUL","review":"This guy looked nothing like Paul Castellano, but then again it would be really hard to find someone like him. That being said i did not like this movie it was not like the true story it was boring, i recommend you guys watch \\"Gotti\\" that film was much better, this one was a TV movie. Not so good, what really made me hate this movie was the assassination, they did not show when Gotti was communicating with the hitmen threw walkie talkies, it only showed when he saw the hit, plus the hit was just wrong! the gunman walked slowly and shoot him and nobody was around it looked like it was like @ 3 in the mourning. You want the real story, watch Mobsters, it tells you everything with details. That's why i didn't like this film. peace the f**k out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be missed.","review":"This movie is based on a true story of Paul Castellano, who ruled the Manhattan in 1970s with construction unions and real estates funded by the money he earned from the illegal activities of the Gambino crime family. After becoming the head of the crime family, his resistance to involve in drugs and crimes made many people down the chain unhappy. John Gotti was one of them, who later assassinate Castellano and rose to power.The movie is considered dull and slow, but I don't agree. If you are looking for some \\"Steven Seagal\\" kind of action, then just forget it. If you have liked Godfather, Scarface, and Gotti, then you definitely won't mind adding this to your collection too. Chazz Palminteri, just played the role of head of crime family brilliantly. His dialogue delivery is perfect for this kind of movie and role. The movie is real and has some powerful moments. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie on Castellano, how boring.","review":"I love Chazz P. and I can see why he would want to give the other side of the Castellano epic, but man is this movie boring. Castellano has to be one of the most uninvolved mobsters ever to take the reins of a crime family. If you know the history of this guy, than you should agree, and if you don't, read some books about him. As powerful as he was, he sure didn't know much about running a crime family as did his predecessors, which this film doesn't portray. The film also has terrible actors portraying both Sammy the Bull and John Gotti. An insult at that. If you like mafia movies and don't care about the history of its real-life characters than by all means watch it. If you do, skip it, you'd be better off reading a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Based on a True story you can not go wrong","review":"This is in my top 10 best mob movies the acting was great. And the best part is that Chazz Palminteri look pretty much like. Paul Castellano in this movie this movie is also based on a true story which makes it even more great to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing perspective...","review":"Anyone who has seen \\"Gotti\\" should also see \\"Boss of Bosses\\" (or read the novels). The movie is well done, considering its era of production, budget, etc. Paul Castellano, as well as most of the other characters, are quite believable and the movie serves well as entertainment or Mafia education material. In many ways, Castellano was the *last true don* of the Gambino Family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"This video really helped.

Constantly feeding the slides demands a LOT of time. But this device allows you to walk away while 50 slides are being scanned. This could be an hour depending on the resolution of the scan. This freedom is wonderful. I've found no other combination that does as good a job as this combo, the SF200 and Coolscan 4000. On the down side, old slides tend to stick together and try to double feed. Sometimes successfully, so you get double exposure scans. Sometimes unsuccessfully, so the SF200 jams. I've always been able to clear the jams and apparently the motor shuts offs and doesn't burn itself up. This is good.

This CD is a compilation of the airplay hit versions of Bacharach/David songs. They are interesting, but Burt is not playing on them (except for the last song w. Elvis Costello). The original production quality of many of these 60's cuts is pretty rough by today's standards. I was looking for more polished Bacharach-performed orchestrations... If you want to hear Burt play his songs, keep looking thru the CD bin. I did not enjoy Jerry Butler's version of \\"Make It Easy on Yourself\\", which I think is one of Burt's best songs ... The Naked Eyes version of \\"Always Something There to Remind Me\\" is a trite 80's jingle. Why is it so hard to find a CD with \\"THis Guy's in Love\\" on it?

I must admit I had high hopes, but was very disappointed in the storyline which would probably succeed better as a dramatic series on TV (read: \\"Dallas\\".) It could be set in Montana and have lovely scenes evoking the joys of flyfishing. A good ensemble cast could make this an interesting production. Unfortunately, on the written page, it fails for me, because even the joys of fishing are not well evoked and the plot is too predictable. Too bad.

I will go back to those.If you want to read this novel, take it out of the library; you can always buy it later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slack Line Fishing Book","review":"Characters in this book are developed only insofar as each is the same as the other. The dialogue is forced and is too often used to advance the story, which is difficult to find amid the writing gimmicks and the characters' frequent and distracting digressions into self absorption about the most minute topics. A skilled trout fisher must often create slack in the drift in order to make the fly look natural and believable to a fish. In writing, maintaining tension is just as critical. There is no tension in this book, anywhere, especially, of all places, after Alton gets hit with the beer bottle near the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great picture of a vibrant Montana sub-culture","review":"Hull does a great job of bringing the fly-fishing guide sub-culture to life in this entertaining and sometimes poignant modern novel. I live in Montana and am on the fringes of this particular group and laughed out loud and in fondness during several passages. The tragedy near the end of the book keeps it from becoming too sweetness-and-light and kinda shook me up a bit.

The conversations between mother daughter, sister brother, sister sister, father daughter, father son make you understand this family in a way that makes put off reading that last page.

When I finished, I wished I hadn't spent the time. Here's the deal... I hated almost every character in the game. They were annoying! How are you really expected to enjoy a gaming experience when you hate all the characters you play as?What I liked in the game was the deep story, and I loved the combat system. Combat was actually a lot of fun. The graphics were nice too.What I hated involved all the characters and the way they reacted to things. In fairness, there were a couple of characters I liked, like Bebedora (sp?). It may be an unfair comparison, but in games like Final Fantasy, you can go back to various areas, and there's all sorts of side quests and weapons you can get. It gave the Final Fantasy series a lot more depth.Ultimately, this could have been worse, but if they'd just made the characters interesting, it would have been a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't catch the little white lizard!","review":"This game would be really fun, but I'm only about an hour and a half into playing and I'm stuck at the pond where you have to catch the white lizard thing is.

While Ambrose's attempt was noble, for the most part she gave an one-dimensional performance. The directing was okay if somewhat hoaxy and limited at times (I guess I just wanted more). The writing was probably the most horrible part to the movie. There were so many plot holes that caused me to ask, \\"What was the point of that?\\" In the end, \\"Swimming\\" is an okay movie to waste sometime with, but don't expect to find any meaning or profound performances. \\"Swimming\\" is just like Myrtle Beach, nothing really happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinna boring!","review":"This could had been a very good movie but the story is too boring.

The plot consists of various forms of backstabbing and betrayal among the characters with very little psychological depth.

First, the \\"strategies\\" were not invented by him. He does not offer the reader a way to do proper analysis of these techniques. Second, he has no concept of market history (as evidenced by clearly incorrect comments in Bear Market Baloney). Third, the book is written in a poor manner, including the obvious advertising of his products. Profit Financial Corp., Wade's company has had numerous problems with the SEC. What is worst of all is that his company will charge you only $695 to send one of your children to his special seminar. It is so sad that people are motivated by such fear and greed that they do this.As an analyst at a Wall Street firm I can tell you that all of Wade's products are crap.

First, none of the ideas presented are unique. As a Wall Street professional, I must say you will gain very little from reading this book. Any investor should be skeptical of 300% returns. The best hedge funds return 20%+ over long periods. Two, the book offers very little insight into doing the proper analysis in implementing any of the strategies. It is very thin on content. Also, very little is mentioned about the pitfalls to option investing in particular. Even \\"Rolling Stocks\\" can be a quite dangerous strategy as Cook presents it. Anyone should be skeptical when in the beginning of the book Cook promises 25% monthly gains. It is absurd.There are many other books written by people who have made money for their clients.

There are many fine books on investing and a search through the Amazon catalogs under Investing, Stocks, Options, etc. will turn up dozens (or hundreds) of well thought out and well written books by highly experienced people.

In fact, I was tempted to give it a 9, but Cook's plugging for his workshops and on-line service are so blatant and repetitive that I found myself becomming increasingly annoyed and distracted. Since then I've been reading \\"Getting Started in Options\\" by Thomsett--it's very clear, well-written and much more thorough than WSMM's treatment of options trading and strategies.

There are many good books on trading options out there (I'm about to buy \\"The Electronic Day Trader\\"). The only problem is you will need more than a 3ed-grade education to understand them. If you are in third grade, then maybe this book is for you. It's barely written in English, and the type is huge (probably to make it look long enough to be a real book).

I think the whole thing could've been summarized in 50 pages maximum. I was very disappointed. If I wanted advertising, I would get info channel. One whole chapter he talks about how his business is not a day trade and how his feeling were hurt that an interviewer called it that. I was particullarly interested in rolling stocks which was a small portion of the book. I will not buy another book from Wade Cooke. I don't think he is a good writer.

The techniques work; I have personally made 20-500% monthly returns using mostly the more conservative strategies (rolling stocks and covered calls). The seminars are overpriced, but still valuable to nonexperienced investors. I found Wade's entity structuring instructions invaluable, well worth the cost of this book alone.

I mean, I bought a book not a magazine... Three, the book talked about the same concepts over and over again, but never addressed how to PICK A GOOD STOCK to begin with.

Promise readers that they can make a lot of money with little work and retire in under a year. This is exactly what Wade Cook claims repeatedly in his book without backing up his claims with hard numbers. Beware!I am a professional trader and I sell options as part of my investment activities. When you combine the potential for unlimited losses with leverage you are lighting matches in a fuel tank. Do not be lulled into thinking it's an easy, sure-fire way to make money. It takes a lot of time and experience. There are no shortcuts. If you take in $1.00 of premium and the stock drops $2.00, you've lost $1.00, period.If you do insist on trying any of Wade's unoriginal strategies, do yourself a favor and either paper-trade or trade in very small quantites until you develop a feel for what's involved.

This message is for those of you who are not compulsive gamblers and are simply looking for legitimate trading strategies. Don't walk, RUN away from Wade Cook and his methods. Not only are his methods bad, but you will absorb his psychology-- the psychology of market loser. Initiate a position to do a covered call? (a Wade Cook special) get real. Use a covered call to hedge an already establised positon maybe, but it is flat out dumb to initiate such a position simply to collect the premium. This position is called a synthetic put.

That's why he turned to making some real money by selling his grossly super-hyper-overpriced 'seminars'. In any case, most of what is useful in this book is available from much better sources from people who know the business.Incidentally, if you want to have a lot of fun, see the review of this book on the Motley Fool Website.

OK on stock options, but Lawrence Macmillan's OPTIONS AS A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT is much better. Cook's \\"rolling stock\\" concept, his term for buying at support and selling at resistance, works only in non-trending markets. Weak on determining the short-term trend of stocks, essential in buying or selling stock options.

If you're new to investing, though, there's a lot of basics skimmed past or left out altogether. If I'd read this book five years ago I would have been lost.The most annoying part of the book is Cook's endless pitching of his seminars and other services. You'll become very familiar with his 800 number.There's also inadequate recognition of the down side to his methods, and possibility of losing money. If his methods were as consistently effective as his examples, Mr. Cook would control all the wealth on Earth today.I don't mean to be too negative - much of the book actually makes investing exciting.

The book itself is an exercise of baroque descrptions and actions depicting the band members as psychedelic characters travelling through the Universe in a decadent space-hulk, armed with musical weapons.

It does have more pixels;it is smaller in size; and the LCD is very bright. But for the high price charged for the camera it represents downgraded capabilities for top dollar.

First I'd like to say that the lack of RAW format is not a big deal. This is after all a compact, point-and-shoot camera. I get the feeling that the reviewers complaining about the lack of RAW probably wouldn't use it anyway. I think some of them just want to show off how sophisticated they are. I wish the battery could be removed without first removing the quick-release mount. I wish the grip were better, especially a place to put my thumb. The shutter is loud and a remote would be great to have. I use an inexpensive monopod for stability.

Without the external flash it's a compact camera that gives great results outdoors and acceptable results indoors. With the external flash it's not so portable, but the results are terrific. I would recommend a bracket of some kind if you use an external flash or it's a bit unsteady. One other thing--I couldn't believe how great the video results were for a \`still' camera. With a 4 gig card you can fit lots of 10 mp stills or 30 minutes of video.

This camera is wonderful. I won't bore you with the details. It wont cover all of your handicaps but it gets close to making every shot you take look perfect. I bought mine mostly to take strong pictures of my very colorfully rendered and detailed paintings. Being a fine artist I wanted the best quality i could afford. Found it in the G7. Aside from my that, my three year old daughter has become my number one model and practice shot. She's my greatest masterpiece to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent camera...A little bit pricey though","review":"I purchased the Canon G7 to compliment/backup my Canon EOS20D. It is an excellent camera, easy to use with almost all the features you could want. It would be nice if it shot in RAW mode as well as it needs a couple of pads for better gripping it while in use. I temporarily fixed this issue with a couple of pieces of egrips I stuck on the front and small piece on the rear.I think the price is a bit high also. The camera is user friendly and is capable of great pictures in the hands of a good pilot. It has a viewfinder! I don't personally think all these new cameras coming out without a viewfinder is a good idea. The image stabilization is very effective while not degrading the pictures noticeably. I have bought a Sandisk high speed 2gig SD card for it and it has good capacity for a lot of shots. The battery charge life is a bit short so you will need an extra battery for sure if you use it very long at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"Stellar camera - for its features and it's size, there's just nothing in the same class. I wanted something that would give me better image quality and more control than an average point-and-shoot, but wasn't the size of a DSLR. That's exactly where the G7 fits in. It's a bit of a jack of all trades, and though it's not a master of any, it can definitely fake it - I do wish it shot RAW, as i enjoy post-processing, but that's the largest of my complaints. Great quality shots, easy to use interfaces, and a gorgeous camera are what I got from the G7 - I'm not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best I've sed","review":"I bought this camera to replace my Canon Pro 90IS - yes, a dinosaur in today's terms, but great in its day.

The canon G7 does not have a swivel screen but it doesn't matter to me because I have a bada experience with them. The pictures are great, and when taken in manual mode with caution I got some of the best pictures I have ever taken in my life.I basically wanted this camera to be able to use it in school and remember the last years of high school. I wanted a good camera that would not make me want to return it.The only thing that took me some time to get used to is the size.

Then I wondered, if the lenses are sealed the only way a particle of dust could have gotten there was when it was manufactured. Well, I call Canon and guess what; they offered me to send the camera for repair (at my expense) or a refurbished one for $250 dollars.

Being in Colorado at high altitudes, I needed the extension tube for the polarizer at certain times of the day. Once ths is on, you can no longer see much of the picture through the view finder, which you must use in bright light. All you pretty much see is the extension tube. Awful! The other problem is trying to hold it in one hand and take a picture is impossible. With no grip, your thumb goes over all of the menu buttons and the trash button.

It is hit or miss. But the bits that hit, hit the bulls-eye. Tobias can be a wonderful humorist, and his wit is on display on many of these pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"After reading and enjoying The Only Investment Guide You Will Ever Need, I was really looking forward to My Vast Fortune for some insight into what Andrew Tobias did with all the wealth he has amassed. Unfortunately, rather than elucidating his passionate conviction for various social causes, he mostly rants about his ineffectual exploits into auto insurance reform, property management and anti-smoking campaigns, and boasts smugly of his \\"vast fortune\\" as if to belittle the reader. His comparison to Don Quixote is certainly not unfair as they both suffer from delusions of grandeur. As Andrew himself would recommend, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource - comprehensive made simple!","review":"As a psychologist and organizational consultant, I found Dent's work to be quite comprehensive and in a way that is easy to read, understand, and apply.

What would make me happier *hint hint to those at Paramount* is if Roundhouse, the Saturday Night Live for kids-teens, was released. I LOVED both of these shows, (and others such as Wild N Crazy Kids) and I was majorly disappointed when they cancelled each and every one of my favorite shows (or changed them beyond recognition ex:All That) and replaced them with shows that, I felt, were stupid.

It is a fun, cute show that shows a reasonably intelligent teenage girl. It's too bad you have to go to Nickelodeon and Disney channel to find shows about teenagers who are not drinking and seeping around. My favorite extra was probably the Mellissa Joan Hart episode of Cribs. I love her house! It's too bad it looks like they will not be releasing the others seasons on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who she was?","review":"Melissa Joan Hart was totally different back then, before she was Sabrina the Teenage Witch. If anyone recognizes Melissa Joan Hart, they'll remember one person Sabrina Spellman. One person who was Clarissa Explains it all was Joe O'Connor, who played the father of the kid who kidnapped Salem. He also played a Dean, tearing down houses in Sabrina Episode. Two people I know who were discovered in the show was,Dawson's Creek James Van Der Beek, who Clarissa met in a party and Buffy the Vampire Slayer Michelle Trachtenberg. One episode I remember Michelle Trachtenberg in, where Clarissa babysits the annoying little girl Elsie Soaperstein is the same episode I saw in Sabrina the Teenage Witch the doll story. It was the episode where Sabrina babysits Amanda her annoying cousin that was played by Emily Hart, Melissa Joan Hart's sister.

Too many pieces with no place to secure them for the target age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loves it!","review":"My daughter received this as a Christmas present and she loves it.

At first he was a little scared of the sound of the moving gears. But once he got the hang of it he likes it a lot. There is not much educational value to this toy though. He just likes to put the gears off and on and push the music button all the time.He likes to stop the gears from moving by putting his fingers on them when they turn. It is safe enough but he did get his finger stuck in there once so there is a slight safety issue.Also people talk about losing the gears which is a real issue. And yes the gears do fall off when the toy is lifted by the handle so I don't know what the purpose of the handle is."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty, but not challenging","review":"I considered this for my grandson, two years old. When my own kids were small, they had such a toy with gears they could attach with velcro onto a backing, and create their own unique patterns, then turn with a knob. They had hours of fun and created myriad patterns with those. Now, is it just push a button and watch??? And why does the info say it is for three+, yet shows an infant with a pacifier...? hmm I know, I know, times do change. Not sure it is for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total hit!","review":"I bought this for my 1 yr old nephew, and it was an instant hit at this birthday party. The kids swarmed to it and it was played with regularly for the rest of the party. The other reviewers mentioned being disappointed in some aspects, but really - what 1 yr old has a long attention span anyways? - they play with it, move on, come back to it, and repeat! It lights up, moves, makes noise, kids can re-arrange (and stack) gears. Even I thought it was fun to watch. Best part - Hasbro has other 'gear' toys and they all fit. Another Hasbro gear toy was at the party and the kids instantly discovered that the pieces were interchangeable so the gears off the other toy were promptly added to this one. So if you are looking for a gift for a 1 year old, try this one. BTW - Even the 3 yr old was excited to play with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertaining toy for kids of any age, even parents too sometimes!","review":"I love this toy. I saw it at Kohls and purchased it there. I was worried first about little fingers getting in between the gears but you don't have to worry about that. There is a slip clutch built in the system that will stop spinning in the gears at the slightest obstruction. So little fingers are perfectly safe and this toy will never hurt them unless you force the gears to turn by hand which there is no safety device for stupidity! But there are lights, there is music also you are able to stack the gears, the kid has to learn where to place the gears and line up the cogs...etc. It is a great and safe toy my kid loved it at 9 months and he is 2 years old and still plays with it. It has lasted him through all that time so I know it is durable! I would totally recommend this toy to any child boy or girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my son's favorite toy","review":"I bought this for Christmas when my son was 15 months old, he has played with it every day and its been almost a year. When he was smaller he liked the movement and the lights, then he moved on to moving the gears around. Now he likes to take stuff from around the house and put it on the big central gear. I have only had to replace the batteries a few times and he plays with it every day from 15 min - 45 min. I have been looking for some different gear toys for this Christmas but this is a really durable, entertaining toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and keeps them busy","review":"Although I wish this came with a few more gears to build on with, I think this is great.

He can easily manipulate/ chnge the gears around himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Item as described","review":"My granddaughter loves this product.

My daughter loves removing and placing the gears and then pressing the button to see them turn. She loves the colored lights and music as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This was a gift someone gave my youngest son for his first birthday. It is really loud when the gears run. The gears slip out too easily and are constantly getting lost, which is no fun. It should have included some sort of cover with this toy to keep the pieces together when not in use. I don't feel that this toy had much educational value. We have a gears, gears, gears set for my older boys and THAT is educational and really fun for children of a variety of ages, since the kids can build it to their liking and run by kid power, not batteries. My son played with it for about a wk and then had no interest in it, so it went straight into the donation pile. With three kids, we have enough toys floating around taking up space, this one was not worth keeping and IMO not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st time Mom","review":"My son got this toy for his 1st Birthday! It has been one of his favorites since we brought it home! He loves to move the gears around, stack them, throw them (like any 1 year old), and likes the music. It doesn't have a volume button, but I can tune things out pretty well and so it doesn't bother me. Just be sure that you change the switch from DEMO to PLAY when you buy it. It's a sturdy toy. We've had it for 3 months and nothing has happened to it. I high suggest this toy! Great source of entertainment :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Grandson","review":"I purchased this for our 1 year old grandson who is just facinated with wheels. It keeps his attention for quite a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interactive, durable and fun!","review":"Our 21 month old has been playing with this since he was 16 months old and he loves it! Not only does he love putting the gears in place and hitting the button to make them spin, but he has sorted the gears by color, put them in upside down (which works), stacks them, and even puts other toys in the middle section to watch them spin!There are plenty of ways to be creative with this toy, especially by placing an animal figure in the center section and having your child name it or make it's sound and then hit the button to make it and all the gears spin. He has also played with the gears outside of the main unit spinning them, stacking them, rolling them, etc.Tons of fun. You have to keep track of the gears though because they do have a tendency to hide on you! Wish they made a replacement pack!5 star toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite toy for 5 months!!","review":"JP received this toy as a Christmas gift and hasn't stopped using it ever since. He's 14 months now and keeps coming up with fun things to do with the grinds (stack them, change the colors, etc.) and brings other toys to the grinds to see how the other toys turn. He dances to the music and laughs a lot. The songs are fun, even though I've listened to them (at least) a 1,000 times, I'm not sick of them. Great toy, it'll definitely be my next baby shower gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little ones love this toy","review":"For the youngest child, just the lights and motion will delight them. As they get a little older, removing and exchanging the wheels not only entertains them, but they learn small motor skills, too. Durable, entertaining, and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for tummy time!","review":"The box claims that this toy is for \\"over 12 months,\\" but my son has been fascinated by these gears since he was 7 _weeks_ old! We would prop it up against something while he was on the floor kicking around and he would love to watch the lights and gears and listen to the sounds. When he was a little older, it was his favorite distraction during tummy time. He is now almost 6 months and still loves this toy - especially now that he can push the button himself. It also helps teach him about cause and effect because he can stop the gears from moving if he puts his hands over them (and no chance of getting his little fingers crossed). In addition, he loves to take the gears off and and gnaw on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 year old son loves this","review":"I bought this for my son & he absolutely loves it. He likes to twist & stack the gears or turn the board over & dump them all off. It lights up & plays music (not annoying music. I can't tell you how thankful we are about that) so it holds his attention longer than most toys will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"My son is scared of this toy. This toy is annoying even to me! The lights and sounds are ok, but then when the gears start to spin, they are too loud! It's distractingly, annoyingly, obnoxiously loud - not appealing at all. I just want to turn the thing off when they spin and the music is weird like a mix of baby hip hop gone wrong.Second, it has a handle to carry it around. Sounds convenient - however the pieces are loose. So when you lift it to carry, all the pieces fall!.. who designed this thing?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I bought this toy last year after reading only great reviews on the amazon site but was not happy when I got it in the mail. Durable? Absolutely. Educational? Sure. But it did not hold my 15 month old son's attention at all! He lost interest after about 30 minutes but enjoyed scattering the gears under tables and across the floor. I finally had to throw it out because he wouldn't go near it except for the minute it took to turn it upside down and drop all the gears all over the place - then he would walk away (not my idea of playing.) If you have an active child, go with the Hoover child-size vacuum instead. Now *that* is a toy that will keep them busy for hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!","review":"My daughter, 3 years old, was playing with this at a friend's house and her hair got tangled in the gears!Her face got pulled into the board and was screaming while we got it turned off and her hair untangled.

I ordered this and about fell backwards when I looked at the bottom of the box and saw those words I cringe at: MADE IN CHINA.My grandsons (1 and 3 years old) love the gears and the lights. I didn't have to buy batteries (included). But, oh, how I detest the fact that I contributed to the demise of American jobs.I would like to see Amazon add another line on product descriptions to state where an item is made.

Less educational than I would like but overall a fun toy for a 12 month old to play with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, cute, easy to use","review":"My husband brought this toy home on a whim for our 11 mo old. I figured his little fingers would get pinched but that's not at all the case. The minute he grabs a hold of the main gear it stops moving. He likes to play with the gears all alone but doesn't really put them back together on the plate itself. Overall, a good buy, especially because we got it on sale. I suspect he will continue to enjoy it even more as he gets older. Also, it plays two songs and neither song is very annoying, so that's a plus for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've bought two","review":"I bought one when we began having grandchildren. All three little boys enjoyed it and would even take it away from each other when toddlers. When it looked like no more babies were coming I gave it to my neighbor for her grandson. Then along came our granddaughter so I bought another. At first it startled her so I put aside but in reach. The next time she came she wanted it and played with it. The music is peppy and sounds like hispanic dance music - very jolly. The gear hubs flash with primary colors. The gears spin noisily. It doesn't take long for the child to discover that the gears can be removed, rearranged, or replaced. Eventually I showed them that they can be stacked - but that requires some strength. The oldest grandson couldn't really do it until he was four. The toy is inexpensive for all the fun it provides and how well it is made. Make sure you flip the switch on the back once you take it home. The music will play for a longer period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Busy Gears","review":"I bought 2 of these for my 1 yr old grandson and granddaughter. They absolutely LOVE this toy. It's bright and colorful. It \\"moves\\" so it's good for not only hand/eye coordination but also provides visual and audio stimulation.

Great for learning colors!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandmom's opinion","review":"My grandson played with this at other children's houses, so I bought one for here. He loves to play with it, but only for a minute or two. It seems that other children have a similar reaction to it. I'm not sure if it will become more challenging later as he learns to reconfigure the gears, or if it will just be boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son Loves it!","review":"At first I thought my son would get bored with it pretty quickly, but somehow he loves playing with it! He's been playing with it for months now (he is now almost 16m old), and he loves watching me stack the wheels and take them apart himself. Although I wouldn't think of this as the most interactive/educational toy, it certainly lasts for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gears, gears everywhere!","review":"When other reviewers talked about its portability, it led me to assume the gears were more stable. I gave one to my grandson yesterday, and within the hour, one of the gears was missing. As soon as he'd pick it up, all the gears fell off. I was chasing parts most of the day. If I find the missing gear, I shall return this toy.It also doesn't come with batteries, and requires a small screw driver to install them. Cole was more intrigued by trying to unscrew the battery case than he was with the actual toy.This toy made me rethink the other presents I bought for his upcoming 2nd birthday that have multiple parts.Lakeshore Learning carries the type of gears used in the \\"Brainy Baby\\" DVD's, but they're for 3 and up. I suggesting waiting a year and getting their magnetic ones.Now, I'm trying to find some type of container to store his Playskool Busy Gears in, or what will be left of them, by the time I find something today:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise Hit","review":"My one-year-old son absolutely loves this. It's a pretty simple toy but provides tons of entertainment for him and is also a great toy to bring along to keep him entertained in the car.How It Works: Baby pushes the red button on the bottom to cause the center gear to turn, this then turns any other gears attached to the center gear. Lights and music play while the gears are turning. The center gear is permanently attached, all of the other gears are removable.Cons: The motor is pretty loud and makes a loud whirring noise while the gears are turning. The gears can easily get lost since they're not attached."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Toy!","review":"This toy is wonderful. I have a 7 month old son, and I had bought it for him for Christmas. I let him play with it while we were shopping and ended up giving it to him early. He absolutely loves it. He doesn't completely understand the concepts of it, but he loves to take the gears on and off and every time he presses the button, he squeals with delight. His favorite part is to drop the gears back on as it's spinning, so the gear goes from being in his hand to spinning with the rest of them. He can't get enough of this.I highly recommend this toy for any kid who is curious and at the stage where they want to get into and try out everything, even if they're under 12 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"regret buying it","review":"First of all, my son is scared of this toy.

So when you lift it to carry, all the pieces fall!..haha who designed this thing?!Also, those two things aside, I don't know why they made all the pieces the same.

The feeling is gone from this album; it lacks the sincerity of the band's previous melancholic recordings. Prior to hearing this album I had a longing ambition to see Madredeus live on stage, but if the songs and instrumentation of this album are any indication, the band urgently needs to regroup. Frankly, Pedro Ayres Magalhaes, the main man when it comes to the writing of the songs, seems to have become an old fart. Even elevators wouldn't move to this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Masterpiece from Excellent Musicians","review":"Every time Madredeus releases a new album I am never disappointed and \\"Movimento\\" is no exception. Teresa Salgueiro's beautiful voice backed up by excellent playing from Pedro Ayres Magalhaes, Jose Peixoto, Carlos Maria Trindade and Fernando Judice make this an experience worth listening to. As usual, Magalhaes's compositions are superb and Salguiero's interpretations are unique and ethereal. I can think of no other voice that can touch and affect me the way Salgueiro's does. Although I like all the songs on this CD, particular favorites of mine are \\"Ecos na Catedral\\", \\"O Olhar\\", \\"A Quimera\\" and \\"Vozes no Mar\\". I highly recommend this CD to any music fan. If you have never heard of Madredeus before and you decide to buy the CD you will not be disappointed.

Half the Pressure Point album could have been well written in 1999, you won't tell the difference. There are some promising tracks like Now Is The Time, Calling or Blowin Ya Brainz kicking a hole in the woofer, but in overall the new stuff fails on too much subjects, mostly the ever recurring samples from the album We Rock Hard. The Freestylers ran out of money for new effects and sample CDs. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed!","review":"I bought this for my tobacco store.

Not one of the characters is this book was convincing. Marines in uniform at a political convention! Come on. In the forward the author talks about doing research at the White House. Ok, he may have accurately described the oval office. I really was looking forward to reading this book because of the others that I have read and was disappointed.

This was basic, boring descriptive travelogue, repetitious at times, with absolutely no noteworthy or novel insights. But the final telling failure of this book was an element of momentous liberal hypocrisy. Matthiessen chastises the Bush administration for its stance on global warming and places the blame for the impending global destruction at the feet of W, but chooses to ignore his own contributions. Pray tell, how does he justify the carbon emmissions he contributed to the atmosphere to drag his sorry carcass from the Northern hemisphere to Antarctica not just once, but twice? What would he think if the first carbon-reduction agreement was to ban all recreational travel to Antarctica as has been proposed by the Obama administration?

This effort is a mediocre travel memoir of two different voyages to Antarctica and for each trip the author fills the pages with interesting historical, geographical and natural facts. Unfortunatly this book has no \\"heart and soul\\". \\"End of the Earth\\" merely 'reports' two stories on Antarctica as if Peter Matthiessen could take it or leave it. The usual book jacket accolades recite \\"...he blends a vision of harsh beauty, a traveler's love of adventure, and a profound appreciation for the splendors and extraordinary wildlife of a forbidding yet fragile world of ice\\".

The small speakers could be considered a little 'tinny' if you get right up to them, but when placed properly as a whole, the three speakers blend together and sound flawless.

To be honest, I get better sound out of my Altec Lansing portable speaker set than I do out of the JBL Creature.Big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound and decent bass","review":"I got this on sale for $40 and am very happy with it. It does not have a huge sound but the sound quality is very clear for a $40 speakers/woofer set. It's enough to fill a small home office or a bedroom. It's not worth the original $200+ price tag as you can find better deals and louder sound from other manufacturers, but if you can find these on sale (they are discontinued I believe), then by all means get them. They'll be among the best $40 speakers you can buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cubicle, bad for home","review":"It's absolutely perfect for a cubicle with a hard floor and partitions that absorb a lot of bass - this unit is WAY bass heavy. I was going to donate it to Goodwill after trying it in my apartment because it shakes the floor and the walls, but I set it up with the bass unit under my desk at work and it's ideal."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go wrong for a <$50 sound system","review":"I was looking for something to take with me to a summer camp. I have a non-iPod MP3 player, which rules out a lot of the nifty iPod accessories (including portable speakers).Pros - Decent sound for under $50.Cons - Not as portable as I'd like. The woofer unit, while cool looking, lacks a handle for easy transport ... The satellite speakers plugs have have unique shapes to make sure they are plugged into the proper receptables on the woofer, and it took me a minute to figure them out ... These speakers are not as loud as I would like them to be, especially outdoors. If you want to engage in speaker wars with your neighbor, perhaps this is not the product for you.Overall, though, a good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome speaker","review":"This is the best speaker that i have ever had.If you are a poor college student,this is the one that you are going to take"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT Speakers !!!","review":"My computer's sound was just mediocre . . . I checked on the Apple Discussion Boards, and many people over there recommended these speakers. Then I looked at the reviews here. Almost all seemed very favorable.I ordered them yesterday. Got them today. Hooked up in 5 minutes. No configuration, just plug and play. I'm stunned! Now I'm keeping them way less than half-way powered up, and I know the neighbors can hear me three doors down. Sound Quality is excellent as well. I'm thrilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So Speakers","review":"I'm not too happy that I made this purchase for the sound quality is fair at best, and the volume is lacking. I would return the speakers, but the packaging is too difficult to put back in the box, so I will likely be giving the speakers away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speakers","review":"I bought these speakers for my parents and they think they are the greatest things since sliced bread. They do sound good and the price from Amazon was terrific. Why only 4 stars? To my ears, the bass is a little muddy even with the control turned down to a very low setting and compared to the Klipsch Promedia 2.1's that I purchased for myself from Amazon and they do not sound quite as good. However, the Promedia's are much more expensive and physically much larger.

After getting this I'm happy with the price...but I would spend more money on my next system!! Hope this helps..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Speakers","review":"SO I got these speakers as a gift when I was believe it or not 14 years old. For those of you who are wondering that was 9 years ago. I first got them to hook up to a small tv when I got my first xbox my freshman year of high school. Since them I have used them for 3 different laptops and 2 desktop computers and they have out lived all of them. The sound is fantastic for its size and honestly maybe I got lucky but they seem to have aged very well and the sound has gotten better as they wore in. My only complaint so far is that the touch controlls for the volume on the satallite are a little touchy and dont always work. After nine years I finnaly Broke that right speaker while moving and I've enjoyed the system so much I just bought a replacement so I could keep it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All treble and bass, no midrange!","review":"I work with a live sound system installer that has used professional JBL concert speakers for 20+ years. So I was astounded to hear what passed as acceptable for their \\"consumer\\" line. Simply put, the subwoofer puts out deep bass, while the two little speakers put out a mid-treble range... but nothing in between! I thought, \\"WTF happened to my music?\\" It's almost as if they just forgot to add a woofer to the mid-range satellite speakers. The music sounds weak and distorted. (These were uncompressed Apple Lossless tracks, btw.) Try something else, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL+VOICE","review":"i bought these speakers from amazon 3 weeks ago. compare to the price, this one can answer all your needs such as sound, detail and idea from decoration. these days, with a help from the creture, i can have romantic nights with my girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. Do not buy.","review":"When this does seem like a great deal it is not. I can not imagine anyone spending 129.99 for these speakers. Even at the $38.89 price point it is a ripoff. The first think I noticed when I got the speakers is how small they were. They sound exactly like they look. They produce no mid range what so ever. Even changing the equalizer on the computer could not make up for the lack of power the speakers had. Nothing sounds good out of the speakers and i tend to find myself using my laptop speakers over the Creature IIs because the sound quality is so bad.Also a side note. The controls on the sub woofer are backwards. To turn the bass or the treble up you turn towards the \\"-\\" and to turn them down you turn towards the \\"+\\". This is a great example about the excellent quality of these horrible horrible speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR","review":"This product may look good, but as soon as i got it and hooked it up, i noticed a terrible hissing noise from the left satellite. It's only tolerable if i keep it on low volume.I was totally disappointed with this system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the average listener, not so for audiophiles","review":"Cool! Beautiful! Strange! These are three words that could easily describe JBL's Creature II speaker system. I bought these to increase the sound of my laptop, and so far they're pretty great. They are sleek and almost alien-esque in shape, and sound great; I do agree with some reviewers who claim they sound hollow, as certain DVDs of mine do sound as such. However, there are many pros about the JBL Creature IIs, including but not limited to the touch-sensitive volume control buttons, which adds to its appeal. Recommended for the average listener, but not for the genuine audiophile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Addition for Your Computer","review":"Simply put these speakers sound and look great. While the subwoofer's size is about average the two speakers are very small and don't clutter up your desktop. Although you'll be surprised listening to these little speekers as they pack a powerful punch and sound great at any volume. Final note, if you own a Mac these speakers are exactely what its been waiting for, if you use a PC then they're still a great additon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks = great; Price = cheap; Sound = you can do better","review":"For about $40 you can get decent sounding speakers, but these don't have sound you can find in comparably priced speakers. I think you can do better than these... You would expect something with a subwoofer to be able to really kick out sound. These don't.If you're more picky about the looks, AND if you intend to use these for your personal use when you sit 3 feet away, and if you're not trying to fill a room with sound, then you won't be disappointed with these.But if you're picky about sound, skip these and go with something from Altec Lansing... or spend more money and get some Harmon Kardon SoundSticks. I have the HK Sound Sticks (about $100 more) and have never been disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply AWESOME!","review":"I was looking to \\"upgrade\\" my office speakers. To be honest the speakers at my office were barely speakers. With music being very important to me I wanted my iPod to sing with more life. I avoid most of the \\"i\\" products because they all have the \\"convenient\\" docking stations. I keep my iPod in a protective rubber case and don't feel like removing it often if at all.Anyhow, the JBL Creatures are simply awesome! If you're looking for speakers for your home or home office you'd be hard pressed to find a better set for the price. Clear sound and deep, strong lows. It's definitely capable of more than my office calls for but every now and again I get to crank it when I'm stuck working late. The unique look is certainly a statement on my desk. If you're too timid these might not be for you. I'm very happy with my purchase and would definitely buy another set should anything happen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Speakers","review":"For the price i think these speakers offer a chic and interesting quality, the sound quality isnt anything godly but its very good, the touch system is interesting and easy, although a little gimmick-y.i did have very little trouble setting it up, i had to turn it off and on a few times to get the left and right speakers working but other than that ive experienced no problems.a good buy for a fair price, i reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"These are the best speakers ever!!!

I don't know why Bose is so EXPENSIVE, but I do know that this speakers are the second best investment in my life (first one was my first Macbook). You must know the final price I've paid for it was nearly U$125 (int'l shipping, taxes, etc), but I'm very happy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"I was very apprehensive about this product at first because of the price reduction here on Amazon. I figured that they had to be horrible speakers to be marked down so drastically.I just received my speakers in the mail and set them up in my classroom. I was surprised at how well these small speakers filled my classroom with decent sound. From the size and price I did not expect this nice of sound. I bought these for my classroom computer and to my surprise they fill the entire classroom.For Under $40 these speakers are well worth it! Deep Base that can be adjusted, easy set up, and good clear sound. (Lets hope they don't break in a week!)UPDATE- After listening closely, I was able to hear a slight crackle in the speakers. The crackle is very very subtle and a listener has to listen extremely carefully at certain times to hear it. (I would still buy these speakers without hesitation)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers and you can't beat the price!","review":"I don't think it is possible to find a better multimedia speaker deal for under $40.00. The speakers set up easily and, despite their looks, can stay fairly inconspicuous. I have mine set up on top of our armoir withsome decorative plants to hide the sub. I am using this with the excellent AirPort Express to pipe my iTunes collection into the living room."},{"rating":"1","title":"One year, twelve days","review":"These speakers were great for one year and twelve days, and then they just died. No sound, just a slight squeak from the sub. Called the company, and from what I can tell this is a known issue. I paid altogether too much for a set of speakers that lasted for so little time, and my choices with them are limited. Frankly, I just tossed them and bought a less expensive system that I can live with if it dies.What makes this especially heinous at the personal level is that I had my previous speakers, a medium-expensive B.A. set that were ugly as sin for at least seven, and I think closer to ten, years. The Creature looked nice, didn't sound quite as good, and didn't last even close to as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but quiet","review":"Cute product.... fast delivery... arrived in excellent shape. I was, however, somewhat disappointed with the product overall. \\"Loudest\\" volume is still too soft to be heard mere feet from the computer. The on/off button is on the BACK of the subwoofer... not too convenient. Would not buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers with Great Sound","review":"The look and sound of these speakers is great. The reason that I got them was becuase I was tired of haviing huge speakers sitting on my desk and distracting me from what I was doing. They were always getting in the way. I was attracted to these because of thier size and color. They match almost perfectly with my iMac that I have sitting on my desk. You just put the subwoofer under the desk and the small satellites on top, and it looks good.The sound of these little speakers are amazing. I've had some other speakers that were 4.1 sound, yet these little speakers are far better sounding. The bass is so deep and the vocals are very crisp. If you are looking for a great looking set of speakers that don't take up much room and sound excellent, then these are for you. Don't let thier size fool you, they are amazing. The price you can get them on Amazon is a very good deal too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Returned this product the same day I received it. There is a message with the instructions about a problem that must be quite common in being able to adjust the volume. I tried the three suggestions to adjust the volume--including having to move the unit to a place I did not want it or using metal for some conductivity issue--but nothing worked. It looked good, but worked terribly. For speakers to have a volume control problem that is so common they have to give you three ways to try to correct the problem is enough of a warning--stay away from this worthless junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"unit did not work!","review":"I was very excited when my JBL Creature II came in the mail. I sat down went over the set up instructions, which were pretty self explanatory. After 2 hours of trying to get the speakers to work, & after both \\"not very helpful\\" trouble shooting points failed. I had to return the unit. The problem was that both the little speakers would not work at all! I could hear sound from the main sub woofer unit, but not the speakers.... So this assured me it was the creature's problem & not my computer. It was very annoying having to return a brand new speaker set I just bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aesthetically pleasing to the eye but not the ear","review":"Classic case of 'looks good, sounds horrible'. And I don't mean they sound marginal. The sound IS that bad. Which is is disappointing because there are very few PC/MAC speaker setups that have white cables (cabling) rather than black if you're concerned about that sort of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers!","review":"I do not see how you can beat these speakers for the price here at amazon.com. The sound is great at all freq's and the lows are mellow and sound very good. One very nice feature is the volume control being handy on the right speaker and it gives very even level adjustment. None of the digital jumping on the volume control as with some speakers. I love the way they look and they go perfectly with my new G5 iMac. Hooking them up could not be easier and they have good quality connectors and cables. Go for these puppies I think you will be very happy with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"The speakers sound very good especially for the price paid, well worth the money. You can plug in any kind of media (cd players and MP3 players) and it sounds good. Two things to complain about: one, the wires don't hide as well in the subwoofer, it doesn't have a very \\"clean\\" appearance. Second, the power switch is in a very awkward position, on the side of the subwoofer, it makes very difficult to power on and off. Other than that I like them very much and would buy again if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?? there is NO volume adjustment!!","review":"i dunno y every one is rating these things so high. my integrated lap top speakers are literally LOUDER then these speakers. o wow, this deal comes with a sub woofer....big deal! im like sooo serious, this is retarded. they are so quiet its not even funny. my dad has the Logitech Z-4 and they work great. i say cough up the extra money and go for some speakers that actually have some sort of amplifier."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOL ,the price is up?","review":"When I bought it ,the unit is 58 plus 2nd day shipping .Why is the price goes up?Any way ,it worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I got these speakers for my iPod and thought they would work great.

Now you know why!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great look, sound not so hot","review":"I just can't deal with the sound quality. Plenty of bass, plenty of treble, but there's just not enough midrange. Turning the bass up doesn't help. It doesn't sound full, and it gives me a headache.On the bright side, this is a very cool looking speaker system. The volume buttons are cool, but I would prefer a knob that I can turn up and down quickly rather than pressing buttons repeatedly. The speakers are nice and small, which is why I bought it, since I have weird constraints on the size of the speakers that can fit on my desk, and all the other systems I looked at have speakers that are too tall.

One thing I noticed about it though was its inability to fully support synthesized music (the likes of Raindancer, Depeche Mode, Cause & Effect, Red Flag plus many other hard-bass loops) because it easily quit delivering any sound longer than one track. I guess it only plays for Pop music that aren't hard hitters. But, as a whole, I had fun with it.Update: June 20, 2011I found out that you should always use it to keep working. I left them unplugged on the shelf for the last ten months because I switched to headphones for my DJ mixing gigs and when I tried using them during one of my breaks, the two satellite speakers quit on me. It's just the subwoofer that lights up now. tsk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"One of the speaker does not work. Volume up and down buttons look fake. Sound is not clear. i will not recomend this item at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmicky and stupid","review":"The only thing these speakers have going for them is their unusual appearance. The touch-sensitive volume control is needlessly complex (why would anyone consider it better than, say, a KNOB?), and offer no indication of how loud the volume is. The volume control stopped working entirely five minutes after I started using the speakers.The bass was fine, but the sound was tinny and crackly no matter what I set the treble to.

Aimee Mann is a good singer. \\"What About Love\\" is an amazing song, and the synth playing is really good. \\"David Denies\\" is also one of best on here too.

Its central point is terribly obvious and fairly unnecessary, and if the point HAS to be made (over and over), it could have been made easily in ten pages. After reading the book, I see that when McCabe talks about directors misinterpreting plays, what he REALLY means is directors interpreting plays differently than how HE interprets those plays. And he seems to have virtually no credentials to back up his rants. He hates dramaturgs, readings, workshops, backstory, blah, blah, blah. So who cares? I'm not sure why he's so angry and so bitter, but this horrific pandemic of rebel directors raping good plays, against which he rails, doesn't actually exist. Still, the book was interesting in some unexpected ways (sometimes for unintentional entertainment value) even though it holds no real value in any ongoing discussion of American theatre.

Aside from that I would recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful surprise","review":"This book was a great, fresh change to the fantasy genre. Patricia Briggs has always been one of my favorite authors, but this series is even completely different from anything else she's written. It was action-packed without being too confusing and the heroine is a very down-to-earth character you want to cheer for. This is a great read that I'd highly recommend to anyone that likes paranormal/sci-fi books without the smut. Can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope this is the beginning of a series...a long series!","review":"Plenty of action, just enough romance, and believable magic makes this a five star read. Mercy's tough without being bullet proof, independent without being absurd, and sexy without being ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, I love well written sex scenes and have a deep appreciation for fantasy erotica, but I truly respect an author who doesn't have to lean the narrative on them like a crutch. If this is your first Brigg's novel, don't let it be your last. They are all good reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series - I read both books in a week!","review":"The Mercy Thompson books are very well written and I must say it took me by surprise. I had a bad experience with Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series which started out great and then turned into weird erotica nonsense. This is nothing like that. It's science fiction the way it should be. I couldn't put either book down and found myself staying up late to finish. The heroine is independant yet maintains her femininity. Mercy Thompson was raised by werewolves but is a walker - a shape-shifter whose animal form is a coyote. As described on the back of one of the books, Mercy has friends in high and low places and often finds herself in somewhat dangerous situations. She always pulls through, of course, with a little help from her friends. Try it, there's a lot to like about Patricia Briggs's writing and characterizations. I can't wait for the next book! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series - book 1","review":"I don't know why I waited so long before checking out this series. I really like the characters and can't believe I devoured the first 4 books in only three days. I really like this series! Mercy is an engaging character that has a unique perspective on the more dominant characters that surround her. The fact this is written from a non-dominant perspective (you'll notice I didn't use the word submissive?)is probably why it took me so long to pick up the first book. Oh silly me! I have obviously been conditioned by this genre to go for the kick#$$ Alpha females, forgetting that the real heroes are the ordinary ones that do extraordinary things. This series is one for the bookcase- you'll want to read them more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Start to a Lengthy Series","review":"Patricia Briggs has created a charming start to a long urban fantasy series. The plot is mysterious enough, and fits together nicely, but is really just a backdrop for character interaction.Our herione has three major romantic interests: a vampire, a werewolf she loved as a teenager, and a werewolf she lives right next door to.This novel focuses almost exclusively on the werewolf side, and we learn something of her past. Nonetheless, it's clear that vampires will play quite the part in future books.As I read the novel, I was struck at how similar to Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake this was. The characters, and the tension they created, echoed some of Mrs. Hamilton's better writing - something, I fear, we probably won't see much more of.Patricia Briggs brings a promising new series to life with Moon Called. She joins the ranks of Jim Butcher and others in providing new, casual urban fantasy that remains riveting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good start to a series","review":"To bad Amazon doesn't allow half star ratings, cause I would have rather given this one a 4 1/2 stars. But they don't so I rounded up to 5.I liked the interactions of Mercy with all the characters in the book, from the Alpha werewolf and his daughter, to the local vampire that has her fix his van.Mercy is a tough lady, but she is smart enough to know when others are tougher and that she needs help.I hope Patricia Briggs keeps putting out books of this quality, cause I'll be a reader for a long time if she does."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last a book that doesn't resort to porn instead of plot.","review":"In this book, Mercy Thompson is the save-the-world kind of girl, but she does it without becoming a martinet and walking all over people who care about her! What a concept! Her character is unique as well, being the lone \\"skinwalker\\" who turns into a coyote in a world of bigger, more powerful weres and other creatures.The supernatural creatures in Patricia Briggs' book are interesting and unique - vampires and werewolves and fae with a strong culture and facinating interaction. The characters are extremely well developed and the plot just zips along. I wish I had happened upon this series when there were about 10 of them out - waiting for the next book is going to be hard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this book!","review":"Ms. Briggs has created a wonderful world populated by people who felt real. Their \\"otherness\\" served to complement their personalities, not rule them, and I really appreciated this after reading a number of books where it felt like each character had the same voice, with only their special powers to distinguish them. Be warned that this is not a \\"romance\\" in the sense that some readers might be looking for. The story is more about the mystery. I look forward to reading the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Amazing...","review":"A great blend of mystery, twists, sprinkle of humor and a great heroine. She's smart without being too sassy or brag-like. The plot is amazing as well and the characters...Damn, she couldn't have made the characters any better. They all have different, but great personality. Each character has it's own problems and emotions.

She has keeps it very interesting all the way through the book and after each chapter it leaves you on the edge so you must keep reading...I myself was half asleep and I could barley keep my eyes open and yet I couldn't put it down till I literally had to force myself...If you like werewolves and such, I think this would be a great book for you to read.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe this series isn't even more popular","review":"I'm always shocked at how many people have never heard of or have never read this series. If you're an urban fantasy, dark fantasy, or vampire fan, you have to check out this series. The writing is great. I really enjoy Patricia Briggs' style. The Mercy Thompson series is great, and unlike a lot of the other series that are out right now I think every book in this series is incredible. Don't wait. Check it out now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story, Poor Writing","review":"I have never written a reveiw for a book before online, but this one I had to.The writing in Moon Called is terrible. The paragraphs have sentences that nearly all begin with \\"I..\\". Also, the author writes about things that are irrelevant to the story, such as the actions she takes to go to bed or walk outside. There is no need for all the junk the writer puts in this book. It actually irritated me so bad becuase of these two things that I had to stop a little after the middle of teh book. Thinking it was just my mood that turned me off of this book, I tried to read it again six months later, but I couldn't make it past the third chapter.Although it was irritating having to read all of the usless facts and sentences that all begin the same, the story line is good. The idea that a shape shifter has to deal with and even help an aggressive werewolf society is very interesting. I have to admit that the story line is what kept me going for as long as I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"just uninteresting","review":"i'm unsure what people who liked this book want to get from authors, but undoubtedly, it ain't much. the writing in \\"Moon Called\\" is substandard (and that's being kind describing it that way). i have nothing against the author, and hey, she's making good money and selling books, so that's cool.but i do find it hard to believe briggs put much effort into this book. \\"Moon Called\\" is literally filled with cliches, to such an extent that i'm a little amazed she could pull off writing quite this trite. in a way, it's an artform, because it's not exactly unskilled writing, it's instead being really talented at producing horrible books. i simply can't believe this was an unconscious effort on the author's part.if you're looking for a piece of literature that's mindless, \\"Moon Called\\" is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"I went to about pg 110 thinking it had to get better based on all the positive reviews but there is no interesting character development or plot going on here.

I have read so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of trash","review":"This book was pure garbage...I couldnt even finish it, I just put it down. I ordered the second book but thank god they didnt have anymore and gave me a refund. The book was interesting in maybe the first 10 pages, but other than that it was way too slow, the characters were dead...perhaps the only character that had any depth was Mercy. I'm still struggling to finish reading it since I paid for it but its too difficult. Unless you're already a Patricia Briggs fan I'd say save your money...This book is just plain awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"anti-feminist from a female author?","review":"I thought this book was pretty damn horrible. Mercy is a likeable character, but this book constantly put down women in all ways possible. Sure, it was subtle, but the message was clear! There was not nearly enough plot to make up for anything. I (unfortunately) finished the book and felt both disgusting and disgusted immediately afterward. Just about the only part I enjoyed was the looking at the cover. DON'T JUDGE THIS BOOK BY ITS COVER! Ugh, I'm just glad I didn't pay to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick, fun read","review":"This isn't my favorite genre but someone recommended this book to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Mercy is a great character and Patricia Briggs leaves you wanting to know more about Mercy's world!I highly recommend the cross-over series, Alpha and Omega. The first two full books in the series are very good!! But start with the Alpha and Omega short story in the anthology, On The Prowl- you'll need the back story of Anna and Charles' relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Escapist Adventure","review":"I've become addicted to the urban fantasy genre. Sadly, many books under this theme, especially if there is a hint of romance, really aren't very good. Recycled plots, cardboard characters. That isn't the case with Patricia Briggs. Her characters are fully developed. After reading all four (to date) books in the series I feel like I know them well and could go to dinner with them. They are real people with real struggles. And, not everything is black and white/good or evil. A bit of grey to keep things interesting. By the way - don't let the provocative covers keep you away. Mercy as described in the book does have a few tattoos - but nothing like the covers depict. And, she's never scantily dressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOWOWOWOW","review":"gritty real charming... the cover was killer, and the inside was better. my only grumble is i can sense the love triangle is going to be bitterly fought among the fans. and she BETTER give us more to sink our teeth into there in the future. people are all like- thank god not the smut of lkh! but i'm like- you can do hot without smut ms. briggs- bring it! your book was hands down fantastic. thank you for your talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge a book....","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I bought it on a whim and usually I am really disappointed when I know nothing about a book or the author. This book is the exception. I thought the main character, Mercy was believable and a strong and intelligent heroine. I loved the two main male characters, Adam and Sam--they were believable and well-developed in the story. I am excited to read the next book in the series and would definetly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shapeshifters RULE!","review":"Yea....I almost didn't buy this book because of the cover, but I'm so glad I did!Mercy is a shapeshifter, a rare and powerful coyote with special powers even she doesn't understand. I didn't put this book down till the last sentence and even then, I ached for more. If you dig shapeshifters, a fast-paced and unpredictable plot and characters you'd love to hang with in real life....you'll dig this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Twist on the Supernatural","review":"This book has completely captured my interest in the series, I can hardly wait for the next installment. Featuring a heroine with spunk, guts, and most of all humor, this book was a great twist on the supernatural. For all fans of supernatural stories, and werewolf fans in particular, buy this book you won't regret it. A literal page turner, I couldn't wait to see what happened next, and I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun!","review":"I have read the first three books in this series, and love them all. Mrs. Briggs writes wonderfully. Mercy is a tough chick, but she has a vulnerable side, which makes her all the more believable. These novels have lots of great plot twists and wtf moments. There were even a few times I cried. Great series, well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mercy Mercy","review":"Mercy is a great Charater. I am looking forward to seeing how she develops. Easy reading that keeps you coming back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moon Called and Book Bound","review":"This book; the first of the Mercy Thompson series of books, is fast-paced and compelling. Although the story is about a shape-shifter who rubs elbows with other creatures of folklore (werewolves, vampires and witches), it still draws the reader into an almost believable world. The story and the adventures continue to unfold as the book progresses. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a great story they can't or won't put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable!!!!!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book!!!

Mercy Thompson, the main character, is a walker, which is basically a shapeshifter who turns into a coyote. She is not an official part of the local werewolf pack, but \\"Moon Called\\" is still very focused on werewolves and their politics. Briggs goes to great lengths to explain werewolf politics, and I enjoyed this aspect of the novel the most. The relationships within the local pack, & Mercy's relationship to the pack, are pretty much the basis of the story.There was also a mystery at the heart of the story, & I must say that I was able to figure out the whodunnit when the character first appeared. The perpetrator was interesting in his own right but, in the end, really just a stock character that is used in many mysteries. Even so, I was much more interested in the relationships & what is to come. There are some hints that Mercy may have special powers, so I hope that will be explored in future novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great author, great stories","review":"All of the Patricia Briggs books are great, haven't read a bad one yet. My wife and I really enjoyed the three \\"Mercy Thompson\\" books that we have read so far. If there was any justice in the world, P. Briggs would be as well off as the author of the \\"Harry Potter\\" books. Ms. Briggs' books are entertaining, well written, and hard to put down. Other recent authors in fiction genres that I read that I have liked include Terry Pratchett and Lois McMaster Bujold (so that you have an idea of my taste, rather than to convince you to read them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"An onbsessive compulsive werewolf who lives next door to a mechanic who can turn into a coyote?

The rest of the characters are equally adorable. If you like werewolves...even if you like vamps (there is a vamp with the mystery mobile...how cool is that?)...I would get this book.

After reading what the book was about I thought it would be some romance between the auto mechanic and the wolf that shows up on her door, that is what everyone was painting. Instead, this book is a bit of a complicated mystery which had me rereading parts of it. I think this is a great start to a series, which I hope continues to get better and better. The main character is very likable and unique, she is NOT a tough cookie like everyone other heroine coming out lately, which is refreshing. I stayed away from this series for a long time, I'm not sure why, but I'm glad I decided to give it a try. Everyone who gave this 4 or 5 stars is right on the money!

I just ordered the third in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Clean Brake from Sex Kitten heroines","review":"Mercy is a nice clean brake from the popular heroines out there in Urban Fantasy. She is average looking and has a hard working blue collar job as a mechanic. The more popular Urban Fantasy heroines out there are the dream Pinup Gorgeous Sex Kittens (with XXX rated situations), that have glamorous jobs or ones that are more exciting then a mechanics. With all the fantasy creatures stripped away (everyone being just humans) you can really relate to Mercy and her struggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"From the first page this book caught my interest, a great hook that seemed to effortlessly make me want to keep on reading. The characters were well written, though perhaps not as deep as I usually prefer. Yet the exciting tale and very well done description of werewolves proved more then enough to make up for the simplistic characters. More often then not the supernatural beings are given to much of an otherworldly feel, making them to hard to believe in. Briggs gives werewolves, fae, and vampires such an earthly feel that it wonderfully easy to see them as truly real people. This is the most important aspect of this story, at least for me. Her well formed ideas of supernatural beings politics and lifestyles give us the reader strong tools to just be, and believe within her world.

I'm working my way down the Favorite Paranormal Romance Authors List that was put together by WoodWitchDame (thank you, by the way, for all your work on that) and was getting a little discouraged. I was finding very few that I enjoyed. But thank you for Kelley Armstrong (Darkest Powers) and now Patricia Briggs. The only reason I took off a star was for the imbicilic cover. Seriously, I've worked on cars and while I'm in decent shape, I can honestly say I've never tied my shirt up under my boobs to change the oil.

I got it as a free e-book, so thank god I didn't pay for it.Sadly, I didn't get through the first chapter.There are a lot of mistakes and too much information all piled together, which I would expect from a teenager attempting to write their first novel. At times I felt as if I was reading a history essay instead of a novel.Then there's just piles of useless information that instead of describing something she just tells the reader with no great deal of description to help them along.I did like the main character, she came across as cool. But just a bit mary-sueish for my liking.I really wanted to read it, but I have to delete off my computer...the writing was just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moon Called... and I hung up!","review":"UGH! I get that this book was geared for the YA audience but can we give the reader a little credit? Simply because something is targeted for a younger audience doesn't mean it should be dumbed down.The protagonist in this novel is a little over the top, and is clearly written as the anti-Bella. Tough chick with an attitude. Which is great, as long as there's some substance or wit to counterbalance the snark, it just doesn't exist here. There is far more successful YA fiction out there. Try Hunger Games or Bad Girls Don't Die if you're looking for something in this genre. If love is what you're looking for, try a Sarah Dessen novel or something by Elizabeth Scott.Is short, this book was so painful I simply couldn't get past the fourth chapter. The writing is bland, the characters even blander and the plot is beyond weak. I really couldn't care less if I was paid to. Again, UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawn out to say the least","review":"I hate to say this, but this book is very disappointing. I can't believe people are giving this anything above a 2 star. There is no excitement, romance or anything to keep your attention. I have read manyparanormal-romance-thriller series (Night Huntress, Vampire Academy, and the Sookie Stackhouse series are all wonderful) and I still can't get over how let down I was by this book.

I read the first few chapters and couldn't bring myself to continue. This series is NOT what it's cracked up to be! I am shocked at all of the positive reviews, because nothing about this book is good. The writing is simple, the story isn't intriguing, and the characters are one-dimensional. Do not waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring waste of money","review":"I am so mad I believed all the good reviews this book received. I bought it and could not even finish it. I forced myself to make it halfway then I gave up. I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did.First of all the plot was lame. And as another writer points out, there were tons of waste. Probably to make the word count.Second, because it was written in first person, you never got any interaction from the other characters. This leaves you with only what could be \\"seen\\" from the heroine, who by the way was also boring, leaving flat characters that had potential but couldn't deliver.Not sure if this was fantasy fiction or paranormal, but I won't be reading another by this author.Wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"My own backyard","review":"I loved all of the Mercy Thompson series. I was more drawn to this book because the author is from the Tri-cities and so am I. Usually books take place in a more familiar place, Spokane or Seattle. I was able to imagine and be more with the story as I read anxiously. I enjoyed the mixture of vampires, wolves, and everything in between.There are many lovable characters, as well as the opposite. Patricia Briggs was able to use humor, emotions, and intensity through out the book when needed. She is not afraid to be brutally honest in her books and that is what I respect. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"A strong woman lead. She doesn't sit back and wait for the alpha male to solve her problems.

She lives in a Hamilton-like universe, where certain members of the other-worlds have \\"come out\\" to regular society. others remain hidden in plain sight. This book introduces the reader to this universe full of werewolves, fae, vampires, et cetera while solving a pretty good mystery.There are bound to be a lot of comparisons to Anita Blake, and I think this series starts out as strongly as that one (the first book there was Guilty Pleasures). I also see potential for this series blowing out of the water in the same way that series did. (Crazy sexual situations that made me so uncomfortable I stopped reading the books). However, until it does, I'm going to enjoy the ride, and hope for the best (Briggs Dragon Bones/Blood series is one of my favorite fantasies ever.)(*)>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moon Called","review":"This book was so good I stayed up all night to finish it. I am a lover of all books with were's, vampires, fae in them. This book has it all. And to think the writer didn't have one sex scene in the story to fill up space.Her characters are very down to earth people, except for the fact that they enjoy added benefits of their species. Mercy is a mechanic, works for a living, and just happens to have the added ability to change her shape to that of a coyote. Her sexy neighbor has a daughter, Jessie, who is human but her dad, Adam is the Alfa werewolf in the area. Mercy works on a car for her friend Stephen one of the vampires in the story.This book is full of interesting characters, least of all the heroine, Mercy. I would gladly recommend this book to anyone. I would give it more than 5 stars though. Looking forward to its sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner, well written and exciting!","review":"I originally got this book as a joke, gifting it to a friend of mine who looks nearly identical to the woman pictured on the cover (sans the tattoos). She called me up two days later, saying that it was one of the best books she'd ever read. Intrigued, I bought a second copy, started to read, and got hooked myself. The plot line isn't horrible original, but the outstanding characterization, pacing, and dialog sets this work above most in the genre. I really like Mercy, the heroine; she's refreshingly \\"real\\" insofar as one can be in a world of witches, werewolves, vampires, and whatnot. The \\"walker\\" concept is interesting and far from overused. There are some really neat touches, like Elizaveta Arkadyevna Vyshnevetskaya, a witch who cleans up after the bodies (it wouldn't do for the mundanes to stumble across a very dead, half-shifted werewolf now would it)... Very well written, exciting, and interesting story. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I was enthralled by the world Brigs describs in this book. The system in which werewolves lived was fascinating, and believable. I also fell in love with the heroine from the very first paragraph.

From the quirky habits of Mercy to the angst felt between her and being alone in a world meant for someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quality start to an excellent series","review":"Moon Called is a great start to a series that keeps getting better. Briggs does an excellent job juggling the story threads, not focusing too much on the romantic entanglements at the expense of the plot, but also taking time to patiently develop the complexity of the relationship triangle. These relationship arcs play out later in the series and are not resolved in this book, however, the main plot mystery is resolved and its progression is handled well.Mercy is an excellent character, with a strong spirit and intelligence. She must sometimes be very clever to get what she wants since the werewolves are stronger than she is, and her relationship to the pack is complex and filled with shifter politics. The complete lack of Too Stupid To Live moments is also refreshing.I recommend this book and the rest of the series without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent supernatural series","review":"I finished the Mercy series and am anxiously awaiting the next book. I won't give a synopsis of the story since that's pretty well covered already in other posts, but just wanted to add my recommendations to read this series. I couldn't put them down! They are now some of my all time favorites! Definitely worth re-reading...a sign of a great book for me. Highly original world, intriguing characters, compelling story, lots of action, mystery and suspense as well as a little romance.I have been on the hunt for books similiar to the Mercy Thompson and Alpha & Omega series. The new Chicagoland Vampire series by Chloe Neill has the same sort of style...strong, likable female lead, good plotline, lots of paranormal action and suspense and a little romance. Give them a try after reading Biggs.Some Girls Bite: A Chicagoland Vampires Novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moon Called","review":"I loved this book, the heroine is Mercy Thompson an auto mechanic and a shifter.

I'm not going to give a synopsis of the plot because plenty of them have already been done. Mercy is a likable character, as are all the supporting characters. My favorites are Adam and Stephan. This book has a lot of world building, but it doesn't take away from the story. The characters' personalities are established pretty early on, and they're easy to relate to.

Mercy is tough without being over the top, and the pacing was right on (there was no drag at all). The world building was interesting, and I especially enjoyed reading about pack dynamics. Briggs definitely knows a little about canines.It's probably a strange thing to pick out, but my favorite part was when Mercy was driving, Samuel was in wolf form, and he stuck his head out the window like a dog. First Mercy tells him to knock it off, but then admits she's always wanted to try it. It was a very cute scene.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys urban fantasy. I love the genre, but a lot of what I've read lately has had a Buffy the Vampire Slayer feel (nothing wrong with that, but some go so far that they're practically fanfiction) and it gets old after awhile. This book has none of that, and I'm excited to have found a new series that is so well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thriller","review":"This is the first book I\`ve read that I did not have the ending already pegged.

When I first used it, it worked beautifully- went on easy, stayed on all day. However, after 2 uses, it almost completely dried out. I would shake it to get some color back in, but it wasn't a lot. After about 4 days of use, my lips became EXTREMELY dry. I mean, I don't think my lips have ever been that dry in me entire life. They became so dry that they were cracking, bleeding, and very painful. Chapsticks weren't touching the stuff at all, and I ended up having to go to the doctor to get a prescription for my lips, and skin removal because there was so much crusted on skin that was not sloughing off. Ouch! This stuff cost me a doctor's visit and nearly ruined my lips. Will never use again. There are safer lip stains out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okko Kamu - a great Sibelian reaches Berlin","review":"Finnish conductor Okko Kamu, now largely forgotten, made recordings of Scandinavian music with his own Helsinki Radio Sym. for DGG and other labels a generation ago. So far as I know he only got to record with the Berlin Phil. once, in this 1970 Sibelius Second. This was Karajan's orchestra, of course, but he chose not to record this symphony a third time(his two version are on EMI with the Philharmonia and BPO), so perhaps that gave Kamu an opening.In any event, the orchestra plays magnificently, the sonics are fine, and the performance is first rate. Sibelius is open to so many interpretive styles that I sometimes think there's no such thing as a bad Sibelius Second. This one is flexible, at times fiery and explosive, always expressive, and tremendously viruosic. Only the finale, which begins with a slow, low-key build, may give pause. The additional fillers are the familiar, and very successful ones from Karajan. Five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sibelius","review":"The CD itself is defective. It is jerky.

To create the character of the Mascot (an endearing stuffed dog), and place him at the Devil's Ball (with the most bizarre assemblage of creatures imaginable), reveals just how masterful Starewicz was, and why there has never been anyone like him to this day. If you've never seen The Mascot, you have a gaping hole in your appreciation of great animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technically brilliant","review":"Starewicz's films are AMAZINGLY done, considering how much of his work was done in the 1910's.

Also this mouse has three buttons and if you don't game that's all you need. Your standard R-L click and your roller btton for page viewing. There is nothing wrong with mine as long as I put in on a relatively solid color with a plastic/vinyl top. If you have a problem with yours, pick it up and blow out the laser hole and wipe your hand over the pad/table, so fare that has solve the problems I've had with it. I like it a lot because it's quiet when you click it, smooth and quiet when you use the roller and it's so light it glides with little effort.The only reason it got 4 stars is because the roller button is a little weak and takes some getting used to avoid pushing it down buy accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"loud click!","review":"Desired a small non wireless mouse for an international flight.

Because of this, I chose to try this mouse. It was more comfortable than I expected, considering my large hands, but after a month, it started going south. It developed the annoying habit of causing the pointer to jump randomly about the screen. These are large, screen-crossing leaps. On more than one occasion, the pointer has jumped to the upper right corner of the screen, turning a click of \\"OK\\" into a closed program. I'm probably going to go Kensington or Logitech for the next mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the size","review":"This is my 2nd one. !st one still works BUT like many plug-in items with grommets the wiring started showing after 2mos.

I recently watched it only b/c of Jim Caviezel (the only good thing in the film). First, I found the language insulting throughtout the movie, especially within the first five minutes of the film. That turned me off right away. Secondly, she (who shall not be named) acted REALLY BAD. Her character was unlikable (which is why I believe she was perfect for the role). I was sadden that Jim Caviezel had decided to do this film after Frequency (A movie worth your time watching). The storyline was also good but was wasted all on HER. Overall in the end the movie could have been better with a real actress."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was diferent","review":"I went into this movie not knowing the plot; I had seen the previews, and admittedly I went to see it because I knew the star was Jennifer.Although there was some skin, this movie kept my attention because it had a plot that was very well arranged.

After seeing this movie I wanted to demand the two and a half hours of my life back. The character of \\"Catch\\" in this movie is the most incredibly dull character I have ever seen in my life. J-Lo was good, but half of the plot line (about her and her interactions with physically abusive men) seemed to go nowhere and serve no purpose.This is basically a movie about two pathetically sad people that fall in love. In my opinion, casting these particular two people made no sense.

The overall story was very touching, and I definately felt for the characters of the film, especially Catch. I think that the chemistry in this film between the two major actors was superb. Contrary to popular belief by some reviewers on here...I think that Jennifer Lopez is a real good actress. I feel that she has the talent to play a wide variety of characters, and she should be recognized for this fact more often.The only problem that I had with this film was in the beginning it was a bit confusing as to who was who, and what role they played in the film, but the film has done a good job in pulling things together. At the end of the film you will no longer be confused, but indeed pleased with the heart wrenching ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel Eyes... Great!","review":"Excellent movie.

A lot of reviewers have compared The Movies to Joy Division, mostly because lead singer Timmothy James strains to capture Ian Curtis' dour baritone. But their failed attempt to ape their influencers ends up making The Movies sound like amateurish wannabes, lacking songs, chops, and conviction. Even songs that show some promise musically fail to succeed: \\"Autograph,\\" one of the catchier songs on the album, is hobbled by James' hokey, repetitious delivery. There are some pretty passages here and there, like the coda on \\"A Better Life,\\" but they are too rare to salvage this snoozer of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job","review":"I been using this brush for few months now and I like it.

I wondered about the additional cost, but decided to give it a try. We all love them. As previous reviews indicated, you brush with the same motion as with your regular toothbrush. The additional pulsating action has improved our gums. Our daughter has braces and had a hard time keeping her gums healthy and her teeth clean around the brackets. This really helps. We all know that our teeth are cleaner. They feel so smooth after brushing, almost better than after a dentist visit.We also noticed that our mouth feels cleaner in the morning, after a good nights sleep.

The build quality is terrible; after about two weeks, you have to push the ON button harder and harder just to get any kind of electric \\"action\\" from the pulsar brush. I don't generally write reviews, but I just went to brush my teeth with a new pulsar toothbrush, and guess what? It didn't work.

These stone sculptors from Zimbabwe are truly masters of texture and its effect on placing focus in the work. The work is predominantly figurative or animalistic, representing the spirits of their ancestors. The themes represented are both ancient and modern, and more than one generation of sculptors is included. I only wish I had seen these works when some toured the U.S.Sculptors: You want this.It also makes a wonderful coffee table book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le Creuset","review":"I am a fan of Le Creuset, have 3 sets of these.

No real songs, no real lyrics. Stream of consciousness female singing to a bass guitar. The music sounds very amateurish, as if it were produced by high school students in a garage.

The DVD is packed with fascinating bonus features (a commentary track, a making-of feature, bloopers, deleted scenes and more). The cast is sensational (especially Kelexis Davenport as Pinky LaTrimm; Krystal Summers as Bubbles; Willam Belli as Rachel Slurr) and writer-director Israel Luna keeps things moving at a smart pace, alternating scenes of wild humor with some tense moments and realistic violence. Lots of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ticked-Off This Hasn't Come Out Sooner!!!","review":"Loved, Loved, Loved the film. From the moment the credits ran I was wondering where I could get a copy. The action is non stop, the gore is gratuitous, and the comedy infectious! Everything you want in what is sure to become \\"the\\" NEW CULT CLASSIC!! Israel Luna is a cinematic wonder - creating and directing such divas that are bigger than life and live up to every word. I fell head over stilettos for Willam Belli and you will too!For those who boycotted this film at Film Festivals around the nation it quietly fought back with sold out houses. Its not a film that demeans any group, if anything quite the opposite. It sheds light on a very serious problem in a most effective way. Violence against the Transgendered population is being brought from being buried on page 6 to featured on the front page. And its about time!Issues aside this movie is a winner on all fronts.

Oh well, at least most episodes r the uncut versions. At least I will have the show since no one is airing it these days!! The fourth season seemed to take a more serious tone than previous seasons. They also tried some jokes from previous seasons to no avail. Was sad to see Corinne leave the show. Too bad they never followed up the loose ends of the season finale.

It was upsetting to see the show go off the air. The only complaint I have is, one special episode was not included in the box set. Jessica went to a comma and ended up in heaven. An angel played by Bea Arthur famously for Maude Tv Show was reviewing Jessica's life to see whether she qualified to enter heaven or Jessica may have to return back to earth. This episode was really a special broadcast 3 weeks before Season 4 began. It's a shame, it should have been included in this box set for a complete set. They could have made it a separate menu. Interview of the cast could have been added to the disc as well. Other than that, It's a must have in anyone's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 for the show & none for ABC","review":"This is one of those shows that comes along very rarely. Talented actors & stellar writing combine to have you rolling on the floor with laughter one minute & have tears rolling down your cheeks the next. A one-of-a-kind show that was cancelled before its time, thanks to narrow-minded conservatives and a network with no backbone. I will never forgive ABC for leaving Jessica stranded in front of a firing squad. I wish they had included the wonderful segment w/ Katherine Helmond & Bea Arthur in heaven and though several of the cast members are sadly no longer with us, I would've loved to have seen some extras w/ the rest of the actors and the creators/producers of this amazing comedy.

I've yet to really figure out exactly how this compares, nutritionally, to some of the antioxidant juice drinks available, that cost so much more; assuming this extract is an antioxidant, however, there is the added plus that it's more affordable and very convenient to add to my seltzer water.There's no real 'taste' to it, maybe just a slight 'berry bite.'

If someone has had a problem, I tell myself it won't happen to me. Well, despite reviews that this item required work to maintain its appearance, I bought it. What I wasn't expecting, was that when a trusted handyman lightly tapped on the knock out holes before installation to prep my new sink for my new faucet, that the corner of the sink would break off. I watched it happen and there was no excessive force used. The directions were followed and the sink just broke. I immediately checked my warranty and, of course, chips and breaks aren't covered. Since I won't be able to buy another new sink, I've had to repair the crack the best I can. Not exactly the brand new sink feeling I was going for. If you're going to buy this and need more than the one hole knocked out, practice extreme caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent choice","review":"I ordered this sink from Amazon and was a little nervous about it being shipped (afraid that it might break or chip), but it was packed so incredibly well that it arrived in perfect condition. This sink is absolutely awesome. I had read previous reviews, most of which were good, so decided to purchase this sink. This dark color goes great with my new granite, really setting off the veins in the stone. It doesn't water spot, and is incredibly easy to keep clean. And what an updated look it provides!

Then I reordered a new one, but it wouldn't arrive on time (this whole time we are sinkless from the remodel). Then I told them to cancel the order and they said I HAD TO ACCEPT THE DELIVERY, so they also charged me for the new sink to be delivered and returned, even though I refused shipment and told them that I didn't want it. I disputed with my CC company and they are still charging me $139.79, because they sent a damaged sink. Buy from a local company, so you can return it the same day, if there is a problem.

I wish I had looked at that before I bought it. After even just washing hands a white film remains and it looks dirty. Someone suggested putting mineral oil on it once a month to help alleviate this problem. That is my next attempt.

In fact, it is mediocre recordings like this that keep people from buying budget line discs in the first place. I will echo the sentiments of the earlier reviewer, and add that one shouldn't confuse crystal clear sound with a solid, passionate performance (although the last movement is good). The gem here, and the reason for a fourth star, is a nice \\"Ruckert-Lieder\\" with Fischer-Dieskau and Bohm. Those looking for Mahler 1's should try the Bruno Walter Edition, or better yet the Kubelik DG Originals that offers the same coupling as this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Intonation & Spotty Interpretation","review":"I'm writing this review to dissuade people from buying this CD. I expected more from Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony than this performance, which has horrible intonation problems and an overall uninspiring interpretation. To top it off, the movement \\"Blumine,\\" which Mahler threw out before publishing the symphony, is stuck right in between the 1st and 2nd movements. Its presence really disrupts the flow of the symphony. In short: try another of the many recordings available, this one is very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"I bought it for my daughter who is listening the audio CDs from same author.

IMHO there are many better books to spend twenty bucks on. If you're a Gurdjieff devotee, of course, then you'll want to learn what he was like to live with day by day. I wasn't much impressed by how he comes across in this book, and after reading the book I certainly don't consider him an enlightened being. Kudos to Mr. Peters for presenting an honest and forthright portrait rather than the kind of pablum that is typically written about guru-type figures. However, considering G.'s craziness and instability, why would anyone want to live by his ideas? Well, he did have some good ideas, but, like all of us, he was inconsistent, somewhat hypocritical, and sometimes off his rocker.

Fahrenheit has that \\"let's play it again...Dad\\" quality that Toto 4, and The Seventh one hooks you into. (Yes...\\"Dad\\"...my 14 year old son has taken a liking to most of my 70's to 80's music all of a sudden). Though the 2 ballad tracks are instantly recognizable, any of the tracks could have easily become standard play on the airwaves. As a drummer myself, I have follow the late, and extemely great, Jeff Porcaro through all of his recordings. It never ceases to amaze me how strong and complicated he can make the beat. Yet it all comes across as simple to the ear. Steve Lukather has incredible chops and precision. He not only leads the song of Toto, but has lended his talents to other groups as well. When Terry Kath (Lead Gutarist for Chicago) lost his life, Steve filled in on their next album doing a much more than adequete job."},{"rating":"2","title":"We,re not in Kansas anymore Toto","review":"Toto's musical fame was too short lived for me. They got alot of exposure from MTV, when albums were still selling. But alot of their terriffic music never got played. I realized I missed their sound. So I did a search on Amazon. Well I found what I was looking for. Great CD, alone or combine on playlist with Billy Ocean, Sade, Cars, and alike.Dave"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toto as Jazz-Rock/Fusion Artists","review":"This album is what I would call Toto's Jazz-Rock/Fusion phase. They didn't score too well on the charts with this album, aside from \\"I'll Be Over You\\", which still gets airplay today.I think the Miles Davis instrumental probably is one of the best jazz pieces that will never get the recognition it richly deserves, having been hidden away on an otherwise forgotten CD.This was Joseph Williams' first recording with Toto, replacing Fergie Frederiksen, who debuted (and disappeared) on Isolation.Peace Out."},{"rating":"2","title":"No masterpiece, but still worthwhile","review":"It's hard not to listen to Ms. Thorn's 1982 EP without thinking of her in Everything But The Girl. In these eight early songs, there are hints of the retro feel of some EBTG music (in her jaunty cover of the VU classic \\"femme fatale,\\" and in the breezy Bacharachian feel of \\"Dreamy\\"). Since it's just Tracey singing with her own guitar as accompaniment, I was also struck by her skills as a guitar player. I already knew she could do more than just sing after seeing EBTG live a few years ago, but her guitar work on this CD is solid throughout. None of these tunes approaches the level of her best work with Ben Watt in EBTG, but some of them are still quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Solid Movie","review":"The Movie stars Meng Fei. Their are three friends and one tricks and betrays the other two for the Ching government. One of the two that is betrayed has two young sons who get rescued by a monk. The boys are seperated one becomes a snake expert and works as a Ching guard the other becomes a crane expert and lives at the Temple. Both boys eventually join together and with others in order to get revenge on the man who killed their father and is now high up in the Ching ranks. The movie in my opinion deserves a 4 star rating for the simple fact that it does great justice in its demonstrations of the snake and crane styles. It also has a solid kung fu movie plot and good actors. I think it is a definate must see movie if you like kung fu movies that demonstrate the annimal styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, useful,straight to the point","review":"The book is just what I was looking for - simple and short, yet effective and precise. It contains just enough intro on the scientific background on how plants purify the air, it gives some info on how this has been tested, it gives practical advices on how to use plants and finally it rates the tested plants according to four criteria of effectivness (removal of chemicals,transpiration rate, ease of growth/maintenance,resistance to insects).Great for reference with some great pictures and guide how to take care of each particular plant. Simply great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide if you want to have indoor plants","review":"More then 10 years ago, we bought some indoor plants for better air quality in the house.

This books came highly recommended by Dr. Chen, a famous Chinese Naturopath doctor who wrote couple of best selling books in Taiwan.

It is quite a different outlook on the inside story behind Jim and Pam's romance. It is a believable, extensively researched book. Jim and Pam were in keeping with the time (saw other people at times), but, they would ultimately always come back to each other. It personalizes their feelings for each other and gives early background similarities in the lives of both Jim and Pam. Beautiful pictures from Themis are featured and this is a must-have book for any serious fan of Jim or Pamela Courson Morrison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, Romantic & A Refreshing Change!","review":"This is EXACTLY the book I was looking for to read about Jim Morrison and his woman, Pam! I really didn't want to read about tour dates or naive' women claiming to be his 'true love'. I wanted an open and honest (sometimes sad, sometimes funny) account of his life with Pam!

I speak from experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"another fictional tale","review":"People believe what they want to believe. And the author of this book, Ms. Patricia Butler, must desperately want to believe that Pamela Courson was a decent person and really loved Jim Morrison. She didn't love him - she only used him for money and security. On July 3, 1971, she watched as Jim died from her addiction. She was never married to him (common law or otherwise). They only had a marriage license application that was never filled out or turned in. Ms. Butler has no right to call her \\"Mrs. Morrison\\". But, when the people you write about are dead, you can do whatever you want, right? This book is very badly written and it has no literary value at all.Go read Patricia Kennealy-Morrison's book Strange Days for a real look at Jim Morrison and the woman he called wife. You'll be very glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just trying to make money","review":"There were, and still are many beliefs about Jim's life.

The author has done her homework and includes references to all the interviewees and plenty of documentory evidence.Whatever loves Jim may have had, Pam was the constant one, the one who was with him right up until the end. I know what it's like to love and hate the same person and yet remain constantly drawn to them. The two people were very young; they were both troubled souls but there is no doubt that they loved each other. Jim could have had any woman he wanted and most often did, but that was just f******. When that was over he returned to his mate, friend, confidant, muse, lover, cosmic equal that was Pam.Patricia Keneeley is just a very bitter woman - lets face it, who wouldn't be if they had loved and lost such a beautiful and sexy man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most comprehensive book I've yet to come across","review":"I love this book because of all the background information about both Jim Morrison and Pamela Courson. There are sections devoted to their childhoods as well as teenage years. The is an extremely rare color photo section in the middle of the book that are of a photo shoot at Pamela's Los Angeles Boutique. If you are looking for a book that is 100% devoted to their romance during Jim's most famous years, this isn't it. Yes there is definitely a section devoted to that (with some very interesting stories), but a lot of the book leads up to their infamous relationship. This book shares facts and details that I have never heard in my entire life and certainly provides insight on the lives of both Jim and Pamela. It's a good read, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful story, beautifully told","review":"Sweet, touching, funny, sad -- a must-read for Doors fans and fans of love stories in general.

So I rented Oliver Stone's movie about The Doors. The Jim & Pam in that flick actually frightened me. I was relieved to find someone (Patricia Butler) who actually put time into researching the \\"true\\" story behind The Doors. I could really relate to both Jim & Pam because they were more human to me now. Not just some mythical type drug addicts. Being the first book that I've read in such a long time, I really have to say that I couldn't have picked a better book"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper","review":"A Harlequin romance (complete with over the top prose) pretending to be biography. Poorly organized, overly sentimental, with messy if not suspicious research and unsound conclusions, this fails to present Jim and Pam's relationship as anything other than what one finds with most dysfunctional, alcoholic couples. No remarkable revelations, and neither individual comes much to life. Falls into usual trap of so many Jim Morrison bios; at the end, one wonders why anyone should care about him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there done that ....","review":"The author's 6 years of research seem to have been spent picking and choosing her way through : \\"No One Here Gets Out Alive \\", \\"Break on Through\\" & \\"The Lizard King\\" (the latter 2 are very interesting & informative). The only 'new' information seems to be that Jim was a bed-wetter, Pamela never graduated from high school, oh and Ms. Butler has determined ( after talking to a medical professional - who NEVER saw Jim) that he didn't die of a Heroin o.d. - no, no, no, he died from an Asthmatic condition, which he had carefully hidden from his Mother, Father, Grandparents, Sister, Brother, Friends, Girlfriends, Consort , bandmates and his own personal Physician!It doesn't pass the laugh test.If this is the 'last word' on the subject, I'm afraid Jim and Pam have been paid a terrible disservice.Anyone interested in Jim Morrison's relationships would do better with \\"Living and Dying with Jim Morrison\\" and \\"Strange Days\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will make you dumber","review":"The only word that comes to mind in describing this book is joke. The wild stories and theories that Butler constructs are laughable. She goes from Jim being gay, to Jim hating the Doors, to Jim dying from an asthmatic condition that she is the first to uncover quite seemlessly. I felt ripped off in paying $20 for this piece of trash. Her sentimentality for the two \\"star crossed-lovers\\" is nice to read, for about five minutes. But the tediousness of the writing makes this book a bore when Jim isn't accused of being gay. If you are a Morrison fan and feel like knowing wrong information anf being aggravated, read this book. Otherwise save the money and buy a cd or Ray's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great photos","review":"A \\"researched\\" book about Pam not endorsed by her family? A \\"love\\" story about Jim Morrison and Pam? How can the author ignore the other women in Jim Morrison's life? As the years went by Pamela was not the only love of his life. The only tragedy in this romance pertains to Pam's heroin addiction and subsequent overdose of the same. Angels Dance and Angels Die is a fair-weather book written to capitalize on the money to be made in the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully told,","review":"Well i just loved the book because i always had a curiosity- as a Jim Morrison fan- in Jim and Pam's romance.And it gave me lots of informations i would never have the opportunity to know.The photographs are marvellous ( i had never seen true photos of Pam, at least colored ones)and this book really helped to know a little more about her, although i think it leaves too much things unrevealed-like their true friend's comments about their social life.AND also i think it's not like the self-intitulated LIZARD QUEEN has written about, i think she(Patricia)just envied Pam for her whole life.She's just a person full of fantasies, because, as we all know, the only woman Jim dedicated his books of beautiful poetry was PAMELA COURSON...VIVA PAMELA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DAMN WONDERFUL JOB!","review":"I really enjoyed this book even my Mother-n-law read it and agreed. She grew up in the 60's and remembers The Doors and thought it was a tragic loss to lose Jim and Pam at a young age. Pamela was such a pretty girl and I'm glad to see that Patricia Butler did'nt dwell on her drug habbit. Also, this book had the best pictures I've seen yet of Pamela and Jim. I think Patricia Butler did a damn wonderful job !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rock and roll love story","review":"A well written love story that isn't something you find when reading about JimMorrison and the Doors. I was very interested to learn a little something about his girlfriend, Pamela. Since she followed him to the grave a few years after him, the secrets of their life together remained silent. Until this book uncovered their attraction and love for each other. A touching look at another side of this great icon and his beautiful woman. Great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"biography\\" here -- Don't be fooled","review":"It's not a biography. It's an overblown book report/slam book entry. Sophomoric, brainless, devoid of style, and hopelessly mushy (in all the wrong ways), Angels Dance and Angels Die is no tribute to Pamela, to Jim, or to their relationship. This is the book the author tried for six years to write? It seems she should have tried a little longer. No book on Jim is perfect -- they all have their flaws, which of course reflect upon their authors. All this book reflects are Butler's failed aspirations as a biographer (getting it published doesn't mean it's any -good-), and frankly, that's not worth the investment of the cover price or the reading time. Memoirs like Strange Days and Light My Fire may also be clouded by the author's personal agendas, but at least they are honest memoirs -- not psuedo-facts and rumors tarted up as legitimate biography. Jim deserves better. Pamela deserves better. And the readers deserve better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"once upon a time\\" version","review":"I ordered this book because i thought it would have more information, more pictures. I saw a few pictures i have not seen but no real new information, a lot of it i had already read in someone else's book and It just didn't seem to have any....\\"meat\\" to it, just a fairy tale-like she was trying to make Jim and Pam seem like cosmic soul mates, like they were actually born to be with each other which they clearly were not. She leaves out Pamela's drug habit with heroin, her affair with the count and many other facts along the way, I guess if you want a nice bedtime story or just see the world through rose colored sunglasses this books for you.

Each chapter, about one woman of significance in history, is broken into the main section that gives very little insight into the woman's character or why the author considers her significant; the meatiest information is in smaller type at the end of a chapter, whimsically titled \\"Ever After.\\" The author does take care to present women from more cultures than most authors do.

The message that might be of some interest is that sexual attraction is often triggered not by a specific person but by circumstances or specific settinge (but that's hardly news, I guess).

I strongly suggest looking at another brand for a flex putty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried this in lieu of other brands, hated it!!!","review":"I tried this in lieu of other brands. In the past I used Kustom Poly Glaze Finishing Putty, also sold on Amazon. I used the Kustom once before on my Manx VW Beach Buggy. It worked awesome until I ran out. While ordering another tube of it, I also ordered this product since it said \\"Fiberglass Evercoat\\". Well, the Kustom dries faster and is harder and not sticky than this stuff. This stuff drys slower and leaves a sticky residue on your mixing board and the Filler Spreader. I would never buy this product again and it costs more than the Kustom that I truely reccomend. I am not a pro body guy, let alone fiberglass guy, just have a hobby of fixing up old cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get ready for repetious scenes and bad 80's music","review":"Being from Colorado and having seen the beautiful scenery I was hoping for a lot more out of this DVD. The scenes are ok at best and are repeated throughout the film, as if somehow the director didn't think I the audience would pick on that. The soundtrack is prototypical 80's mood music and should probably be muted to get any sort of satisfaction out of this dreadful ensemble. I recommend something from the BBC collection paired with music of your liking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Sean Penn","review":"An adaptation of David Rabe's play which was successfully revived this year both off- and on-Broadway last season.It would be difficult to find a better cast and production than this fil.Penn, Kevin Spacey and Meg Ryan are terrific.A great addition to any serious actor's DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This would be a five-star movie without Meg Ryan.","review":"About a year ago I read a quote from Sean Penn that said something like: Film is too powerful a medium to not carry a message. Movies should strive to be more than entertaining. Hurlyburly is not entertainment, it's full of substance, a message, and talented actors. In this film the viewer is in awe of the brilliance of Sean Penn, truly an unappreciated member of the industry (my theory relates to his disdain for the Oscars and other hype surrounding Hollywood.) My only objection to the film is the casting of Hollywood's sweetheart, Meg Ryan, as the drug addict, stripper/prostitute. If she is trying to escape her typecasting, this is the wrong place to do it. She is out of her league in this film, and unbelievable as a big mess. A bad haircut and dark eye-makeup don't cut it, maybe if she were a better actress?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad movie","review":"As one of Kevin Spacey's biggest fans, I have to say his performace is the only bright spot in this otherwise bland and utterly pointless movie. If someone wanted to do a movie about life in Hollywood Hills, why not make a movie with a PLOT? The performances were all good (although I have to say I did not like Robin Wright--she was good in The Princess Bride and Forrest Gump, but not in this), but the movie is bad. It's really not worth the two hours it takes to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something tells me I'm gonna have to see it again","review":"Well at first I hated the movie. I could not understand the point of the story. I thought that Kevin Spacey was wonderful, but then anything that he does is wonderful. Since I saw the movie I have reached an understanding of it. These people are not good people. They are not happy. They want to be happy but they continuously look for happiness in the wrong places. But in closing Kevin Spacey was terribly sexy. It is a must see for any Space-y-Cadet."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you want to waste money then rent this","review":"This movie to me made no sense but I give it two stars because some of the actors i like were in it.I had to ask anyone if they have seen the movie so i could understand what it was about because I couldn't tell.I dont know what movie to compare it to because this is probably the first movie i've seen that had everything in a movie that wouldn't make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pretentious Boring Mess","review":"This is the kind of movie that is best forgotten. The dialogue is reminiscent of coffee shop diatribes by overstimulated upper middle class misanthropes. Avoid this movie! Back away from this movie!

The acting was good. I'm always impressed with Kevin Spacey. But ugh. Even the acting couldn't save this drone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting, lousy movie","review":"I agree with most here that the acting is amazing for this flick (Penn and Spacey are great, Palminteri is good, Meg Ryan is forgettable). However, after about 1/2 hour, the movie becomes unwatchable because the dialogue (with the exception of 1 or 2 scenes) is annoying, meaningless and ultimately painful to listen to. The actors all speak in paragraphs, and they don't speak like normal people would. It all becomes a boring, pointless exercise in overanalytical crap. And in the end, you don't walk with any sense of just what it was that the writer was trying to say, other than the fact that people are basically pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh huh, it must be art.","review":"An \\"ensemble cast\\" wasting 126 minutes snorting coke and babbling incoherently. Boring losers in a story without grit. Occassionally it feels like something's almost there, but it never quite solidifies.Watch the first fifteen minutes, then fast forward to the end. A movie you won't feel obliged to pause when you leave the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME","review":"When I was younger, I had the habit to see each movie until its end and I can't remember having left a theatre in the middle of a projection. But, as years go by, time becomes more valuable and I don't have now the faintest scruple to eject a DVD when the movie is boring.So I've seen maybe one hour of HURLYBURLY before giving up. This movie has all the defaults of this wave of films trying to imitate the best Woody Allen's movies. Narcissism of the director who has certainly given birth to this thing after years of intellectual masturbation, terrible waste of the talent of the good actors involved in the project and a subject that is not the least universal and will only arouse the interest of the so-called artistic circles of Los Angeles.Nothing else. I'm gone.A DVD for the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This movie most obviously benefits from a flawlessly written script and exceptional acting. The dialogue is written remarkably well and the entire cast (including Kevin Spacey, Sean Penn, Anna Paquin, Robin Wright Penn, Meg Ryan, and Garry Shandling) recites it with perfection, even through long and drawn out, yet very interesting conversations. The acting and direction makes the characters seem like real people, and we are merely onlookers viewing a small portion of their complicated lifestyles in the Hollywood upperclass. Sean Penn gives one of his best performances as Eddie and Kevin Spacey does a great job as the cynical Mickey, though he isn't given as much screen time as he deserves. Meg Ryan and Anna Paquin show up more as cameos, rather than actual characters, but they play their brief parts to perfection. If you can stand watching a movie that focuses on the characters and the story without any action or special effects, than this movie is worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like wasting time","review":"You'll love this. I sat in amazement and watched about one-half of this rambling mess about people who were so vulgar and pointless that I could not understand why major stars agreed to do this. When Chazz Palminteri smashes his head into Anna Paquin's forehead, I lost it.If you enjoy watching a \\"movie\\" about people who have diarrhea of the mouth and spend their pointless lives snorting coke, screwing, bitching, complaining, snorting more coke, talking about drugs and bitches, snorting more coke and commenting about every single thing they've just said, you'll have a grand old time. If you want to be entertained, moved, enlightened or challenged, you'd be better off sitting in a lotus position and chanting your own mantra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should Be 4 1/2 Stars","review":"This film was really quite good, I was leery at first but was drawn in but the great performances all around. None of the characters are at all likable, but the interactions are fun. Chaz Palmintari plays the dopey, vicious scumbag, Sean Penn plays the out of control scumbag, Gary Schandling plays the sad sack scumbag and Kevin Spacey plays the suave, charming scumbag. The movie was based on a play and it shows, it's all about the dialogue. I recommend it to all fans of 'acting movies'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Semantic Sublimity","review":"Love/Hate. Most certainly. As a lover, I feel no compelling need to defend this film. It is a self-sustaining entity, a comprehensive experience. It is HURLY BURLY. But haters condemn this film so passionately. (i.e deep down you love it) Indifference is not an option. Why? Because Hurly Burly IS excess. Beautiful excess. However, in this case, excess does not lead to the palace of wisdom. When does it ever? This is one good existential, abusurdist romp with a (well-disguised) heart. I doesn't hurt that the casting was brilliant...Penn and Spacey as roommates! But the writing, the writing. Infectious Language. A refreshingly non-existent plot. Hurly Burly is hyper-conscious, hyper-psychological, hyper-hyper. I can't get enough of this movie. I can't wait to read the play. Thanks Mr. Rabe. Maybe this did turn out to be compelling defense."},{"rating":"2","title":"worthwhile","review":"ok, so you just watched some out there movie called hurlyburly and your askin yourself \\"what the hell was that?\\" well, that was one of the most profound well spoken movies you've seen in some time. i felt the acting was definately up there in rank. whats the plot? good question cause i dont really know myself. if you're not scared of big bad words and you have a questioning mind then this is a good choice. peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stole Worst Movie Award from \\"Howard the Duck\\"","review":"Couldn't watch it all in one setting because it was too painful.

The movie is absolutely awful, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It drags on (and on and on...) and I kept wondering what the point was. Unfortunately there is no point. I was singing praises to the Almighty when it finally ended! If you have 2 hours to waste, buy this movie. If not, SKIP IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MOVIES LIKE THIS ARE AN INSULT TO THE VIEWERS","review":"I have one word for this manipultive, meaningless, contrived waste of time and space movie .. PATHETIC. I can think of no good reason why this movie should be in existence. Although their acting is good .. Penn and Spacey should be ashamed and I lose respect for them being part of this trash. You know you have a real loser when you can fast forward constantly and you don't miss ANYTHING! Meg Ryan is an absolute JOKE in this movie. Send Hollywood a message .. Burn this movie!! We deserve better than this crap -- especially from two fine actors such as Penn and Spacey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and pathetic","review":"It was a real effort to sit through the movie.

The methodolgies suggested by the author are known to produce a system wrought with root rot problems.

Well yea, the song does get annoying, but it's growing on me a little, and that song (happy 1984 and 1999, i think?) was 10 x better live. It might be hard to imagine, but when i heard it live, it was really good. After that song, the next 3 or 4 songs are pretty good, but they couldve been better. After about number 7, the cd just goes downhill it seems like, the rest of it isn't too exciting.

Not very many good songs, and several spoken parts (some of which seem to not make much sense). \\"Body & Soul (Take Me),\\" is the last great slow ballad that they made, and \\"I Don't Believe You Heard Me\\" is a rollicking, bouncy, James Brown-inspired funk number, but aside from these 2 selections, the rest of this album lacks the focus and solidity of previous efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CHRISTMAS HIT!!!","review":"MY 14 YEAR OLD SON \\"M\\" WANTED THIS DVD FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE REALLY ENJOYED THIS DVD, I ALSO GOT SEASON 2.

I am trying to broaden my security horizons beyond intrusion detection, and I found this book well organized, logical, and amazingly pertinent almost two years since it was written.

Glimpses of his earlier musical genius show through with songs like Lonely In Love, The Way It Must Be and She Don't Look Back. Unfortunately these highlights are overshadowed by far too many weak spots.

One has some kind of mental issue going on. The other is somewhat of a sex addict or rather he seeks thrills, despite the fact he's supposed to be in hiding.

The back story is confusing, the chase scenes are few... and the passionate love scenes are straight. You heard me right. In a \\"gay-themed\\" movie, the heterosexual couple um, gives it some body. The two men kiss passionately.... occasionally. Their pairing lacks electricity.

In such movies where the actorsare supposed to be gay and involved in a steamy, amorousrelationship yet fail to show any evidence of one existing (while the straight couples are going at it like rabbits) makesyou wonder if the actors or director is a bit homophobic or afraid of what gay sexually-explicit scenes could do to themovie's ratings and/or actors' careers.

The story was very dull and slow moving. There is nothing erotic about the movie, however that was not the reason for me buying the film. I thought it was a gay romance against the backdrop of a heist which the movie does not deliver. The two actors are absolutely straight and are not at all convincing as gay lovers.

I'd never paid much attention to movies in Spanish before except for those that earned Oscars as best foreign movies. Burnt Money changed my perception about Hispanic movies. Leonardo Sbaraglia (Nene) was wonderfully successful in coveying his loving feelings toward Eduardo Noriega (Angel) in the movie.

This book is definitely not one of the books I will keep. I agree with other reviews that Tasslehoff's story is good. It is very entertaining, but since it is only ~70 pages I can't justify keeping the book for that reason. Douglas Niles and Richard Knaak's tales are decent, but I wasn't exactly thrilled by the other stories. I remember the other Tales books being more entertaining.

Margaret and Iffer are bold to discuss their inner-most thoughts openly, but even more bold to seek to publish while still in middle school. The chapters of the book are pertinent, especially the chapter on sex. Because I work with hundreds of teenage people each week, I know that Iffer says what many of his male peers would say in front of a girl: \\"I don't think we really need to talk about sex.\\" Yet Iffer shakes off the initial hesitancy and addresses Margaret's questions of timing and appropriateness of sex at various ages head on.

And look at the final shot of Fate on the floor: the arms look like the horns of the bull.I just feel that Bizet's music was not given enough relevance.As always, Plisetskaya's dancing is excellent, as is her interpretation of the role of a seductive gypsy girl. In fact, all the dancers give a good performance.I knew Alberto Alonso many years ago, and he was always a great choreographer.

When it comes to bottom of the barrel Italian exploitation, DR. FRANKENSTEIN'S CASTLE OF FREAKS is at the top of the list. Dick Randall haphazardly tosses together an awful plot with ridiculous characters in the hopes that the sleazy sex and gore will distract from his own artless direction.

Popular science at its best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This is a well written and sometimes very informative book that everyone interested in science should own. The only negative is Plaits quixotic penchant for attacking beliefs that have nothing to do with science. He puts a lot of effort into debunking things like the NASA never went to the moon conspiracy theories and other things even though such attempts serve only to strengthen the beliefs of the people that he's attacking. Some his his chapters on those things could have been shortened to a clear demonstration of the silliness of those ideas and left him room to clear up many other misconceptions people hold about science. My favorite part of the book, and the one I learned most from, is the section on meteors, he cleared up my own misconceptions in an area I hadn't thought through all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read","review":"Plait has put together a must-read book for anybody interested in astronomy or anybody tired of seeing fiction put forth as fact. He has accomplished two important things with this book. First, he has corrected some of the most common everyday mistakes. This alone would make the book worth reading. But he also goes beyond that to tackle the pseudoscientists and others who claim astrology is real, the moon landing was a hoax, and similar nonsense. Alas, most people who believe in astrology will probably never pick up his book -- but they SHOULD. And anybody who ever thought \\"maybe this is real\\" should read it from cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great information, horrible writing","review":"This book is filled with great information but the writing style makes the book almost unreadable.

I'll wait a couple of years for her copy.Here is an except from the final paragraph of chapter 8: \\"Finally, in this section we'll travel back in time and space to where it all began, the Big Bang.

Zucco pretends to be innocent, but we all know (and so should everyone else in the movie) that he's behind the strange killings that are always preceded by the discovery of an unusual feather. Zucco's (admittedly average) performance really is the only thing that makes it worth a view.As a lover of old low budget horror films, I give this one a \\"weak but fun\\". I'd recommend a rent instead of a buy, though, because the DVD is not a good value for the money. The picture quality is decent but the source material's quality is not very good.

The central issue here is this film's over-broadness; I'm Loosing You takes a stab at every possible genre. Never really allowing itself enough time to explore the possibilities within one central story with well developed characters, it sprawls out its never-ending twists and turns over the lives of at least 7 different characters, lives that somehow strangely (although predictably) manage to intertwine (much in the way Crash did in 2004). The minute we become attached to a character, the film jump cuts to another; it's annoying!I give this movie 2 stars (instead of 1) because it is not a complete waste of time.

In the mid 40's, though, such a premise probably seemed less preposterous, and von Stroheim's Prussian mien must have exuded a milieu that tweeked the xenophobic.

Sure, they're not at amazing at the diamond grip tweezers out there, but they're also a fraction of the price. My only complaint is that they seem more prone to breaking the hair rather than pulling it out than my old pair (happens one in four - five times at most), but that doesn't bother me enough to warrant spending $30 on a pair of tweezers.Overall, great value and good performance. Far better than the cheapies, better value than the expensive pairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST","review":"The best I've ever had. I bought them about six years ago, and never needed to buy another pair.

I wanted a tweezer that would grab those little hairs. After reading the reviews, it seemed as though these tweezers would do just that. However, that was not my experience.

Overall very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and flimsy","review":"I don't know why these tweezers received such good reviews from other users.

Personally, I will stick with the Revlon tweezers at half the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful compared to other tweezers","review":"I've tried many tweezers in my life, but few make tweezing as painful as the Tweezerman brand. Sure, they work well at grasping small hairs, but I have a different brand of tweezers that works just as well and is not half as painful.

Since I don't have much good to say about these tweezers, I'll start with the cons: They don't consistently grip hairs - it takes repeated attempts to get an appropriate grip which becomes infuriating. When you do get a grip there's a good chance the hair is going to be cut in half (I would guess one out of four times). Also, the edges are entirely too sharp and makes for a great skin cutting tool. I wouldn't be writing this review if the average rating for this product was a 3 star...but at 4.5 stars, I feel like I need to share my frustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get the hype","review":"I've been using a pair of nationalbrand tweezers that worked great - but have unfortunately dulled after 8 months or so.

If not dropped I suspect this would last a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"IGNORE THE HYPE - DON'T DO THE JOB","review":"When I saw these tweezers I was really excited because I know how hard it is to find a great tweezer. I decided to try them because they had alot of positive feedback. Let me just say that they did not live up to my expectations. When I first used them, they were flat together and had very little \\"spring\\" which left little force to get those short, difficult hairs. The packag said you can slowly pull them apart for more resistance, but that did not change the fact that the tips are very sharp and they hurt your face without pulling out the smaller hairs. When I targeted one hair in particular, the tweezers failed to pull it out and just kinked it up, forcing me to use a different pair of tweezers to grab the imbedded hair. For the price, I was very surprised that they were not the best pair of tweezers I ever had. I would never buy these again and I suggest that others save their money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tweezers I ever bought!","review":"I thought tweezers were all alike...until I got TWEEZERMAN tweezers! They grasp and pull out eyebrow hairs like nothing I've ever owned, even the ones that are barely grown in yet. They are very sharp, though, so be careful with them at first.

I highly recommend them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much better than revlon","review":"I bought these hoping they would snag those really tiny, barely there black hairs under my eyebrows.

The theme song alone should tip off the viewer that this is not going to be a good movie. It sounds like a pop tune instead of an eerie sounding music that would set the tone for a film of this nature. This movie was supposed to be about Alien abduction of young women. The alien had reportedly abducted 21 women. However,the movie never showed a single female abduction. Instead the evil alien kills the heroine(not pretty) and a learned professor(an egghead). The hero John Saxon may as well have not even been in this film because he doesn't do anything heroic. A waste of talent. The authorities track the alien down and then allow him to fly away without any provocation. The movie is slow moving and dull. Unless you like other British Sci-Fi dull-fests like Doctor Who or They came from Outer Space, don't waste your money on this one.

I could hardly stay awake as I watched it and I wasn't even tired. A large plastic ball transports an alien to earth from one of Jupiters moons, where he poses as an agent for \\"Bikini today\\" to ensnare attractive young women.

The target age is 9-12 but I didn't read it until I was in my mid-teens, but still managed to be caught up in it. It was a little distracting when the author discussed how the parents met, etc., but that part was short and the rest of the story was worth it. Part friendship, part bittersweet falling-in-love, and overall very good. It has a solid place on my bookshelf of favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed young reader","review":"I like the way this book was written. I like the Quaker style of it, and that's why I picked it up. But, before I get into a book,I like to skim through it to see if it's OK- a tactic I've learned from my mom.First of all, if you hope to learn about the Quaker life from the veiw of a girl, don't read this book. All you'll bump into is a girl who gradually falls into a whimsical romantic relationship with an outcast boy that she taught how to read.Second of all, this book teaches that if you really have to, go ahead and tell a lie. In truth, there is never a time in life where you really have to tell a lie. Lies are bad with no exception. You can always work around telling a lie.So overall,this book has a good Quaker vocabulary, but a few poor moral choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Sorry, I hate to say anything negative about Wayne Shorter, but I just can't connect to this record.

It's in Miami. I liked too how it didn't demonize voodoo, but instead called it ancestor worship. But those are about all the good things.I do understand Ebonics, as most of the intended audience would. However, every character speaks slang in incredibly low voices. I got tired of the invisible narrator/main character. This takes bits from \\"Menace II Society\\" and \\"New Jack City.\\" Every woman is referred to by the B-word, in a terribly misogynist manner. It took 15 minutes to introduce the main character's \\"crew.\\" This had close to no plot.Only a person who loves any and all hood films would enjoy this. There is extremely little redeeming about this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT'S UP PLAYBOY?","review":"The film takes place in MIA and uses a lot of street language as the make the ice so they can get the paper or cheese. The movie looks like an HBO street documentary with poor camera angles and talking to people like \\"Whypp\\" \\"Pyg\\" \\"Dog\\" or \\"Mooch.\\" But clearly it is not a real street film as the camera shows you both ends of a telephone conversation. The plot involves some home boys dealing drugs in the street, telling the guys that work for them they owe them for all the drugs no matter what happens. It feigns some politically commentary when it mentions the disparity of jail time for crack vs. cocaine.There are drug deals gone bad, deals with Latinos and a \\"cracker\\" but no real plot, just a slice of life. No character build-up and minimal plot.Written, directed, produced, music score by and starring Tony Mashino.Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, sex, nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"CCNA 1 and 2 Lab Companion, Revised (Cisco Networking Academy Program) (3rd Edition) (Lab Companion)","review":"Very good book for my University course in Networks and telecommunications, hard to find at bookstores"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Neil Gaiman...","review":"Then this book is for you.

Even in the Bay Area, people are sleepin on this joint and they shouldn't. Taydatay (of the group 11-5) is one of the best lyricist to come out of the Bay for quite some time now. So if you can get a hold of any 11-5 records off of Dogday records do it now, they have 2 cds already out, and they are off the hook (the song Garcia Vegas has been an undergound hit since it dropped a few years ago). Anyways the few of us who follow him have been waiting for him to go solo. Anticipation is a good album, not great but good and won't letdown any true fan. With tracks like Cutty Bang, Tay flexes his flow. The down side is he seems to come alot stronger on tracks with faster beats and I also think he has way to many guest artists on the album with him. But overall it's a good buy.

If anyones sees the REAL NC-17 or the X-rated versions of this film they will see a great movie. Buyer beware"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls","review":"This is a very poor movie. The acting, casting, directing, writing, filming, and any other catagory is just plain weak. There really seems to be no plot, and the movie meanders from meaningless scene to meaningless scene. The main three characters, three young women, make stupid decisions and yet there are no real consequences from them. This is the fault of the writers, who appear not to know how to write a decent outcome of a particular scene and the director, who lets his cast hang in pointlless situations.Some people may think this movie is well done. I'd guess they are really only comparing this movie to Bambi or Dumbo."},{"rating":"2","title":"GImme some sugar, baby!","review":"Okay, get this straight: if you try to follow the screwed up plot, especially the sickness and horror at the end, you will not enjoy the film. Because this one is about the LADIES! So just fast forward past all the whining and soul-searching these people do, and watch the parts where the women are NUDE.One negative: Not enough sex, or extended scenes of nudity. These women are ripe fruit and, man, I want to pick em!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ORIGINAL \\"VALLEY\\" FANS","review":"As a huge fan of the first \\"Valley\\" film, I was quite excited to see this film for the first time. Although I knew it was technically not a sequel, I had heard from many others that it was \\"Basically the same as the first one, just a lot racier.\\" Well,they were right about the racy part, but that's about it. I mean this movie is just weird for the sake of being weird. If the weirdness was a natural element of the plot as opposed to such an obviously contrived factor in the film, it would be much more palatable. While I did enjoy the campy early 70's hairdos and outfits as well as the ultra mod sets, it just wasn't enough to salvage this cinematic experience. I do wish someone would rerelease the soundtrack though, because the songs the girls performed were actually quite good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond the valley of intelligence, that's for sure","review":"Bad acting by goofy b-movie stage actors, bad plot-- Roger Ebert should be ashamed of co-writing this garbage. after reading the reviews by reviewers here, i thought this film would be excellent and original. Boy was i wrong! don't believe everything that you read, that's for sure.This film has an NC17 rating at the video store. Why, may i ask? the sex scenes wouldn't even qualify in low-grade porn. The plot just killed whatever left the movie had to offer--which wasn't much, other than over-makeupped starlets which by appearance were somewhat entertaining. Grotesque violence is what probably got the rating, but even that is blantantly dumb and worthless when portrayed.Susann herself said that the original Valley was horrid, so i can only imagine what she'd think of this lame portrayal with a similar namesake and theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boys shouldn't play with dolls","review":"I must admit there are several parts of this movie I like watching again- the musical montages and the girls band music and even the love scene between two women at the end- but I also must admit the rest is completely unbearable and was originally 93 minutes long. Beware of some newer \\"modified\\" versions that have some distortion in the picture too close with stretched faces, even a reedited musical number."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is so 1970","review":"Worst thing that can happen to an already-bad movie is that it becomes dated, and alas, that's what became of \\"BVD\\". So we get wooden acting and a howlingly bad script right alongside \\"square\\", \\"groovy\\", and bad color reproduction. They tried to work a rock band somewhere into this movie, but it all seems to have gotten lost in the mess of flamboyant scenery-chewing and several women with bubble hair missing their cues.The \\"racy\\" stuff this film is famous for has not endured the march of time, and even the creepy part at the end (...)is of little shock value in our modern world brimming with \\"transgenders\\".Lastly, the tacked-on moralizing sequence at the end of the flick effectively nullifies everything that occurs in the movie up to that point, sort of a \\"don't try this at home\\" band-aid for a Hollywood too cowardly to take a \\"chance\\" on this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lunatic skies of red destruction","review":"Russ Meyer (in)famous venture into a Hollywood's major studio is now one of the most regarded cult classics. I'm a eternal lover of that wonderful camp classic named \\"Valley of the Dolls\\", and that film, not a sequel, spoofed that spirit as it used the same \\"pills 'n' showbiz\\" vogue. Meyer's obsessions are all here (unmeasured breasts, poppy color, kitschy situations, trashy characters, hilarious morality, absurd political dialogues,...), but it's perhaps a little more restrained. (Film critic Ebert was the scriptwriter; believe it or not!) Color, violence, sex, sensationalism and great touches of comedy fills this late 60's flick. However, I prefer \\"Valley of the Dolls\\". (I'm gay and those extraordinary Meyer's women leave me very indifferent.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is a one of It's kind!","review":"This movie is so good, that when it finished I just wanted to watch it all over again...

This film stands out as the absolute emperor of camp cult classics. Revolving around the antics of an all girl rock band that goes to Hollywood and is corrupted by fame, money, drugs (i.e. \\"Dolls\\"), and lesbian sex, the film is augmented by an laughably ridiculous soundtrack (\\"Go and Ask the Gentle People,\\" \\"Candy Man\\"), hilariously over the top racial and sexual exploitation, and a script that is such a work of art, a masterpiece of the hip lingo of yesteryear's youth, that it's been repeatedly cannibalized in countless subsequent films (the most recent being the ... \\"Austin Powers\\" series).

It is, rather, a SUPER entertaining flick that is justifiably a cult classic. I recently saw it with nine friends while surfing through cable channels, and we all sat and watched it in disbelief. It was the funniest film, (NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AT ALL), full of racial and sexual stereotypes, horrible acting and bad dialogue. A heavy-handed, tongue in cheek morality tale, it has an epilogue similar to the moral preaching at the end of the Jerry Springer Show. This film is all camp. I'm glad I was with nine witnesses who also viewed it, because no one would have believed my description of the film, nor its mere existence.I don't condone drug use, but being in an \\"altered state\\" while watching this film couldn't hurt.This film only for those with a great sense of humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"russ meyer fan","review":"if you like russ meyer you'll love this. if you hate him you'll hate this movie too.

It's easily the worst movie I've seen all year. Most of it consists of rappers mugging endlessly into the camera, talking about their frightening experiences with da hip hop witch. Eminem (who tried unsuccessfully to have his scenes removed from the film) talks for what seems like twenty minutes about the witch trying to anally probe him. This is amusing in the most embarrassing way possible, but isn't nearly as funny as it sounds. The production values are barely above those of a home movie, the acting (particularly by the five white kids who travel to New York to find the witch) is atrocious, and as a parody of the \\"Blair Witch Project\\" it completely fails. There are about two genuinely funny jokes in the entire thing. The surprise ending is pathetic. Co-produced by Vanilla Ice, who hasn't been involved in anything good in his entire career.

A bad story line, (5 white people try to find a witch that targets rappers) accompanied by poor acting (if you're gonna pretend you saw something, at least make it sound believable! Who smiles when telling you that someone was trying to kill them? Ja Rule that's who.) makes this the worst movie I've ever seen. Eminem did an okay job during his interview, but that is the only upside to this movie. I hope they paid him a lot to put him on the cover.

The only worthwhile moments in the entire film come from eminem, who turns out a lengthy, improvised rant on his horrific run in with the 'hip hop witch'. I have no idea what the motivation was behind the making of this film, but whoever is responsible should hang their head in shame. I cannot stress enough how much of a waste of time it is. You would have more fun eating your own vomit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smoke up and watch this movie","review":"Get some friends together, smoke a nice fat J, and watch this movie. It was the funniest film i ever saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 STARS","review":"As a film maker with a track record of success myself, I feel that a film must be judged on it's own merits. To know this was shot for less than 5K and it had no studio believing in the concept-the film maker who also made the beloved COLORZ OF RAGE with REDMAN still found a way to see his vision come to light. So many in the indusrty get scared and back down and go back to washing dishes when people say no to an idea but Dale stuck with it and so far from what I read in the trades he has earned over 1 million dollars from over 50K units being sold from this film and 500 thousand dollars from 30K units being sold for COR. At the end of the day you can hate the movie but not the hustle. Dale is destined for super stardom. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly Good 4 U","review":"I have to say, with all of the press, both good and bad surrounding this little movie I was expecting to see something horrific. Instead I find a gem! Bad handheld a la Blair Witch camera work style aside, this movie has so many inside jokes it's like an EXTRAS dream, if in fact your the type of viewer that likes to catch things like that. Also Eminem in his film debut is a real coupe for the producers and RAh Digga, Pras and JA Rule also. The white kids story was hysterical as well. I can see where animosity might set in if your thinking your renting a studio release such as Sixth Sense (wich they so cunningly poke fun at) but really if you read on the DVD box it professes itself to be an indie. Rent it, buy it and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EVEN ONE STAR!!!!!!!!!!!!

Truly madly deeply yall this film had me in laughing for dayz. You really have to be on the director's level to even catch half the jokes...it's like he's an MC of film for real. His jokes and ability to catch EMINEM 2 years before his rise of claiming Rap God should never go unnoticed. THis film is iconic in that it's loaded with more than a dozen gold and platinum selling artists but also in that it's the best spoof of the mega million dollar selling indie phenomena known as The Blair Witch Project. And he made this film years before Hollywood even cared about Hip Hop. This is a cult classic 4 real. Cop this joint."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS FLICK IZ OFF THA CHAIN!!!","review":"Talk about your funny flicks boy. This movie has got it all. You get to see EMINEM in his FIRST MOVIE playing himself...not like that phony watered down version of himself in eight mile.

Anyone who gives a positive review on this crap must of been involved in the production. Mr. Mogul, who claims to be a filmmaker himself, and gave this a positive review, should remember that the directors name is connected to this stinky thing forever. Regardless of rather it was made for Five-thousand or Fifty-million dollars, it is still awful, I don't care if the director and producers made enough money to buy themselves solid gold houses. Any so called filmmaker with a shred of dignity will distance themselves as far as possible from this weak, anemic excuse for entertainment. Don't believe me, ask Eminem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Gotta Be Kidding","review":"First of all you can't even call this a film.

I had thought I was going to see a hilarious movie, but most of it wasn't that funny and the acting was pretty bad.

And here at last (for me) is the book!The major arcana are really what is covered in the book, both the flow from card to card as well as the symbology. The actions of the people portrayed on the cards is detailed with motivations and backgrounds of their correspondences or mythologies. For the most part these cards are given 2 pages of text and then a full color copy of the card that is just shy of the decks original size.However the minor arcana get short shrift. Court Cards get an average of three lines of description, and the others a bit shy of two lines. Yet these pictures are no less complex than the major arcana and are such a departure from other decks that I will feel as if I've missed things in them for a long time to come.Get the book, and then write the 2nd half of it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic","review":"Much like The Empire Strikes Back, I usually consider this sophomore release the masterpiece of the original CR trilogy... but then again I love them all and even all of Peter's solo stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly","review":"I had thrown away too many of the cheap $15 Heath-Zenith motion detectors.

So far, I am happy I spent the extra money on it. I am using a 150 Watt incandescent lamp as the load at this time. The unit says it is compatible with the fluorescent lamps, so I hope to use a fluorescent lamp with the unit in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"air storage tank","review":"this tank looks well built.

I love the smaller sized Hanson-Roberts deck - the original deck is smaller than average to begin with, but the one included here is adorable and pocket sized, yet still big enough to use for readings. the book is of course very basic, little more than a \\"LWB\\" (the little white book included in tarot decks) but worthwhile for a memory jog, and good for beginners. I would certainly get another book to go with the set if you are learning, I recommend Mary Greer's Tarot for Your Self.I think this is a very good value for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarot to go!","review":"I love this little deck of The Hanson Deck.

I love the deck, the water color coloring of the deck is soft and warm to the eyes. It is a great beginner deck. More cheerful than many decks, this one will appeal to optimists for its cheerful approach.I learned something new from this deck and I have 5 other tarot decks. It is great for carrying in your purse. It is a little easier to use than it looks. You get used to the small size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Light Sabers","review":"My kids are enjoying these light sabers very much. It is a good buy.

They don't light up or anything like that, and they don't automatically extend, but the kids play with them like crazy. If you can get them for around 6 dollars each, then they are worth it. 3 years of age to 8 will think they are cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've looked closer before buying","review":"At first glance I thought that the author was giving a list of people making America a worse place and possibly statistics to prove it. Well, a few chapters in and honestly, I thought he would play liberal, but give credit to conservatives where credit was due. No such case here. It is a ruthless attack on the Bush administration and anyone rich and voting republican. He promotes the lead singer of the Dixie Chicks purely on the basis of the quote about being ashamed Bush was from Texas. Shallow reasoning.As a college student I have been lectured to attempt to avoid bias on a personal basis if I am to be credible on a large scale. Well, I see this book only being mildly entertaining from its flaws, and not entirely credible or worthy of a place on the front of the bookshelf. There is a lot of preaching examples here, and for a steeled mind the words will just come off as one-sided commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the thinking.","review":"I got this at the library, thank god, so I didn't waste the 60 cents that this book is now being sold for. If all you want to do is smoke pot and then read this poorly written book, fine as that is all it is good for but if you are used to reading higher quality books, are educated, read and think critically; you will be grossly disappointed. After page 18, I realized that I was about to embark on a repeatitive attack on America by a fool that has to remind us that he is from Canada but doesn't go into why he stays in this rotten nation. I paged throughout the book and saw that I was correct -a long winded chant that gets boring after 20 pages. It is written at a high school level to trap as many people as possible into reading this. Note to those who actually thought this was good: get out more. There are a lot of great books out there. If all you do is sit and read recycled Chomskyist propaganda, then I can see why you would like this vomit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book written by a very small man","review":"A very angry book, but not written well enough to be any good. I knew it was not going to be that good when on the back he has a quote \\" The Scum at Fox news\\"He also quotes blogs, and most of the time he doesn't say who wrote the blog. That is just week. It is one of these things where you read it and say \\" I get it you do not like people who do not think just like you, well sorry.\\"He is just like the people who he hates, a small minded wimp. He is the Ann Coulter of the other side, they are both angry hacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Hit Job' that gets easily verified facts wrong","review":"This book is, needless to say, a reaction against (and a pale shadow of) Goldberg's wildly successful \\"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America (And Al Franken Is #37)\\"Apparently Huberman felt Goldberg's book was too hard on various left leaning prominent figures, so he decided to write this screed to provide some balance. Sadly, all it really does is provide a list of people who really, really get under Huberman's skin.The book is full of shoddy research, poor citation, and outright lies and fabrications.Perhaps the most glaring example is the section on Rush Limbaugh, where two incredibly racially incendiary quotes are listed. The only problem is that Rush Limbaugh NEVER SAID either quote, or anything remotely similar. They are pure fabrications.This book is not witty or droll - John Stewart and Stephen Colbert are witty and droll. It's simply Huberman engaging in fantasies about the people he really personally dislikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry and predictable","review":"Huberman's attempt at humor comes across as nothing more than hateful,thoughtless, unoriginal liberal rhetoric. If you're looking for outside the box thinking, skip this one.It does little more than shout, \\"I'm a liberal, and I'm SO much smarterthan you average Americans\\".What is supposed to be humorous, just sounds angry.Huberman admits to being jealous of Goldberg's success, and he should be jealous of Goldberg's talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satire on another book by Bernie Goldberg","review":"This book is obviously a satire on the other book with the similar title by Bernie Goldberg. If you add up all the people in this list, you will have to include 95% of the American public including God and the Pope as the \\"people who are really screwing America\\". From reading some of the reviews on this book, it is sad to conclude that some people don't get it. They think this is a serious piece of commentary. #57 is the Average American voter. Now that the 2006 election is over, I wonder if the author stands behind his assessment. Mr. Huberman, haven't you heard, imitation is the highest form of flattery. In addition, some of the items on his list are not people per se. Organizations and groups are not people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabricated, Dishonest Quotes In This Book.

Don't you do it either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical of a liberal.....","review":"I have never said \\"I am a republican or I am a democrat,\\" But being somewhere in the middle, this book made me choose once and for all - and it's not to be liberal. It's so typical for a liberal Bush-hater to put so much effort into taking statements out of context, not doing research, and pointing fingers. My blood pressure was off the scale the entire time I was reading this book. I'm not saying Goldberg's book was perfect, but it is clearly more human and researched. I do not recommend this book to anybody who uses their brain, and actually thinks about issues rather than taking somebody's word for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Back Cover","review":"To be honest, the most useful piece of information in the book, and the most telling comment regarding the author's attitude, is on the back cover, where he references the \\"unforgivably successful\\" book by Bernard Goldberg that inspired this tome. That's the liberal mindset after all: ANY success is unforgivable. After reading the back, I put the book back on the shelf and bought Goldberg's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy \\"101 People Who Are Really Screwing America\\"","review":"This Huberman birdcage liner or cup coaster, or whatever it is, is completely incoherent.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Small Sectional","review":"This sectional is a lot smaller than the picture makes it out to be. Look at the pic of the ottoman in the picture by itself and then in the pic with the couch and you can tell it's smaller than it appears. If there was a person in each seat your feet would literally be on top of each other. The material looks/feels durable, but it isn't soft like chenille. The color is hard to describe...it looks like industrial 70's fabric...some olive, some brown, there's even little flecks of blue and red in the ribbed areas. I drove over 2 hours to see it in person and I'm glad I didn't order it! I would definitely buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Westwood Sectional Review","review":"We are very please with this sectional. It is very spacious and comfortable.

The wood board with handles I was using was aggravating these wounds, so I wanted something more flexible. This board is perfect for me because it is flexible and makes for a smooth transfer. I transfer with ease between my wheelchair and the bed, car, and commode. I cannot walk or stand, however, I have strong upper body strength and a husband who is always close by when I'm transferring. Even though I can use this board easily by myself, it would not be good to use for individuals who are weak or unstable by themselves because it is so slick. But as long as a person is not weak or unstable OR has a caregiver to help, it's a great transfer board which works well with wheelchairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Clean recording microphone. Great value for money spent. Pretty good in both Omni and Cardioid settings. Picked up vocals, including the sotto voce phrases that accompany blown parts.

No way am I not going to take a chance of something that's odd and two people loved. The guy who hates it may be right, but comedy is too important to let other people cut me off from it.

Totally out dated!

But, with \\"METAL HEART\\", ACCEPT made it clear that they were changing...for the worse !

This one does not come with the belt however, so make sure you have it if you're just going to order this disc. I'm sure the workout would work without the belt but it wouldn't really work your abs any extra. It has three separate workouts of 1, 2 and 3 miles, each with warm up and cool down, and all use the belt. Good workouts, and using the belt does increase the use of your core.

This is keyboard heavy, half ballads, with songs that repeat three words over and over.

For their third release, they decided to crank up the keyboards and go for a much poppier sound. Now I guess that would be okay if the songs were catchy, but they mostly aren't. I do like \\"The Wild And The Young\\" even though it is much too slick and overproduced. I also enjoy \\"Put Up Or Shut Up\\" as a good, dumb rocker. But that's it.

Seems like everyone made efforts to go heavy on the keyboards in 1986: Judas Priest, Keel, and Iron Maiden just to name a few. Being a huge Quiet Riot fan, I can find some redeeming value in this effort, but it is keyboard driven as opposed to guitar driven, and it seems like Carlos Cavazo was only needed for his solos and no riffs.

He spends quite a bit of time showing how Gentiles are never referred to in Scripture as Jews or Israel. This is the only reason I give it four stars out of five, only because I'm still not 100% convicted that he is right--but he certainly does a commendable job of making his case.The Jew/Gentile issue is not the main focus of this book however-- Newness is.

Certain premium channel providers may not use the blocking signal yet from what I have heard. But the majority do, so beware. It will allow recording of these channels to the VHS tape but not the DVD. Most other brands of recorders will allow DVD recording with no blocking. Sony is automatically assuming we are all pirates. I am recording these channels (which I am paying a premium price for) for my own personal use. I consider this \\"fair use\\" of the video. I erase them then record again.

It does not matter if I feed real time from the PC thru the camera port or record to the camera first and then try to make a DVD. A call to Sony support was a waste as I was told that as long as I edited the material, it would give me the error. When I complained that that was a lousy way to design a product they hung up on me.

I called Stanley-Bostitch Tech Support and they said the o-ring in the trigger valve failed and was probably because Amazon had it on the shelf too long which caused the o-ring to dry out!!!

After Prodigy's very avergage solo CD and the dissapointing Infamy LP, Prodigy and Hav have suddenley become recharged... with some of their best energy in years. Murda Muzik was a masterpiece, mostly because Havoc crafted some of his best production. But I must say the beats on this album are a great combo of Mobb's early, funk & bare drum tracks with the post-Murda Muzik more operatic, sonic beats Hav has been perfecting for the past couple of years. On the rhymes tip, why couldn't Prodigy rap like this on his solo?

Sonics, however, though not bad, are not ideal, making it difficult to clearly differentiate every strand in the more complex portions, such as the triple fugue that concludes the \\"Gloria\\". On the other hand, if one adjusts the volume upward in order to be able to clarify the solo, ensemble, choral, and instrumental lines in the Mass, the solo organ interludes can become thunderous. 5 stars for the music, 4 1/2 for the performance, and a hair short of 4 for the sonics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you--that's me!","review":"I have been retired over a year now and have read the book twice--underlining and starring many of the passages.

These 2 cops sell cocaine to dealers, kill them and then throw away the drugs but they make a mistake when they kill a DEA Agent instead of a dealer.

His forays into anything else come off as useless, by comparison. He's just walking through the occasionally inventive script, and likely was rooting for his paycheque at the end of each shoot.The film itself is less than a rental, and only 2Pac fans will pay money for this.

There is some good information on how to decipher how old sign is, but this completely ignores the fact that there are so many potentially different environments. (Not every place in the world will have worm castings and spiderwebs to help us gauge the time for example.) The book appears to be aimed at a long-term tracking session, and doesn't seem to consider that there are situations that will take less than a day.

It had neither the depth to be considered as a scholarly work nor the level of characterization for a fictionalized history.The main character remains, throughout the work unknown and undeveloped.

Maybe if the author had named the book \\"An Overview of the Early Years of Court During the Reign of Louis XIV\\" I would not have been so let down. The author spends relatively little time focusing on Athenais and too much time on the other court players. I came away not having learned anything new about this intriguing woman. Further, the impression I got is that the author did little new, in-depth research and just spewed out well-known facts, dates, and names. While it is not a terrible book, if you have any prior knowledge of the reign of Louis XIV, then I would not recommend this book as it is only a reiterration of commonly known facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievable (one-star for jawdropping shallowness)","review":"Well i do think i've seen it all, tho i never thought i'd see the day where a woman, known in her own time to be, at the very least, manipulative, scheming and cruel, at worst a possible accomplice to murder, lauded and fawned over as some sort of feminist heroine.Athenais de Montespan had nothing likeable about her, certainly no traits to encourage any woman to take her up as role model. She was not misunderstood. She was despicable.The author has, sadly, placed countenance over content; but then again, that is modus operandi in the world of fashion, glam rags et al.The descriptions of Athenais de Montespan in Anne and Serge Golon's \\"Angelique\\" series (romance novels no less, but well researched) offer better insights than this book, as do previous bios on Montespan.I recommend readings on du Pompadour or Marie-Antoinette instead, the latter of whom was indeed misunderstood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I purchased this book some time ago and after several attempts to \\"get through it\\" chalked it up as a sunk cost: Publishers Weekly's review on this web site is generous.

The first couple of chapters lead the reader to believe that the book is well-written and interesting. The truth is that Lisa Hilton's writing style is extremely erratic and well, the exact opposite of a 'page turner'.

Gay didn't write just another British working-class grumble about real or fancied oppression by everybody in sight, as this production has it. He crafted a sly, funny dig at the upper classes as aped by the lowest: outcasts, thieves and scalawags. Until Jonathan Miller's \\"rehabilitation\\" it was a very funny, even romantic, little piece. Anthony Powell, in his autobiography, dwells nostalgically on the charm it cast every time a new production was mounted every 20 years or so. Or at least did cast until this latest--which should finish it for good. It may be politically unimpeachable but artistically it is witless and mendacious.The now unobtainable Olivier version, marred only by Lord Laurence's decision to sing his own part, may well be the last to respect Gay's original intent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect High Style...","review":"Don't expect to understand a word of either the songs or the dialogue, unless you have some expertise in comprehending an assortment of inarticulate low-life dialects, enduring assorted varieties of mumbling, and catching lines made inaudible by background music. This film would benefit from having subtitles posted, in John Gay's English.So much about the film is lovely--the settings, the costumes, the music (both vocal and orchestral). The satire would be superb as well, if the actors weren't so concerned with clowning and calling attention to themselves.The production overwhelms the viewer with its attempts to capture the \\"realism\\" of the bar and the brothel, and the cast seems to believe that the spectators won't get the jokes if they are presented with any subtlety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Knight Rayearth Sunrise","review":"Rayearth is a fantastic series about three school girls, Hikari (Shining), Umi (Ocean), and Fuu (Windstorm). The three unlikely trio start to cooperate with eachother, have less fights between themselves, and we learn more about them individually.

I first heard Truls play in recital five years ago and was stunned by the incredible range of his technique, including unbelieveable variety of vibrato and bow control. And so much the more that it never approached idiosyncracy, but rather, all added to a musical quality in performance I have since rarely seen. (Evgeny Kissin at the piano gave me similar pause). Mr Mrk obviously has deep feeling for the Britten Suites, and they are a wonderful showcase for his prodigious talent. I am pleased that with his recent Grammy nomination, many more will come to know the musical vision Truls Mrk shares so generously."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smooth reading...","review":"Considering a five-star rating to be perfection/near-perfection, this recording deserves a rating just slightly below. Mr. Mork's virtuosity and musicality are quite evident, and his playing is amazingly smooth and legato when he so desires. My one point of difference with his playing is the occasional loss of rhythmic certainty: listening with the sheet music in front of me, I could not tell exactly how he was counting. The rubato seemed a bit much.Despite this one difference of interpretation, I have greatly enjoyed listening to Mork's playing of what is a relatively unknown work--especially to non-cellists. But like the more popular suites of Bach, the solo suites of Britten are rich with thought, emotion, and a wonderful variety of sounds. As a cello performance major just beginning to work on the op.72 suite, I am able to appreciate the beauty of this work, and the validity that Mork's playing gives it. If you listen to this recording, I'm sure you will feel the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic lessons by Keb Mo!!!","review":"Extremely relaxed and user friendly lessons to some of Keb Mo's beloved songs.

He wonders whether or not Richard Howard may have recognized Priscilla Becker's poetry. If not, Howard has a short memory. A year before the contest deadline, he published three of Priscilla Becker's poems in the Paris Review. A few months later Howard published more of her work in the Western Humanities Review. Then, just a few months before the contest deadline, he published Becker a third time (again in the Paris Review). Prior to the Paris Review Prize contest, Richard Howard was, in fact, the only editor to have published Priscilla Becker's poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pepsi Challenge","review":"Ms Becker has gotten a lot of praise lately.

There were a few leaks in the equipment, and not because of a faulty seal where it's attached to the pipe. There is a pivot joint on the mounting bracket, that allows you to reposition the showerhead when stationary. A leak sprayed out of this joint when I moved the showerhead to a vertical/overhead position. Also, there were a few spots on the spray nozzle where it just dribbled down, instead of spraying forward. Lastly, there was a slow leak right behind the spray setting dial. I'm returning this WaterPik Shower Massage today for a refund, hence the one star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only Showerhead I Will Use","review":"I love showering. There is nothing like hot water streaming over my naked body. I can't understand how anyone thinks that baths are a mode of cleaning. Sitting there in a tepid pool of your own filth is not a pleasing prospect. After my daughter cracked my 15 year old Waterpik hand held shower massage (the 4 mode unit), I had to get another. I upgraded to this one that has 6 spray modes. The first thing you need to do when you receive it is remove the two flow restrictors that are in the shower head. You will thank me as this will make the pressure something you will look forward to every day. Who wants to deal with a stream like a piddling poodle? Not me. The other thing you need to do when you get it and remove the restrictors is to try the pulsing massage on your neck and low back. I have spinal issues and this hot massage is my daily ritual to help restore some flexibility in my back and neck. You will not regret this purchase.

Although it will take more than one bad experience to turn from Logitech, this purchase left somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth.The functionality is great. Pairs extremely well with my LG VX8100 from Verizon. However, the sound and mic quality are poor. The headset often has difficulty recognizing commands, especially the \\"YES\\" command. Frustrating to say the least.

It has a plastic cover that is easily scratched and peeled off the underlying speaker component. If you plan to put the headset in your pocket when not using it, you have to treat it like a fragile piece of jewelry, i.e., wrap it up or put it in a case. Otherwise, the earpiece cover will quickly be damaged and fall off.Returning the second one was difficult since a month had passed when the earpiece cover ripped off.

I suppose that is the most important part.Having said that about the set, the cars that come with it are amazing, and he uses them all the time.

His examples are very dated based on his home prices (all in the 48,000 - 62,000 range); and the kind of decisions his example bankers make haven't happened since before the S&L scandal.

Too many characters pour into the first chapter and by the final page I cared not one bit for any of them - there was no realism and no character development. Language is strong, backstabbing is laced throughout the book, the Christmas part is limited to a study of the tacky decorations in an Atlantic City casino. There is not a bit of charm, cleverness, or grace - ballroom dancers are represented as toupee wearing, shallow and out of touch, with partners frequently betraying each other.

However, I do not believe that elkins is leaving this task for the reader to do.

It is somewhat frustrating how slowly Douglass' books come to the US.I found this book hard to put down, with so much going on that at the end I was looking for the other books! If she can pull this together as she did the Wayfarer, this series will make a fascinating and obviously contraversial story. Though she points out that this is fact mixed with fiction, it inspired me to read a little more into this time period and get a taste for the \\"real\\" characters.There are some parts in the book which I did not like, but they were few.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed previous Douglass books or enjoys Lackeys books as well. They are both excellent writers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow story with horrible main character","review":"I have yet to finish this book mainly because I find myself struggling to continue.

One of the challenges here is to stay involved with the story even though the main character is extremely unlikable. You are pulled through the story by the plot, to see what happens, not because you actually care about what happens to the main guy. He's quite nasty and unlikable, as opposed to her other books in which you care about the travels and interactions of the main characters.The history aspect is interesting, and if you find medieval Europe tweaks your interest, it'll add to the lure of this book.So -- hooking plot, interesting history lessons, unlikeable main character, and a good story overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"The history was entertaining...","review":"The characters were not.

Thomas, a Dominican friar, is visited by St. Michael, who tells him that demons abound in Europe and that it is his life's task to stop them.

You need to buy Renee's special cards so you can tell which color group your clothes fit into.I am not even sure I really know which color group I fit into. The information on deciding your own color group is minimal: three pages. On the page devoted to which eye color fits into which category, there are NO green eyes!

My only complaints about \\"Lighting Secrets...\\" are: (A) The title should have the word \\"studio,\\" since the book does not cover natural lighting. (B) Chapter Two (pp.17-43) on the \\"Whys of Lighting\\" shows only a single lighting diagram and a single photo from each shoot. (C) The images on pages 109 and 125, manipulated using 1990 computer technology, are not very attractive. (D) The photo on p. 113 (identical to the cover) should be swapped with the photos on p. 115.

The tap water taste was markedly improved. However, after about 2 weeks, the container, the filter and the water it holds developed a very unpleasant smell. I do not see the algae, so it probably are bacteria. Needless to say, the pitcher is mostly in the fridge, nobody drinks from it directly, it just does not make sense! Washed it really well with soap again. After a few days the smell was back. Threw away the filter and bought a new one. After less than a week it is back again! I suppose the filters themselves must be contaminated, because no other explanation comes to mind. Will likely get rid of the pitcher at this point and look for another product from another company.

Still, these are supposed to be the carbon particles that filter the water, ie suck all the things we do not want to drink, so I consider this explanation poor and I am sorry to say I had to throw away the pitcher and buy another brand..Brita 42558 Aqualux Water Pitcher"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pitcher","review":"I read all of the negative reviews about this pitcher before I bought it.

Great product, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but well designed","review":"This is one of the smaller Brita pitchers. Every morning, after water for the cat, the dog, and my pills, it needs a refill. The great part is, no need to remove the top to add water. A small section of the lid tilts up for refills. No fingerprints, no smudges, no problems. It is small enough to fit anywhere in the refrigerator, door or shelf.

About a week later the filter began depositing charcoal pieces into the filtered water. I read some reviews and people had said it would go away within a couple days. The charcoal pieces kept dropping into the filtered water every day I used it. Finally I just thought it must have been a defective filter, and ordered a 3pack of new filters.When they arrived I immediately repeated the instructions. The brand new filters I had JUST bought are doing the same exact thing, except now there are charcoal pieces in both the filtered and unfiltered water containers.What is the point of filtering the water if the charcoal which removes the impurities is sitting IN the filtered water?!

We thought we would enjoy it like the old one that we had used for more than 7 years. We were wrong. Everything that was described by A. Ferguson is happening to us. The lid always come off when we try to pour water. We never attempt to pour it when the water is in the reservoir but it still comes off. It is horrible. I sent an email to Brita's customer service about our experience but the reply did not answer our question and concern. it was just a generic reply that a P.R. would do.

Just wait.","review":"As a contactee myself, I know that Hopkins is not lying, and we'll find out soon enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, but goes over the top.","review":"I think that this is great fiction, in the spirit of films such as The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity. If you read it expecting a true story, well, it might satisfy the gullible and those of Faith. It takes the reader from the unbelievable to the truly absurd. To me, it read like competent grade B sci fi, and it did surprise occasionally with some ingenious and entertaining tricks. Unfortunately, perhaps to meet page requirements, the story definitely stretches itself long and thin by the two-thirds point though the book. Although sci fi is a genre of which I'm not particularly fond, this book succeeds much of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long-winded and shaky alien soap opera","review":"I expected more from the first true book I've read about this type of phenomena. The book should have been a third of its 398 pages, because in the end, all you have is a couple of people's stories, however compelling they are, to judge for their truthfulness. The three cental figures connected to the Linda Cortile case won't reveal themselves, so we're left wondering if she made them up(by sending letters to the author) to further her sensational means. There isn't any real evidence other than a xray that used to show an object in Mrs. Cortile's nose, which is no longer there, well, because the aliens took it out. Hopkins conviction and analysis is compelling, as well as some interesting side stories. But in the end, even if the events did take place, which is possible, what happened is kinda silly. With obsessed top security agents, a wierd \\"world leader\\", and criss-crossing generational alien meetings, this should have preferably been a 30 page article."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly complex and fascinating if true","review":"I read the book three times, strolled near the apartment complex where it happened, and even spoke to some people in the building.Most didnt know anything about it although one lady told me that people told her that the street was lit up. She however,slept through the night without incident. My question to Mr. Hopkins: How come you did not make a greater effort to track down witnesses in this neighborhood where thousands LIVE? You wrote in your book that you d9id not know how. Also- Did any new witnesses come forward since the book came out? Why dont you have a website where people can ask these questions? One more- How was your witness able to sketch the area so well after seeing the object only a few minutes on the bridge? If you will not answer these and other questions people will always doubt your story. Otherwise the book is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Written","review":"Witnessed is truly one of the most bizarre and intriguing stories I have ever read. The author writes about a group of seemingly unrelated people that have a secret life involving dreams, UFO's, and aliens. The characters become aware of their relationship in a most bizarre and unexpected way suggesting a conspiracy of mind boggling proportions. The author then backs up the first bizarre account with numerous others reinforcing the suggestion that something unbelievable is going on in the world. The book does not offer any answers to the UFO puzzle and poses many more questions than it answers. The book reveals a tangent to the UFO phenomenon that has not been revealed before. Well researched and written, Witnessed is probably the most significant work on aliens and UFO's since Communion or Missing Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made leather sheath. Doesn't hold up.","review":"My original review said this was great. Well, a couple of months later, I've changed my mind. Sure, it holds and protects the knife just fine, but the sheath itself simply doesn't hold up. Very disappointing for a Victoninox product.First, the cheap rivet on the belt loop popped out. In doing so, it ripped (yes, Ripped) the leather.Next, the stitching on the sheath has started to come undone.I'm still using it, but I'm in the market for a new sheath.

They've been playing consistently since I build it and set it up in my driveway.I do have to agree with others that it took some time to build. You really need to check and make sure all part are received before starting the process.I had some trouble with the instructions that came with it. There were times that I had to stop and review the instructions a few times to understand what needed to be done. (Yes, I had to take some things apart a few times to get it right!)It will take two people to finish building it as well.Overall, this is a great product, priced competitively. The free shipping and no tax made the price hard to beat anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and does the job but prone to rust","review":"Unlike some others on here, I had no problems with the installation which took me 2 hours. The instructions recommend 2 adults to assemble, but I has no problem assembling it by myself. You do need a small table or stool to put under the goal area while you assemble the back of the backboard.My only complaint is that the goal has been up for only one week and it's already starting to rust! The hoop section has several very rusty areas and the pole is rusting where some of the paint was scraped during shipping and assembly. At this rate, I expect the hoop section may rust out in a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Instructions","review":"While this is a nice piece of equipment once it's assembled, the instructions for assembly are HORRIBLE! It took 3 intelligent men and 1 intelligent woman over 7 hours of putting parts together, taking them apart and re-assembling, and trying to figure out the illustrations included with the instructions. I won't buy this brand again if I have another choice.Sarah"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"The instruction manual is VERY poorly written, so much so that I cannot recommend this unit to anyone. The unit took 6 hours to construct, and we are still not sure if it is put together properly. Even the pictures in instructions contradict themselves. The biggest problem is the height adjustment (as mentioned in several other previous reviews). If the manufacturer put forth even 1 hour of research before releasing this product by watching a consumer put this until together, they could have produced half-way decent instructions that are actually usable. Frustrating best describes this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"Chose this after researching about a half dozen other similar hoop systems on-line. Heard Huffy systems were pretty bad, so I went with Lifetime. Installation wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Took about 2 1/2 hours, but I had some breaks in between. A little tricky setting up the hieght adjustment system, but I figured it out after two attempts. Backboard is a little shaky, but not really that bad. Other than that, it is a pretty good hoop system. Seem sturdy and looks pretty good. I paid $170 plus free shipping on Amazon. Went to the sporting good store and saw some other systems that cost $100 more (plus shipping) but they really didn't seem much better. For the money, I think this is a pretty good deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to put together - good quality.","review":"It did need 2 adults as suggested, took 2 hours to assemble.

It is a 3 hour project (again, factor in the READING time FIRST) and not too bad. My husband and son did it with minimal frustration. It is very sturdy and gets used almost everyday!

Directed by British born director Peter Chelsom. The sentimental adventures of two couples after 25 years of marriage. Very funny but one can regret that the slapstick mood of the second part of the film is a little bit too heavy. I preferred a lot the NYC scenes with the family problems of the Stoddard's to the Sun Valley scenes that feature a farcical Charlton Heston and the evanescent because empty character played by Andie MacDowell. Good surprise, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not give it a glance on the positive side?","review":"Wow... look at all the big names out there: Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, Gary Shandling, Andie McDowell, Nastassja Kinsky, Charlton Heston, Jenna Elfman, Josh Harnett... They somehow reminded me of another star-studded movie, \\"Everyone says I love you\\" (featuring Woody Allen, Goldie Hawn, Alan Alda, Julia Roberts, Edward Norton, Drew Barrymore, Natasha Lyonne, Natalie Portman...) which remains one of the best comedies ever. My point is, don't blame it on the actors. They could be at their best or at their worst (and they all got bills to pay don't they?) That being said, I believe poor movies like \\"Town & Country\\" are worth being made, just to render fairness and more value to good movies like \\"Everyone says I love you\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Adult Comedy","review":"I saw this movie on a flight from Sydney to Los Angeles and loved it. I am surprised it was rated to poorly. I am also surprised that if the cast went to every household that watched the movie in the cinemas and acted out the movie, it would have been cheaper than making the movie. Anyway, I think it is an excellent adult comedy, few of which are made today. It's a good movie if you want a laugh. I particularly like the conversation between Beatty & Shandling during their 'miscommunication' scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could rate it No Stars.","review":"Believe the rest of the reviewers when they say that this possibly may be the worst movie ever made. My review is only based on watching 1/2 of the movie because after the scene where Charlton Heston starts bellowing like a dragon, I had to turn it off or be sick to my stomach. My feeling is that movie is just too young for the actors playing the lead roles. Warren Beatty is in his 60's - yes I know that men get better as they get older, but seeing yet another movie where the husbands start to have mid life crises and start having affairs and the women are clueless is just passe at this point. These are roles that these actors can play with their eyes closed. They certainly have proven time and time again that they are talented - why did they waste their time on this drivel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing makes for a really bad movie","review":"Ok, I've said it more than 1000 times -- what makes a good movie (or TV show) is good writing; therefore bad writing makes for a bad movie. But add a bad actor like Warren Beatty and you have a horrible movie. When I first heard of this flick, I wanted to like it. I accidentally stumbled upon it last night on the Independent Movie Channel and gave it a viewing. What was crazy about it was that as each terrible scene after another happened, I couldn't stop watching this train wreck of a film. I hate to dump on a movie, but this movie was so bad that I just have to! And that's that. Wanna see a train wreck without blood and guts, then here's your chance! Enjoy.... SUCKER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what went wrong","review":"All these actors and all the pretty places they live and the marvelous houses and clothes and cars and interesting careers yet the movie is empty. Maybe you expect more from people when they get past the age of fifty. It could have been fun and flirty and silly without losing all sense of proportion. I wanted to like these people and to care but when Wareen Beatty and Goldi Hawn show up wearing the same clothes they wore thirty years ago and playing the same character they've played before you begin to feel sorry for them. Give me something new besides all the pretty things. What a fun romp this could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is very, very, very, very bad","review":"An amazing cast in a movie that ends up making absolutely no sense whatsoever. It's actually one of those really bad films that's so bad it's fun to watch. It's beautifully shot, the score's pretty good, the opening scenes are okay...but then we're left with characters with no motivation doing ridiculous things, who show up unexpectedly with no explanation as to how they got there or why they're there, and a complete lack of any sensible ending. Garry Shandling almost redeems this film. But that's a very, very, very, very big almost."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Turkey, Considering the Cast","review":"I understand completely why this movie sat on the shelf since 1998. It should have stayed there. I haven't seen a movie this poorly directed and unfunny since Breakfast of Champions. The story revolves around Warren Beatty's character, Porter Stoddard, a chronic adulterer married to Diane Keaton. Goldie Hawn and Garry Shandling play their friends also going thru marital problems of their own.The actors were wasted in the movie and should have known better."},{"rating":"1","title":"RE: Waste of Time.","review":"Unfortunately Town & Country was a total waste of time and good talent. Everything about this movie was painfully bad, from the writing to the directing to the uninspired acting of a tremendously talented cast. The movie just never took off and lacked any spark of intelligence or energy. Do not waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst. movies we've ever tried to watch","review":"This was one of the worst movies my husband and I ever tried to watch. We finally gave up and I threw our DVD away. We were looking forward to watching it because of the cast, but that just proves that you need more than very good actores to make a good movie. Nothing seemed funny to us; I find it strange that it got better reviews than \\"My Fellow Americans\\" and \\"Her Alibi.\\" We enjoyed the first one and thought the second one was cute, but they got trounced. Which might also prove that you have to be an outspoken liberal to get a good review in Hollywood?"},{"rating":"1","title":"town & country","review":"Worst film with so many stars that I have seen for quite some time.

What were these talented actors doing in a mess like this? It's thin plot focuses on marital infidelity and pompous overacting. Warren Beatty is basically playing his off-screen persona; Diane Keaton is playing the same roles she's been playing ever since Annie Hall; Garry Shandling is like a stand up comic with no funny lines; Goldie Hawn is the same Goldie from DEATH BECOMES HER; Andie McDowell and Nastassa Kinski are wasted in their superflous roles; and Charlton Heston is no Leslie Nielsen, and is about as funny as HOWARD THE DUCK.Peter Chisom's direction is pedestrian and uninspired, and the whole thing just falls flat on its incompetent face.

I have a watch specially made for Sachs Fifth Avenue, bought in 1984 for a mere pittance that is as thin as the Steinhausen watch. It, also, has a Swiss quartz movement with a date display at three o'clock, plus it has a sweep second hand that I like.The Steinhausen watch has a true thickness of about 6.5mm, which is much less than some of the behemoth's I own, but certainly isn't the world's thinnest.

I do remember thinking a lot about this flick days after I saw it. It might not have had the huge budget of studio films, but the smart filmmaking and story telling is there.I thought the main \\"Bad\\" guy in the film did an amazing job, as he not only is struggling with a great deal of guilt, but also suffering from a horrendous medical problem.

Example Goku's Kamehameha is said \\"Ka may-ha-may-ha\\" not Ka maya maya! Also for those of you that care Piccolo's signature attack is not called \\"Special Beam Cannon\\" It actually is Hell's Light.

I've watched most all of the Namek saga on TV and think it's absolutely wonderful. Having to read subtitles are boring and a waste of time. I can't imagine Krillin, Gohan, Goku, and especially Vegeta with any other voice than what they have in the American Cartoon Network version. The actor portraying Vegeta is doing an wonderful job with the charactor and I hope they use the same voice when they dubb the new episodes in the fall. I think everyone should stop yelling at the producers of the American version for cutting out all the violence and language and be glad that this blast of a show has come overseas to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"It could use a little more action","review":"This is the saga with the least action in it. I mean, it does have it's good points, like it has the end of the Goku and Vegeta battle, and watching Vegeta destroy all of his old rivals is just plain fun! But, the saga does'nt have much action besides that. And if you started watching the new episodes first like I did, It'll take you a while to get used to the voices in this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was brought into the US , but . . .","review":"I cannot blame the people who wrote and censored the \\"americanized\\" dragon ball z , episodes for making it a cheasy Pokemon esque type of anime .

If it weren't the effort of Funimation to even bring Dragon Ball Z into an \\"American-children-audiance\\" genre I would give this a -1 star if they had it . As you can see by the \\"real\\" fans that this was way censored , I mean theres so many goofy lines that its sad . Take for example on one of the episodes , like when the news chopter was blasted by Napa , Teinshin yelled out , \\"wait they are ok , I see them with parashutes!\\" when you can clearly see the chopter is burnt to bits . Well if you are an anime fan and want to see why Dragon Ball Z is great , then I would recomend you to try and find an uncut version of Dragon Ball Z. By saying Uncut I mean its realistic , better in story , and plain out good ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Junk","review":"Please, this dubbed anime is even worse than Sailor Moon in English.

Arthur's Perfect Christmas, however, was a disappointment. The show is very ambitious as it touched on Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Christmas and even, St. Lucia Day. I think it focused so much on the being all inclusive that it didn't do enough to explore the positive, non-commercial aspects of Christmas. Instead, the secular way of celebrating Christmas is explored with one character's family (Buster's)deciding not to celebrate the Christmas holiday at all because they find it \\"too exhausting.\\" (Nice solution.) Arthur frets over his shopping list. D.W. pines away for the year's hot toy while everyone else in Elwood City seems to be celebrating alternative holidays.I think that Christmas was not portrayed in a very positive light in this video. The end result was that Arthur's Perfect Christmas didn't feel very Christmas-y.

It's great to pull out on a rainy/snowy days. The dvds help to reinforce scientific terminology and stimulate conversation. You just need to keep in perspective that it is an imagined story about about each of the species and subscribes to the current theory that dinosaurs were more closely related to birds than reptiles. The colors and sounds are vivid and hold your attention. Another nice feature is that if you have a multi-disc dvd player, all five will play in order.

It sounded like a completely different band. \\"The Doctor\\" showed a patient on life support. Give it a pass, and pray it remains out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least It's Better Than Lap of Luxury!","review":"But that's about all you can recommend on this one, a late/mid-eighties offering from the Tricksters that showed the group struggling for new ideas. Any new ideas. They wound up going the new wave/techno front with a heavy (over) reliance on synthesizers. Still, you can't exactly say the album is boring. Actually, it's more strange than anything. But at least at this point CT was still writing (for the most part) their own material, and Rick Neilsen's typically oddball sense of humor lyrically is well evidenced here. That aside, the bottom line is that there is one good song on this entire album, the undeniably catchy \\"Kiss Me Red\\".

Too much 80's production kills it, but I gave it 2 stars, because they had a few good songs in, \\"It's Up To You\\", \\"Take Me To The Top\\", (Should of been a radio hit) and \\"Good Girls Go To Heaven (Bad Girls Go Everywhere)\\". The rest is almost worthless.

WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THIS ALBUM, AND THAT THE STUFF WAS NOT STRONG LIVE. AND HE IS RIGHT, BECAUSE THAT IS THE DOCTORS' APPEAL. IT WAS A DIFFERENT ALBUM FOR TRICK TO MAKE. THEY WENT INTO IT WITH GREAT IDEAS, AND IT BECAME THE DOCTOR. JUST WANT EVERY ONE TO KNOW THAT THIS ALBUM GOOD, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS TRICKS OTHER RELEASES.

Gayle's book lists at $14.95 (but I got it for less!) vs. $24.50 for the other book. At a time like this, I need to hang onto every penny I've got.

Its a super weak product, I mean with all the touch screen moving technology out there. I feel like its a Radioshack product.

But, how many of those 80's action were as fun and funny as The Running Man? This is one of my favorite Arnie movies, after the Terminator films. If you have read the Stephen King book but have not seen this movie and are planning too, I have one suggestion:forget the book. The movie has a higher entertainment value. When Arnie gets his revenge on the host of the show, you will feel like laughing and standing up and cheering. Jesse Ventura's appearance is absolutely hilarious and has an extremely high 'I don't blame for being angry one bit' factor. When you see the movie you will understand what I mean. Maria Conchita Alonso's character is also extremely likable. And Arnie is surprisingly fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Mindless Dose of Arnold-Packed Silliness","review":"This is a tricky one to critique, because it's devastatingly stupid in every single imaginable way, but that's also precisely what makes it such a silly, reckless good time. In many ways it's the prototypical Arnold Schwarzenegger action vehicle: tons of bad one-liners, genuinely awful action sets, a romantic subplot with zero chemistry and a retreaded sci-fi premise are only the most glaring notes on its loaded rap sheet. That he's backed by two of the genre's most notorious overactors in Jesse Ventura and Jim Brown just amplifies the insanity, while a carefree, pun-loaded screenplay is only too happy to take advantage. Former Family Feud host Richard Dawson is noteworthy as the conniving silver age comic book villain behind the whole mess, a role he clearly loved playing. Mind-numbingly simple and eye-poppingly profane, it's the best bad movie you'll see all month."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a \\"so what\\" kinda film","review":"This is a pretty run of the mill formula flick, with nothing whatsoever to add to the genre of dystopias that are fragile enough to be destroyed by a single toughie. While I admit that I used to enjoy these films for the action and explosive violence as a kid, I have seen so many as an adult that they bore me to no end.

It's about the way prisons will be in the future, game shows, reality shows, and it shows that these shows work and no one wants to go to prison. Sadly this will never happen b/c Liberals see prison as a place to put victims while they wait to get free lawyers to bail them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the idea of this story read the book","review":"This movie is a typical Arnold 80's flick. Bad acting, loads of action, and God awful one-liners that you have to crack a smile at. This film does do a major injustice to the story that was original written by Rich Bachman/Stephen King. The book was far more a better story to be told. Ben Richards was no wrongly convicted criminal but a desperate man trying to save his family, a sick and dying child and a wife who sells who body so the family can have money. The story goes way more into the corruption of the government and Ben Richards adventure is breathtaking while Arnold's Ben is just boring and predictable. If you are interested in this idea for a story don't waste time with the film, it shouldn't even use the same title as the book because they are only two things that both have. A main character named Ben Richards and a corrupt government controlled gameshow that kills the contestants.

When I selected the DTS option, there was no DTS trailer at the beginning of the feature. Having the DTS trailer there is a hallmark of quaility.

Except for his choice of wives, such as his niece Agrippina (too bad about that. It gave the world Nero. Oh, and Messalina, the party girl!) he did rather well. And Vespasian himself, who would have thought! He brought stability to the empire, paid off the debts, put a tax on urine, and got to sleep with Antonia Caenis as well.

It's an interesting concept, but it's a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible implementation of a good design","review":"I have a comparable product that I got some time ago, and it works great, but has no eraser. I decided to try this one out for the eraser. However, I was severely disappointed with this pen's design.The top and bottom halves, like most pens, separate so that you can replace pencil lead & ink cartridges. However, unlike most pens, the top and bottom of this pen do NOT screw together securely -- it's a pressure fit, with a slight lip, that does a terrible job of keeping the pen in one piece. A good deal of pressure on the button at the top will cause the bottom of the pen, at best, to loosen a little, and with enough pressure, will eject the bottom of the pen casing completely, sending you scrambling to reassemble it for use. Similarly, using the button to advance the pencil lead is impossible -- all it does is push the bottom half of the casing off the pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your money . . .","review":"After 1 week of use the barrel started to separate.

Even the Belkin website seems to say so, but its just clever advertising. When you get the product, there is no eraser on the pen, and the manual makes no mention of it.The clip does not hold to your pocket tightly, so be careful with it because it may fall. I just ran acorss the street and it fell out of my pocket and got run over by a car when the green light came on again, which is why I'm here buying another one.Otherwise, it's a great pen and a great buy compared to similar products out there.

And it stays in position much better than a ski mask. It also allows for better vision than a ski mask. I wear mine with the black side out as the \\"glow in the dark\\" side looks like something for Halloween. I would have given this 5 stars, but the Velcro fastener was positioned so that it would only properly fit someone with a very large head, or perhaps a woman with lots of hair.

If that sounds like you, then go out and buy this film today! Dunne plays a small town writer who writes a steamy novel. Douglas plays the book's illustrator who tries to get Theodora to cut loose and stop letting her stifling town control her. Well she does just that, with sidesplitting results.

Worst, the attacks consist of irrelevant information about intimate details of Marx's life that may be inaccurate or mere gossips. Sure, it is perfectly right to include biographical data in a book like this one, but it is dishonest and false to use this data only to disqualify thoughts and theories.It is very clear that the author is severely biased against this social thinker. It contains some interesting information, though. If you read this book, you should look also for a counterpart from a serious scholar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for a basic understanding of Marx","review":"This is an excellent book to read if you want to get a basic understanding of Marx; how he lived and his ideas. Even though Marxism is a failure, a certain percentage of the population will always believe in his idea of a Utopian society. One that would not need a central government, money, etc. Marx believed you could reach such a state in three stages, but Marxism couldn't make it past stage one.

Sure, the cover photographs (with band members dressed in gaudy leather) have been, perhaps rightfully, derided, but when you ignore the image the band was projecting and focus on the music, you're in for a treat. I can honestly say I like every one of the songs on this album, although highlights include \\"Heartbreak Beat\\" (the album's most successful release), \\"Shadow In My Heart\\", \\"Angels Don't Cry\\", \\"Midnight to Midnight\\", and the excellent closing track \\"No Release\\". Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor effort from a great band","review":"This is the worst Furs album -- everything else they ever did (and including the 2 albums by Love Spit Love) was fantastic.To me, it feels like a tired effort -- an attempt to milk the late 80s glam image of the Furs' when they no longer had the heart for it.It also alienated a lot of their original fans, so that the critics unfairly panned the Furs 2 great albums that came afterward in the 90s, as well as the 2 great Love Spit Love albums.If you like top 40 with a slight alternative edge, you might like this. But if you really want to know what the Furs were all about, start with a different album, and add this one only when you feel you've got to have them all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only disappointment from this amazing band...","review":"Unlike most bands that end on a bad note, The Furs fortunately hit their bad note, this album, slightly more towards the center of their career. They then recovered from this pop-crap to end with two more awesome albums, Book of Days, and World Outside.I'd say buy every album except this one.

God is an idiot, authorities and law enforcment are just there to stop you from having a good time. Because God and the police know how to have a good time but, they just don't want you to have one. Right?WAKE UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Christian Right has trying to reach him with and why.","review":"The Christian Right does not hate Manson. We Love Manson. We love him so much that we want to share the truth of the Gospel with him in the prayer that Our Heavenly Father might bring Manson to Himself through His son Jesus Christ. If Manson would only turn from his sin and repent, see Jesus as the Lord of all things that He is, and believe the Father raised Him from the dead then he would understand the love we have for him brought about by our love for Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is pretty messed up!","review":"I dont really agree with Marilyn Manson, the choices that he made, or even him at all. I borrowed this book from a friend, and I was surprised at some of the stuff that he said. I mean, he actually sounded intelligent! But I still did not like this book, it tells why he is the way he is. But if you're really curious; I'll tell you. He is messed up and you should not buy this book unless you are messed up as bad as he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not impressed... sorry","review":"Ok, I am a fan of what I have heard of Manson's music (I have \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" and \\"Mechanical Animals\\"),but his book simply left me bored and unmoved. He is intelegent, but not THAT intelegent. Some of his ideas and beliefs are good,but simple. I truly expected more. One phraze that kept popping in my head throughout the book was \\"yeah right!\\" His description of his life is just too over the top. Until I began reading the book I truly did not think he was a fabrication,but I now have to wonder. Don't waste your time or brain cells on this book, stick with decyphering the social commentary he puts in some of his songs (the ones that aren't strickly commercial)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manson","review":"This book went into great detail about his life. It had every littel detail about him but, it had strong languge. I never skiped any pages and It never Had a boring part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astoundingly Enjoyable Book About the #1 \\"Shock Rocker\\"","review":"This book is an incredibly enjoyable, no-holds-barred journey into the scarred, tainted heart and soul of Mr. Brian Warner, known famously as Marilyn Manson.Manson's incredible intelligence and insights abound, but his darkest moments are wonderfully mentioned with a wry, dark wit and humor that help to humanize the man behind the myth, as they say. His tongue-in-cheek humor and ability to mock himself is incredibly funny, but it is never overdone, and is offset nicely by his unapologetic, description-laden tales of drugs, sex, and rock and roll decadence.Too many times, artists' autobiographies seem as though they were written by someone other than the artist theirself - such is NOT the case here. The writing has Manson written all over it, and even those who are not fans of Manson's music are sure to get a delightfully, sin-filled thrill out of reading this literary masterpiece. A wonderfully entertaining, enlightening read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Read","review":"This was definitely worth the read. It gives awesome insight to such a misunderstood individual who seems to just be trying to figure out where he fits in the grand scheme of things"},{"rating":"1","title":"F*** Neil Strauss and his bullshit hack approach to human life","review":"I liked most of the man behind this book. I enjoyed the unfettered romp around the US in a drug filled frenzy, but it was hard to get past the shadow writer Neil Strauss who also wrote \\"The Game\\" and several articles for Rolling Stone. Seriously, F*** that guy! He writes for 8th graders. Target audience. And do you know what? He succeeds at what he does because people don't want originality, depth or intelligence.I'd like to try my hand at a Marilyn Manson Biography with an older and more disillusioned Mr. Manson and really make some people uneasy. Cut a bit deeper and bring out a more refined hatred for existence. Perhaps someday..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense!","review":"This book is very intense and descriptive. It is well written and I could not put it down. I wanted to stop reading at several spots, but could lay it down. It's like a train wreck. You feel bad for looking but can't stop lol!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Warner to Marilyn Manson","review":"I have been a Marilyn Manson for a long time. Reading this book got me to better understand him and it changed the way I thought about things like religion and people. Being a 14 year old and making big changes in my life I can relate with Brian Warners change into Marilyn Manson. Of course, his change is a bit more disturbing than mine is. As I read about his philosophies, and childhood I better understand his music and what it is meant to mean.I would recommend this book to any body. I think most people can relate to Mr. Manson. This book is a page-turner that hooks you from the beginning and keeps you reading. He tells his story in so much gruesome detail that you can feel like you are there with him. This book is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book rocks","review":"this is a really well written book. i wasn't really big fan of marilyn manson before i read the book. i really loved that marilyn didn't write any 'i am perfect, i've always been, i always will' kind of thing...while reading about him as a kid i was amazed how similiar i have been/i am. the book also looks really cool, unlike most biographies (read MANY, i can tell you that) it has many pictures, mostly b/w, but also in color. so five stars and both thumbs up for marilyn!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written auto-biography depicting manson at his best","review":"In this book, manson is depicted as a misunderstood child and adult. It shows his struggle with Christian activist groups that started back in his roots in Florida roots continuing until today."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my new bible","review":"This is a book better than anything about a certain hypocritical religion we all know and disapprove of.(for those of u ignorant souls out there, im talking about christianity)This is a great look into his heart and soul. Manson has suffored a great deal in his childhood. And people will soon someday see the light and accept Marilyn Manson as our lord and savior!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Zero Circle of Hell","review":"This book cleared the way of Manson into the lives of America. Now, all the Moral Right will have an avenue of attack besides second-hand knowledge. I still find it humorous that all of the negative messages are from supposed \\"Christians\\" and do not have one forgiving bone in their body. I feel for Manson on the grounds that people exploit his Satanic (read: humanism) beliefs and have never even read the Satanic Bible. Also, he exposes the \\"American Dream\\" for what it is: FAKE"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written","review":"This book is one of the best ever written.It has everything, It's sad, funny, scary and wonderful.And the best part is that it's real. You get to see pictures of some of the persons he talks about and it's very well written.I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hate Manson? Read this anyway!","review":"I'll start this review off by saying that I'm not a huge Marilyn Manson fan or anything. I like him as a person, and most of his music, but nothing major. What does this have to do with a book review, you're thinking? Well, I didn't think I'd like this book very much, but I was proven wrong. The book starts out dealing with his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. This is how it all started. It's a disturbing, dark, and true tale. Marilyn Manson's addicting read should be followed by a novel, or more books, considering he's a very good author. Neil Strauss just contributed things, he didn't write. A bonus for the book is that it had about 5 pages of color photos, and alot of black and white ones throughout the book. Needless to say, this is a very original book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected so much more.","review":"This book was awful. I thought that there would be more insight into Marilyn Manson the performance artist, rather than page after page of his drug induced disgusting sexual sadistic escapades. So he grew up with a strict christian upbringing. Big Deal. So his grandfather had hidden porography. So What. The story never gets any deeper than that.I can't even tell you when or why he started a band, or how he even found out that he had an acceptable singing voice. If it's there, I didn't see it.I'm not one to be easily turned off by rock-star decadence, but some of these incidents bordered on such a level of sadism that I was apalled that these situations were even put into print.Total garbage, and a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutly Disgusting","review":"I bought thid book because I absolutly loved Manson! Some other people said that it was sick, but I didn't listen to that, because I loved him so much, and thought they knew s**t. If you are a big Manson fan, and are saying that too, beleive me on this one! If you like to read about Manson picking off bugs from his d**k, grandpa's masterbating, losing virginity, and other sick sex, well this is for you. If you're a big Manson fan like I am, just stick to the CD's. Trust me on this one, and you'll be glad.I still like him, but not this book. Oh, one more sick thing. Marilyn and Twiggy, (by the way I think Twiggy is the hottest guy on this Earth!) are left deserted, both naked in cold snow. They dig up dead bones, and bring them on the tour with them. This book did however have a couple of good points about his tragic childhood. Stick to Manson's Cd's this time! Twiggy is soooooo hot!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This misery sculpture is carved from my own flesh...","review":"Well, I was kind of surprised how normal his life was after all. Lots of cool pictures I never saw before. Insights into lines that were always abstract like the kneeling on broomsticks and all that. I sort of hate him for going around and doing these book signings where you have to stand in line with your receipt from the Virgin Megastore but he did say he would betray us now, didn't he?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should actually be rated in NEGATIVE numbers.","review":"There is no way to adequately summarize or convey the utter pretentiousness, humorlessness, stupidity, and vanity of this book. O.K, for all you \\"Satanists\\" out there who think this creature is \\"the bomb', let me just say that he is pretentious, solipsistic, full of counter-productive pride, and totally lacking in aesthetics.The fact that he wormed his way into ole'Antons confidence may only be evidence that \\"baldy' had finally started to totally \\"lose it\\". There are uses for this book. For one thing , one could always grind all remaining copies into pulp and use them as fertilizer. For another, one might give a copy as a gift to ones worst enemy, but that would be far, far, too cruel. PLEASE, Marilyn, go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I have purchased a second hand book from the seller. But the condition was pretty bad.

It's quite probaly the best book i've ever read. His life made mine boring in comparision with its uncommon events, amazing moments and often disturbing times such as his grandfather's basement...and ending with a quote from the back cover of the book \\"The best rock autobiography...since Iggy Pop's I Need More\\", how true."},{"rating":"2","title":"very intellectual","review":"i hate reading but i have read this book so many times its not funny. i even got my sister-in-law to read this book and gain respect for brian warner. he is a very intellegent and talented man, and this book lets you know all about him. read this book you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read","review":"This bio was easy to read and gave Manson an almost human-like appearance. He doesn't hold back when speaking about his drug use but he only eludes to his on stage antics we know him for. I personally do not like him, not because of what he represents, but because he preaches independence, self worth, and knowledge but criticizes others for the choices they make in their own lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading, if you can stomach it","review":"This not very happy, it's not written to make you think Manson is a good person. His childhood wasn't happy and it won't really end on a note that provides closure. Much like his music the movie can provide you with some pretty intense imagery, but after the shock value of some of his statements has worn off your left with someone who is pretty insightful about himself and others and you realize how much deeper the rabbit hole goes.I listen to some of Manson's music but not a lot of it, I had to read this book for a college and it was enlightening and I think I like Manson so much more now then I did before, if for no other reason then this book makes you understand how much his music really means to him. Is he a good person? No. Does he know that? Yes. I think this book gives you a good look at what goes on in the minds of some of the people society has tried to disassociate from as much as possible and I don't think that is ever a bad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"All he does is complain!","review":"I love his music but really all he does is complain about society and do drugs and terrible things to girls"},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opener!!","review":"This book gives an interesting insight into the person behind the persona.Although I am not a huge fan, I have always been intrigued by MM.

She kind of scared me a little with all that! Now years & years later, I am an avid fan of Manson. I got the book on a whim, I had just seen him live for the 3rd or 4th time & thought I'd like to finally read it since it's been out for so long. So when I ordered my husband's birthday presents I ordered the book for myself. I could not put it down!This is a captivating book! I find myself looking at 'Manson' now as Brian, a human who feels, loves, & hurts. With this telling of his lifestory hopefully more people will realize that he's just trying to open your eyes to the hate & craziness around you, not bring it into your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"amusing..how much better does it get?","review":"i bought the book soon after it came out because i am a big manson fan. this book was awesome! i mean...even if you dont like manson this book is still interesting.my favorite part was when(back in the old days before anti-christ) they went to disneyland on acid. heh..down with the \\"sheep\\" hail the blessed cow ;) l8r kids"},{"rating":"2","title":"eye-opening biography","review":"I have listened to Marilyn Manson's music for three years now, and this book cleared up several misconceptions and ideas about Manson. The story presented in the book is very compelling.

Any persons who cannot in some way identify themselves with Mr. Manson are most certainly the freaks of nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that changed my life!","review":"I hated Marilyn Manson before I read this book. I thought he was evil, stupid, gross, dumb, sick and, inhuman. But his words in this book changed my heart toward him and it will change your thoughts and beliefs about him too! READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opening Acurate Account on MR. MANSON","review":"Never in my right mind would I have ever thought of respecting Marilyn Manson. But now I do, all owed towards this funny and entertaining book of his. This guy is was drug-addicted and maybe a bit insane also, but this book made him a much more appreciable person to have on our planet.How 9 inch nails covered them in vaseline, catsup, and other junk, then had the security drive them for 1/2 an hour somewhere, then ditch them naked in a snowy area, leaving Manson's gang to beg college students for a ride back. They drove into a cemetary, stole some bones, then Twiggy dragged the bones around them on tour that whole year. These acts and scenes are scary and dangerous accounts that opened up my narrowminded thinking. A change for me as a person and human being on our small little planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian pulls no punches","review":"If you have ever had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Manson on the Howard Stern show you will know what his book is like. He pulls no punches and just tells it like it is. His honesty is greatly appreciated. His book is a lot like Mr. Sterns two books in the sense that it's like he's just sitting down in front of you telling you a story and not bullshitting you in any sense. He doesn't care about how he comes across and he doesn't care what he says about 'famous' people. He just tells you what transpired and what he tells you is unreal. He pulls no punches and just lays it on the line. From his early childhood years spying on his cross-dressing, dildo loving, tracheotomy wearing grandfather to his search to lose his virginity to his hellish experience in Catholic school to his pranks he played on unsuspecting victims to his dabbling experiences with drugs he tells it straight. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some disturbing parts, but otherwise very good read!","review":"I have enjoyed Manson's music since I first heard about him during the controversial release of Antichrist Superstar, so I was intrigued to read his book. He does a good job clearing up facts about his life & childhood, and while some of his tour stories can be shocking & disturbing (although maybe not as much for true Manson fans), his story is still enjoyable & very real to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Really good book, let's you get inside his twisted brain. You also learn how he got that way, and then realize how smart, sad, and lonely he really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start....","review":"Started off very interesting, and then about 1/2 way through became rambling and kind of uninteresting. It became as though he was reading scraps of paper that he had written notes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding!","review":"This book was fabulous. I couldn't put it down, literally! I read through the whole thing in a matter of hours. It really delves into his mind and his history without holding anything back. I just with there was a new novel from him coming out to cover the last decade or so. If you like other books like \\"The Dirt\\" or \\"Slash\\", I suggest Manson's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For Manson Fans","review":"This book takes a close look at the life of Marilyn Manson. From the early childhood of Brian Warner to the life of Marilyn Manson now, this book explains in explicit detail events that have taken place throughout his life. Learn what has gone on (from his point of view) backstage and in his personal life. It includes pictures of Manson and people involved in this strange tale. Like me, you won't be able to put this book down. And once you have finished reading it you will only love Marilyn Manson even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brian Warner's Divine Comedy","review":"Though this book was probably meant to be a declaration of Brian Warner's self-proclaimed brilliance, it is instead a moronic exploration into the life of a decaying human being. This person obviously has a very limited view of philosophies, which can be evidenced through his excuse of explaining away his ignorance with the statement that he is a contradiction. The contradiction seems to extend into the area of his fluctuation between being a \\"superstar\\" and being a common cocaine addict. His discovery of self is a delusional one that folds back onto itself until he realizes that he has not moved the slightest bit forward in his quest to know himself. The book itself is a pitiful attempt to exhibit just how shocking a person can be if they wither away in front of millions while yelling the words, \\"performance art\\". In the end, all one can do is feel pity for this sad human being while discarding his book as an empty vessel of self-hatred masked as discovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Feared and Revered Superstar in the Country?","review":"\\"from the pit of despair to the top of the charts, and recounts his metamorphosis from a frightened Christian schoolboy into the most feared and revered music superstar in the country.

Hardly the most revered rock star in the country. Hardly one of the world's most dangerous rock stars. This self-adoring review is enough to keep me from spending any money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manson-fascinating guy? judging by this book nay","review":"This book was nothing more then a bunch of bullsh*t. Manson is constantly trying to make some kind of extremely philosophically profound writings and eulogies. This book was fairly well written but its message is nill however its slick enough to satisfy the simple and childish minds of his teen followers. Personally I think his songs are not bad but his image and attitude is overdone. He's not a musician anymore, just a sellout buisnessman. He's also giving bad name to real goth and goth get blamed for stupid things that mansonites do. Manson says god is dead but he sympathisez satan. It isn't any smarter not to believe in god and worship satan. So if you wont a book of slick quotes, record sellin' image creatin' fake creativity and a bunch of statements that don't make sence that gets your pondering check out this book. Or better yet go read some classics or something. Atleast those authors know what they're talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"this obviously will be misunderstood and overanalyzed.","review":"his detractors and disciples have already lost the meaning in the message. it was well-written and served its purpose splendidly. as for the posted reviews of the book, i quit reading anything above 3 stars; i wanted to focus on the detractors. sadly, they were no different than the disciples, they just thought they were. everyone knew what the focus of this book was and reading this book would do nothing to alter a readers perception of that focus.as for my own rating: giving it fewer than 3 stars will draw more attention than a screen full of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is interesting but is already out of date","review":"The book although interesting is out of date due to his sudden appearence change"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you hate /|/|arilyn /|/|anson, READ THIS BOOK!!","review":"Isn't it amazing that people bash Mr. /|/|anson even though he is only doing things like Alice Cooper, or even David Bowie have done in the past, just on a bigger scale? Wether you love or hate him, this book is a great book. There's a little something for everyone. It also makes some of his songs make more sense if you couldn't figure them out by listening to them. This book is a lot like his music in many ways, you can take your own meaning from it. /|/|arilyn /|/|anson is definately the Rock Star he sings of, the Antichrist Superstar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best...","review":"If you could only read one autobiography in your life this would have to be it.

I want to say I somewhat understand him, and in other way I don't and it makes me more curious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written book giving insight into the character MM","review":"As the press continues to print lies about Reverend Manson there aren't many sources to tell the press they are schemeing fascists who want to bring them down. But this book reveals Marilyn Manson as he is, without the lies. From his early childhood, to the experimentation with drugs, to his beliefs, the book gives insight and detail into his life, to prove how much people's hate can cause millions of people to hate one person. I couldn't put the book down from the moment I picked it up. A friend who had lowered his respect for Reverend Manson, but still liked the music changed his mind after he read the book. He told me that there aren't many books he had read and liked, but this is one of his favourite's, and I still haven't got it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Road out of Cocaine","review":"Manson's book is a self indulgent trip through cocaine addiction. Not too bad. I would like him to write a new book every ten years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read","review":"This book provides an inside look at the life of a Rock Superstar. I've been a fan of Marilyn Manson for many years, and this have me insight to his life and how he struggled that I never knew. I could hardly put it down! It's a must read, fan or not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting....","review":"Another book I couldn't put down, this book blew my mind. Wow, this guy is seriously out there, but at the same time so normal. I was moved, disgusted, humored...this book had it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're a Haughty One, Saucy Jack.","review":"There's not a whole lot to say about this book that hasn't already been said. If Manson and his ghostwriter were trying to write like Jackie Collins in black leather pants, they succeeded. But judging by Manson's philosophical posturings and the GRIM DARK title, I doubt it.I will say this though: the story of the making of Antichrist Superstar has the potential to be a brilliant black comedy. It's like \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" meets \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" with Manson himself as a black-clad Ignatius J. Reilly. Unfortunately, that would probably require more self-awareness than he seems capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight on the real story.","review":"It was great to read some of what has really happened, not only behind the scenes but to have some of the media's BS stories have a little light shined upon them.I've heard the rumors and stories, and I've been to the concerts. I'm not saying I would send my teenage kids alone, but then again, I wouldn't send them to 7-11 alone. I would however, take them to a show in a heartbeat. I was 16 when I first saw MM with the Jim Rose Circus open up for NIN and that was a great experience.Brian Warner wanted to become a performer and a rockstar, and so he created Marilyn Manson. This is a great read for anyone who doesn't know about him and would like a little insight on the man behind the makeup."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true look into the life of a genius","review":"I found this book in the trash on my block and rescued it! I am so glad that I did, because while I was always a huge fan of MM, this book opened up a whole new side of the band and it's front man to me. Not only is Brian a fantastic musician, he is also a great story-teller and writer. His childhood was twisted, his life - twisted, yet completely normal. The book is somewhat gruesome, but also shows a softer side of Brian. This book is not only a great read for fans, it is also a great read for haters and people who are not fans! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Masterpiece","review":"This book was fantastic! Ever wonder why Manson is as unusual as he is? READ THIS BOOK. I couldn't put it down. It explains it all. You wouldn't believe all the things he has lived through. This twisted tale turns out to be very insightful and is filled with true reality and wonderful thoughts and quotes. \\" The boy you love, is the man you fear.\\" is just an example. I'm not that great at writing reviews but I can reassure that this book rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manson is the Dark Knight","review":"Now THIS is rock & roll. Whether you're a Manson fan or not, this is a respectable journey of a brave free-thinker who is dedicated to his art like nothing you've seen before. The pages are PACKED with humor, terror & mystery, all wrapped in one shocking human experience. You get chills when he describes his fears, and you can feel his tears as he takes us through his tragedies.If you take nothing else from the book, you should realize this man is a dark knight, taking hatred for attempting to rattle the cages of blind conformity. The grit & grime unsurprisingly cause this to be an R-Rated book, but it's honest & open and worth the experience. This story truly is a road through hell & back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man or monster, you gotta love him","review":"I can't stand here and tell you whether or not Manson is a writer of integrity, a strong person, an intelligent person, or a person of morals and philosophies. My personal opinion is that he is all of these things. But the book held me enthralled for so many different reasons. The most enthralling moment of all was the chapter on the creation of \\"Antichrist Superstar,\\" an amazing chronicle of how a disturbed man retreated into his past (and to the beginning of his book) to escape the wretched whirlpool of his life, faced terrors about himself that had afflicted him for years, and come out stronger and refreshed, like the Antichrist Superstar described in the album (which, incidentally, meant so much more to me after reading this segment). His section on \\"The Rules\\" is a welcolme amusement that never fails to crack me up. I was truly touched by his story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"Marilyn Manson, since his induction into stardom, has been critisized by countless people who claim he is the 'anti-christ.' No matter what your opinion about Manson is, this book sheds light into the more human side of Marilyin Manson - Brian Warner. It also shows the demons of addiction and the hardships we all go through to establish our position in life. This book would certainly be deserving of 5 stars because the reading material is so interesting, intelligent, and most of all, addicting. However, trasitions from chapter to chapter are very rocky. That, along with occasional gramatical errors, kinda left me lost at parts. Thats why I only rated it a 4. But over all, this is one of the best books I've ever read and I would certainly recomend it to anyone with an open mind. You won't be disapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Most people do not understand the real Marilyn Manson. From reading this book, it is discovered very fast that he is a happy and caring person, and a humanist by all standards, probably even more so that the right wing extremists that are quicker to judge him than lighting a match. Deep down from his inner most emotions, Manson (Brian Warner) tells us of his struggles as a young man, which actually gave him the will power and vengence to make a name for himself and become a model citizen for this country, young and old. I strongly recommend this, and maybe even buy a couple copies because it is so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"THIS BOOK IS A WASTE OF TIME. I TRIED TO READ IT BUT IS DID NOT HOLD MY ATTENTION VAEY LONG. DON'T WASTE YOR MONEY ON THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although not a huge fan of Manson, thought the book would be much better. Seemed just a clinched rock star book. Nothing earth shattering here. Not terrible, but nothing great either. Read my share of music biographies and autobiographies, not all if the subjects was I a fan, this was just okay, if you are a fan you will most likely enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like this book","review":"I could not even force myself to finish this book. I like some of his music and am fascinated by his video's, but just couldn't stomach the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"i am a big fan of his music but this book shows a differnt side he is nothing but a bully and a losser if any of the stories are actuly true that is but one thing i do know is he drinks alot of his own bath water nothing like being your own biggest fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good of a read","review":"He doesnt really answer all of the accusations made against hi, if anything it leaves more questions than answers. However it does provide an inside to some of the obstacles he faced with drugs, and alcohol."},{"rating":"1","title":"The finest example of formalism I have ever seen...","review":"The packaging is excellent, dazzling, but artfully chosen...An informative read, but falls miserable steps short of genius...Its tenuity easily unfolds to an observant eye...Visible lack of nuance...No extraordinary display of subtlety... Entertaining throughout, however...Chock-full of disturbing musings, and articulate, dotty reminiscing...His previously lyrical trademark of cryptic imagery and metaphor abound here as well, and are fittingly egocentric... Conclusion: With its emphasis on the art department once again, Manson becomes our favorite Thespian. Dangerously charismatic, he is an arrow of dry wit -- unsheathed, and ready to strike. Yet his aim remains pitiably poor. This is no Beelzebub, folks. Simply raffish, teenage hearthrob. The book is a misnomer, and I suggest Memoirs of a Megalomaniac. CChaxes"},{"rating":"1","title":"and Why Not?","review":"I was curious to know his story, I didnt get much interesting views from him but I am still finding that his purpose is to shock people and blame everything on religion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"None","review":"THIS IS NOT A BOOK ITS A EPIC STUFF OR A BOOK THING STUFF EPICLY AWESOME READ OR DIE A DEADLY DEATH AND DIE BUFFY HEGDE H0G SMOSH RESIDENT EVIL FAT GUY MAYBE!#%&$"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Was Okay...","review":"This was an okay book about MM's life, childhood, and goth depravity... but just okay. As far as being a \\"how-low-can-you-go\\" type of book, David Crosby's bio \\"Long Time Gone\\", and John Phillips' \\"Papa John\\" bio were both light years better. Give either of those 2 a try before giving this one five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Short Quick Read into Hell","review":"Worth a browse in some mall bookstore, readable for about as long as it is comfortable to stand with a book in one's hand. I will admit to one real laugh that almost made the cappucino foam burst my eustachian tubes. The pics are pretty artsy. But the horrible stories of boring experiments of depravity on handicapped groupies was really too much. Not even so much as a tinge of regret evident, either. I wonder when or if he is ever going to wake up to the existential nausea of his own existence, instead of merely reacting to the banality of post-modernism. And how about more details of his granddad's basement hobbies, eh? Anyway, might be worth buying a copy just to have to take to Vegas sometime when Manson is in his 50's and playing some off-strip lounge act, you can get him to sign it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting, depraved etc","review":"I've read a few bios of rock stars (the best being \\"Life\\" - Keith Richards) and I've enjoyed them all. But this one is absolute rubbish.I truly believe half of it all is a figment of his imagination. It truly is hard reading - so I gave up. I read for pleasure. Whata retard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for everyone","review":"It's an awesome book. I've read it two times now, and I'm on my third time through. I can't put it down. I must say that it has definitely changed my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for a true fan, covers past, present, and rumors.","review":"This book explains almost anything you ever wanted to know about the controversal man in the media, Marilyn Manson. From his childhood up until the end of his Anti-Christ Superstar tour this book doesn't hold anthing back. Lastly you'll finally find out if he was a part of the Wonder Years cast or not..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I usually hate reading but...","review":"I hate to read the mear site of a book and I think oh no teachers and I start to panic but my friend got me to read this book and it was the best book ever (consedering I never read.) I think if any book good enough for me to keep reading till the end is the best dam book ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book proves how intelligent Marilyn Manson is.","review":"I felt this book was very inciteful as to how Marilyn Manson got his start in the music as well as in life. Marilyn Manson is a wonderful writer and this book proves how intelligent he really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Absorbed Drivel","review":"Followed the band over the Nine Inch Nails period so I bought the book for some light reading.I read to the end hoping that it would lead to his seeing that he was taking himself too seriously but he just never does. This is a boring, repetitive account of someone's self-absorbed, destructive adventures at the expense of other people. There are a couple of amusing parts (like his lists) but really he is trying to make a book out of nothing.Like every \\"deep teenager\\" he seems to think he is the only person to endure rough times or question anything. Luckily, most \\"deep teenagers\\" eventually open their eyes, suck it up, move on to adjust to a reasonable approximation of the life they want in the context of the world they live in.Perhaps some of his self-loathing is a fair judgment. He is proud of all the wrong things. This book is a yawn. I feel intellectually worse off for having read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"This book was definitely an interesting read, and provided a good deal of insight into the man behind the rock star persona. It balances humor, wit, intelligence, and things that just plain make your stomach churn very well. The only thing I didn't particularly care for didn't necessarily have to do with the book itself-- it's just been my opinion and experience that Manson tends to embellish: not just on his stage persona, but on almost anything with which he regales those willing to listen to him. It seemed to me that that was also the case in this book. Sure, it was an entertaining read, but it leaves me wondering how much of it is actual \\"autobiography\\" and how much of it is \\"fiction.\\" Regardless, I doubt that you'll find this book boring, so if you're looking for something new, give this a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the real thing","review":"Like a car wreck, I couldn't look away from this book. After playing music in bars in my younger days, I realized my life was pretty normal compared to this. Neil Strauss is a great writer, this book is worth reading solely for that reason. However, if you want the REAL Inferno you may want to check this out in addition:Afterlife - An Introduction to Dante's Inferno"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Very honest & open book. Sometimes very wrong but also very entertaining! Gave a great outlook on a sometimes private person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"I have to give this book 5 stars due to the fact that it kept my attention, and it was the first book I actually finished reading in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CAPTIVATING, ENTERTAINING & EDUCATIONAL DOCUMENTARY","review":"A most Interesting, Entertaining & Educational Video. I have viewed it several times and would highly recommend it to anyone. A great presentation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on Mormon Temples","review":"My wife and children love this book.
