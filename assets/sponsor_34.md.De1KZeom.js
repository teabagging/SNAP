This pilgrimage route is over a thousand years old and is still going strong. In ,fact thousands upon thousands do it every year , drawing people from many different countries. This brings to life the way people lived, walked prayed etc over 900 years ago and walking the same \\" Camino \\" today, through the same villages and towns and often the very unchanged rural tracks to Santiago de Compostela.

Do not plan to get the crystal clear audio you'd expect from digital transmission.If you plan to watch analog TV or listen to AM/FM radio and sit in the same room as the transmitter, then I guess these headphones are okay.

The last cut of meat I tasted pre-tenderizer was tough and chewy. Now the same cut from the same store, after tenderizing, was tender, more flavorful, and yes, I believe it cooked faster than I am used to.

The bugs that I have encountered are so inconsistent that it is really hard to say what causes them to occur. It seems that every so often a rollover goes dead. There is also a problem with saving different changes of files under different names... etc etc. If you go online for help -the moderators are likely to answer a question that you didn't ask and close the issue immediately.However, despite the bugs -this webeditor is well priced. If you persevere through all the issues and learn a little manual HTML -you will have a working website.However I must stress that if this were my only tool for mantaining and updating a website -I would seek another one. This is not a professional product and more suited for someone who is learning about websites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with it on Vista... better yet, don't bother.","review":"I downloaded their Vista patch, which says it fixes a problem where Vista reboots when the program is installed. Not launched. INSTALLED.Of course, installing the patch fails because it says the program isn't installed.Guess what happened when I tried installing, because I assumed the wording was due to imperfect Korean->English translation? It rebooted.No, it seems the linguistics were just fine. The logic of the programmers still leaves a lot to be desired, however. I had used this product 'successfully' on XP, but agree with the other commenters here about stability and poor customer support.Not to mention the program does generate a LOT of bloat.

And get very agrivated because she is stuck on the wall. The red tabs to secure it from rolling really cut your fingers when adjusting it. and I hate that it does not colapse. I am military stationed overseas and cannot go out to any Babies R Us and buy another one. SO we are stuck with it.I remember my niece has the Bear walker from Baby Trend. It has great toys on it and folds nicley under her crib when not in use.

The activities on the dashboard are not entertaining, unless your child likes to make noise. Mostly at about 4-6 months, babies like to chew and suck on things- and they can't do that with the tot wheels. The two items that she might be able to chew on are located on the far side of the dash board and she can't really reach them, and they pop right out of her mouth. She mostly just gets frustrated with the whole thing. We usually take the dashboard off and pile toys onto the tray. However, she loved the circular walkers with the seats that spin 360 degrees that have all the toys within easy reach. The tot wheels is a waste of money- get a walker if you're looking for something like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful gift","review":"we have an item (same name, etc., but it is different colors and has different features.)

Not only did my nephew that sat in it like it but his older brother and sister enjoyed playing with it as well..If the wheels would allow it more freedom of movenent I would have given it a higher rating.

I had read all the reviews and figured that it was worth it. I first put my son in it at 4 months old, he loved the noises and also the star just like so many people have stated. The only problem I found is 2 months later he can only inch it in forward and reverse. It is very hard to move around the house even when I am pushing it. It doesn't make turns easily and it is very wide compared to the other walkers out there. He does love the noise but can't move it, although he does have very good strenght in his legs. So to him it's the same as an exersaucer. When looking for a \\"walker\\" I would have definitly went with a smaller more mobile model."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"My daughter is 12 months today. We have had this walker for 2-3 months. She still loves it. She has snack time in front of the TV in it and I am able to speed clean. OF COURSE, I wouldn't leave her alone in it. She is pretty active - not walking yet - but she loves to climb. I don't think she could ever climb out of it, but I'm not going to chance it.We haven't had any problems with it... safety or otherwise... I started to buy the mini mastreo walker but was turned off by some of the reviews. The main reason I bought this one is, reviews on that one were mostly displeased with how hard it was to turn. This one is very easy to turn. My girl spins in circles, even on the carpet and on our wood deck!Yes, it is bulky, but have you seen a walker that's not? They have to be so that they can't be tipped over! The only problem I have with it is... there is not a volume switch.

I do really recommend this toy.

After hearing mixed reviews about the safety of walkers I was hesitant to let my son use it. When he was about 4 1/2 months old we put him in it for the first time, and he loved it! The activity tray has a great variety of toys. We also really like the fact that the tray comes off and he can put other toys or Cheerios on it. This walker is very stable and well made. At 10 months my son cruises around the house a record speeds and is just about ready to walk on his own. This toy has really let him explore the house safely. We all love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Walker-But still monitor your child","review":"This is a great product. Of course if you have it in a dangerous place (near steps) or use it in a way not intended, the child will possibly get hurt.

My 7 year old likes to push her around in it and the baby loves it!... There is a warning sign molded into the spoiler saying not push the baby in the walker...When you don't heed warnings, you assume risks, right?...As with everything, babies can still get hurt if the toy is used improperly and/or dangerously. It is a good product. My baby plays with all the attached toys and squeals with delight...just monitor your precious babies in anything they do and they will usually be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"I doubt the manufacturers age.","review":"I have this walker for my triplets and I liked it fine.

It is so LOUD that it scared her to tears. Not only that, but the noise completely dominates the whole room. Forget about trying to have a conversation or watch tv while this walker is in the same room. I brought this item back to the store the very next day. I am very disappointed as I did a lot of research on this product before purchasing. Perhaps if there were a volume control, I would then recommend it. I'm not one to write negative reviews, but this one had to be written! Way too LOUD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tip hazard","review":"I bought this walker for my baby when she was 5 months old. I had researched all of the available styles of walkers and stationary entertainers and decided this one would be best (only drawback was that it does not collapse) Everything was wonderful until last week (baby now 7 1/2 months) when she grabbed a stationary object and pulled the entire walker over on it's side. Graco informed me my daughter is too active to be in a walker, but that reasoning totally eliminates why we buy walkers for our children in the first place. I do not recommend this walker for the saftey factors of your child. My opinion is that this walker needs to be remanufactured so that it is not easily pulled over by a 17# child while they are sitting in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great walker","review":"My son is 6 months old and he loves this walker. He will sit int it and play by himself for at least 30 minutes.I really like the three tabs that come down to make the walker stationary. They really work and the walker doesn't move even on the linoleum in my kitchen. Also, while the walker doesn't fold like many of the other walkers on the market, it easily comes apart and goes back together. We took it on a trip to my mother's and it was no hassle at all. I also like that the toy panel comes off to reveal a plain base that I can add my own toys to if my son ever gets tired of the toy that comes with the walker.The only reason I did not give this walker 5 stars is that periodically one of the buttons on the toy panel just quits working. All of the others continue to work, though, so it's really not a big deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better on hard floor","review":"The walker is great and my 6 month old has a lot of fun moving around in it. Be aware that your child will probably want to walk toward you more than anything else. This can tend to hurt your feet if you are not wearing shoes. You, and your child, will notice that the walker is slower and more dificult to move on carpet than on a hard floor. This does not stop him from walking on the carpet, so it must not bother him too much. This is the stuff that I felt would have been helpfull. Given the chance to go back, I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Entertainment for babies","review":"We purchased this for our now 3 year old when she was a baby and she just loved it. It is now being passed down to our 5mo. old. who simply loves it too! She has been moving all around our house & just making all kids of noises with the activity center.

They've used it constantly since we bought one for them to try out. They love being able to get around themselves without needing adult assistance. They chase the dogs and us around the kitchen, family room, anywhere they can get the walker to go! Unfortunately, our twins' pediatric occupational therapist says we should limit their use of this type of walker. Apparently the way the seat positions them, it promotes toe-walking and makes it more difficult for babies to learn to walk properly. This was confirmed by a friend who's 1-yr old nephew used this since he was 6-months old and now walks on his toes all the time. We'll continue using it since the boys enjoy it so much, but we will be limiting the amount of time they stay in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comes in handy","review":"As a mother who takes my daughter to work with me this walker come in handy. It helps her be mobile (which she desperately wants to be) and when you put the stationary feet down double as a feeding chair since i'm limited for space in my office. She loves the toys! The high back was great when she was younger. Only problem is that for the average 5 month old a few of the buttons for the toys are hard to reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I think this is an excellent item that all parents should consider. I feel that my baby is safe and occupied the entire time he is in it. Like anything else, you must monitor your child while he or she is in it, as it is plastic and does have the possibilities of breaking or snapping, but I feel that if you do not leave your child/children unattended and make sure that your children are within the appropriate age range (and strength!) that you will be extremely pleased with this equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I got this for my son when he was 6 months old.

The coverage and organization is thought out. He obviously spent a substantial amount of time researching Flash and ActionScript, as well as associated technologies covered in the book.

I recently took the Flash Developers Exam and did not do so hot on the XML section of the test. After reading the first 5 pages in this chapter I found all the question I got wrong on the exam. Their coding styles teach you how to use the a lot of the new Flash MX features which is a huge help if you are just now coming over from Flash 5 (or earlier).

The sections that talked about application development were pretty good, but most of the booked seemed irrelevant. I think the title Developer's Guide is a little misleading. I thought Developer referred to application developer, but I guess it is referring to any Flash development. The book does cover a lot of different topics from 3D to Generator (which does not even apply to MX????). So if you are looking for a book covering a little on a lot this may be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiter!, the check please...","review":"I have no other option than to agree with some of the others here who have found it necessary to beat this book up a bit.

But so does an evil wolf named Morgra who wants to possess the sight as well. Its a complicated fantasy novel full of adventure.

That was lovely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur","review":"I wanted to like this book. I'm a huge fan of intelligent animals as viewpoint characters, and the setting was pleasantly atmospheric. Nice cover, nice feel to the book. Of course one can't judge by externals, but this one gave me nothing but positive expectations.Unfortunately, it's a clunker. The prose is clumsy and amateurish. I'd have written this book in high school. The plot points are not merely belabored, but beaten bloody. And when the wolves speak, the verb used nine times out of ten is \\"growled.\\" Okay, they're wolves. They may well verbalize in growls. But it's an annoying verb, it calls attention to itself, and it lends an inflection to the words that's often at odds with their content.If you like intelligent wolves, you may be able to get through these flaws and still enjoy the story, though it runs aground with its heavy-handed morality at the end. There are no surprises here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This book was very disappointing. It is not what I look for in a book at all. This is the type of book I read, animal fantasy adventure, but this one was not very good. It did have good detail and kept you wanting to read more but it was too depresssing. Practically all the main characters died, and the very main character did die! When I read a book I go in looking for a taste of reality, some death and despair of course, but I want it to end up with a overall triumphant and happy ending. I write books and they are not all happy-go-lucky in every single page but in the end it is an uplifting message. I was so excited to read this and I was very unhappy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get an editor!!!","review":"Oh, my God, get an editor! We have an emergency!! Thick plodding trite plot, predictable action, and poorly drawn, one-dimentional characters. The author introduces wolf dialect for words, then (ooops!) forgets to use it consistantly. The \\"history\\" is recreated and amended to serve the plot several times. He even has frequent grammatical errors! Amateur, amateur, amateur. Good grief. Thank goodness I only borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"this book haunts my shelf every day. it worth less then the milk carton i threw out yesterday. This book was so disapointing and boring and ill never read a book by David Clement-Davies again. It was unfortunate that i bought this book for a trip i was taking- i ended up watching the prince&me on the plane instead. 90% of all the charactors (including ones that i liked) died. He spends the first 3/4 of the book developing them then he kills them off in stupid ways, for example, one of the charactors looks into a pool and decides to jump in. then she dies. If your hypnotised by the eyes on the cover of this book, or by the lame poem on the back, i have one thing to say to you. Don't be."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a good book if you got time to read it.","review":"The book (the sight) is about a wolf pack trying to find a safe to raise there cubs.They are also trying to get away from morgra because she need a cub and a human child to bring back wolfbane and for her to get the power of the sight.When the pack finds some where safe to have there cubs some thing bad happens.Not to long after they have there cubs they get accused for stealing a human child. Now the humans are after them to kill them. so the pack is forced to leave there dean or they will be killed by the dogs or by the humans.The sight is a power that can be used for good and evil.

I loved it. I admit, the beginning parts weren't the best, but keep going- it gets better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different sort of wolf story","review":"This book was a very different sort of young adult novel. I originally purchased it in the adult horror section, so I expected a werewolf story. After bringing it home, I discovered it was for young adult readers, and that it was all about a wolf pack/family. And a legend. It also seems like a story about the entire world and in its own way, it was deeply religious. The author did a wonderful job with the point-of-view and managed to convincingly create and relate the story of his wolves. All in all, it was very different from what I expected from its shelf location and cover. I rather enjoyed it, despite its sad ending. It was very good and I look forward to reading the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dezi's choice","review":"I bought this book as a birthday gift for my 16 year old granddaughter.

Thankfully I didn't buy it; I would have been sorely disappointed. What promised to be interesting at first look quickly proved an inept attempt at a supernatural epic. The wolves' theology is so reminiscent of Christianity as to be just one step above plagiarized. I would expect a being supposedly sentient and with such developed theologies, beliefs and self awareness to be more eloquent. Dialog was juvenile at best. I would not recommend this book to any serious fantasy epic reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this Book!","review":"I haven't read fire-bringer yet, but i hope to do so. Either way, this book is just as good, and it is very dark and emotional, exploring the world from an animals' point of view. No magic like Harry Potter, which is great! People these days think that stories should only be told from a humans' point of view, illustrating them as the 'good guys' and animals as the 'bad guys'. Not so. I like how Larka takes care of a child, and sees him as a being just like her. And the Humans are not seen as 'pure evil', which oftens happens in a animal story. The wolf talk introduces me to something new and fascinating instead of boring old fancy. They are seen as friends of the Wolf, so for all you people who believe this book has too much humanism, this is my response! The tale is told from a mature point of view that helps young people to deal with death. Great piece of work overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Preachy","review":"I love philosophical anthropomorphic novels, such as Watership Down, and I heard The Sight was very similar, so I decided to give it a go. The plot started off very interesting, although the characterization was a bit boring. I was very disappointed after having read the whole thing, realizing it was just another one of those oh-so-preachy \\"we all need to be atheists because religion is dumb\\" novels. Now, I enjoy hearing other people's various points of view on the subject of religion and heatedly debating it, but what I don't enjoy is having some one else's opinion shoved down my throat in such an obvious way (especially in what I suspected to be an entertaining animal tale). The Sight is not a story for those wanting a simple fantasy animal adventure. Also, just because this is a young adult novel does not mean it has to be so blatant! It would at least be a little more tolerable if it had some room for interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sight","review":"Huttser, Palla, Bran, Brassa,Kipcha,the pack wanted nothing more than find a den and give Palla time to have and raise her pups.Little did they know just how special and how hard life's journey was going to be for their little ones and themselves.If you liked WaterShip Down or the Secret of Nihm, then you should give The Sight a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storyline, but lacking execution","review":"I thought this was a great book overall; the plot-line was sound and kept me interested. The only problems were in the author's writing style. I remember being frustrated by the random history throw-ins, and I also remember some awkward phrasing that made me shake my head sometimes. It is definitely worth reading through for the story, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show, don't tell!","review":"This is my second time trying to read this book. Once again I didn't get far. I finally had to give up, again, due to the poor writing. Rather than showing us how the wolves live, he tells us \\"this is the law\\" and \\"wolves do this for this reason.\\" Etc. Perhaps it gets better further in the book, after the initial setup. I don't know, I just couldn't get that far. I gave the book two stars, rather than one, since I didn't get far into it. Maybe it gets better, but I won't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dispointed!","review":"I couldn't wait for the book to arrive and then I was very disapointed.

I was angry at myself for getting it before reading the first chapter.I thought it was lame. It was the type of lame that made me think \\"What kind of crazy person would write such a book? And such a long one too?\\"The dialogue seemed to be like from some dubbed anime. An anime with bad reviews.I do not want to read about wolves flirting with eachother. Wtfffff. I am not into beastality, sorry.One thing that was good about it was that it was descriptive, I guess. But it didn't really matter to me, since what David Clement-Davies described wasn't really that interesting anyways. Sorry.It's odd, though, to see it get such great reviews. All my friends (mind you they are smart O:<) thought the story and plot was ridiculous. I thought it was ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book EVER!!!","review":"The book is amazing! I'm obsessed with it and I can't stop thinking about it. The plot is very good, but the book is so emotional. You get so wrapped up in the book that it's emotional for you. Expecally the ending. You have to read the book at least twice to fully get it and you still cannot get tired of it.The author did a really good job on it and if he can write like that in all his books (I hope so)then the writer must be extreamlly good and can count me in for buying all of his books.Because I'm a kid, the book makes you imagine a lot and sometimes those imaginations can be extreamly sad. I kind of wish that the author put a happier ending to the story so the white wolf did not die, but then again, it might not make the story as good as it can be.So you decide, should the ending be a happy one? Or should it stay the way it is? I just wish that the author would let you choose the ending...Either way, imaginely happy or sad, the book is better than a 5 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for wolf-lovers","review":"This book is great!The sight is a power to look through birds eyes and to look into the water and see past, present, and furture, even to heal the mind.I wouldn't call the book nice through the story because there is a lot of dying and killing in it but that's what makes the book good. Its a story about a wolf pack and the alpha female(Drappa) gives birth to cubs.(4 but 2 die)Her evil sister Morgra(who has the sight) knows one of her cubs have even a more powerful sight and needs to get to her(Larka the cub with the sight) but the loving family will do anything to pertect Larka.

So I decided to read this book. It was okay in the beginning, but I reached the halfway point approximately seven characters had died. Maybe I'm the only reviewer to have a problem with that, but also it sounds really cliched, we've seen all these animal stories before, written better and in fewer pages. The important elements we've all seen before and the plot beginning was unoriginal. I could predict the whole book. It got in to some interesting character study, but then it just signed the bad guys off as evil, even after showing that they had been wronged in the first place. Maybe if you are not quite as critical as I am you will like the book. I just didn't.And I'm sorry so few people found my review helpful...I just could not finish the book. If fewer of them had died..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, People!","review":"This book really touched my heart. For those of you calling David Clement-Davies an amateur, I'd like to see you do better! Can't, huh? This book explores the world from an animal's point of view, and sees Humans as friends, and teaches about love. It helps people deal with death - hey, Larka lost almost everyone she knew, but she made it through! What's unusual about this book is that in the end, the heroine dies. And, I actualy felt a sense of loss here.

She was involved with, or had something to say about every major social and political issue of mid-century. Her friendships were numerous and varied. She was married four times (once to literary titan Edmund Wilson) and had many tempestuous affairs. It's disappointing, therefore, that this biography is such a disjointed and discursive hodge podge of gossip, hearsay, and innuendo. Not that those are bad things, but if that's all the attention McCarthy deserves why not just let Kitty Kelly do the book?

This set of two seemed like a great deal, since their price together was less than a similarly-sized cooling rack at the store.Their size is generous without being too big, and the quality is top-notch. I now use one for ventilating my laptop, while the other is used for cookies. They excel at both tasks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cooling racks for a great price","review":"These cooling racks are great multi-taskers.Let me start with the bad: The packaging clearly states not for use in the oven! But this isn't really bad, I had to try them in the oven just to see what horrible thing could happen...and nothing did. There was very minor warping so I wouldn't put a large roast or anything on this but bacon or other light things will be fine.Now on to the good things: BACON, oven broiled bacon is delicious, my wife swears this is the only way she will eat it now. The main reason I purchased this was for bacon, and it does a great job and NOTHING sticks. The non-stick on these baking sheets works awesome. I wouldn't worry about cookies or sticky breads or anything sticking on these.In summary if you need a cooling rack that fits your standard size cookie sheet then this set is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent rack but handwash & dry only","review":"It'll rust if you run it through the dishwasher.

On top of that, because of the many grids, they don't leave a mark on the back of the cookies which many racks do, because of the weight on either side.

Will probably use sometimes for other things like cooling cookie's also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad purchase.","review":"These set of cooling racks are definitely at a low price point, but sadly, it's highly recommended that you not use it in the oven or near any open flames, probably because of it's Teflon coating. The little grid pattern makes it a nuisance to clean. Little square bubbles of soap and water form, much like when it water on a window screen. To be fair, the cooling rack is specified as a cooling rack, but many other racks are dual purpose and may be used in the oven or on a grill. Also, because of the grid pattern, there is more surface area touching the product, which could undesired soggy squares on certain items.If you ONLY need to cool things on a grid, this is an okay purchase. I would go for something a little more expensive and buy something that will be able to withstand heat as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken!!!","review":"I purchased 2 of these gates to close off the entrances to my son's playroom.

But, nowhere in the product description does it mention that the gate is made for SMALL sized dogs. The instruction manual says: \\"This product is designed for small dogs 6.6 - 17.6 lbs.\\"I think instead of calling this a \\"Large\\" gate, it should be more appropriately called a \\"Wide\\" gate instead.I really should send this gate back for a refund but I will keep it. I don't see another free standing gate for sale anywhere else. I have two beagles that probably could jump over the top with no problem at all. But, I just need to have a reminder for them to not go up the stairs. So, I think the gate will do the job. I just wanted to make sure that everyone knows that this is actually a WIDE GATE FOR SMALL DOGS.The gate is nice enough to rate 5 stars but I'll give it a 4 star rating based on the deceptive advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for small dogs and for small children to step over","review":"I AM SO HAPPY WITH THESE GATES I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE!

I needed it for my senior dog who gets disoriented once in awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes I did","review":"A little embarrassed that I thought I needed one of these, but after too much looking around for one that would fit the opening where our sliding patio door used to be, I went with this one. It's actually pretty nice. I'm probably going to do some modifications to make it a little more compact for storing, but it's doing the job and looking good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice looking and great for dachshunds!","review":"I bought two of these free-standing gates for two different openings to keep my dachshunds corralled into the family room and kitchen. I love that they are free-standing and expandable so they can custom fit different areas. They are great quality and look very nice. Out of other dog gates I have tried, these are the sturdiest and nicest looking. They do not distract from my wood floors and actually have more of a \\"furniture\\" look to them. The gate is at a perfect height for my dachshunds. My last gate was too short and two of my more spry dachshunds jumped it. This gate is good for short dogs with short legs AKA dachshunds. I am very happy with these gate; they are the best dog gates I have ever bought!Cons: As with ANY dog gate. Step over slowly and be very careful or you might fall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent gate","review":"This gate looks good - looks 'classy' vs 'industrial'. We use it between our living room and dinning room. Also gate was easy to put up and easy to take down when we need to. This gate is low enough that we can easily walk over, but tall enough to be a hindrance to our dog. She can still jump over it but it isn't easy. (She is a 25 lbs medium size dog)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this gate!","review":"I have two dachshunds that I want to keep out of the formal dining room and formal living room but I have a wide area to block off so most gates wouldn't work. This one does and it's easy to step over or move to get to these rooms or the front door. I like that I can just fold it up and put it in my closet if I have guests and don't want it there. I had purchased a metal gate previously that had a door opening through it but people always managed to knock it down and it was a pain to put back together so I gave up on it. It also damaged my wall. This one looks great and I would highly recommend it to people with small dogs. I only wish I had purchased it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for keeping small dogs in and stepping over.","review":"I have used the Large, Wood Freestanding Pet Gate for about a month and it works great for keeping my two mini-dachshunds in the kitchen or other areas. I got the wide one to accommodate a 71-inch opening between living areas. The low height allows us to easily step over, and, visually, does not 'overpower' the room. The padded base extensions keep the gate stable. The gate assembles quickly, but once the frame is attached you have to remove and reinsert the screws to change the width. I also like how light it is to pick up and move around. Overall, the gate is well made and and the dark finish looks good, too. I would recommend for small dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"read the dimensions carefully","review":"I bought this to keep our Yorkie from going into a certain room.

I wouldn't have minded spending the money if it was AT ALL worth it, but I'm sorry to say this book was simply silly and boring. I actually threw it in the trash after reading about a hundred pages of it. Basically it vascillates between three different small tales all tied together. Two \\"Deliverance-type\\" characters who make their living running moonshine and have their fun having sex and murdering, two women from the \\"big city\\" and a deformed Appalachian young man with a big penis, hence the name Bighead.

It takes a lot to shock me and make me sick but at least every 10 pages I would say out loud \\"Oh MAN!\\". Unlike, say, American Psycho, which is also disgusting but boring, you actually care about the characters and what happens to them, especially the priest and the nympho. There is some really sick stuff in here, that makes me want to not run into either Ed Lee or John Pelam in a dark alley. But, if you can stomach it (and why would you buy it if you wanted something mild) it's a great read. There are images in the book, mainly the detailed exploits of the two hillbilly killers (who make the guys from Deliverance look like Mr. Rogers) that will stick with you for a looooooong time.

However, younger children should enjoy the music and the songs are well chosen so if you can tolerate a bubble-gum sing-song style (like Barney) this may be a good option for you.

When our first child came along (the high maintenance one)he had trouble with the long driving days. We'd pop this CD in and he would calm down and eventually fall asleep. The voices are of probably an older children children's chorus. The songs are of Nursery Rhymes which children seem to be barely introduced to these days. Whereas this CD is not one I would pop in my player if it were just my husband and myself in the room, the fact that our son enjoyed this and calmed down while it was playing was really priceless to us.

He did not do a study of his own to confirm his findings. He just believed everybody elses research instead. Also he does not state why he believes this information to be true or why it would be true. There is some information that is helpful but it is very scientific and a little hard to understand without going back over it a couple times to review it.

The unit had a date of manufacture of 2005 - it was bought in mid-2007 so this was kind of odd. It was very difficult to get the unit in - the place was over fifty miles away and was open during work hours. Not only was the power unit broken and had to be replaced but the inside of the unit was dirty. There is a good chance I paid a new price for a refurbished unit that was never repaired.

Nothing cheap about them. Another plus: You only need one triple-A battery and this tiny radio, about the size of a lighter, is easy on power. Sleek, high-performing, including 5 presets each for AM/FM/TV, defaulted to shut off after 90 minutes to save batteries, and costing under $39 on Amazon, the DT-180 is a great choice for a \\"pocket receiver.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"AM Talk Radio on the Beach ...","review":"I walk my dog on San Diego's famous Dog Beach, (in Ocean Beach), EVERY DAY.

Being a TALK RADIO addict, I wanted a portable AM radio with better reception than what I presently owned -- I rarely listen to the FM band. The Sangean fit the bill, perfectly. I found a carrying-case designed for a cell phone at the local \\"Swap Meet\\" and the Sangean fits perfectly in the case and on my belt. The controls are on top and that makes it convenient for me to switch back and forth between two competing shows using the preset buttons. The volume control is also ideally located and easily adjusted through my make-shift carrying case.All-in-all, I would rank the Sangean at FIVE stars, but, occasionally, I must twist it a bit from left to right to maintain the signal strength -- yeah, I know -- \\"picky-picky\\" ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sangean DT-180BK","review":"Very poor FM reception spoiled an otherwise fine product.

For one it has no clock, the Sony Walkman does. There is no clip for easy attachment when walking. There's no case for carrying it when walking or exercising. Unfortunately, cannot return it to Amazon for a full refund, so I am now the not-so-happy owner.

Laurence Olivier would have undoubtedly been an ideal Darcy if he were allowed to actually play Austen's Darcy and not this watered-down Darcy. It is a shame but at least we have the BBC production, which is wonderful. Above all, there's Jane Austen's wonderful novel to enjoy--no production will ever replace it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good basis","review":"This film is an integral one in the study of film adaptation of Jane Austen's most popular novel, Pride and Prejudice. It represents the beginning of a serious love affair between film and Austen novels; however, it is not great in terms of adaptation. If you love Pride and Prejudice and have never seen this film, skip it. It will only anger you. If you're studying film adaptation of Austen novels, you MUST see this one as it has influenced everything that came afterwards. AND--it's Laurence Olivier, afterall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just shoot me now!","review":"I adore both Greer and Lawrence, but not in this film (and I use the term very, very lightly). I used to think that when I saw these movies when I was younger that this was close to the author's vision. The clothing for the women is not even in the right time period. (which the studio's were famous for.) Most importantly,Jane Austen could never recognize the ending of this movie as a part of her vision at all, because it's way out there. Watch the pivotal character of Catherine debourgh and see what happens all for the sake of making the studio happy. Some of it was totally unrecognizable. Do yourself a favor and see A&E's presentation with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. I'm giving 2 stars one for Sir Lawrence and the other for Greer because it wasn't their fault I'm sure. If it wasn't for them I couldn't have brought myself to give any stars at all. Enough said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie had no respect for the book!

Both Ms. Garson and Mr. Olivier were really bad, I hate to say it, but it's true. Ms. Garson was a fluttering hummingbird and Olivier a stilted, very bad actor. No chemistry, no depth, and really bad acting. I won't get into the details such as faithfulness to the book, costumes, set ect. as I could have overlooked these things had the story and acting been good. It just wasn't.

A character as one he played in Wuthering Heights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so-so","review":"Out of all the adaptations of this novel (and I've seen them all), this is probably my least favorite. First, it has all the nausiating over-dramatized acting that is so characteristic of old B&W movies (Betty Davis style prounounced eye-batting, and the like). The costumes were more of the style of antebellum pre-civial war America, rather than early 1800's Victorian England, with the poofy hoop skirts, and big bows. And I think the worst part, for me anyway, was the fact that this version completely changes the motives of Darcy's aunt for her battle with Elizabeth near the end of the movie. She did it to ensure that Elizabeth was sincear?? Give me a break. I know that most versions due take some liberties and make some changes, but this to me was just criminal, and was the last straw for me. I give it 2 stars because Olivier and Garson were both fine actors in their time, and should be given credit. but the movie as a whole, was just a complete dissapointment to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie OK, \\"Features\\" Superb!","review":"I have to tell you I am NOT a fan of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as an entertaining movie, but there were some choice moments.HOWEVER, this particular DVD package has a \\"Special Feature\\" that just BLEW ME AWAY!

The \\"Eyes\\" short features...the USS Enterprise and the Naval Air Station at San Diego as it was in 1940. W-O-W!!! Footage of BT-1's, TBD's, F3F's, etc was priceless!

It does not follow the book at all, clothing wrong period, Mr. Darcy is too stiff, and bending at the same time ie. offering friendship at the Netherfield picnic ( Which BTW, was a ball) and then 5 seconds later acting like he'd never seen her, story progresses too quickly, not in line with the book.

I couldn't get through the movie and never actually got to the part where Darcy and Elizabeth interact. I think Laurence Olivier is a great actor but I don't think even he could have made me enjoy this movie. If you want to see a good version of P&P I suggest renting the BBC/A&E version which is considered by most the best adaptation or I'd even suggest the Keira Knightley version, which even though it had its own faults, it wasn't that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I can't believe anyone having anything to do with this film ever read the book. From the costumes to the acting it is horrid. Laurence Olivier rather than being a taciturn and to many appears as an arrogant person actually boarders on being foppish. I'd never seen him on stage and if his portrayal of Darcy is any indication of his acting there then I'm glad I never got the chance. Greer Garson is far to old and the film which over all touches so briefly on the story throwing in a few of the actual lines now and then is very dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"No that bad","review":"I have seen this movie.

A lampoon of the British ruling class it depicts, more charicature than reality, which I accept and enjoy. Leave Jane Eyere in the dust, and don't neglect the modest pleasures of this little gem. The petty family dynamics are still with us, of steam-opening letters, feigning illness until betrothal (or to induce one (\\"Did you say it was chicken broth?\\")), sibling jealousy and rivalry, and resigned patience with the system by paternal figureheads -- it's deliciously fragile. \\"Oh, heavens, what a pudding face,\\" pout the sisters of soddy Mr. Collins, judging him together with their father. \\"Perhaps he has beauties of character,\\" volunteers one.Greer Garson in one of her most appealing roles, lacking the saccarine, matronly radiance of such roles as Mrs. Miniver (a fantastic film, but I'm comparing Greer Garson's traits), possessing a more earthy, actionable orient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Everyone Nuts? This Is THE BEST MOVIE EVER!","review":"I've seen two other movies based on Jane Austen novels. I abolutely loved them, so of course I had to see this one. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, I was mesmerized. Greer Garson pulled me in and made me beleive she WAS Lizzie. And Laurence Olivier! What else can I say, except that he's the greatest actor of all time, and they casted him perfectly in this movie. And all the rest of the actors/actresses were superb in this film too. After I watched this film 3 times I HAD to read the book. When I did, I saw that, though it was a little altered, the film had captivated the full essence of the book. The events were a liitle mixed up in the movie, but all in all, this movie was a great adaptation of the book. I think Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier should've both gotten an Oscar for this film.

An Austen fanatic, I own more than one version and while this one takes a few more librties than others, it is my favorite. Like most movies it sticks true to the main points of the book but, even the differences seem to fit in seemlessly. If you are a stickler for the movie being a carbon copy of the book (in which case you might want to try the BBC version) then you probably won't enjoy it as much.

What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said already? Coming off two triumphs (see my review of \\"Wuthering Heights\\"), Laurence Olivier is yet again in top form as the arrogant Mr. Darcy, Greer Garson is magic is Elizabeth Bennet, \\"Tarzan's mate\\" Maureen O'Sullivan is perfect and the script, by Aldous Huxley, is tailored to the 1 hour, 40 minute time frame.

The costumes were totally wrong. Hello? Several characters were totally misinterpreted. And I was ready to accept that it was going to be a little different from the book, but parts of the book that could have been translated quite well on screen were TOTALLY different for no apparent reason. I have to admit that I didn't finish it. When I heard Elizabeth tell Mr. Darcy that he was too proud, to which he responded that she was too prejudiced, I was outta there. I can only hope that one of the other versions do the book justice. This one hurt me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"As an avid Jane Austen disciple I was horrified by this movie. It was as if the screenwriter had never heard of (let alone read) Austen's classic. The costumes alone made it quite difficult to watch- it is apparent that this film was hoping to ride the coattails of the epic Gone with the Wind with its Southern dresses and customs. And it only gets worse- Olivier (who I believe is a marvelous actor) transforms a prideful Darcy into yet another cowering suitor- a mistake that really defeats the point of the book. Basically, Austen's plotlines and themes were disregarded and I believe that any true Austen fan will agree with me on this. To end this review on a high note, I refer you all to a, in my opinion, five-star miniseries by the BBC that will truly satisfy your appetite for all things wonderful. It stars Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and it will truly be time well spent. You will definately not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"grotesque distortion","review":"If you love the words, characters and plot twists of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice you will dislike, even hate, this movie. Every character and scene is a grotesque distortion of the masterpiece. Who would have the nerve to take Austen's unparalleled dialogue and clumsily rephrase it? (Aldous Huxley for one as it turns out). Why turn Lady Catherine de Bourgh into a heroine? The characters are almost all as unrecognizable as the leftover \\"Gone With the Wind\\" costumes. There is zero chemistry between any of the actors and even Laurence Olivier seems to be sleep walking through his scenes. It makes no sense. Save your two hours for Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mixed Bag","review":"While this version is some what entertaining, you can't help but feel cheated. A two hour version is simply not enough to cover this Jane Austin classic. Many things were left out and changed for the sake of time. I will say though that Laurence Olivier is excellent as Mr. Darcy, but Greer Garson is not even tolerable. She's actually annoying like most of the cast. Almost completely miscast.Like another reviewer said, the 1990's version with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle ruins the 1940 version. If you put both verison side by side, you will see how the older verison pales to the modern version. Colin Firth is Laurence Olivier's equal when it comes to the portayal of Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle is perfect as Elizabeth. The updated version IS the definitive adaption of Pride & Prejudice.Another point: Men should stay away from this movie. I couldn't finish watching it. It's way too feminine, but the 1996 version is recommended for any one who appreciates a great story and wonderful dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could have given it no stars","review":"They need to find a new title for this book.

The best Pride and Prejudice is with Colin Firth and Jennifer Erhle. Presented by the BBC and played on A&E. That is a good movie. Not this filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY LOOSELY based on the novel!","review":"Jane Austen would be turning over in her grave if she knew what this film adaptation had done to her brilliant novel. The characters' names are the same, but nearly every plot detail is so different from Jane Austen's original story as to be nearly unrecognizable.

The acting is of the lowest standard imaginable and Lawrence Olivier simply walks the part because that it is charactor anyhow. The scenes are rushed, Mr. Bennet's wit is completely drowned by a dull pathetic script and the minor charactors that help shape the story are completely left out. Either read the book that far surpasses this travesty or but the BBC 1990's version that is excellent. This film is drivel and a classic example of unimaginative Hollywood run-offs. Avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly Pride","review":"I would label this the \\"Silly Pride and Prejudice\\" for while it is entertaining to watch, it is not nearly so romantic as some adaptations of this novel.

It offends in so many ways. The plot and characters are changed radically from the book. Greer Garson is too old by 20 years to play Elizabeth Bennett, and her acting is smug and affected. The actresses playing her sisters are much younger and more beautiful than she. On the other hand, the character playing Mr. Bennett is well-cast, and I supposed it is a nice touch to have the other three Bennett sisters be very pretty. But in this version, Darcy and his Aunt are the nicest and most democratic--modern American, really--people you'd ever want to meet--no class snobbery there! The only value of this version is as a curiousity, but Garson really ruins any entertainment value it could have. The 1995 Ehle-Firth A&E verson is superb in every way, and I do recommend that."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pity","review":"What a pity that you don't offer a NO-star rating.

The three stories Full Circle, State of Decay and Warrior's Gate represent the best of the various eras of Doctor Who. Full Circle is representative of many of the Peter Davison and Colin Baker stories.

Full Circle, the first, involves a stranded colony ship, marsh creatures, and Adric (probably the most annoying companion of the entire series). State of Decay, the second, concerns a flock of vampires who repress a medieval society; a superior episode, with an eerie score and gorgeous costuming. The real treasure of the set, though, is Warriors' Gate, the third story, filmed mostly on all-white sets, with a war of survival between humans and lion-like humanoids over interdimensional travel. The episode also features the departure of both Romana and K-9.

He think's his camera is \\"cool.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good camera, reliable and convenient!","review":"I got this camera for work, very quiet when taking the photos and has a fast save time (time for it to take a photo, save it, and then be ready to take another picture).It's SD card slot doesn't share space with the batteries like some cameras do, so changing SD cards or taking it out to read the photos online doesn't require turning the camera off and on.It's also got a much better optical zoom that most cameras in this price range (3x is norm) and the 5x optical zoom doesn't get all grainy and pixelated like digital zoom does.Another nice feature is the sport mode which adjusts the shutter speed to let you capture a fast moving photo (like sports activites, kids at the holidays, photos from car window like for survellance) without getting a BLURRR. It's very nice for all types of light too.Best value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big battery eater","review":"I had the earlier model of kodak camera and liked it. One thig about the kodak camera, they seems to produce high quality photo. We really like the picture. However, I am not happy about how fast we need to change the batteries. We can still use the used batteries for electric toothbrush (still enough power left for it), but not for the camera. The camera starts to shut off in a few seconds when the batteries do not have enough power for it anymore. It is very frustrating. We had suspected other defects, but as soon as we put the new batteries in it, it works fine. The older model went through a lot of baterries, too, but this one seems to be worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!","review":"The printer did not work, it only printed 1/2 of the picture.

Money thrown away!! The camera doesn't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk, also in my opinion. It truly is junk now as I got so frustrated with it, I threw it on the floor and smashed it. Not kidding! When I first got it,I called Kodak and they told my son( who is knowledgeable in this stuff) how to reset the printer. We reset it and it worked for awhile. Then it wouldn't work any more and I did away with it. No more Kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking camera; not user friendly nor quality","review":"I purchased this camera for $199 at Walmart -- and promptly returned it a short while later.Pros: lots of settings, easy to use (in automode)Cons: lots of settings (too many), the LCD viewer doesn't reflect the actual photo, and taking low-light pictures is very cumbersome and not easy. So, this camera is not easy to use for common family pictures indoors; photos are always dark unless a flash is used or manual settings are enabled (the settings of which require a rocket-science degree to understand)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"This is my first digital camera, and I'm so pleased with it. At the beginning I don't know what kind of camera buy, but a friend of mine recommend me this one.

If I have to buy another camera I buy another Kodak easy share."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD AFTER 6 MONTHS!","review":"I bought this camera brand new 6 months ago. It has been used very lightly on birthdays and holidays. It has never been dropped and stored properly but now it is dead.Aside from my bitterness over it going dead so soon I would still give it a low rating because of how fast it goes through batteries. Two AA batteries would only last one photo shoot.

I had to convince my boss that Kodak was a good camera and the dock system was the way to go...unfortunately my recommendation turned out to be a nightmare!! We spent almost $300 for the camera and dock station - haven't taken 75 pictures with the camera and it is junk! When I turn the camera on it extends the lense about 1/4\\" and then retracts and shuts itself off. I tried all of the sites from Kodak and after numerous correspondence with Kodak the conclusion is: 1. I can send the camera back to them and for $125.00 they will fix it. (I can buy a new one for $129.00) 2. I can send the camera in and they would sell me a \\"refurbished\\" camera for between $250-$300. OR 3.

This camera will run about a half hour on fresh batteries, and then it just turns off. I thought it was defective, but a camera guy told me the Kodak digitals are like that. I would recommend a different brand with a special battery pack, not one that runs on two AA batteries. I'm going to try rechargables just to save some money, but this will never be a good camera for trips or outdoor stuff. Also, it sucks at landscape pics, bright colors (such as sunrises and sunsets) appear washed out and pale. Even a bright fuschia forest-fire sun is an anemic pale yellow (maybe that's just a digital thing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this camera !","review":"I bought this camera for my wife for her birthday.

Being 35mm SLR buffs we decided to upgrade to the next model the Z740 which has full manual controls and features similar to a SLR .We instantly fell in love with this camera but alas , within less than two weeks this camera also died .Same scenario , lost power and fresh batteries didn't help .

Anatole Broyard writes about New York in 1947 from his perspective, as a World War II veteran coming home to new ideas and strange people. His vision is romantic and nostalgic, but he also recognizes the limitations of these times and his own feeling of being an outsider among outsiders. Being so immersed in the intellectual and sexual experiences of life, he longs for a more personal, emotional bond which he fails to find. Though Broyard could not finish the book before his death, it is still very much a worthwhile read if you love books, sex, and the excitement of cities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Track 13, Let Us Buy It","review":"I don't understand what the logic is behind restricting one of the best tracks.

This is what happens when a film purposely doesn't take itself too seriously, and it shows in the end result of these fun, (and in the case of Goldilocks), outright goofy takes on classic bedtime stories with a horiffic twist. The other reviewiers obviously did not experience true 80's horror i.e. Sleepaway Camp, My Bloody Valentine, April Fools Day, and Motel Hell to name a few. Horror today is way too self-absorbed, over-analyzed, and the movies are mostly made to please a demographic that really don't appreciate what makes a good popcorn night. A couple exceptions would be Slither and Feast which give an obvious nod to the 80's style and are indeed a treat. I have spent 20+ years collecting and studying the horror genre, and believe me, Deadtime Stories is ten dollars well-spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"el oso grande","review":"The story lines are predictable and the special effects are cheap.

Usually, the answer key is in a different order from the way the questions were presented, so you have to check to make sure you are correcting your answers properly. Also, I was expecting a little more on test taking strategy. As I look at reviews for past editions of this book, I see that errors were a problem back then and I wonder why Random House has not corrected them for this newer edition.

I really don't know how to describe the experience reading this book will bring - other than to say it is painful and an utter waste of valuable reading time. The story is ridiculous and the dialogue is perhaps the worst I've read. I read the entire book - though I constantly wanted to stop. I now wish I had. If you're contemplating reading this book - don't. Use your time to do something a bit more productive - like staring at the wall or picking lint out of your belly button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I have read several of David Morrell's books and enjoy the suspense and mystery as he presents it, but this was a flop! Not only was it below his standard, but the evil American Government approach presented in this book made it even worse. If you like books that demonize Americans, this is the one for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and last David Morrell novel","review":"This book features an incredibly lame plot and even lamer dialog that is so corny it almost seems like parody. Then there is the obnoxious phrase that two of the main characters say to one another ad nauseum: \\"But...(dramatic pause, I assume) I saw you die!\\" I wish they had seen ME die so I wouldn't have had to finish reading this idiotic book. Take out this phrase and the 500 page book would probably be reduced to 450 pages. This was the first - and last - David Morrell book I will read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Morrell's best","review":"Unbelievable! I mean it. The story is just not believable. It's absurd. Try another of Morrell's books. He's usually really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fifth Profession","review":"What an outstanding book. I read this book a number of years ago and decided recently to read it again. Reading this book again, reaffirms why I read books written by David Morrell. If you love action, suspence and a thrilling twist at the end, this book is for you. The reason I like this book is because David Morrell has the ability to describe details in such away you feel like you are there. This detail is written in such a way that is does not detract from the book. The two main characters in this book are experts in executive protection and live on opposite sides of the world. They are drawn together by a set of circumstances which will stop you from putting the book down. It ends with a twist which blows you away and I guarentee if you don't currently read David Morrell books after this you will be thirsty for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"i was so confused!!!","review":"when this book began i really enjoyed it. I thought it was intelligently written and well thought out. What dissapointed me was that none of that thought was shared with the reader. While reading i didnt think i was anymore confused than any other book with such a convoluted plot. However, i was expecting it to be cleared up by the time the book ended. Imagine my dissapointment when the book ended and i still had no idea what the point of the book was. however i read another one of Morrells books and i enjoyed it a lot. ( Thats not to say that i didnt enjoy this one) i just left it feeling so muddled. i cant give this book a wholehearted thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration","review":"First time in reading a David Morrell novel, the beginning was promising but later found it frustrating and repetitious. Skip the endless lines of 'but I saw you die' sections, you aren't missing anything. Once you know the plot questions that try to keep this novel going, be prepared to re-read these very same questions again and again and again--with no answers either. Skip those sections you aren't missing anything. If you like history, take your time through those sections, a reward for persevering through the mindless repetious sections. Skip the sections repeating 'bile rose in his throat', stopped counting how many times that came up. Skip the sections regarding the Protector's code of keeping things secretative, they didn't bother so why should you bother reading about it. All in all an easy book to read without missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook awful...","review":"I listened to the first hour of this book before giving up. The readers sounded so comical that I couldn't stand it anymore. The narrator sounded like he was narrating a 1960s cartoon. And the hero of the story - Savage - sounded like Bruce Wayne as Batman. The readers are listed as \\"Cast of Readers\\" and I can see why - nobody wanted to associate their actual names with this. Buy the book if you really want to read it, or find another audiobook instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinkade Paints Rocky Horror Picture Show","review":"This novel is so bad it's good. I've been listening to the audio version for the past couple of days and it's had me laughing right out loud. Rob Petrie, Sally Rogers and Buddy Sorrell, working overtime intentionally writing laughs for Alan Brady, couldn't have topped the accidental humor that the crew who writes as \\"David Morrell\\" put into \\"The Fifth Profession\\".I'm feeling the blood pulsing through my typing fingers as I write this. Thankfully, that look of overwhelming sadness in my eyes has been overcome by this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book","review":"I picked up this book without any really knowing what I was getting into. This book read like some of Tom Clancys better pieces of work. The story starts slow, but then yankes you for a ride where you are wanting to know what is going on. A must read for people who like action and thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane, corny","review":"The book has a certain zany energy to it, but the plot is inane and the writing is incredibly corny. I couldn't even listen to it as an audio book. If you're interested in the Japanese underworld read Barry Eisler's John Rain series instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"The Opening gets you hooked. As the plot unfolds, the reader has so many questions, it's amazing to think they're all going to eventually be answered. The end brings the answers, but a little too sudden, fast , and furious. Less development of the chase scenes and more clues to the ending would have made the climactic scene much easier (and more interesting) to discover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written action novel!","review":"I am a David Morrell fan and have read many of his books. This one is great with respect to the fact that it is very orignal and unique with many plot twists and turns. There is significant historical reference to make the story line more credible and believable. It had the right mix of action, exotic locations, character developement and suspence. David Morrell is very good with small details that make the book thought provoking, realistic and interesting. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Terrific!","review":"This is far and away the best book David Morrell has written and one of the best books I have read. It would make a great movie.

It's guaranteed to waste label tape. You have to throw away 1/2\\" of tape, which costs about half a cent, everytime you print. And if you get the dreaded \\"Cut Error\\" message, you will be throwing away even more money.Nor am I a fan of the keyboard.

What a crappy engineering design - or they do it on purpose so you waste half the roll of tape and have to buy more.... For the past two months i've been getting the dreaded \\"Cut Error\\" that happens no matter how fast or slow I cut. I mean come on - why the heck do they even put this error in the labeler in the first place? If the label doesn't cut it will be obvious, then I'll use scissors... Today after 25 to 30 cut errors in a row in a fit of rage I spiked the labeler into the tile floor as hard as I could, then stomped on it. I've had enough of this POS labeler. I've dumped all 1000 pieces in the trash.

A few issues though, Like other reviewers have stated, this Labeler forces you to waste tape, about a half inch for every label. This is ridiculous, i've used other Labelers that have worked absolutely fine and have created the same labels as this without the need to throw your money in the garbage. The cutter error! is hilarious...it's almost like it's yelling at you.Don't make the P-Touch angry, it might waste some more tape on you!This thing wastes so much tape in fact, you may find yourself creating labels smaller than the wasted tape.Keep buying the tape rolls so you can throw a quarter of it in the garbage.Look elsewhere, there are other Labelers out there that will not take their anger out on you by wasting materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutter Error.

Easy task right?Not when armed with the PT-1400!You see in the course of making these 44 labels I have also produced a total of 22 wasted labels that were cut early because for whatever reason the label maker felt that there was a cutter error. Even resting your finger on the cutter can cause a cutter error. What's REALLY annoying is that the second one occurs, there is no way to just continue what you were doing. No, you have to start from the beginning, redefine the sequential numbering, the number of copies etc.With the PT-1400, even a simple task can be made difficult. Thank you PT-1400 for making me stay late today printing labels..."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the worst waste","review":"This machine wastes tape every label. it requires that you manually cut 1/2 inch of tape before each label, and shows a \\"cutter error\\" that wastes even more tape! it's totally annoying already to manually cut but worse that it will cost twice as much for tape to make up for the losses etc. YUCK NO THANKS. This unit is used at my office, i personally use a p touch desktop model with auto cut.. much much better and no tape wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely OK","review":"I bought this labeler because it has a number pad and I need to make labels with alot of numbers. I didn't realize the number pad would be so hard to reach. This thing is huge. Nine inches tall. It's hard to reach all of the buttons with out shifting your hands. This makes typing slow. The buttons have a very mushy feel. The code button is in the wrong spot. The letters on the buttons are white and the symbols next to the letters are yellow. This makes the letters hard to distinguish. The letters aren't in a qwerty format. So you'll have to learn the letter placement if you plan on using it alot. I can only recommend buying this if you'll be typing nothing but numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overkill","review":"Although this product does make labels...it also makes labels in thousands of configurations, and designs...something no normal person should ever need.

I checked the batteries, the label, the position of the labeler, the alignment of the stars...nothing helped, I guess its just a flawed machine period.If you purchase this labeler, make sure you stock up with tapes...and patience.My advice: don't even think of buying this expensive tape waster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid but wasteful","review":"This is a solid and useful labeler. It's sturdy and obviously built for industrial use and it is ridiculously easy to use. Sadly, it is also a bit wasteful, which is my only serious gripe with it. You see, every time you make a new label you are asked to cut a piece of tape about 3/4 of an inch before the label pops out. Perhaps the thinking was that since this is an industrial strength label machine, many labels would be entered in one shot so the 3/4 inch cut would occur only in the beginning of a massive print run. Or maybe Brother was slightly less than competent in designing this with economy in mind. Or maybe they planned on selling lots of tape. I have no idea why it makes that cut, but it is annoying.Aside from the wasting of tape it is a workhorse and it is very well built, so if you need an industrial strength labeling machine, this one will do nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"StarWarsEpisode1Book","review":"My son enjoyed this book.

The title story was the best, but for me at least it is still marred by being difficult to take seriously at times, which is an even larger problem with the other stories.

Johnnie Frisbie's father was an American, Robert Dean Frisbie, who married an island woman. Robert wrote several books about his life on the islands, and encouraged his daughter to write her own story in which she describes growing up in Puka-Puka and traveling with her father to other islands. She describes a destructive tropical hurricane they and her siblings endured on a tiny island in which they were the only inhabitants...how they survived it and started over again after the loss of nearly everything. After reading the book I did a little investigating and found that Johnnie, now an older woman, is still living on the island of Rarotonga.

It is a useful not only as a learning tool, but as a reference as well. This is a book that will probably remain on my bookshelf for a while.The only complaint I have is that sometimes material may be difficult to find.

It dives _way_ too deep into the case within the material being taught and makes it very hard to get at the meat of the material. Learning from the book required more time and effort/struggle than I had to give.I also felt a general lack of purpose in the book - is it a book on UML, UP, or Design Patterns?

The subtitle was much more descriptive of the content than the title. The title was very misleading. The book was a very detailed introduction to OOA/D, with minimal descriptions of UML scattered throughout each section. IMO, the writing style was much more complicated than it needed to be--the book didn't have a clear flow; rather, it seemed to jump around and repeat a lot.

The anlysis patterns (GRASP) described in the book are easy to follow as well as easy to remember. Though the author has not taken pains to describe all artifacts of UML. He has paid enough attention to clearly describe the important artifacts which are widely used. This book is not detailed description of Patterns and OOAD process. But it is a good amalgamation of processes, patterns and notations. I feel its a good recommended book for preparing for IBM OOAD certification test."},{"rating":"2","title":"OOA, OOD, UML, and Patterns","review":"Theory and practice are balanced through the development of a point-of-sale application. Excellent utilization of UML diagrams. Stimulating discussion of class design using the General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns (GRASP). Concentrates on domain objects. Distinguishes between closely related concepts such as conceptual vs. design model and multi-tiered system architecture vs. deployment architecture. Decomposes software using iterations, packages, and layers. Effectively presents object-oriented analysis and design while applying UML and patterns. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Software Engineering Title!","review":"I enjoyed this book greatly. It provided me with a solid understanding of how to work with UML and OOA/D. It not only covers the basics of UML but brings the reader through the process of creating software, using a persistent example throughout the book. It helped improve my knowledge of object oriented design and overall software engineering skill.I found the book clear and easy to understand. Additionally I found the examples very helpful in showing me exactly what needs to go into a certain UML artifact.The discussions on the GRASP design patterns and GoF design patterns were both very thorough and helpful and opened my mind to new ways of handling various software problems.The one problem I had with this book is the occasional instance in which the author contradicts himself.Overall an excellent book and I would recommend it to any future software engineer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from the real world...","review":"I was not able to learn what to apply, why and where - from this book. Maybe the development cycle is to be followed indeed as presented in the book. But why... it's not clear. How do the needs of the development translate into methodologies, good practices? Why follow this way and not the other? These are important questions left unanswered. Going UML in contrast with older analysis methods and languages should bring a plus - what will it help gain, what to avoid? (which I was to find out later on, unfortunately not due to this book). Instead, a baroque demonstration of scholarly correct style, an example of cheese-smiling perfect development cycle. Which is not the case in the real world... Contingency plans, balanced approaches, tackling strategies - save the day. The principles behind should have been explained first."},{"rating":"2","title":"good introduction and step through","review":"I wish we have this book in CS class.

Larman clearly breaks down all of the OO design concepts and gives clear illustrations of how they are applied to the point-of-sale system, which is used throughout the book. He does a great job of showing how all of the concepts can be applied to a given project and how the various diagrams and ideas are tied together. This also allows for the reader to quickly identify the different purposes of each of the concepts.Although it was nice that Larman used one consistent example throughout the book, I would have preferred if he had used a different example than a point-of-sale system. I really lost interest in hearing about a POS system towards the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cpre 486 Review","review":"This book is a great for beginners learning UML and design patterns.

This book is simple yet precise and tackles on many of the true difficulties and problems that ones faces while trying to apply an OO methodology.

The only drawback I found with this book is that it doesn't hold up well when subjected to water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if you are new to UML","review":"Larman does a decent job introducing UML and showing the reader what UML is good for. The book goes into some depth on the different types of class diagrams and shows how they can be useful. A great deal of the book is also spent on design patterns, but once again is better as a beginner book with general information about everything. This book is a great general resource on the subject, and also tells you where to look if you want more specific information in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn UML and Design Patterns","review":"This book was required reading for two courses that I took. I found it most useful for learning about UML and design patterns. It also contains many of the diagrams used when designing software. It is useful as a reference or for learning about these topics for the first time. The writing is succinct and allows the reader to quickly learn about the concepts presented. One puzzling aspect of the book is that when new concepts are introduced the solution is often presented ahead of the problem and I found this distracting. I also sometimes wished for more involved and complicated examples than were in the book. Overall I would recommend it for learning about software design and object oriented analysis and design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good learning tool for software developers","review":"This book did a good job in teaching the UML, UP, as well as design patterns in a step by step manner that everyone can follow.

I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to be a software developer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn OOA/D","review":"This is a good book if you are interested in learning about object-orientated analysis and design, the unified process, the universal modelling language and software patterns. The book does a good job of gradually introducing you to software development and takes you through a typical design process. Throughout the book there is a running example of designing a point of sale system that really helps you to apply what you're learning to a real world example. The author's ability to write and communicate the points he is trying to make also makes reading the book not tedious, but actually entertaining. I would recommend this book if you want to learn or increase your knowledge about software development."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT introduction to object-oriented design","review":"Despite the main title, this book is not just about the UML (UML is not OOA/D or a method, it is SIMPLY NOTATION).The book helps a developer learn core skills in the art and science of building object systems, rather than notation.In fact, it is not so helpful to learn syntactically correct UML diagramming, but then not be able to create an excellent design, or evaluate, or improve an existing one. This is the harder and more valuable skill.\\"How should responsibilities be allocated to classes of objects? How should objects interact? What classes should do what?\\"These are some critical questions in the design of a system.Knowing an object-oriented language is a necessary but insufficient first step to create object systems.

As the batteries wore down it did slow down, but still worked about the same.For such a low price you will be amazed how well this thing works. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a built in beard trimmer. So if you have a stray hair that sneaks buy or bends/curves into your flesh a bit you'll need a separate trimmer to cut it.I used to have a three foil Remington several years ago (it was great too) but can't find it anywhere anymore.

My very first original Microscreen was an excellent shaver, but the NI-CAD batteries in it died and were not readily replaceable. I had had several rotary shavers which never really worked well for me. So I bought a new Microscreen which worked well for me for many years until the batteries in it also died. This shaver is almost as good as these past shavers, but much less expensive. Some disadvantages: The screen is not replaceable. But for most other shavers, a replacement screen costs more than this whole shaver. I use the same AA rechargeable batteries in it that I use in my digital camera, so batteries are never going to make the whole shaver unuseable. It does shave a little slower than a normal one.

Just shows that price ($10 vs. $90) does not equal quality.Why four stars? A couple items:- Battery operated. Can get expensive over time to keep buying batteries, though the batteries do tend to last a while (2+ weeks) before speed of blade gets noticeably slower.- Can't replace the blades or foil. Small complaint, as the shaver is cheap enough to just buy a new one.- Does take a few passes to get a majority of the hairs (esp. after batteries are worn a little).- As with all electrics, tends to miss hair, especially in hard areas (under chin, around lip, next to ears, etc.)Overall, a great value to at least try BEFORE you spend $70+ on a rechargeable shaver."},{"rating":"2","title":"good shave","review":"Works great for a quick touch up at the end of the day or while traveling.

Takes too long to shave seems like it takes 5 to 10 minutes - after a while you will give up. I only use it since I spent my shaver budget and can't afford another.

There is nothing attractive about the heroine and I kept reading it thinking, \\"Oh,she's going to show soon, please soon, why such a great guy has put his faith and love in her\\". Alas no. There are lots of romance novels out there where the heroine is 15 or 20 years younger than the man, but in most of these, the author at least attempts to show that the lady has redeeming character traits, apart from her youthful appearance.

From the moment we laid her on the mat, she loves looking at herself in the star mirror that hangs from one of the arches, and although she doesn't quite get that it's HER kicking that activates the noise & lights, she still grins.The only drawback is that a couple of the Silly Sounds are annoying, especially the one that sounds like a cartoon arrow, but what is a little annoyance if your daughter is happy???The mat is quite generous, but still doesn't take up a ton of floor space, and is full of fun colors & characters, which seems better to me than just plain red,black & white.

In some states this may be illegal, not sure about my state, PA.I have a \\"vanity\\" plate, and found most typical frames cover the text at the bottom of the plate. This frame is only visible around the perimeter of the plate, which gives it a very nice appearance without getting in the way or being gaudy.The only complaint I have is that the chrome will begin to pit and flake after a few years, this is the second frame I purchased. The first one lasted about 4 years. However, for the cost, a new frame every few years is still a good deal to improve the look of a plain plate mounted on the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"fits my plate","review":"the plate frame is thin fits around my license plate.

They look almost as if though you don't have any frame at all.My biggest complaint about them, however, is that they are packaged with only 2 screws! I ended up attaching them to the car (front and back) with only the top screws available. It was simply too much of a hassle to return the 2 frames I bought. However, this makes the frames more flimsy and less attractive - the holes are there, but the screws are missing. So now I am going to have to shop around to find the matching screws to add at the bottom, which is also a hassle. In short, I wish the manufacturer didn't skimp out on something as small and inexpensive as 2 extra screws!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruiser plate cover","review":"This item shipped defective.

Many of the pictures were very poor in that they were out of focus, poor lighting, upside-down, or mislabeled. The majority appeared to be of the authors own plants, and as such, their presentation contradicted what the author was stating (e.g. the author states orchids should be given lots of room for free circulation of air, but the pictures showed plants crowded on top of each other). A lot of the text was repetitive where the same phrases were repeatedly used. Much of the culture information was written for people that live in a northern climate, such as New York where the author is from. It is of little use to people that live in warmer climates in the US or with any experience in growing orchids.

They just talk about the moves and then do one lame example--there is no stretching workout or sequence on the first DVD! So booooring!!!!!!!!!

Apart from the similar-minded Tortoise, Jim Black's arrangements never feel excessive or self indulgent.

This iron was my second one, because the 1st one I got was defective and did not heat up after the 1st week of owning it. I haven't had any problems with my second one. It heats up fast, and gets really hot. I think it was a good buy. My only complaint is that it snags a small amt of hair out(as with most irons)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for long, thick hair","review":"Although the teflon coating did not damage my hair, the unit did not heat up enough to curl my hair.

It is now October 2008, and it has just stopped working. I only used it 2-3 days a week, never dropped it, or got it wet. One day, it just stopped heating up :( Before that, it worked GREAT! It's hard to find a 2 inch barrel curling iron... Unfortunately, it has been longer than 30 days, so now I can't return it, and it can't be exchanged because it is no longer available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good results when it works","review":"My first iron did not work straight out of the package...the light came on but no heat. Sent it back for a replacement. Second iron worked great. The larger size of the iron works well with my layered long hair. It gave it nice body (not actual curls), tamed the frizzies and the teflon kept the barrel from getting gunked up. But after about 3 months, something happened to the spring in the arm and it lost some of its pressure making it harder to keep my hair on the iron. It still worked just had to adjust how I rolled my hair to curl it. After another couple of weeks the thing stopped heating correctly. It just gets warm.Now after all the trouble I've had with this model, i'm considering purchasing a different brand. The size is perfect, too bad the iron isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend this product!!","review":"I ordered this product on March 20, 2007.

All of the necessary techniques to produce a convincingly life-like fish carving are illustrated. The paint schedules are easy to follow and the addition of the colour section on step by step trout painting is excellent. The book contains a number of projects that build on each other. It is profusely illustrated and the instructions are easy to follow.Patterns (side view only) are provided for all of the projects in the book, plus several additional species. If the book has a major fault, it is that top view patterns are not included: a beginning carver will have difficulty in getting the top view proportions correct. Otherwise, this book is a good investment and I do, in fact, recommend it to my carving students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fish Carving: An Introduction","review":"This book was very nice as it introduced carving fish in action.

It's watchable enough if you've nothing better to do, but apart from an amusing early warning signal for arms smugglers (a local TV channel pulling its striptease show for technical reasons and replacing it with an old movie!) there's not much in the way of imagination on display.

You'll cry when their loved ones are sent to war, when the fated telegrams arrive, and when they are reunited. You'll read about amazing growth, struggles and triumph over fear.

She then goes on to skillfully weave a realistic tale of a young girl, who must brave the pressure of peers and a respected Rabbi, in order to extricate herself from an abusive situation. The falsehood in this book is its strength; It portrays an orthodox Rabbi as an abuser of young girls. Matas is careful to say that she modeled this character on her imagination. My objection to this book is that I doubt that she or anyone else can produce an example of an American Orthodox Rabbi doing what she says her fictional character is capable of.This book does not portray our world faithfully.

It also seems that most of the footage was shot in either the 70's or 80's, which isn't very entertaining.

It also shows how difficult it can be for a child to adapt from one culture to another (the title character, Winky, is a little girl who has recently moved from China to the Netherlands.)

Some of them speak of problems getting the game to run, while others sound almost like they were made by the developer to promote it.Luckily when I got the game it ran just fine. No crashes yet, having played around 80 of the levels.It's a nice, slower paced game to relax with after some hours of action games. Some of the puzzles can be a bit tricky but that just makes it more satisfying to finally solve them.Summing up my impressions: Game works fine on my year old PC running WinXP Home. It's a different kind of game from most I play (RPGMMO, shooters and strategy). It's fun to play around with all the gadgets and tools. Might have limited replay value once you find the best (simplest) solution for the puzzles.

The book was okay, it did not live up to Pamela Leigh Starr's other books. I loved Fate and the books that were sequel to that but Illusions was a disappointment.

Don Lee so perfectly describes the experience of boxing, the \\"lucid\\" feeling you get after a good workout (great word for it), that he HAS to have fought himself, right? Not only that, Danny's life experience seems to match my own in so many other ways (not that they really reflect well on me). I'm actually half Japanese, not Korean, and I'm going thru college now rather than in the 70s, but it really feels like someone took my life and made a book out of it.

It looks really nice, kept my tv area nice and orderly and the glowing blue base was a cool touch. Gotta say I was disappointed when about a month later the connector that fits into the dualshock was dangling and would only charge one of the controllers. Well, lo and behold it happened to the other one about a week later and even the glowing blue base stopped working. The way the connector is sitting is just a bad design. This charger was not built with quality materials or with frequent usage in mind. I'm skilled with a soldering gun but when I looked it over there were no screws, just large plastic pieces that would likely crack or break if any attempt was made for repairs. Since it was bundled together and I didn't have to pay for it, I saw no need to repair it or even send it back. You'll fare better with another brand, no doubt. This charger is junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly not high quality, but is aesthetically cool","review":"I just received this charging station yesterday and it is pretty much what I expected. The quality is cheap and I noticed a small (2mm) crack on the corner. It could be that ordering these is hit and miss, and I think I got lucky.Nevertheless, it is a pretty cool addition to my setup. The LED lighting it puts out looks best in a dark setting as its not super bright. I do enjoy being able to only take up one USB slot for controller charging so I can use the other one for my external hard drive.Another slight perk is that it charges controllers and lights up when plugged into the wall via an Apple iPad USB to AC charger, however, I'm not sure if it is meant for that voltage.All in all, just be gentle with it. If you leave it in a safe, sturdy place and don't fiddle with it too much, I'm sure it will be fine.Worth my seven dollars for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool product, good price.

A friend gave me this book and I honestly thought I wouldn't enjoy it as much as one of the usual Jane Austen books. I was wrong, it was very enjoyable. The \\"other lady\\" that finished up the book did a pretty good job of hitting the basic Jane Austen tone, pitch and pace with the story. There were a few sections that seemed to drag or amble in some odd directions, but on the whole, a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Tale","review":"I loved this book.

Perhaps the two stars I've given this piece is too harsh--it is in contrast with her other works that so few stars are given. The first portion of this book, the one Austen wrote, was surprisingly dull. The characters did not have the \\"life\\" one comes to expect from Austen. The second part of the book definitely \\"picked up\\", but seemed more like a Victoria Holt novel, than Austen. On the whole, it was more memorable to me as a disappointment than as anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant...","review":"I'm an incredible Jane Austen fan and have tried SO many of the sequels, pre-quels and alternative versions written by others, the large majority of which were incredible disappointing.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Finish","review":"This book, Sandition, was started by Austen and completed by \\"another lady\\" since Austen died before her story was done. Austen made it to chapter 11, and that is where \\"another lady\\" takes over. There is a definite difference in the writing; you can just tell that the remainder of the book is not true Austen. The chapters are longer, the characters are more bold and outwardly flirtatious and romantic, and the writing, while very Austen, just isn't authentic. However, the book was just as fun as Austen's many others. Who knows if this is how she meant for it to go, but it's an interesting tale nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completed, yes, but certainly not by Miss Austen!","review":"The dividing line between the work of Miss Austen and the work of the other person who worked on this book is far too obvious. Characters suddenly begin to say things that an Austen character would not allow herself to think.The writing of a novel of manners is made easier by an understanding of what is and is not considered good taste in the period repreented. Unfortunately, the perosn who ruined this book did not see it to take the trouble to do this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite worthy of Miss Austen","review":"Only fellow Austen-philes will be interested in this book, but they will not be disappointed. The good lady who finished it did a wonderful job. The characters and plot follow along quite as Miss Austen might have done.I cannot give a perfect score, because Sanditon is not fully Austen. There is one little twist that is a teeny bit more than Jane Austen probably would have gone (I refuse to ruin things for possible readers) and no-where else in Austen's books do the actual declarations of Love occur on-screen so to speak. These two things are handled quite well however.I like this book better than Emma, and may end up ranking it above Mansfield Park."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of imitators of jane austen","review":"I have read many of the sequels or completions of the books of Jane Austen and find this one to be by far the best. The plot is simple, but Jane Austen's plots were always basic. The prose transition between Austen and the \\"other lady\\" is absolutely seamless. I defy anyone to spot it without referring to the foreword which tells you where it is. The female characters are nicely done; the men as well developed as any of her characters. I have read and reread this many times and am as fond of it as I am of the \\"real\\" Austen books."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I love this book. I love Jane Austen. The author did a lovely job finishing this story. Her style is not that of Jane's (and she herself admits that), but it is a wonderful style - witty, engaging, intelligent and just plain fun. I couldn't put the book down and continue to pick it up several times a year for a re-read.

But he's still got some fairly good stuff like, \\"Spirit Move\\" \\"Walking on Water\\" and a few others. I kind of think he needs to do his \\"folk hop\\" or \\"folk rap\\" a little differently. He's definitely not a rapper. But I think he could improve.I will say this...this man has a heart for God. Praise God that we have talented singers like Paul Wright in this world."},{"rating":"1","title":"tongue and cheeky","review":"The best stuff on his previous album is heartfelt, beachy and mixed with some reggae.

It was just the pc of furniture I needed for the end of the loveseat, but the table has flaw in construction whichcauses it wobble while sitting on the floor. I placed a large cup of coffee on the table which caused a shift motion at base. I found that one leg of table is fraction shorter which causes it move. I love the end table. Now that I have the table put together and being handicapped---in intend keeping the table, Maybe my daughter can figure someway to fix it. It was great diappointment to find the flaw. Since it such a nice, well constructed table. I was going to purchase another one---but I don't want a table that rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"The table was delivered with a defective part.

However, I bought it within the past 6 months and 3 days ago noticed a small crack across the wood on one side of the top. I only keep the dish with my car keys on this. No heavy objects. Yesterday when I looked, there was a very large crack across another part of the wood on the top of the table and the small crack had grown a bit bigger as well. This is now a complete waste of my money as the return window closed a few months ago. Nice table, but a lifespan of 6 months is pretty worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I ordered two of these tables, one of them had a leg that was too short and the other had a crack in the table top. Move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"This product looks obviously cheap if you look at it from less than 5 ft away. The paint is too thin. The wood comes chipped in numerous places. The glass is too small for the cavity and moves if touched. It's good to look at from a distance but if you're planning to place this where guests can get up close, choose something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The wood on the inside (viewable under the glass) was not stained. It is unfinished wood. It would otherwise be a nice looking table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged on Arrival","review":"I purchased this table for my RV to go between two recliners. It is a cute table, but arrived damaged. The finish was rubbed off on a portion of the table rim. Also, the bottom shelf was cracked. My husband put the table together before I noticed the damage. Since I didn't want to go through the hassle of disassembly and paying postage to return it, I was able to sand and stain the rubbed off area so that it's not noticeable, and I will glue the crack in the shelf. If I were going to use this in my living room I would definitely return it, however. So, although it is just the right size and shape for my space, the condition it arrived in was barely acceptable. The box was intact, so the package was probably packed with damaged pieces. This does not speak well for Winsome Wood's quality control. I won't be purchasing any other products from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"winsome wood & glass end table","review":"Very flimsy and wobbly.

It is dark espresso in color almost black and very contemporary.

Considering the quality of the finish, materials, assembly difficulty, etc., this end table should have been priced closer to 25 bucks. Steer clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent table for the price","review":"I purchased this table to place a lamp on in my nursery next to my glider. This product isn't that hard to assemble as long as you follow the instructions step by step and make sure everything is securely in place first. Mine did come with some scratches on one of the wood legs so I would just look out for that. Also I wouldn't say it is something you would want to keep moving once placed but it serves its purpose. Overall I am happy with the quality of it for the price I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little table for the price!","review":"I got two of these tables yesterday, less than a week after I submitted my order. The first one was a little difficult to assemble- as a previous reviewer who purchased this piece noted, we too had some trouble lining one of the legs with the pre-drilled screw holes. To those who experience the same problem: it's much easier to position them properly with two people. With my help, my husband was able to get all the legs screwed to the base properly. The second table was a breeze to assemble- probably because we knew how we needed to position the legs. The finished product is a really handsome little end table! My only complaint is that the glass piece could fit a bit more snugly in the center. But hardly noticeable unless you are cleaning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winsome Wood Genoa End Table, Espresso","review":"This little table is decent for the price.

Actually one of the best buys."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap and it shows","review":"It was cheap that's about as good as it gets. Assembly is with those dang bolts and alan keys that have lost the threading before you actually get it together. Then when you put the glass on it its not secure and one knock and its gone. then what disappointed me most was when you stand up and look through the glass you can see the cheap unfinished wood... disapointed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!","review":"I love the shape of this table. The size is perfect in my bedroom next to my reading chair. Well packed, although the glass was chipped. That ends the positive things I can say about this table.Cheap,cheap,cheap!!!! Much smaller than it looks in picture, weird scale for a living room next to a couch. Wood not even finished on the inside rim, visible through the glass top. Wood sanded unevenly so finish is glossy then rough. Skip this table unless you are planning to use it as a side table in a small space and want to do some stain work to even it out...I gave it two stars only because I like it in my bedroom (although I bought it for my living room), it has a nice shape and stain color next to my reading chair. I am still annoyed when I look at it because I have not had time to stain the raw wood circle under the glass. I only kept it because repacking it to return it was too much hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"not fully finished","review":"these tables are missing an important finishing touch....the interior wood on the top circular table top is not finished with the dark wood stain. which wouldn't be a problem if the table didn't have a clear class top.

Remember in the future to keep the consumer happy and not to spiral into too much detail.Although thankyou to xperfectdarknessxx for telling me that it did not contain Jade from Sweetbox. That my friendly shoppers is something you might wanna know.Therefore I did not purchase it, so do not pay any attention to my rating.Final Fantasy...the only good reason to spend day after day glued to the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done, why couldn't have Nobuo worked on it?","review":"This soundtrack has some serious problems. To be the most obvious, it wasn't composed by Uesmatsu, so right off the bat you know it's not going to be that good. Secondly, with an exception of a few songs, the entire soundtrack is horrible. The durations of the songs (time a song lasts before it repeats) barely average over 40 seconds. In comparison, final fantasy VIII has an average duration of about 1:40. One of the songs, \\"Bikanel Desert\\" is about 25-30 seconds! Wow, that's pathetic. Im not telling you this because I hated the game,in fact I liked it, it's just that im a serious video game music fan and this soundtrack did not please my tastes at all.If you really like this soundtrack, go ahead and buy it, but I strongly advise to save your money and spend it on something else, like a chrono trigger or FF VI - FF IX soundtrack. Sorry, but this doesn't deserve to be a true final fantasy soundtrack. Don't buy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best of game music","review":"so many songs, so little time.

The song \\"Real Emotion\\" and \\"1000 Words\\" are really cool sounding. It is worth spending your money on. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No sign of Nobuo Uematsu","review":"Its waaay different than any FF soundtracks out there. It just needed a little bit of Nobuo Uematsu's work. The songs in disk 1 has 31 tracks. It starts off with a pretty piano song called Memory Waves of the Light then goes to \\"real Emotion\\" performed by Koda Kumi which is a very kool song if your interested into Jpop. Track 3 is YRP Battle 1 which is a disco-ish song. The only songs i liked were Memory Waves of the Light, real Emotion, YRP Battle 1, Besaid Island, The Machina Faction, Yuna's Ballad, which is a beuatiful piano song, Memory Waves of the Light 2 (better than the first), 1000 No Kotoba (which is also performed by Koda Kumi)is a pretty melodic song, and I really liked the Ending theme. It sounded happier than the one in FFX if you played it.I reccomend this CD to anyone who likes Jpop, piano songs, and disco music. But don't expect to many \\"touchy-feely\\" songs. And if you only go for Nobuo's work, I wouldn't reccomend this one.-Chihiro Hironobu ^_~"},{"rating":"2","title":"An original soundtrack... just like it should be","review":"I first would like to thank Ian Vance for his thorough and subjective review. For all those who were critical of this soundtrack (mostly those who were upset Nobuo Uematsu didn't contribute his amazing talent to this game's soundtrack), I'd like to point out the game's story and style is totally different to its predecessor. I find the music highly appropriate for the game. In a story where there are three girls going out to collect spheres and have fun, why not have some J-pop and synthesized music with an upbeat tempo?Now I should say that I really can't stand pop music, but both songs, \\"1000 Words\\" and \\"Real Emotion\\" are great!Music for locations such as Besaid, Kilika, Gagazet, Bikanel Desert, etc felt perfectly paced and placed. I felt I was actually there.My suggestion to all those who love Final Fantasy is to go into the game and the music with open eyes and ears. I'm sure you'll enjoy it if you take the music for what it's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like any other Polly product","review":"I think that this was a great item - something unique from what I can usually find around here.

Dont spend $25 on this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where did all the pieces go?","review":"That's the problem with Polly Pockets--little pieces always get lost. The problem with this one is that my daughter couldn't even figure out how to use those tiny pieces of paper that are supposed to be like film for the photo booth.

Christmas is promptly reinstated 10 minutes later at the 77-minute mark, although viewers aren't privy as to exactly *why* (the main character goes into the courthouse and returns shortly after to triumphantly announce that Christmas has been reinstated). Need I say more?Viewers can then spend the last 8 minutes regretting that they just wasted their time with this movie, and wondering how it ever got made in the first place. Unfortunately, those are two things I end up doing more often than I'd like. The only thing that could've made this movie worse is if I actually spent money to rent it, but fortunately I got it as a free MVP rental at Hollywood Video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens ate my homework","review":"This book is mainly about a kid named Rod Allbright he is in the sixth grade he is picked on in school that is smaller than him named Arnie Markle and he is trying to see how many bugs he can squash into Rod's hair.

Rod Allbright says, \\"I cannot tell a lie.\\" And he can't, even when six aliens crash into his bedroom and eat his homework. He is in big trouble.

I would not recommend this book for anybody. I would rate it a one star. The reasons are: One there wasn't any suspence in the story you could finger out most of the things that were going to happen. The story didn't have a climax. There wasn't a surprise ending and there was no twist in the story. The main character is Rod Allbright and they really don't explain much about him. There was really not a steady setting. They were at school, houses, a field, and a front yard. The theme was not clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens ate my homework","review":"My opinion for this book is the sometimes the characters in this bool say stupid things, but sometimes the things they say are pretty funny.

Aliens Ate My Homework is an intriguing story about a little boy who is thrown head first into a science fiction adventure. Rod, the main character, is enlisted to search out a space criminal hiding here on Earth with the help of his new found extraterestrial friends. This book is as exciting as it is delightful. The story is not only well written but is appealing to boys and girls alike. While the entertainment value of this book is high, the honesty of Rod is most impressive. With so much dishonesty in the world and the saturation of our children in it. I find this truthful character to be a refreshing change. I would suggest it to all.

Even today I have resentment about how we were pressured while we were doing what was ethical. After the contract was awarded I was interviewed perhaps 2 hours by a Army Crimminal Investigator.

I gave an honest answer to his question."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd say this is their best.","review":"Unlike VOA's two previous releases, I'd say this one is actually pretty good. They have a new female vocalist who, while faulting only a bit on her lower notes, really outshines the old vocalist when she goes for those higher notes. The songs are also a lot better. They still maintain the band's creative symphonic metal sound, but also have some catchier choruses, some nice guitar solos and some excellent drumming. Some really touching duets between the male and female vocalist are featured also.The CD's only downfall would have to be its lyrics. The words can get a bit corny at times. Lines like \\"I'm so sorry 'cause you're dead\\" don't do it for me, personally. It'd also be nice if the vocalists put a bit more emotion into their voices and concentrate on what they're singing about instead of getting a perfect, crystal clear sound.I'd recommend it, nonetheless, for symphonic metal fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I was hoping to gain some respect for Islam as a religion, but the book only gave me farther proof that it is a complete sham.

The lyrics are not deep and the music may seem a little repetitive to most, but these guys have infectious energy. I have never seen them live, but I can only imagine it being amazing. Their jaunting guitars and so-British-it-isn't-even-funny harmonies should sink in rather quickly. Songs like \\"Decent Days and Nights\\" and \\"A to B\\" should help you to understand the genius of this band if you need proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angular, Edgy Retro-Pop","review":"As a big fan of both the Jam's early work and XTC's entire catalog, I listened to the opening notes of THE FUTUREHEADS and knew exactly where they were coming from. Along with the Dead 60s, these guys are rechanneling quality New Wave pop from the early 1980s like nobody's business.But I wouldn't insult the band by calling them derivative; after all, you can't riff on XTC without having the ability to write a catchy tune. On songs like \\"Decent Days and Nights\\" and \\"Meantime:,\\" the Futureheads show they have a knack for songwriting. There are missteps; \\"Danger of the Water\\" and \\"The City Is Here for You...\\" are too ambitious by half, but again, you can't fault them for aiming high. So I'll admit that I'm rating this CD a little bit higher based on the band's potential and moxie.SIDELIGHT: In the true spirit of New Wave pop music, most of the songs here clock in at just over two minutes.

The Futureheads may be the most dogged and the most energetic band I have heard in a while. They sound a little like The Jam and a little like Devo. They are a young band. The songs are urban and intense. They even do a Kate Bush cover. Songs like \\"Le Garage\\" and \\"robot\\" are a little art school. Their vocals are pretty amazing. Some songs are like a blitz. Andy Gill from Gang of Four is on hand. This band is supposed to be good live. It's time to check them out now. Music must look towards the future for inspiration. This is a powerhouse record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Few albums engineered like this one","review":"The Futureheads have crafted an amazing album which anticipates a listener's tastes, captures their attention and pulls them into a very alien sound that works so well. My first listen, left me unimpressed, I listened to a very Franz Ferinterpol kind of track, after which I skipped around and was left wondering what I was listening to and was left with a bad taste in my mouth. I made the mistake of skipping around this album. While on a road trip I listened a 2nd time begining to end and it was a totally different album. Amazing, every song creating a feeling that predicates the next.

If some repair shops are repairing 17 or more of the same sets for the same problem, then Toshiba should know what the problem is.

If anything, it makes us think twice about what the league, management and media types say about the people who actually play the game. While they are paid professionals, Platt shows us how little their pre-NBA experiences prepare the players for the big time and all that fame brings them.The language used in the book - while rough - only adds to the impact of what the players themselves have to say about what is happening. If anything, language is obviously used as a weapon (esp. in Charles Barkley's case). You really have to think more about the message's intent rather than how it's expressed.Great book - highly recommended to all those starry-eyed wannabes who think they have the right stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is for real","review":"While I can't feel sympathy for high-paid professional athletes under any circumstances, I loved this book's perspective.

So buy this book if you are interested in the mathematical theory and ideas behind numerical analysis.

There is little hand-waiving here. However, this is hardly a book to learn by.The typesetting could have been a bit better. I wish the proofs had been set off from the examples and the text a little more. There is also too much referencing to earlier equations. Rather than referring me over and over to equatin (6.2.1), just re-write the equation.Also, this book is starting to show its age. It is now 11 years old, so its bibliography is a bit outdated, as are references to computer programs.My most severe criticism of this book is that it is sorely lacking in explanations. There is little intuition provided here. Definately not an undergrad book. A much better text to learn from--but not as useful as a reference as this book is--is Burden and Faires. B&F make lots of use of pseudo-code and I applaud them for it. It helps detangle some of the math."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"I had fun when we recorded this album in 1995.

Daniel found a literary portal combining colourful experiences and factual information, creating an effective basis for psychedelic drugs and the dying shamanistic beliefs.Overall, i saw B.O.T.H. as a helpful insight into Daniel's becomings and his flight into shamanism, giving forth a wonderful palette of beliefs, rituals and ways of life throughout worlds we may never experience, see again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan the man!!!!!","review":"Simply stated, Daniel Pinchbeck might be poised to be the next Terrence McKenna for this decade.

He speaks to the bourgeois simply without being over-intellectual. He's right.....The knowledge of God and other dimensions is accessed thru plant mediums.

I took them a working laptop, with a couple minor things that needed to be fixed. Now, they've taken my hard-drive, and won't give it back. I keep calling everyone involved, but am seriously considering a criminal complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This book will not help you if you really have a serious computer problem, chances are, the author will suggest you better take your computer to a technician. Why then did i buy the book? The so called solutions are summaries on how to fix problems as the author tries to cover three major applications problems under 218 pages. I suggest he writes three separate books for each application,(Mac, windows 3.X and widows 95/98). This book might be good for someone who wants to learn tips on maintenance or how to prevent computer problems. I had to buy another book that helped me with my problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the Geek Squad should read this book","review":"In my dealings with the Geek Squad, I've found them quite incompetent. I won't go into the my main story because it's so darn long. But, they're awful. If you need to take your PC somewhere, please take it anywhere BUT to the Geek Squad.About the book. The book is full of very basic, but useful information for the novice computer user. Honestly, I think you'd be better off with a PC Repair for Dummies book or something.If you think about it. Would the Geek Squad rather you buy the book ($15), or bring your PC to them (min. $120, but probably more)? They'd probably prefer BOTH. However, they don't want to provide enough info in the book to keep you from visiting them and giving them more money.To sum it up. The book is okay, very basic, but I think you'd be better off with a \\"For Dummies\\" book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of the 224 pages maybe a total of 5 are worth reading.","review":"This book is very vague. If you know anything about computers it is a complete waste of money. I read the whole book and found, at most, five pages of quality reading. They have a funny name, but geeks should keep to fixing computers not writing books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable for complete beginners","review":"The GeekSquad has been around for years. They originated in the Twin Cities with a gimmick - suits and cool cars. Apparently they've fixed the computers of celebrities (ooh). When I was still living in the Twin Cities, however, my experience was that with any computer problem that required more than basic skills to fix, the GeekSquad was sorely lacking. Many problems went undiagnosed through several GeekSquad visits, though they will happily take your money anyway. If only for this reason, I'm a bit loathe to trust any book that they happen to have written. If you really want to get hands-on with learning and repairing PC's, don't bother with this book. Better books are ones like Scott Mueller's \\"Upgrading and Repairing PC's\\", as well as anything from O'Reilly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"I find that I waste my money on this book.

I will never, even all these years later, shake what he did - this book helped me come to grips with a small part of what happened as I was too young then to understand.

My friend deserved better. *ALL* his victims deserved better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary...good read!","review":"I recently moved from California to Montana and one evening the area around Missoula was being discussed for my benefit. The subject eventually came around to crime and the lack of it in this area except for the events in this book. It is a true story, a little scary but worth my time to learn about my new enviroment.

Winston Rodney and the band easily earn their titles as reggae prophets in this spiritual album that lacks any mediocrity. It is a merciless seduction of the listener, I only wish it was longer. It isn't as well produced as Live in Paris or later recordings, but it is an elegant recording from one of reggaes living messiahs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will shred speakers","review":"Massive low end, clear drums, and the vocals and horns rock solid in your face.

The live versons of Old Marcus Garvey, Slavery Days, Man in the Hills surpass the studio version in power, emotion, intensity and pure groove. I only wish it was longer.

(OK, maybe \\"Police Squad\\" was funnier, but it only ran for six weeks, not eight years.)In season 3, this show was just starting to hit its stride. Steve Landesberg's Arthur Dietrich became a recurring character. In season 4, he joined the cast full-time, and added a bit of absurdity that seemed to inspire the rest of the cast. The first two seasons were entertaining, but in season 3 we began to see the sparks of one of the best comedy ensemble casts ever.Jack Soo's dry delivery as Nick Yemana always cracked me up; he was in good form here, but got even better later. He is missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent show POOR package","review":"One of the finest sitcoms of the 70's & early 80's. The show gets five stars hands down.

Yawn. and there is a bit of remastering, which sparkles everything up a notch. Why else you might want to pick this up, I couldn't really say. If you liked the Heads, this adds nothing but the MTV side of the story to your collection. If you don't like them, this won't convince you. If you're curious, yeah, why not, I suppose.

The material is obviously some of the best of the past 40 years, and the boxed set is a well curated mix from a prodigous band. It's great to see those videos again and remember that this, the music and the images was and is cutting edge stuff. these were white kids RISD grads at that) playing dare i say black music on a punk rock stage.as far as the packing, it's awesome. so what if it won't fit on your tidy cd shelf. the talking heads never fit on any shelf either, why should their packaging?"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"It took me a moment to catch my breath after finishing this book. I can't remember when I last laughed so hard at the tragic and was so moved by the trivial. Galanes is really successful at destabalizing the reader. It makes this book a surprising and thrilling emotional journey. I'm a straight woman and felt all Matthew's powerlessness and desperation. An excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too facile","review":"So this is what Knopf is publishing now? The novel is just so formulaic and tired. Gay young man sees shrink and then thinks about his past and cut to a flashback of that scene in the past. Back to the present and the phone line scenario which works once and only once. Back to shrink and another scenario. Flash to scene in real time. Just not artful at all. 1 1/2 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious, name dropping drivel","review":"I found the book tedious, too full of name and label droppings. Every item was from some obscurely expensive store, or some reference to an author no ordinary person would know. I am gay, but find this kinda of gay writing to represent a very one sided gay life, full of bitchy, vacuous, demeaning comments. The most important part of the book seems to have been glossed over, the part where Matthew feels up his dad while he is asleep, and from this he feels somewhat responsible for his suicide. Lots of tired \\"Woody Allenesque\\" dialog and self reflection. It has all been done before, AND MUCH BETTER. Straight people might like it as it provides a cleaned up version of gay chat lines, but sounds like the musings of a pill popping, name dropping circuit queen trying to validate his lawyerly life of cash cash cash.And like the other reviewer said about the cover, I too find the cover art boring and trite. Yikes, and that author picture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unanswered questions answered at last!","review":"Way back in the beginning of the Deathlands series, the author gave us our first glimps into Zulu Redoubt. An inbred family tried very hard to kill Ryan and his band. Anyhow, there was a locked off section of the redoubt that we were never once allowed to see what was hidden. UNTIL NOW!The secret that laid dormant for nearly two centuries was awakened by a magistrate and archivist. The end result was the death of a Baron which has never happened before in the history of the villes.Kane, Grant, Brigid and Domi are sent to investigate the death, and the implications. They discover far more than they ever expected. Yet another mystery left over from the Archon Directive.The name isn't misleading, but Doomstar isn't what you expect it to be.And to the author.... I want to see Tara return!Chris Van Deelen Owner of the Deathlands web survival Guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and unusual","review":"I thought this was an excellent book with an unusual angle, focusing on the tragic love Roberta/Tara felt for the evil Barch.The concept of a holographic assassin with particles of anti-matter mixed in with her energy field was very original.When Tara's primary programming kicked in and she and went on a slaughter spree against those who had been using her--yikes!I really liked the way Brigid reached her by appealing to her human counterpart's broken heart.That part of it was a real tear-jerker.This was a great book from the opening chapters in the steamy swamps of Louisana to the explosive climax in snowy Alaska."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and Inspirational","review":"The stories are very inspiring, the photos are great, and the book itself is well done from the cover on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"A bit pricey for an album but I think it was worth every penny.

Every one of their previous albums contain some essential indie rock up to this one. They were on a roll, the albums were getting more and more consistent, the buzz around them was getting huge, then they fall flat on their face. This is a classic example of a major label sell out. The music has lost all the attitude, edge and electricity. Its hard to even recognize Mr. McCloud's trademark vocal. These guys had to have been taking cues from the corporate people. Shame on you.This is a great band, but don't bother with this one!

There are so many stories, all important, all unforgettable, and most horrific. And I am completely amazed at the simplest lesson gleaned from these stories. . . life goes on. The human desire to live despite the atrocities of mankind constantly enlightens and inspires me. The human act of forgiveness in the face of these demeaning acts seems to be almost inhuman or perhaps otherworldly. And love; when our humanness is completely and utterly exposed to our world of those who love us most, there remains to ability to empathize, sympathize and forgive, and yes to go on. Les we forget. This book is a lovely story of love and forgiveness, fathers and sons, and guilt and redemption.

This movie was not funny in the least. If anything, it's Twilight Zone-ish appeal made me feel like I should smoke a joint. Definitely trippy and weird, the movie's cover box makes the renter/buyer think they are getting a great slapstick hit. Not so. The movie had absolutely no plot, which I did find appealing and different, but Lewis' character as the Bell Boy was a mute until the very end of the film, relying solely on bodily actions. Of course, Lewis does do many of his famous faces throughout the film, but other than that, it was just a weird, weird movie.

Because of its vitamin k content, it reduces or eliminates the affect of blood thinners such as Coumadin, Plavis and even low dose aspirin. Vitamin K, present in extremely high quantities in green tea, promotes coagulation and consequently the formation of clots.

But Amazon's price is now higher than the local store","review":"This tea is wonderful, a good blend of vanilla and spices, and a good amount of tea as well.However, with Amazon's recent price hike, changing the subscribe and save discount to only 5% (was 15%), this tea is now cheaper at Wal-mart. I can buy a single box at Wal-mart for $2.34 (including the sales tax, list price only $2.18), and this six-box set at Amazon now costs $2.42 per box (without sales tax).The tea I would give a 5-star, but downrating to four because it can be bought elsewhere for less. Shame on Amazon! The bulk rate for six boxes should be competitively priced, at or below what it costs at local stores.Addendum: Amazon must really want to get out of the retail tea business. Now a few days later, after I even submitted the \\"tell us about a lower price\\" form, informing them of the lower price available elsewhere, Amazon instead RAISED the price of this tea even higher. Strange indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigelow - more flavorful than the other Oolong bag teas","review":"I have tried numerous brands of packet Oolong tea, such as Twining, Choice Organic, etc. but each time I have been disappointed by the flavor. I recently realized that even though my grocery store doesn't carry Bigelow... well, the internet does! I was curious to see whether I was remembering the tea properly (if it was as good as I remembered), and I'm happy to report that yes, it IS better. This brand of Oolong is by far more the most flavorful of the ones I have tried, and it does not become bitter easily - you have to brew it a long time for that to happen. It's nice to drink something that actually tastes like tea, rather than hot water. :-) Anyway, feel free to try the others as well, but I think you'll find that this brand brews with a superior taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift idea","review":"Sent this item as a gift to my newly expecting son and wife.

If you drink 4 cups in two days or less this shouldn't be a problem. but if you only drink one cup per day then by the 4th day the last bag is starting to show some age because the envelope is open to the air.I only wish I had noticed this sooner and I would have bought the 20 count size box instead.Well, I guess I will just have to drink more tea so it wont go stale.

But, I have wanted to start drinking it for years, due to all the health benefits of green tea. This finally gives me, someone who enjoys black tea, something with flavor.If you like Earl Grey black tea, give this a try. It's not nearly as flavorful as black tea, as it essentially only tastes and smells like bergamot, but it enables me to drink green tea on a regular basis and actually enjoy it!If you are a green tea aficionado, then be warned that you may find the taste/smell of bergamot to be overpowering.6 boxes of 20 bags is a LOT of tea just to try.

Otherwise, you might want to think twice. This tea smelled wonderful while brewing, but in the cup the taste is muted and muddled. There is some kind of spice there--I know because 1) it says so on the package and 2) I can feel the bite of something on my tongue, but I can't place what the spice is and it's aroma is barely discernible during drinking. It's like a mouthful of flat, flavorless... I don't know what. It was unbearable without sugar, and it didn't improve with it. I didn't add milk because I didn't want to waste milk.

The Wulong/Oolong whole leaf tea is an aromatic, delightful tea - golden in colour and has a wonderful taste that does not require sweetening. The tea bags are nothing like it. It smells like regular tea (like a Lipton, or any other generic), the colour is dark and the flavor nothing special; even after sweetening with honey or sugar it does not improve.If you want to experience the delight of drinking Oolong tea, do not get it like this. Get it as whole leaves.I will continue drinking this (120 bags @ $16) but I won't enjoy it but winter is coming, I'll have reason to drink tea...or find someone who likes this and give it to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"My wife is the tea person in the house and she is very happy with this peach tea.

I wanted so badly to give it 5 stars, but I wouldn't be honest if I did. I don't like the cinnamon flavor. To me, peach and cinnamon don't belong together. Peach is summer and cinnamon is winter. This tea might be better in the winter as hot tea, but then again, not, because peach is too summery. Cinnamon would go better with apple flavor. As soon as I finish this box, I will not buy it again.The cinnamon is way too strong. It made me sick at my stomach, and the aftertaste is horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tea - be informed about packaging","review":"This is a great decaffeinated organic green tea - especially, since there aren't that many choices on the market today. However, I wish I'd read some of the reviews before ordering so that I understood that the bags are not individually wrapped. There are 4 bags to a package. Which has its pluses and minuses, in my opinion. I like to take tea with me when I go out to eat and it's much more convenient, for me, to have one tea bag in a package, rather than four. But, how picky do you want to get? And, is it enough to keep me from purchasing this product again? I'm not sure? It's probably the best value around but, for me, there is definitely a trade off between value and convenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Searched many stores for this, happy to find on Amazon!","review":"After enjoying this delicious tea at a friend's, I looked and looked in many stores to find this tea.

I find the flavor refreshing when it is hot out. This tea just does not deliver the mint like other brands do. I find this to be problematic when I bought the tea specifically for this purpose. I confess, it could be that this tea just does not like cold brewing, but that would make it unlike every other tea I have ever bought.If you wish to enjoy the tea as a cold brew, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tea on earth!","review":"This is my favorite tea.

Good to help you clear your mind before bed. Again, I'm not saying it will, so don't depend on it. It's just one of the best drinks to add to your bed time routine.

I've found green teas can be easily \\"burned\\" if you boil your water before steeping, so be sure to stop heating your water before the boiling point (I just use a Chantal ceramic teapot & heat a cup of water in it in the microwave for just 2 minutes, then steep in a cup--perfect. I like to sweeten it with a package of Sweet Leaf Stevia==healthy antioxidant heaven & no caffeine!).Also, don't steep any green tea too long--about 3 to 3-1/2 minutes is just right for green tea--otherwise, it WILL be bitter, regardless of brand.I love the fact that these tea bags are individually packaged in foil-lined packs; tea stays fresh and delicious until you're ready to enjoy a cup.

Of course, I add a splash of half & half to it, and that makes it creamy as well. Back to the whole point, it actually helps to make you sleepy.

When I received my order confirmation, it specified 3 WEEKS for shipping, including 8 days to just ship it, and 13 days for transit.I immediately went down to the local grocery store, bought a 20 count box for $2 (on sale), and then cancelled my order.Maybe I need to work on my patience and planning, but who in their right mind would order 240 tea bags and wait 3 weeks for it to save 2 cents a bag?Oh, I did drop Amazon a note about this; all I got back was an email from a contact center in India, regurgitating the shipping policy and apologizing for any \\"inconvenience\\".

A big name in the tea industry.I steeped a Japanese green tea (Sencha) in one clear glass mug and Bigelow's in another glass mug.Rules: allow the boiling water to sit for 4 min. Then gently steep for 4 min. Place onto a large pure white table top.The difference was dramatic. The Bigelow's green tea looked brown next to the Sencha tea.The taste was just as dramatic. Bitter initial flavor with a dull harsh after taste vs. A Smooth consistent green tea flavor.I repeated this 3 weeks later with a different batch of Bigelow's. Same difference.So if it's GREEN tea your looking for - Bigelow's is not the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAKSAUCE","review":"The quality of the tea itself is not the problem here(though it is not that great), its the quantity in each bag that I have an issue with. Compared to other brands of organic green tea, these bags seem to contain about half as much green tea leaves, causing me to use two bags for each cup of tea I brew, otherwise I just end up with a dissatisfying cup of weak tea. Go to Trader Joe's and get a box of their organic green tea,their tea bags are filled generously, and your tea will be a nice bright green!I'm sure there are other great brands of organic green tea, I just have had great experiences with the Trader Joe's brand. Bigelow brand seems to be trying to make up for the more expensive costs of providing you with organic tea by skimping on the amount in each bag. I really don't blame them though, they gotta keep profit margins up in these tough times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"Because this got such good reviews, I decided to try it as a substitute for my favorite Celestial Seasonings India Spice chai, which has disappeared from my local grocery store. This is some of the worst chai I've ever tasted. It had a very strong artificial vanilla flavor, and none of the after bite that good black teas should have. It was so bad that I could not force myself to finish the box. I do like their classic Constant Comment, but I cannot recommend this Vanilla Chai."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherished classic!!","review":"One of the classics of trekdom - have owned one copy or another since it first came out.

Still, it has some quite big faults. Biggest of all is the dates, the first Enterprise served 2221-2285, not some time around the turn of the century and the NCC-1701-A did not possess a Transwarp Drive like described in the book.

You will fall in love with the characters in Only By Your Touch and wish the book was longer!

Silent Partner was billed as a tense thriller. The only tension I felt was wondering how much longer it would go on. The thrill came when it finally ended. The actors moved as if they were zombies on Prozac, and Elliot Gould delivered his lines in a flat monotone that was a good substitute for Ambien. Interspersed with this dullness were a few scenes of graphic and shocking violence that, because they did not fit the overall ho-hum tone of the movie, were gratuitous. If you want a good thriller, spend your money on practically any Alfred Hitchcock movie, not a sadly inferior Hitchcock wannabe."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Silent Partner","review":"This is an older movie,but still good.

I bought the Japanese import on Laserdiscs more than 10 years ago, and was so happy to hear that it was finally coming out on DVD. It was such an important project on so many levels, not to mention the eclectic mix of artists and songs. The laserdisc was pretty good, with an additional 12\\" x 12\\" booklet included with the disc. It was a great presentation and transfer, and I was first in line on street date to get the DVD.I don't think that I've seen a transfer this bad on DVD, ever. It's really THAT bad. It looks like they took a worn out VHS copy of a copy and mastered it on disc. Yeah, it's that bad.I hated writing this review because I don't want to diminish sales for this project. But this DVD should be recalled, and some serious quality assurance should be applied to a remaster.

In spite of a few technical inaccuracies in regard to some medical sightings and the abilities of nanomachines, it is a truly great book. As a believer in Christianity, I found the plot and its themes irresistible. The plot is detailed and follows the end time prophecies of the Bible with astounding clarity. Fans of the suspense/mystery genre will enjoy the pages of heightened tension, although it fails to measure up to Stephen King or John Grisham. I look forward to reading the author's next novel and hope the originality of this one can be topped.

The first couple of chapters didn't flow very well, in my opinion. But I kept reading and was glad I did.The scientific/technology element to this story was facinating. The world we live in is so techno hungry and I see some plausability in this plot. The book is very well written and will pull you in. This is one I couldn't put down and only found myself wishing it had been longer!If you are looking for a end-of-times book with more bite then the Left Behind series, this one will NOT disappoint you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a muddled mess","review":"I like the concept and the technical bits and philosophical questions are worth a read. The plot however is a muddled mess. There are really only two characters you want to care about but they are not given the room to develop into believable, three dimensional characters. The novel is suppose to be tied in with end-times as in the book of Revalation, but I don't see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"He sure looks nice on the shelf..","review":"For a collector, this toy is quite good. It is very detailed, and just looks darned cool. He has his mace, and his sword. You'll need this toy to complete the array of major characters from the Pellenor Fields battle in ROTK. (He fought with Eowyn, as if you could forget that awesome scene..)But, while he is detailed and very nice looking, he has some problems.1: His arms are too short.2: He has some trouble standing.3: His robes are awesome, but they render his button activated action feature completely innefectual. They get in the way. Plus, the mace is so heavy, and it is attached to a chain, so it hardly works anyway.Nonetheless, this is one of the best looking LOTR action figures in my opinon."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are other much better SF Guides.","review":"As a Bay Area resident, I stopped buying the Zagut guides long ago.

Les does all his own camera work and does not have a camera crew with him. He gets extra points for that. He has to lug the camera gear, and if you see him walking off, it means that he had to go back and get the camera. Everyone seems to like this show. I also like Man vs. Wild, but Bear Grylls has a camera crew with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Les is great!","review":"I enjoyed watching the Survivorman episodes. Les gets dropped off in the middle of nowhere with very little to help him except what an average person might have with him. This show is interesting, educational, funny and a lot of fun to watch. I was hoping that it would have the episode in which he stranded himself in the snow in a car and had to make his way back.I have also watched Man vs Wild and have found that not to be as good. He always brings a flint to make fire and a canteen full of water, not to mention a camera crew. Les brings none of that with him.

He helps you tackle your behavioral and emotional problems through rules and reports (how you should think about things). He also shows that there are fallacies in reasoning, and he provides you antidotes to over come these fallacies.This book is a fantastic guide to helping someone think in the approved manner.

Unfortunately, it turned out to be only a polemic against feminist pagans and assorted Christians. There is less than 5 pages here actually about pagan male deity in any form or concept, and even that is mostly presented in the negative as what the god is not rather than what He positively is.

At the end of book five with The Chairman & Lilith running rampant, I figured book 6 would be a slam dunk of non stop action and demon/vampire butt kicking. Instead, it was a 500 page mess of he said-she said, nothing but bickering between housemates and drama, drama, DRAMA!!!I really think L.A. Banks could've just eliminated 7/8's of this entire book out of the series and we wouldn't have missed any key elements. It wasn't until, literally, the last 30 pages that it was worth reading.

Even the Guardians are affected, albeit to a lesser degree; the \\"thrill is gone\\" from Damali and Carlos's relationship, and the tension rises when Damali finds herself thinking of Jose in the physical sense, and there is serious distrust throughout the Guardian team...especially between the Neterus. In order to stop the pandemic, the Guardians must find and behead both Lilith and the Chairman...and Carlos must retrieve the Book of the Damned and return it to the Light....before souls everywhere, including Guardian souls, are lost forever.Never one to disappoint, Banks has delivered another winner in her series....anxiously awaiting The Forsaken."},{"rating":"2","title":"The damned","review":"I loved the story from the beginning I was reeled in.

It captivated me and I look forward to the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another great read","review":"I continue to rave about Banks's Vampire Huntress Legends. The Damned is equally exciting and moving. The in-depth look into all the characters continues the saga. She's like a juggler keeping all the balls in the air, and not dropping a one. This book is a bit deeper in that Carlos returns to his bad-boy-self, giving a brief break to his move into \\"The Light.\\" She allowed human nature to remain center stage saying, in essence, that we are not all good. I hope Banks continues to keep Carlos's duel personality in the mix. She hints that the female and male Neteru are going to really come together in the next book. I can barely wait for \\"The Forsaken.\\"Amazon's rating scale is wrong.

I must be too old, I need a dictionary to understand all the ghetto talk, I spend more time translating the ghetto talk to older person talk to really get into the book. I guess I am not the 20-something that this series is aimed at. I am wondering if it was written in modern English if I could read more of it, even if I haven't read the previous installments in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Disappointed","review":"Well the Queen has done it again! I was NOT disappointed with this 6th installment of the Vampire Huntress Legend series. L.A. Banks has continued to add depth, intrigue and most assuredly DRAMA to her characters and storyline. I feel like I know each and every character intimately. This time around, the reader is lead on a more emotional, soul searching journey than in \\"The Forbidden\\" (the 5th book), and while I was wringing my hands w/ emotional frustration I was loving every bit of it. As always Banks has masterfully incorporated; history, culture, diversity, politics, world events, religion, and the supernatural into a FANTASTIC story. This is definitely a MUST read and a valuable addition to any library.P.S. The illustrated poster by Eric Battle which is enclosed in the back of the book in the first printing is HOT, OFF DA HOOK, COOL, ETC.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why is there no zero star option?","review":"simply does not work on many common OS's like media center and 98.Don't believe it, go to the web site and see how long at takes to find that out.NO RESPONSE AT ALL TO SUPPORT QUESTIONS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading the Fine Print Did Not Help","review":"I recently purchased the MA-8212A package, and have been unable to get it to operate.

I am a SONY fanboy at heart but this product is far superior top teh sony i read like a bunch of reviews to! i love it definitely reccomend! There are a few strange things i have noticed such as that the cd text soemtimes only works when the unit is plugged into the wall outlet adapter, and that if u take out the AC plug while the unit is beign charged it will forget the resume info of where ur cd was stopped at and will the nstart form the beginning, i can deal with that since the player if FRIGGIN' AWESOME! if u havent bought a cd/mp3 player yet try this one out u will like it very much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted","review":"I received my IMP 550 today.

The only problem now is that I live in Ireland and Amazon in US don't sell outside of US and Canada. I used a friends address in the US who then bought it with him when he came to Ireland."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"this player is very good. Perfect sound compared to Sony, Panasonic, RCA (have my word of a audiophile). Easy to use. Small. Compact. Even if you plug in bigger speakers if sounds great. Battery life is as noted in the description. Also good for audio books. It is good that you can use it in your car as well and in this way you don't have to worry about leaving your car with an expensive car audio (this one you can easily carry with you). I highly recommend it - this is the Cadillac of all portable cd players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product ... BUT","review":"The 550 is an excellent product, with one exception: It will NOT play protected WMA files: i.e., music downloaded from one of the popular services (Napster, BuyMusic, etc.). iRiver hasn't yet responded to my query about when they expect this support to be available (their flash memory products offer it). If you expect to rip hundreds of songs from your own CDs and play them on a single CD then this product's for you. If you expect to download hundreds of songs from a service to a single CD - get a flash memory device instead. Other than that, it does everything it claims it can do and does it very well. Quality and ease of use are very good. However, I do think the display is kinda small, particularly at 70 mph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty looks but not good quality","review":"The player looks nice, I grant. But now after only 6 months of occasional use I can only get 30 minutes of play out of my batteries. Well just return them under the one year warranty right. No, the warranty on batteries is only 90 days. So the player that plays 50 hours on batteries now plays for 30 minutes. By the way new batteries cost $20 from I-River and mine never played anything for 50 hours. I expected better from a $150 cd player. My recommendation: Buy something cheaper so you're not broke when it breaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad radio","review":"The radio is worthless!!! It is only possible to listen to the strongest radiostations, when you are standing still and holding up the earphone cable. Tried it at the absolute center of Stockholm (the capital of Sweden), and could bearly hear anything.Furthermore, putting the mp3 on takes about 45 seconds and a usual audio-cd takes about 20-30 seconds....so I returned the player to the store and, with some hesitation, bought the iRiver SlimX 400 in stead. I became very positively surprised! The radio is very good on SlimX 400, I can use it almost anywhere, maybe not in the subway but rather far down the stairs to the subway.

Seriously, I am not joking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"This Cd player is not slim at all, when compared to slim offerings from Sony and Panasonic. The case design is also very ugly. It's not just generic, which would have been fine, but ugly. It's at best average as a CD player. It can play MP3 files, but I'd recommend a dedicated MP3 player like the iPod or the Rio products, because they give you more control over playback. The user interface on this thing is depressingly confusing, and some of my CDs and CD-Rs which play fine on Panasonic had trouble playing on this. Not recommended, unless you want to pay $150 for a low-quality FM radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not robust at all","review":"I have purchased two IRiver CD players. The first one was defective from the start (no bass output). So I took a chance and ordered another player, which was this model (550).

I listen to a lot of mixes that are spilt into tracks and having a 2 second gap is annoying. When I got the player, the AC adatpter did not work, which meant I couldnt recharge the batteries. I called the Customer Support line and with no hassle or delay at all they sent out a replacement adapter that arrived in about 5 days. Awesome! This is a great player but be warned, the remote is smaller than you think and feels fragile. Unless you absolutely need the car kit, go for the $99 model. It's strange, in a package filled with high quality accessories, the earbuds are simply awful. But who ever uses the included ones anyways?

It never once occured to her that people were suspicious because she did a crappy job of trying to be her sister. Turns out just about everyone who was close to the sister knew all along. Why they all pretended not to know comes out later. Most of it in invovles her being manipulated by her new found father who she forgives immediately for keeping her sister but putting her up for adoption.

It does an excellent job of up converting standard movies, (my display is 720p or 1080 i), and beats the up conversion of the Samsung Blu-Ray.The part you don't often hear about is its excellent audio quality.

Needless to say, it was a very personal experience when the the trio comes in after Bud Powell's intro on track \\"tea for two\\". After that, the band just carries the album through like a short play, or story. The warm tones and textures of this album in particular are my favorite combination every put on any recording. I highly recommend this album for someone who is studying jazz for the first time and/or is looking to expand his/her jazz music library. It's a perfect album. Piano, drums, and bass!!!

A sabbath tour is imminent and the objective here is clear. The book on it's own would be worth 10 - $15.If you han't got the 'Ozzy' era Sabbath, this is a good start, other than that it's a rip-off (IMHO)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better value than iTunes and MP3s","review":"I've been hoping for a Black Sabbath \\"give in\\" to sell their catalog digitally so I could conveniently purchase digitally, but could not complete my iPOD collection without Black Sabbath, so I \\"gave in\\", and bought the box set. This purchase reminded me of the beauty of good old fashioned CDs with covers, artwork, lyrics and all! Much happier with the physical box set than the digital would-be set.

This is a better value than I would expect from a future digital box set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally awesome.","review":"THIS is how box sets should be done! Not only is this stuff remastered, but there were a few things I wasn't expecting. One, the book that comes with it. Never knew this had a book, but it's excellent. It has a Sabbath timeline, quotes from other musicians, and a ton of Sabbath history and trivia. Also, THANKFULLY all of the lyrics from every album is in the book. I bought The Rules Of Hell Box set the same day, and this did not have the lyrics, which I think sucks. Also, I didn't know that a bonus DVD came with this set. I guess you could say I didn't pay much attention to the description... hahaha...

As other reviewers have said it is definitely lacking in artwork. My main issue is that the mix and overall sound is terrible. Yes, it is remastered and LOUDER but so what? Spend a little extra money and get the 2009 Remastered and Deluxe Versions of the individual albums. They are not as LOUD of a mix (why this is considered better is confusing - maybe it's easier than actually taking the time to mix the damn albums) but far superior. The 2009 versions make it sound like you are in the studio with the band. Geezers bass is so warm and alive it's incredible and all the harshness that is annoying about Tony's guitar solos and Bill's cymbals in the Black Box set is removed and you have a much more rounded and better sounding experience. Unless you're a collector of Sabbath (like me) that needs to have everything, avoid this set and get the 2009 Remasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY NOW.","review":"If you are looking at this box set, I don't need to describe/review the amazing music of Black Sabbath for you. I like to say they 'created the awesome riff' and are gods of metal.With that being said, I felt the need to review what I see as the most important and fantastic quality of this set-- the sound clarity. I've heard many reissues of Sabbath albums. I've always been satisfied but not impressed. With this set, that cycle has been broken. The quality of sound in this set is simply beautiful. It is-- by far-- the best sounding issues of Sabbath material that I've heard on disc.For anyone that has been wanting to delve into Ozzy's Black Sabbath, look no further. BUY THIS SET."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set","review":"When I heard about the sound quality that this set was supposed to have, I couldn't wait to check it out. It is that good!!

I couldn't help but notice all the derogotory comments about Fred Durst's #1 Fan, but after reading his review he deserves to be slapped for completely making a mockery of all music lovers and fans of Sabbath and really needs to know what he is talking bout before adding his two cents.

He seems to have absorbed a lot. This Schumann recital is fully mature and very musical. Biss's ability to phrase with freedom and nuance captures Schumann's spontaneous effusions without exaggeration. The great Fantasy in C comes off as one long lyrical inspiration, held together by Biss's unforced line. He doesn't overuse rubato, and he doesn't have to apply faked poeticism. Kreisleriana shows the same mastery, although I must admit that I am less familiar with the work. For the Fantasy I am confident recommending Biss's reading over many rivals. In fact, it's fair to speak of him in the same breath as great Schumann pianists like Richter and Kempff, which isn't to say that he is their equal just yet, as the young Peter Serkin wasn't his fahter's equal at this age. But Biss is well on his way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeds expectations!","review":"The analog picture for the typical channels was far better than I expected and the digital picture is VERY sharp.

The DVD layout means this unit is not as slim as many other TVs out there, so be aware.Overall remote layout was good, but the buttons are small. Sound quality is good & there's plenty of volume.I was expecting a good TV with some compromises because of the extra features and competative pricing - This one exceeded my expectations and I have NO regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good fit!","review":"This TV had to fit in a small space.

But then, maybe it's my fault. First of all, I should have questioned why a 32\\" LCD TV was selling for so much less than those of leading brands such as Sony, Samsung, etc. Second, I should have thought twice about a television that comes with only a 90-day warranty. And third, I should have done more thorough research before buying--perhaps I'd have realized how many people have been disappointed by Westinghouse televisions.I now have a TV with almost no picture that I'll try to give away.

The Westignhouse is very low quality compared to the Toshiba in every way - the case is cheap, the remote is missing basic funtions like diplaying what track you are on and time remaining. The picture quality is pretty good but not as good as the Toshiba. When you stop the DVD, it doesn't save your place. It has only 3 picture modes - stantard, overscan and one more - the Toshiba has 5 which means you can pretty much find a mode that uses the whole screen no matter what the aspect is on the DVD whereas on the Westinghouse you cannot. To top it all off, the DVD player stopped working yesterday after a month and a half when I only use it every other weekend or so.

Her voice soars on this album, and compliments the epic music wondrously. This has always been my favorite Oum Kalthoum song, it is the epitome of her tireless efforts.

The hatred and revenge also end up turning one into the same being who created the first hateful act. 5 minutes of heaven gives the audience a glimpse into how this revenge and hatred destroys your heart. We also see the origins of hateful acts - ignorance, narrow mindedness, ...and often the near sightedness of youth.

I was in two minds whether to watch this movie and bring all those memories back, but I'm glad I did. Set in an era of sectarian violence, the movie shows the tremendous devastation reeked upon the victims and perpetrators of such acts and, more importantly, the power forgiveness has on both sides, with the eventual act of reconciliation liberating them from 30 years of torment.If you want a Hollywood happy ending perhaps look elsewhere, but the movie was ultimately uplifting despite an arduous journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Since recently discovering Liam Neeson as an actor in the movie Taken, I was expecting so much more.

The accents were a little hard to understand at the beginning of the movie and I found I couldn't understand what they were saying sometimes, but I'm glad I stuck with it and watched the movie throughout. So sad that the Irish kill each other. I feel for both sides. It's heartbreaking for sure.

The political divide in Ireland runs as far as it does deep. Alistair and Joe each stand on opposing sides of that gaping chasm. Alistair killed Joe's brother, and for than man who's lost family, absolution simply isn't an option. I though this movie has more going for it that the current action flicks these days. Not a fast-paced moviie, nor a story that pretends to have all the answers regarding forgiveness, resolution, etc. But it is a facinating, amazingly performed study in the attempt of two men to come to terms with a horrific event that destroyed both of their lives. And James Nesbitt's performance is amazing, compelling, and unforgettable.

In this game there was more customization and bigger cities but that led to bigger glitches and more sluggish gameplay. Aiming system and driving physics were all greatly altered from vice City to this one. And all for the worse. I had some strange glitches in which I would enter a building to either customize hair or change clothes, whatever it was the character would never come out.

None of them did a particularly good job, though all (particularly Hackett) would record better vocals later.Rutherford's vocals were arguably the worst of the lot (he himself said AVS made him realize his voice was \\"crap\\"). He only sang lead once more, on \\"Making A Big Mistake\\" from the AGAINST ALL ODDS soundtrack. Whatever he did differently there, I wish he had done it when making AVS.At it stands, AVS is mostly a historical curiosity, though kind of a fun one. IMO the most successful track is \\"Who's Fooling Who\\". But there is no song that makes you forget this guy is no singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed solo attempt from Genesis guitarist Rutherford","review":"This very weak solo outing by Genesis guitarist Mike Rutherford isn't going to make anyone forget Mike and the Mechanics, or even \\"Smallcreep's Day\\". The only notable thing about it is that Rutherford, who does his own singing, has a surprisingly decent rock voice. The songs are all second-rate, with \\"Halfway There\\" the best of the batch.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hide it away","review":"The last track of this album \\"Hideaway\\" is a classic ballad and remains completely out of place on this hideous offering. The guy can't sing, well no better than I can anyway. You'd probably come across this album because your a Genesis or Mike and the mechanisc devotee. You'll be disappointed. Stangely enough, his first solo \\"Small Creeps Day\\" was also mostly trash with perhaps a couple of really good tracks. I loved early Genesis and followed them up until \\"Duke\\" . This album proves that I got of the bus at about the right time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly short","review":"Much of the 96 pages is taken up by religious artwork from various 15-century artists.

Several of the tales were too similar to each other to really merit separate explanations. Others I had never heard of before, or have since been debunked as pure folly since the book's publication (I think it was '87). The authors also tried to be rather cutesy and make jokes which usually left me rolling my eyes.

There's some good songs here (Natural Born Chillers, Fatboy Slim, Wildchild, Portishead, Uberzone) but there are many tracks that are just mediocre or disappointing (namely, the decidedly inferior mixes of the Crystal Method and Prodigy tracks) and, unfortunately, this is not a continuous mix. Finally, it could have used more tracks with less hip-hop influence... there's more than one type of techno out there.Disc Two: 5 stars. A bunch of classics continually mixed together, the album never loses momentum and it keeps a constant groove to it. Of course, with classic songs like \\"Go,\\" \\"Charly,\\" \\"Chime,\\" \\"Cubik,\\" and \\"Strings Of Life,\\" how could you go wrong?Bottom line: the average of 3 stars and 5 stars = 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong disks in case","review":"u put the wrong disk in the case it isnt what i paid for and am not able to return them to u due to someone else"},{"rating":"2","title":"great intro to electronica","review":"this is a good introduction to anyone who wants to sample some good electronic music...i like the first CD a lot better than the second CD though. listening to the two CD's got me through workday commute in a fairly good mood :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast-paced whoddunit!","review":"\\"DEGREES OF SEPARATION is a teaser-a fast-paced whodunnit with complex characters and an intriguing plot that keep the reader mesmerized and coming back for more until each fascinating clue is stripped down to the naked truth.\\"--Barbara Colley, author of MAID FOR MURDER"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I received the book when expected and it was in even better condition than I thought it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sylvie Guellam is amazing!!","review":"Sylvie has extension and feet like nobody has seen in a long time! the pas de deux are choreographically fantastic, altough it is not a classical story line. great dancing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great ride!","review":"It took me a while to get through the first few pages, but after that I could not put it down!

Shopping, emergencies, general greetings and more are covered on this disc that can be viewed either on your DVD or iPod device. When in your computer, the DVD provides additional information including a handy vocabulary feature.Although it involves the standard repetition of many other language courses, this DVD also features a great cast of people who actually seem to be enjoying repeating French phrases to each other.

Nonetheless, I felt that this is perfect for the French Newbie, like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A refresher if you once spoke the language","review":"Here's what this disk is for. If you have a basic knowledge of French or a memory of having learned it back in the once-upon-a-time, this will refresh your memory in preparation for a trip. The disk is easy to install and use on both MacBook and iPod, although you'll have to provide your own case for safe-keeping.This would probably not be of much help if you were starting from no knowledge at all- at best it would tune your ear to the sound of the language, although the demanding and fussy pronuciation of French might overwhelm this simple disk. It certainly wouldn't work if you wanted any understanding of the structure of the language so that you could apply it in a real setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"idon't Think So","review":"As I stated in my review for the Italian ivideo Language Lab, this program is a good idea boringly executed. Best for those already on their flight to Par-ee with no good books to read, the ivideo lab presents speakers repeating lists of words against a french-y backdrop.Snoozeville.The speakers are excellent, and the idea of learning a language on your ipod a very good one, but it is very hard to learn a language through rote memorization. A story format would have been so much better. Watch \\"Cyrano de Bergerac\\" on your ipod instead.

So allot of the learning deals with situations you would encounter while on vacation: such as, basic greetings, how to get directions, what to say in an emergency, etc.Most likely this program will not help you become 100 percent fluent, but it's a great tool for the elementary learner. The video presentation is a bit bland, but I like it better than plain audio. If you really want to learn the language you probably need someone else (who speaks French) to interact with, but this program gives you a foundation; if you have the foundation, it's more likely that someone will help you (because teaching the foundation is the most frustrating part).good luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time, energy or iPod space","review":"Although this seemed like a great idea, this was difficult to use and certainly did not meet my needs. It did not instantly upload on my iPod as advertised, was difficult to find the file to upload and did not tell me the size of the software on the package so I would know whether or not I had enough room on my iPod for it in the first place. The instructions included in the package were inadequate. I did watch a lesson on my computer screen just to see if perhaps I should make the effort to make some space on my iPod for it or use it on my iPhone. Nope. The French speakers weren't adequate for a first-time French student, there was no phonetic pronounciation, and the lesson I viewed was downright tedious.

It is a rich and rewarding book, one that bears reading more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"huh?","review":"Like other reviewers, I was dismayed by the poor writing style. I found myself reading the same sentences over and over, without ever figuring out what the point was. But even overlooking the problems with the style, the content is sparse. I reread the section on Mark several times and couldn't really find much to support the author's thesis about his motivations and political stance, even though I know from other readings that the evidence is there.

It is very disjointed, the author jumps from topic to topic and then returns to the previous topic with no apparent order. The author argues that the four writers of the gospels were writing for different audiences but provides no evidence for who or where they were.Also, the author has an annoying style of changing terminology that has been used by centuries. Thus, the book of Genesis becomes \\"Beginnings\\" the book of Exodus becomes the \\"Journey\\", BC becomes BCE (before common era).

Whether you want to visit the major battles such as: Kings Mountain, Cowpens, Ninety-Six or visit the homes of patriots, Barefoot's book contains easy-to-follow directions and interesting anecdotes of the event or place.Since I live in Charlotte NC and am close to many of the sites, the book has several times served as a valuable guide for Revolutionary War tours.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm account of most confrontational night in rock history","review":"A rarity in Dylan books in that it treats its subject matter with a sense of perspective and also a sense of humour.It is a paradoxically warm account of probably the most vicious night in rock history.

Many of them had come to see a folksinger and simply could not 'cope' with the flagbearer of radicalism as Rock n' Roll singer.They reacted in a pure English manner by booing and trying to appeal to Dylan's sense of fair play.

Of course any information about Bob Dylan and especially this concert is great, but the way it's processed in this book is distracting. The best parts are the stories of the people who were there. The least effective were Lee's cultural analyses and song analyses. The more he writes the more he gets further and further away from Bob Dylan, it seems.

This film seemed to be so concerned about being deep and portentious that many of the most basic elements of a film (plot, character believability and motivation, character development) were either not considered at all, or just de-prioritized. The film is a poorly-made confusing jumble of scenes about characters we never care about, and who don't even have the benefit of at least being nice to look at as we watch them ham-handedly deliver their clinkers of dialogue.

All those that had a Kodak were buying another Kodak ,while those who owned other makes were mostly looking at other makes then their present camera and some were looking at the Kodaks. My son told me about Amazon.com and the price was right and I ordered. I'm very pleased with the service from Amazon and extremely happy with the Z740 Kodak camera.

One memorable (Zoomed 10X) shot I took from my 6th floor window at the hotel where I stayed. It was of the New Orleans skyline 9 miles in the distance rising out of the trees in the late afternoon light. I had to shoot it at a 45 degree angle thru the window glass, and it still came out perfectly clear and sharp. That would have been a feat even for my old Nikon SLR.

I've tried various settings and they continue to come out rather a little dark unlike my 4330. I still love this camera though and wouldn't change it for any other camera. Thank you Kodak for another lovely camera. The 10x zoom is one of the things that got me to purchase this.And I agree that I'd like to be able to zoom while filming, but the first time I used the video feature was at a United Way truck pull infront of my place of employment as I had to film and take photos.

It is my first digital camera but most of the functions are quite intuitive. There are two areas which are less than they could be: (1) the LCD screen is fixed; infrequently, it would be helpful if it could be pivoted due to light conditions, etc. and (2) the joystick takes some getting used to when processing settings under the menu. Both of these are minimized with experience. One last thing is the minimal picture size of 1.8 MP; this requires a filesize in excess of 450 KB to email a jpg image."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!!","review":"We are extremely pleased with our purchase. The camera is very easy to use. Very intuitive. It takes great pictures. We get compliments on our photos all the time because the colors are so vibrant and the resolution is so sharp.

I shopped around before I bought it, and I felt we got the best deal from Amazon. Definitely a wonderful camera for the price. And I also love that you can add lenses/filters to it.

It wasn't dropped, or bumped or damaged in any way.When I try to take pictures, the screen is totally black and takes black full frame pictures. I know this because the \\"view pictures\\" mode still works. I called Kodak and of course the warranty period ended after 12 months. They charge a flat fee of $125.00 for a repair and then only give a 30 day warranty.Really disappointed but have actually considered buying another simply because of the awesome pictures that I was able to take.My only advice...buy an extended warranty!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the 10x zoom!","review":"Couldn't be happier with this camera - I use the sports mode and the zoom at my daughters soccer games and I am continually told how great the pics are! Shutter speed is so much better than my old digital(Nikon Coolpix). It's very easy to use, downloading is a snap ... internal memory is WAY cool! I accidentally left the memory card (bought seperately) in my computer one day, but was thrilled when I remembered that I could use the internal memory to take pictures. I have used the camera a lot in the past month and still have not replaced the batteries. The lens cap does pop off a lot, but the strap keeps it from actually falling.

In good lighting conditions everything works great. This camera is made for outside shots on a sunny day. But if you're inside with poor light you might run into a few problems with the zoom. It will take 5+ seconds to focus and even then the picture might turn out a little fuzzy. Don't get me wrong, the flash is very powerful. If you're not zoomed in it will take a perfect picture in complete darkness! The only other complaint I have is the lens cap will not stay on. Make sure you tie it to the strap or you'll probably end up loosing it.Lastly, the easyshare software that's included is great. Very easy to use and the options they give you to improve the quality of the picture actually work. I have paint shop pro X and it can't do some of the stuff the free Kodak program can."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful camera","review":"I decided on this camera after receiving photos from a friend that had a Kodak. The images were amazingly sharp and the prints I made looked professional. I hate reading owners manuals, but this camera is extremely user friendly. My one complaint is that the batteries that come with the camera are not rechargable. The camera is a little bulky (less than the previous model), but I bought it for the quality of photos, not to fit into my back pocket. It is very easy to download the photos to my computer using the USB port, however I have a little trouble transferring them to the other photo program I prefer to use, but this is most likely my fault due to lack of knowledge of the programs. If you are looking for a camera to preserve memories, I highly recommend the Z740."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING CAMERA!!","review":"THE 10X OPTICAL ZOOM IS UNBELIEVABLE.

Kodak has done a wonderful job of laying out the menu in such a simple way. It is easy to use and you dont have to wait 5 seconds for the picture to snap either. I highly recommend this camera. The only negative point I have to make is that the lens cover comes off too easily, so make sure you get a good camera case to protect the lens cover from being bumped."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbeatable for the money","review":"i am by no means an expert but this camera continues to impress me. easy to use, not too big or too small and the prints from the printer dock have wonderful color and clarity. using the digital zoom can take some getting used to only because it is hard to hold the camera still enough without the use of a tripod to get a clear pic. i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a digital camera with top end performance with mid range price, printer dock is well worth the money. more than enough features to keep you busy for a long time. i love it! i cannot believe i lived so long without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best camera for a great price!","review":"Nice and easy to use.

I changed the batteries twice, and it wouldn't turn on. A quick Google search uncovered four forums with other Easyshare users describing the same problem. And the problem apparently can't be fixed, or at least can't be fixed for less than the price of a new camera, according to the local Kodak shop.

I've tried using the different functions, adjusting the manual setting, and playing with the zoom but nothing has worked.

I've had the card for about 2 months. At first I was thrilled with the capacity, but one day it just stopped working. Now it will not work with any of my devices or my computer. Tech support admitted that the card is only supported by about 10-20% of the items currently on the market that use SD cards, and that it can operate inconsistently or fail when used in electronics that do not support this new technology. I wish they had disclosed that upfront, since upwards of 80% of the electronics currently on the market are apparently incompatible.

You'll come back to this one over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly useless","review":"Avoid this book if you can...The author tries to get away with repeating the same paragraph and example over and over and over, and not have to actually explain anything. You finish the book with a lot of code snippets, which are of very little use unless you either know the subject (in which case you wouldn't have bought this book in the first place), or you are trying to do exactly the kind of work described in the book. This is nothing but a cookbook, and a bad one at that.A seemingly hefty reference closes the book. But a closer examination reveals that it's no more that a quick listing of properties and methods (with little distinction made between the two) of some of the ADSI COM interfaces. The text and reference are exclusively VB oriented, and will frustrate all but the most inexperienced programmer.If you are the kind to cut and paste JavaScript code and then go on to call yourself a programmer, this book is for you.

If you are deploying web applications over mutliple servers and would like to get away from using the MMC for creating each and every web site then I would recommend getting this book. The book clearly explains how to write automated scripts that can be used to deploy web sites to a single server, or across an enterprise. Creating a web site includes multiple tasks such as FTP accounts, FTP virtual directories, Web site virtual directories and more. This book explains each facet clearly and you can pick and choose the parts that you want to sew together to create an automated system.

I like to thank amazon for being the first to keep us fans informed when they do come out ,,,,,,,,, \\"great job Sony and Amazon\\"!

I was very happy when the sets came out in rapid succession but stopped after Volume four. Now Volume 5 is going be released and here comes Shemp! i've always liked Shemp as a third stooge and I think is detective shorts like Who Done It?, Blunder Boys, Hot Scots, and Crash Goes The Hash was some of the Stooges best work. I hope they release all Shemp shorts, even there are many duplicates and some after Shemp's death with stand in Joe De Palma. I ordered right away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...Shemp!","review":"Just because Curly is gone by 1946/47 doesn't mean that one should not buy this Volume 5.

He has been a huge fan since pre-school!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncut Episodes / Very Clear Picture","review":"Sony did a SUPERB job creating the DVDs in this new, official Three Stooges set. I bought both Volumes 5 and 6 from Amazon and have no complaints.All episodes are in the original airdate order, back when the Three Stooges were new. Also, all scenes are there, and nothing is cut out like when they are aired on TV. This volume (5) contains the end of Curly and the beginning of Shemp, which they don't air many episodes of on TV (mainly Curly).The picture quality is amazing on both Volumes 5 and 6, and Sony did a great job cleaning speckles and spots during the DVD transfer from film reels that are over 60 years old (this collection is from 1946 to 1948)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curly's legacy is born","review":"While the final shorts aren't vintage Curly, there are so many classic comedic moments that make them unforgettable. One of my clear favourites is 'Rhythm and Weep'. What a unique story. Three men tired of being failures attempt to kill themselves, meet three girls with the same motive, hook up with a millionaire with show ambitions only to discover the so called millionaire is a demented soul. The ending where the three stooges are yelling in breakdown frustration is both chilling and hilarious. the concept of the story is chaotic.Never has such a story been filmed and kudos to the person who wrote it.The stooges are often seen as the poor man neighbour to the marx brothers or abbott and costello, but their legacy is far more stronger than the others. thier appeal is timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep them coming the Three Stooges Volumes","review":"2 disc set has Curly and shemp in this volume a great set and i be collecting them all, the stooges are the best keep them coming"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only volume that will contain BOTH Curly and Shemp!","review":"This review is for the CONTENT included on this volume, rather than the production. I have all the shorts included here on VHS and I can only applaud Sony Pictures for releasing these shorts uncut, unedited, and remastered for the first time on DVD (Bravo Sony, Bravo). As other reviewers have mentioned, even though Curly's health was declining toward the end of his career, I still enjoy watching any Stooge short with Curly or Shemp. Personally, I would've liked to have seen the pic with Moe, Larry, and Shemp looking at the train passenger (played by a retired Curly with hair!) in 'Hold that Lion' as the main cover pic, but at least they included it in one of the smaller pics off to the right hand side. If the production quality of this volume is as good as the others, I very much look forward to watching. Keep'em coming Sony!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to Sony!","review":"Why it took Sony so long to decide to release the total Stooges catalog on DVD we may never know. But it's a thrill to watch even the poorest of these shorts in clear, pristine condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shemp is great too!","review":"I loved this collection just as much as the first four. It's sad to see Curly's health slowly going downhill but some of his final shorts are still funny. I don't know why some people don't like Shemp because I think he's hilarious in his own unique way. I was hoping that my favorite Shemp episode, \\"Who Done It?\\", was on to this set but I see it will be on volume 6. I highly recommend vol. 5! Five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Like a Very Good Workout","review":"I watched this video all the way through and it looks like alot of fun and a good workout. There's a fun variety of dances. I started the Cha Cha and it will take quite some time to become proficient at any of the dances. Good winter indoor exercise aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I purchased several of the Dancing With Stars workout videos - all a waste of monies. These workout tapes have no real instructions and are faster than the speed of sound. As instructors, surely these people know that they should be turning AWAY from the viewers with their backs facing the students. When the instructors face toward the camera, everything must be learned in reverse. High hopes dashed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really looking forward to this, but found it difficult to follow, nothing is really explained, the instructors lack the personality of other Dance off the inches instructors such as Jennifer Galardi and Kristina Milanova whose dance dvds are great fun and I love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I have Brazilian Dance Workout with Vanessa Isaac, and was having SO much fun dancing, that I thought I would try DWtS to learn some different moves. How disappointing! It doesn't raise your heart rate, and the dancers don't actually show you how to do the moves at all. As I do have some dance experience, I was able to reasonably follow them, but still never felt quite like I was doing the moves just right. The music was less than inspiring, and Ashley is just WAY too perky first thing in the morning when I like to workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch","review":"I love this tape; great moves, great explanations and I feel like they are talking to me and encouraging me throughout. Ashley's voice is a wee bit annoying but I focus on the energy. They really work together well, respect each other and that comes across. The challenge is exhausting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to my expectations...","review":"I'm a huge fan of the show and really amazed at how great the pros look. I did the workouts but I didn't feel as though they were high impact enough to make me sweat or feel the burn. The moves were fun to do but no properly broken down, but the pros just jump right in without proper instruction. The camera-angles don't help either. The freestyle at the end of the workout was more like a filler for the dvd to reach an hour, you just pretty much watch the pros dance around. I bought Edyta and Alec's Fitness With The Pros...TEN times better! I think DWTS-Cardio Dance is more of a franchise sale for the show. Not a lot of thought was put into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad For Non Dancers","review":"I actually hate giving bad reviews but in this case I am going to make an exception. This video is HORRIBLE for beginners. As dance instructors, they should have known to actually include a segment on the dance moves and have a practice section so that beginners could work up to the moves. It's far too fast paced. Also, the blonde is really annoying, as though she is trying to push her sexuality on the viewers instead of sticking to the routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancing with the Stars Cardio Dance","review":"This is a well put together workout video with great warm-up, cool down and fun dance moves. The set is attractive and so are the instructors, especially Maxim with his long legs and swivel hips. I'm sure the gentlemen would like Kim as well. All in all, very attractive video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with it...","review":"Yes, at first the DVD is tricky to follow. Maxim starts out pretty basic and easy to follow with the Paso Doble. Next is Ashley and she introduces a little more difficulty with the Cha-Cha, and so on. But, I found that if I just did what I could I eventually started learning the routines through repetition. You will still break out in a sweat even if you're just trying to learn the moves (you don't have to have perfect execution to lose weight). If you're getting frustrated, then you're taking this way too seriously. Loosen up, try your best, and have fun; the accuracy will eventually occur - and when it does you really feel like you've accomplished something big. I am a complete two-left footed klutz and can get through the dances pretty well. This is one of the few workout routines I enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love it!","review":"This is a great, fun workout. I admit to being pretty coordinated, my mom was a Rockette. I alternate this with a weights workout, Crunch with Kendall Hogan, and I'm seeing results and I feel great. The trainers are all very good and really energetic. I hope they will do more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so fun.","review":"I really did not like this workout. In fact, I gave it to my sister after using it only once. It had little explanation of the moves. If you have a dancing background, it would probably be easier to understand. The only positive is being able to look at Maks. Other than that, it was worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work out disappointment","review":"I was very excited to get my dvd in and try it, but I was highly disappointed with this work out dvd. I was not able to follow many of the moves because I have no dance experience. They would instruct you to do a dance move, and give no direction of which way they were moving, or what to do with my feet! I was trying to look at their legs to give me some direction, but that was difficult too because they had on black pants against a dark background, and I could not visualize the steps either.If I had any dance background this dvd would be a blast, but for someone who just wanted a fun new way to work out, it was not effective. I didn't even get a good enough work out because half the time I was trying to watch them as to what to do. By the time I did get the hand of a particular move, they were onto the next step.I am going to stick with my Tae-Bo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Beginners!","review":"Sadly, this Cardio Dance Instruction is not for beginners. I have some dance experience yet, everyone needs some direction and instruction with new steps or routines. There are basically no instructions for the moves here and they progress so rapidly that even in slow-mo it's pretty difficult to follow these dancers and get the routines down without a lot of rewinding. They really missed an opportunity here to \\"do it right\\" and inspire. Would not recommend this DVD as it's too disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cardio for Anyone with Dancing Experience","review":"I've had dance experience, and while the moves were relatively easy to follow (since I already knew them), it was a great cardio workout. The moves are simple, but the instructors keep your heart pumping the whole time; you're practically never barely moving. Even these basic steps were made challenging by how quickly the instructors perform them at a rapid pace, so this might be a better workout (initially) for someone with a dance background. However, anyone who is willing to press the pause button frequently in order the learn the moves would eventually get the steps down and enjoy the workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout for a former dancer","review":"Out of all of the workout DVDs I've tried, this one is by far the most challenging and enjoyable. It's easy to follow if you've had previous dance training, but difficult enough not to be boring. The music is decent, the hosts are tolerable and it really gets your heart going. I wouldn't recommend it highly to someone without previous dance training, unless they are very patient and are willing to watch the steps, rewind and then proceed."},{"rating":"1","title":"cardio workout dancing with the stars","review":"This workout is tough if you are not a dancer. They move quickly through the steps without and instruction. It would be great for a dancer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very difficult to follow","review":"This was quite disappointing! The instructors go too quickly & don't explain the moves step by step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful Music","review":"I think everyone else has covered the dance aspect of the video. My problem with it was the music, especially the Latin. I need to \\"feel\\" the music to be inspired to dance well and this music was lame. With so much music to choose from, I don't understand why this awful music?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome workout","review":"I love how this DVD gives you a choice of dance workouts to do one at a time or just doing all of the workouts back-to-back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"only if you would like to learn some basic dance steps would I reccommend this DVD. If you are looking for a great dance workout this is not for you. I do like that you can customize your workout and the music is great but the moves are hard to follow and the improv was a COMPLETE waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Instruction!","review":"I bought this DVD hoping to have a fun workout. I got very frustrated with the lack of instruction in this video. It's very difficult to follow. Also, one of the female instructors has a very annoying voice! If you decide to buy it I suggest turning the instruction off since it's useless anyways. By the way, I'm a coordinated person. I dance a lot and do taebo and yoga. I haven't had problems following along with any other videos. I would return it if I could! I don't even want to sell it to anyone else...it's that bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"A must for a great midsection. A little fast to pick up the first time, but stick with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you're a dancer, don't waste $$$$.","review":"Short, simple, and too the point. If you're not a dancer, don't buy this \\"exercise\\" tape. The moves are extremely complex, the dancers don't que between moves and the camera is constantly changing angles which makes it impossible to try and memorize what the dancers are doing. Want to get ripped and toned? Try Jari Love's Ripped to the Core."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this video...","review":"As another reviewer stated, \\"I had high hopes for this video; too high, perhaps\\". That is it in a nutshell. As a fitness professional, not only was there no breakdown on how the moves were performed, the choreography did not take into account the fact that the vast majority of home exercisers do so on carpet, not on wood or linoleum floors. I would say that half the moves are unperformable on carpet and pose a high risk of injury to your knees if you try to do so, especially in the Paso Doble and Jive portions of the video. The \\"routines\\" were not really routines, just a series of steps performed in a particular style and, with the exception of the Jive, did not raise the heart rate, nor keep it raised, enough to give any real cardio benefits. Top this video off with Ashley's incredibly annoying, squeaky voice and I would say that there are a lot better ways for you to spend $10 to get fit, even if you get to stare at Maxim while you are doing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was highly disappointed with this DVD. The dances are good but they really don't teach you the steps they just show them too you. Also they don't give you enough time to learn them before they move on to the next thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy now, wait till you've taken dance lessons!","review":"The dancers offer little instruction, leaving the exerciser feeling confused and looking ridiculous. This dvd is better suited for people who have had previous dancing experience and are familiar with steps and dance vocab. A real bummer for a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a demonstration; no real instruction.","review":"The steps are named and presented while the dancers are doing them at full speed. There really is no instruction. You just have to watch the steps and try to follow along. Their black leggings made it hard to see exactly what their legs and feet were doing and the camera angles never really focused on that, either. The footwork is somewhat complicated and just too quick to follow. My next attempt will be to play a short segment, pause the DVD, practice some, and then move on to the next step. Also, many of the moves require twisting your body or ankles very quickly and I can see a possibility of easy injury. This might be a good workout for someone more accomplished at aerobics, but who wants to learn a new style. It's not for someone who wants to learn to dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration","review":"This video left me a tiny bit sweaty, but a lot frustrated. I couldn't even make it all the way through--half way through the second routine, I was lost. Save your money! I think I'd do better just having fun dancing to my own music."},{"rating":"1","title":"a frustrating work-out DVD and who needs that?","review":"There is essentially no instruction in the dance steps - just expected to do it. Too fast-paced for anyone to catch on by watching unless they maybe watch it a few dozen times in slow motion. I will never do it again. There are much much better work-out DVD's available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but not the best aerobic workout","review":"These workouts were fun to learn, but they are not a good aerobic workout for those that are already in shape. For those beginning a workout reimen-it's a good start though. I was hoping that they would teach a full routine, but they really don't. So, the different moves are fun to learn, and it's fun to try to do with friends, but if you want a serious workout-this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly executed dance and workout video","review":"This would actually be a fun and engaging workout if you could see what the dancers were doing. Every single time they start a new move, the camera gives you a closeup of the instructor's upper body so that you can't see most of what the instructor is doing. It also skips from the instructor to the other dancers so quickly, it takes several viewings to catch each move. The director and cameraperson apparently didn't understand the difference between shooting a performance and shooting an instructional video.I took dance for several years when I was younger and still consider myself a passable dancer. I quickly grew so frustrated with this video on first viewing that it hit the Goodwill pile before I'd even finished the entire routine. Unless you're a regular DWTS viewer and already know all the dances by heart, skip this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Selective great dance DVD","review":"Yes, they do go fast on this DVD. Right off the bat, I say if you don't have dance experience or if this DVD was way too fast for you, you might enjoy Denise Austin's Cardio Dance workout; easier to follow and slower going.This is a different type of beast here. The Paso Doble hurt my kness and I'm in my 20s! Be very careful here. I skip this one usually.The cha cha is really fun and keeps me moving. Great for the stomach. I usually do this one twice in a workout.The Samba is a little wishy washy but fun. Good for the calves! More freedom to improvise here.The Jive is true cardio but very fun! Give it a chance adn you'll be breathing pretty hard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"super fast, no explainations of moves","review":"I had high hopes for this video; too high, perhaps. As another reviewer stated, the moves do go pretty fast after Maksim's part. My biggest problem is that there are no real explainations or instructions of the steps, the instructors just say, we're going to do this now, toss in a dance term, and then they do it. I had such a hard time trying to figure out what the steps were by the time I sort of figured it out they had moved on. This workout would probably be a good workout, provided you understand the moves and can execute them at the speed the dancers on the video can. I found it to be too frustrating and will have to be desperate for some exercise before I pop this in the DVD player again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be called \\"Watch Us Dance.\\"","review":"This video was terrible. I thought I was going to have so much fun, but I was left in the dust. Usually exercise videos involve instruction and explanation; these people felt no such need to do so.They are professional dancers; we know this; there was no need for them to prove to us how wonderful they are. But I bought the video to be included in on the dancing fun. By the last song when the girls were laughing about how they were going to \\"make it up as we go along,\\" I was ready to throw the DVD out the window.If they wanted a video of them showing off, the least they could have done was included a beginners program as well.I want my money back.:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"I am a HUGE Dancing With the Stars fan and the moment I found out about this workout DVD I raced to the store and bought it. It turned out just to be a way for them to make more money, not a way to whip your body into DWTS shape!It starts out with an upper body Paso Doble workout. This may be a workout if you're over 65 or severly out of shape because I didn't find it elevated my heart rate at all.The improvisational section at the end was terrible. Each star took a turn adding dance moves in but they didn't explain them and you could not follow what they were doing.The Jive and Samba sections in the middle were ok. Afterwards I didn't feel like I'd gotten a whole body workout.

The sheer length of the workout altogether made it cardio, not it's intensity. I did enjoy doing it again and again, and learning choreography, but the challenge was a complete waste of time, impossible to follow, and there for the 3 dancer's mutual admiration.All and all it was a fun DVD. Worth it if you want to understand the steps of the different types of dances, especially the Jive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Dancing with the Stars DVD","review":"I was dissappointed at the lack of instruction in this DVD. There is an assumption that you already know how to dance. Dance terms are bandied about such as chaissez and plie, and potubourais as though we have had years of ballet training. It is a good cardio workout if you can catch up and learn the steps quickly. It seems more like a vehicle to showcase the 3 dancers from the show rather than to teach anyone to dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least Maks is good eye candy....","review":"I am pretty good shape and love to dance, but this was hard for even me to follow!

Essentially, there is a warmup, 4 different dance routines and a cool down. The routines are easy to follow and don't put too much strain on any joints or muscles. It is great cardio exercise, really fun and using dance steps makes you forget that you are exercising! The only way it could have been improved is slightly better music and a better costume on one of the instructors. For me it was distracting as her pants were cut so low, I kept expecting them to slip. This however could work as motivation for some to keep watching and working out, so maybe that's a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No mercy...not for beginners","review":"I have recently begun to watch DWTS re-runs on BBC America and I thought that it might be fun to try some of the dances they do. It wasn't fun for long! They move so fast with very little explanation! It starts out like your average exercise DVD with a \\"dancers warm-up\\" but then it seems to quickly become a really long dance-off between Ashly and Kym. Maks (who I think was the one to come up with the idea for this DVD) seemed to want to keep it slower and toned down, but it wasn't gonna happen. The concept of this DVD was *great* but perhaps Maks should have chosen different co-instructors. Ashly and Kym just seemed to want to show off how fast they can do all the moves. Not so great for your average at-home exerciser. Also, Ashly's overly sappy voice can grate the nerves after a while. I wish I could recommend this DVD, but I just can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty stupid","review":"I thought this DVD would be fun. It's got a fantastic feature that allows you to customize your workout, but I was really disappointed with the content. It was poorly organized, short, and not very fun.

Went out the next day to buy it and watch it. I thought this is going to be fun but the sound quality was horrible and the steps were to hard to follow. They should show you very slowly and then speed it up as you go along like they do in my belly dancing and crunch videos.

It's too fast with minimal actual instruction. There are too many shots of the dancers from the waist up...we need to see their feet! Ironically, the hardest segment for me was the jive and I took swing/jive lessons for three years! I adore Kym but trying to understand her over the music is tricky with her thick accent and I have always found Ashley just plain annoying.

I just get so mad at how bad it was made. First of all, they don't teach you the steps, they just start dancing and expect you to follow them. In every dance, they're just improvising, they don't do a rehearsed choreography teaching every step. They just do this and oh! let's do that, and expect that everyone knows how to do the complicated steps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"I had high expectations with these series of DVDs when purchasing, but unfortunately they didn't live up to the expectations. I am pretty quick to grasp moves, however if you have not been a professional dancer in the past, this is definately a video you will want to pass on. The dancers tell you what you are about to do, use a dance term (not ever fully explaining the move) and then jump right into it. I even set up a mirror to watch it so that I could move 'with' them (same step) and that didn't help. It is entirely too fast paced to try and keep up and half the time didn't even know what move we were supposed to be following. I've paused the DVD for a moment to come and write this review as I am entirely dissapointed with the purchase. I bought two and it's too late to return them, otherwise I would do so - it is a waste of money, especially since they will only be used once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and fun","review":"I love this video and purchased the latin cardio because of this one.

I am not, however, a professional dancer by any means and therein lies the problem.This is not an easy workout to follow if you are not a dancer to begin with. There was no explanation or example of the moves before they performed them. They would just say what they're going to do next and then do it with no explanation whatsover.I think this is a great workout if you have a background in dance or are patient enough to try to follow them. I'm giving it one star because it is good if you already know what you're doing but bad if you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"After doing this a few times I have come to enjoy the workout. The downsides are not enough explanation of the moves. My favotite is the Jive. This gets your heart rate up and is fun. I dont even bother with the bonus mix like other reviewers advised. This is not well cued or explained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the dances","review":"I'm a big fan of variety and when I saw that this DVD offered 4 different routines (each 10 minutes), I thought it was a great deal. But, I ended up liking only 2 of the routines (jive and cha cha). Plus, the jive was really the only routine that got my heart rate up - I didn't feel like I got any type of workout with the other dances.Some of the dances were repetitive and there were times towards the end of some of the routines when I felt like the instructors were just killing time and trying to figure out what do to until the 10 minutes were over.Although none of the steps are explained, I picked them up after doing them a couple of times. But the 'challenge' at the end was WAY to challenging for me to actually follow along.In a nutshell, I was a little disappointed that I didn't get quite the bang for my buck that I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance Driven DVD is better","review":"Very hard...not what I expected.

The female instructors are simply annoying and the male instructor is too flat and boring. The guy I could deal with, but the female instructors were TOO annoying with their overly perky attitudes. I've never seen any exercise instructor that annoying, honestly. Besides the personality problem, the moves in this \\"work-out\\" were very boring and didn't do much to raise my heart rate. If you want a workout DVD I suggest you go look elsewhere. There are plenty of other DVDs that do the trick easily and much less annoyingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor instruction","review":"I love the dancing and workout combined, but this video does not provide the best combination. Maksim and Kym do a good job demonstrating their moves, however the cardio level is just too low to get the heart-rate to the target. Then here is Ashley, who has a high pitch voice and put in too much rock-movements which does not represent the ballroom style Chia-chia. Also Ashley calls out every step, and she is really talking way to much (with a high pitch). I have a hard time keeping her section on for more than 10 seconds.

I will confess that I quit the book at page 156, but by that time, something should have happened (and nothing had happened, not a single episode of excitement). one of the reviews said it would make a good movie. Well that's what it read like: a screenplay. it was an endless dialogue of \\"he said\\" \\"she said\\". and nothing happened. Lots of one dimensional characters in a two dimensional world. It was so bad I wouldn't buy another book by the publisher because I think they have no taste for a good book. They'll publish anything just to try and turn a buck.

Seeker, the main character, is underdeveloped and rather bland, though it is hinted at that he has a special spiritual connection with their god, which is known as the All and Only. The point of view of Cheerful Giver seemed rather pointless to me, and slowed down the book's pace.On the other hand, I found the Wildman an interesting character. Described as a golden, beautiful river bandit, he is a violent, selfish, and naive young man at the beginning of the book but near the end he begins to learn how it feels to love people and care about their safety.All in all, worth a read if you are willing to tolerate the flaws and overall slower pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Builds to Great Climax","review":"Seeker is the story of three young people all searching for acceptance into the Novana Society, protectors of an ancient god. Seeker, The Wildman, and Morning Star eventually find themselves all thrown into the same boat together, and realize that only in working together can they help one another to achieve their dreams and save their creator.Seeker has it all, adventure, romance, mystery, magic (or whatever you choose to call it), everything that makes for a great fantasy read. Simply having all the right ingredients won't bake a great cake however, and it seemed as if Nicholson had the ingredients all wrong. What may have been a mediocre story was saved by strong character development and an outrageously awesome climax. Though the story seems to waffle on at parts, the way in which Nicholson brings all his characters together is ingenious.

I couldn't even finish. I loved Kestrel and Bowman and Mumpo and Sisi and Pinto! Morning Star, Seeker and Wildman are all kind of weird and awkward and not as origanal. Espescially Seeker!

The problem is, in his efforts to provide an up-to-date text, he attempts to lend Cavalcanti's poetry a modernist and perhaps even avant-garde air that strips the poetry of its feeling and adds pretension in its place. His translation of verse number 51 (\\"Guata, Manetto, quella scrignutuzza\\") is particularly awful, with his dryly academic and unhip use of \\"cool\\" slang that is actually awkward and outdated. He also manages to make \\"Donna me prega\\" unbearably pretentious.

It is difficult to imagine what it must be like to be charged by three and four hundred pound cats, but Salmoni stands up to charge after charge to keep from reinforcing the aggression that threatens to put an unfortunate end to the pride.Surrounded by the natural beauty of a nature reserve deep inside Namibia, this documentary gets up close and personnel with the wild lions Salmoni comes to know by \\"name\\" and personality and sheds light on the inner workings of lion communal behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"freakishly awesome!","review":"This is an incredible story of a man trying to help a doomed pride of lions.

These guys apply a lot of classical music principles to their music which is what sets them apart from the pack. And they can somehow manage to keep trance music interesting for long periods of time before building into a mega-crescendo and segue into something, or maybe just keep on jamming.

This book has everything in it like the stuff I mentioned above pluss a great story and even a little romance, but don't let that discourage you, it doesn't take away from the book at all. If anything it makes it better. This book has a lot of great action and suspense that never stops through out the book. The characters are great and the story is fantastic. To me the ending is good and bad at the same time, which is definetly what Stackpole wanted. The ending is good because of being good and bad at the same time. That's the only way to explain it without giving anything away. Anyway like the ending or not there is a sequel coming out that will start a whole new series by Stackpole that I look forward to. I already pre orderd the sequel I like this one so much. So after all that if your a fantasy or Stackpole fan why would you not read this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't need to think","review":"There is room in the world for a book that you can't put down but has the depth of the kitchen sink. I found this book to have solid fantasy ideas (i.e. believable kingdom/interesting magic system/decent villian). It did not however, need to be pondered too heavilly.Stackpole has a fairly dark vision in this fantasy world. While heroes exist here, there is an underbelly that makes the story far more interesting than it otherwise would be.Be aware, this is a \\"set up book.\\" You will be buying a good story with an interesting new world to read about. However, please expect to have to buy the next one to get over a brutal cliff-hanger ending.For all adventure fantasy fans, this is a good purchase. If you are looking for something a bit more challenging try the latest George R. R. Martin series. (Game of Thrones is the first there)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Readable","review":"What can I say? I just don't think Stackpole is for me.This book had potential, I'll give it that much. There were two highlights: The first page and the last page. Let me rephrase that: The first sentence and the last sentence. Despite an interesting premise, this story just seems to fail in so many areas.The characters were uninteresting. The battle scenes were boring. The prose was mind-numbing. When the characters conversed, I didn't care. During the fight scenes, I felt like I was reading a grocery list.The coming-of-age celebration could've been so much more. The masked society is an appealing idea for a fantasy novel, but it is poorly executed in nearly every area. I wanted to like this book, I really did. But I can't.If the first 50 pages or so aren't for you, I'd suggest quitting the book outright. I wish I had only read the first sentence, the back of the book, and the last sentence. I would've been much more pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"damn good book","review":"I agree with one of the other review stating that it is very similar to the talion book.. its still a damn good book but i can see the similar style.

Does not worth reading it! All he states as truth is just an interpretation -personal one- over the facts. There is no single piece of evidence mentioned that matches the truth about the conclusions, which are merely subjective to the author's opinion.

Trees are such a basic, amazing thing on this planet, especially the large, old trees featured in this book.One thing I was disappointed in though, is that this edition was much smaller than the original edition. Such grand trees need to be seen in larger format, and the photography is impressive and deserves the original edition's larger size book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Beautiful Book on British Trees","review":"If you are a fan of trees or simply like to look at pictures of wonderful old specimens and imagine fairies, gnomes, soldiers from another era, Robin Hood or whatever fantasy you like, this book is a great choice. I was expecting it to be a bit of a coffee-table picture book but instead, as other reviewers have also noted, it contains quite a bit of text about the history of each tree covered as well as its location. I love big old trees and would have been happy with a picture book, but this goes well beyond the standard pretty-pictures-of-trees book I was expecting, without getting too text-heavy.

This was an extremely disappointing present for the 7 year old receiving it and the only thing that made her feel better was that none of the adults could use it either, two being artists.

Both aspects are there. Height adjustment is in 1.5 inch steps but that seems OK. The fit/finish is just OK but consistent with other bars I own. The main thing is it is heavy and sturdy and should do the job. I put a locking 5/8 pin on it so the ball end cannot be removed to take my trailer. It does not come with a pin but that was not an issue, I have extra non-locking pins if I wanted to use one.

The descriptions of inns and innkeepers reflect the differing personalities of the various lodgings.

The reasons the wetlands are disappearing, we're told, is lack of new soil being deposited due to levies, and the canals which bring in salt water from the ocean. The rest of the film we're subjected to watching the cajun musician and the fiddler zipping up and down the canals in their speedboats. Then, once Katrina devastates New Orleans, the film makes a point of noting that the broken levy, which caused flooding, had thankfully been repaired. For most of the film I was wondering, okay, so how do we save the wetlands? The answer, revealed at the end, is more man-made engineering. Okay. I give it two stars because the music overall was fun to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's more to the Gulf than NO","review":"Dare I say, shallow; no depth. I love NO and the bayous (wetlands), and agree that they need to be saved. However, this seemed to be more about showcasing a 13 year old prodigy and the musicians of NO and their travails before, during and after Katrina. I'm sure the folks of Pass Christian could tell a tale or two also. In the aftermath of the BP oil spill, and the recent flooding of the Mississippi, I would like to see focus on the entire Gulf Coast/wetlands region; not just NO. God bless those hearty souls who have survived and persevered through these disasters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Money to Rent so Little","review":"This documentary was a flash in the pan.

I am getting the DVD as a souvenir of the experience.I have heard a criticism that the films goes light (or 'lite', if you will) on scientific information. Once again look at the target audience...it is well defined INTRO of different subjects: the bayou and NOLA culture pre-K, the science of the storm and the bayou and NOLA AFTER the storm. For the amount of time an IMAX film has, it does a great job.I do recommend seeing it in IMAX first if possible...especially in New Orleans. You will definately want a copy of it after you see it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"bayou","review":"Hurricane on the BayouI recently viewed this film at an IMAX theatre and strongly recommend this film.

It had only 3 line dances on the whole DVD -- about 8 minutes worth out of sixty. What instruction I was interested in was made more difficult by the costuming.

The passion between them was as thrilling as Trish remembered. But then a fax arrived from his \\"fiancee\\" - just as Trish was about to announce she was carrying Adam's baby!Review: This book had too many strange threads. The hero was married for 15 years to a woman he had a child with but never truly loved and had only married for teenage trauma. He met the heroine when she was 16, he was married and she was a border in the home he shared with his wife. He was twice her age at the time. Both main characters were in other relationships when the first slept together. Just a bit too much ickyness to make them compelling characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found a better solution","review":"I bought this battery and it only powered my laptop for just a little over one hour so I returned it and got my money back and bought a Novuscell brand external laptop battery from The Battery Geeks website which powers my laptop for over 7 hours per charge and also charges my iPad and iPhone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for only one movie","review":"I'm taking a 16 hour flight and need to power my laptop for at least 6 movies.

Rockport has been my shoe of choice for many years and these do not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"These shoes are hot","review":"These shoes look good, but because they are waterproof, they don't breathe. Consequently they get quite hot when you wear them all day long. And sweaty feet in shoes that are waterproof can, er, start to smell a little bit. They also make a squishy sound when you walk. This is my experience anyway. These are not high quality shoes. I am buying a pair of Ecco's to try them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure if these are 'legit' Rockport Evanders...","review":"I know this might be odd to say, but I'm not sure these are legit. Or perhaps they could be the ones from the factory that didn't make the cut....

I am alway on the go. I have some pairs that are more casual, but liked this pair because they go better with more formal occasions. I have gotten a lot of complements on these shoes.

Nevertheless, I like them very much, and will still rely on Rockports as my shoe of choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed to say the least","review":"I ordered these from Rockport's website directly and was very disappointed to find the quality of these were lacking. When I opened the box, the polish was already noticeably gone in some spots. Thinking it may have been some leftover dirt, I tried to clean it with water and a cloth, and even more of the polish rubbed off. I gave it two stars instead of one because they were supposedly the most comfortable dress shoes (according to the person I bought the shoes for).Due to the polish already being rubbed off, I can only imagine what actual wear and tear will do to the shoes.

Recently we traveled to Mexico to see some of my family and we brought it with us,.. it is very compact and light to carry, also has wheels to roll it. The changing table which is attached to the play yard, is very heplful especially during nights when baby is half sleep and you want to avoid moving him too much (to other places too far from bed) to wake him up. Also you can set it up in a jiffy...which it's handy when baby is fuzzy and ready for nap.These days the play yard is set it up in our bedroom and it takes little space in a corner.I would recommend this as a good buy that would last long enough. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Combi playyard","review":"Loved this playpen! It is convenient to have at home and to pick up and take some where or put away. It is very attractive and \\"modern\\" looking unlike some. The bassinet works great for a newborn so you don't have to bend over and the changing table is wonderful. The vibrater on it just makes a very loud noise, but the music and light are very good features to help a little one fall asleep or help you see in the dark. Another complaint I have is fitting the changing table back into the bag. Usually when I pack it up I don't put that in there because it doesn't fit without a lot of wiggling and then I sometimes still can't get it too fit. The changing table is also not that easy to fold up. The compartments on the side are great for holding diapers and such too! But over all it is a awesome playpen especially for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A workout a new mother can actually find time to do!","review":"I love this video because 1) the exercises are something I can do with my baby; 2) the exercises are broken into groups so I don't have to do all of them in one sitting or have the video running every time; 3) it's playtime for my son - sometimes it is hard to entertain a young baby all day, so when I run out of ideas, I do some \\"exercise games\\" with him!; 4) my baby loves it and he laughs & plays while I do all the work; 5) it makes me feel good about myself to get a little exercise in each day, especially knowing that I don't have to stop interacting with my son to do it or give up my \\"break time\\" when he is nappingAs my son gets older & harder to lift (or to get to sit still!)

The difference betweeen this and other post-pregnacy videos I've seen is the focus on bonding with my baby while I'm exercising.

Noire books are unrealistic, she is a good writer but she needs to try and connect with her characters more. Things that happened to Candy will not probably happen in real life. This book shows how young, fast A** women get caught up in the money and fast life with older men. Both of Noire's books were about that. Also how both of there moms weren't good mothers, they had a sibling that got caught up into the game with their \\"Older men\\", they both had a friend that was scandlous and had to watch out for her, they both got they A** beat by these sick men.

This book was okay but all the books by this author seems repetitive. If you want to read real erotica, read Zane. I was more disgusted and disturbed than anything after read this book.

This book will make you happy, sad and want to beat someone down, and believe me you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Poignant Life of Candy Raye","review":"I finished \\"Candy Licker\\" in no time. I do see the similarities between \\"G-Spot\\" and \\"Candy Licker\\", however, this book is excellent! A few people stated that I shouldn't waste my time but I'm joyful that I didn't listen.Hurricane was 10X more vicious than Granite (of G-Spot). What a freakin' narcissistic psychopath! At least \\"G\\" had a penis, he just didn't know what to do with it. Hurricane couldn't satsify a mouse. LOLI love the way Noire blends hip hop, thug life AND erotica. For her next book, I'd like to read something totally unlike her first two books. She certainly has the talent and ability.I'm still trying to figure out what Candy Raye Montana looks like with all of that red hair and blue eyes. I just can't picture it. LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Novel","review":"OMG!!!!I read this book in 2 days. I could not put it down. Noire kept it real. It sucks you in the moment you pick it up to read it. Great read for anyone.This was my first book by Noire but I can guarantee you it wont be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This book is full of juicy, scandelous drama. So if you like urban novels I would definetly suggest you pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rerun","review":"This book was a bad rerun of G-spot. I wasn't at all impressed with Noire using the same basic format of: abuse, money, girl trapped, in love with another guy - in another book. It just seemed all too familiar. I was dissatisfied and felt all novels after G-spot was forced and lacked originality. I still think she is a good author with a lot of talent and potential. But the same ol' crack head mother theory gets old quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"It' s just LIKE CANDY!","review":"Candy is another diva in distress, with big dreams of becoming a famous singer. When she thinks her life is about to go from bad to even worse she bumps heads with one of the hottest rappers on the planet, Junius \\"Hurricane\\" Jackson. He is CEO of the number-one urban record label, House of Homicide, in Harlem. Candy finally can live her fairytale, so she thinks. Going from dead broke to having everything anyone could ever want; she lacks what her heart truly desires. Romance & Love. Instead she enters the most abusive sadistic relationship one could ever imagine. Her only safe route? The arms of Hurricane's lawyer, Knowledge.Noire did an amazing job with this GRIMEY, in-your-face tale of the music industry. Candy Licker is action packed, and will have you on the edge of your seat through the entire novel. Noire did an extraordinary job with her vivid descriptions. I could smell the sweat dripping off every booty popper & rapper in the club!I can't get enough of NOIRE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading title","review":"I did not feel that the title of the book justified the contents within it. It seems like the author gave the book its name only to capture readers of such material's attention. It was a great disappointment to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME GOOD REVENGE","review":"AWESOME. JUICY. VERY DETAILED WITH A GRUESOME TWIST. KEEP ME READING GOING PAGE TO PAGE JUST LIKE G-SPOT. BABY YOU'VE GOT IT GOING ON. THIS BOOK WILL MAKE YOU CRY, LAUGH, FEEL SAD, AND END MAKING YOU WANT TO READ THE NEXT RELEASE BY THIS AUTHOR. LESSONS IN LIFE LEARNED FROM THIS ONE.......CONGRATS GOOD REAING..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read","review":"From the beginning to the end this book had me hooked. Had some small grammatical errors however this was a good book. Not my first time reading this author. I will continue to read this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think so","review":"This is my first book I have bought by Noire and I am not sure if I want to buy another one. It just wasn't my cup of tea. The things that Hurricane did in this book was \\"Scandalous\\" to say the least. I liked the story but some of the things that went on were too crazy and over the top for me. I wished I didn't waste my $9.99 on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Feel Disturbed And Sad After Reading This Novel","review":"I thought this was going to be an erotic novel. It wasn't. I was intrigued by the story and I read it in two days. I hope there aren't real women out there who put up with this type of violence. I can understand why Candy felt trapped but why did the other women stay and continue to be punching bags? Just for the money and lifestyle? Only one of them had kids so why'd they stay?The violence against women was just too much for me. I felt sick after reading this. This novel left me with so many questions:Why did the \\"man\\" set up Percy\\"Knowledge\\" Jackson?Why did they frame him?Who would want to do something like that to him?Was it because he was black and brilliant they had to frame him????Why would a 15 year old boy need to get circumcised? That made no sense whatsoever!Based on this book I don't think I'd be interesting in reading any more of this author's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"close but no cigar","review":"If you want to be real about this novel. It was similar to G-Spot but not in the right places. Controlling man, thirsty girl,...... The only thing that made this book readable was thing that happened with her family, other than that I would have put it down for good. Gspot was one of my favorite books Candylicker was not. I couldn't wait for this book but if this was all that I was going to get I would have preferred to have been kept waiting. The only good thing I will say is that you will enjoy this book if you have not read gspot. Read this book first, Gspot will not disappoint you whether you read it first or second there is no comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"I ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK, AS I DID HER FIRST BOOK. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH IT IS THAT THE STORY LINE WAS A LITTLE LIKE G-SPOT. ALL TOGETHER THE BOOK WAS A GREAT READ. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHANGES","review":"I PICKED UP THIS BOOK MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE COVER A I FIGURED HEY HER LAST BOOK WAS GOOD Y NOT.THEN I STARTED 2 READ IT AND TO ME IT WAS JUST LIKE G- SPOT SAME EVERYTHING.NOIRE PLEZ SWITCH UP YA STYLE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, It's hard to be fair..","review":"Yeah, yeah. Wyrm gave some laughs, especially at the MUD parts. But it was not exciting, not interesting and certainly not remarkable. I found the later parts pretty good, but the plot was so ordinary, the character was flat and I always knew where the story was going. My advise is: Don't do as me. don't buy it. Because I for certain will not read any more hacker novels. Wyrm scared me away from those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, meandering and pointless.","review":"The only positive aspect of Wyrm is Fabi's thoughts on intelligence and sentience. It's a real shame that the plotline spends so much time on the ludicrous RPG/D&D game; a childish one-dimensional Hobitt/Lord of the Rings rip-off. BUUUUUHHH!The characters are also weakly developed. If you are not extremely interested in SF, stay away! Fabi has nothing to offer whatsoever in the technical insight/innovation department either. Trust me, I have a masters degree in the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let it go....","review":"I read the first 150 pages of this book in an hour. Turned the page and I thought I was in a different book! The technical aspects of the book were very well written, but it was very disjointed with the on-line gaming portions of the book. I thought I was the type of person that would enjoy a techno-d&d book. But this one was written in such a way that it was like reading two separate books. Beer and chocolate are two of my favorite foods, but not together. I feel the same way about this book. Get this one from your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wyrm is lacking in good execution, it's slow and stilted.","review":"Mr. Fabi reminds a little of Melville, going off on tangents that really shouldn't be part of the story. The descriptions of the world aren't very even, there seems to be a large disparity between the technology that's available and what is used. The writing is very hodge-podge, meandering through descriptions of things and seemingly bump into actions of importance. Overall a mediocre readIf you want good cyberpunk stick William Gibson, Neil Stephenson, Bruce Sterling, and Rudy Rucker"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read, especially if you know computers","review":"This book was one of the monthly choices in our book discussion group, and I went into reading it with little expectation that I'd like it. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised and entertained, and went back to read it a second time. The book explored a variety of computer and FRP themes, and while there was some stereotyping, and some very predictable plot twists, on the whole it was an enjoyable read. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves computers and/or fantasy role playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a awsome book!","review":"I think this was a really good book... it had all the stuff I am interested in. Hacking; Virus's; RPG's and other stuff. He really put a lot of good true info in the book...- Fire~Matrix"},{"rating":"2","title":"dangerous fun","review":"WYRM takes us on a ride to the millennium picking up computer viruses, arcane mythologies, chess and theories of consciousness while never slowing up from the weight of its erudition. The characters are engaging- Mr. Fabi manages to make an incredibly good hero not be a prig, and his, admittedly few, women are real rather than strident or passive.Weaving in and out of reality and virtual reality, WYRM is highly contagious. Keep out of hands of adolescents, or you will be assaulted by recursive acronyms before you've had your coffee, which makes parents look stupid"},{"rating":"1","title":"I regret the hours I spent reading this book.","review":"Others have said it better in their reviews, so I'll be brief. This book is boring, tedious. There's enough creative material in it to fill out about two or three pages; the rest is dross. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating, Horrible, and Never Worth Reading","review":"Wyrm is an absolutely horrible book. To anyone I would say,\\"Never read it!\\". As any one can figure out, the next milleniumbegins in 2001, not 2000, because there was never a year 0 and 1+2000=2001. Mark Fabi's little paragraph about how 2001 is mathematically correct, yet 2000 is agreed upon by the general population is like saying \\"The general population believes that 2+2=5, and so it must be true! The only thing that Mark Fabi was trying to do was show off how much he knows about computers, and how much he can stereotype every form of life on this planet, especially women. The only good stuff is in the game; he should have just cut out the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first book I have failed to finish in over 10 years","review":"What a waste of money.I read the online reviews which were glowing, and expected an exciting Cyberpunk style thriller along the lines of Gibsons Neuromancer or Jon Courteney Grimwood's Red Robe. Er, no.The story might be fine, but I just kept thinking 'Geeky IT bloke saves the world and gets the girl' the characterisation is just awful - more contrived than my 8 year old Sons learn to read books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most Fun I've had since Jose Phillip Farmer's Riverworld","review":"Just short of perfect for a difficult book to write. Bounding between the modern 1999 time space and the fantasy world that is Cyberscape Role Playing, made for a speedy, entertaining read. The insight offered on global conscience was a real hoot; if there is ever going to be a human-thinking computer program, the only way I can see it becoming a reality is the Mark Fabi way. Thanks for making Science Fiction/Fantasy fun again. I can barely wait for these MUD's of the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark Fabi doesn't miss a beat -- This book delivers!","review":"If you are the kind of person who can sit around with a group of friends and talk about Star Trek, Role-playing games, computers, the Internet, the future of technology ... if those conversations include a lot of \\"wouldn't it be cool if ...\\", then Mark Fabi's WYRM is for you! I loved this book ... it read like something I'd write, or something one of my friends would write ... that is, if we were as brilliant as Mark Fabi! Don't turn to this book for flowery prose or deep characterization, but please do turn to it for rollicking good fun! Thank you, Mark Fabi, for a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun.","review":"While this book won't win any awards, it was an entertaining (if somewhat lengthy) read. I'm a computer professional, and most of what Fabi wrote is technically accurate, and he did a good job at making the technology in the story understandable by those who don't know what \\"pre-emptive multi-tasking\\" is. This is a story I felt I could hand to my mother and know she'd understand the story, and more about technology, when she finished it. This is an entertaining, and funny book, good for mindless escapism, but it's not really going to be thought-provoking, unless you're paranoid about Microsoft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine dcollection of short stories","review":"After finishing this book, I am looking forward to reading her new novel. Fine writing and very believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, funny, and subtle!","review":"I loved this book and its brave, funny, quirky main character. She treads the delicate line between self doubt and calm surety with aplomb in some moments and hilarious accidental awkwardness in others, to great effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Reliable","review":"Does the job, a bit big and clunky but I don't imagine you can get it any smaller. Converts both ways. Easy to use and seemingly indestructible. I am Satisfied"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I really love this product. This is exactly what I needed. Its not all that fancy look but serves the purpose well in less price. This is obviously an Indian company (from the name). The difference is that this is step up and step down, both. MOst of the ther products are either step down or just step up. And the ones that are both they are very expensive. This is just awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipping... or Packaging?","review":"I was happy to have my product in the mail, but I was surprised to find that my product was badly packaged... My transformer was dented on the side and the outside was poorly taken care of. Other then that, I am using this here in Paris, France and it's working. It is a bit warm while it is on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not legal in US workplaces","review":"One of the base contractors was using this transformer at a USAF computer facility (or one that looked a whole lot like it). The contractor's own safety inspector took a look at it and promptly removed it from the room and told the tech not to bring unauthorised electrical devices into the lab. Turns out there is no UL or other testing/listing label on this product and the tech's manager and Base Civil Engineering got a real nice letter. The contractor got a reprimand for an OSHA violation (because they are civilian contractors using unapproved electrical products). They are not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Products","review":"I foud the converter has many damages in each side of it. Unfortunately, I was using my office as a shippment address for this product and they received it. I was out and came to the office more than one week later. When went to home with the converter I found the converter something like very used one. I was trying to return it and pay the shippment but the return due was past, althought I should not pay the returning shippment because it is not my problem.Now, I using that converter with some improvising."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay","review":"I read Randall's Jefferson biography and was unimpressed. However, I thought I would give Randall another chance with his Hamilton biography. I thought it was slightly better than the Jefferson bio.Then I read Chernow's Hamilton biography, which leaves Randall's in the dust. The main problem with Randall is that he is a professor and, as convential wisdom goes, professors write to pad their vita and for other professors, with little concern for the reader and more concern for quantity than quality. (In fact, with few exceptions [like J. Ellis], you should always skip a history book when the dust jacket announces the author is a professor).This book is an adequate overview of Hamilton, but why read it when an exceptionally better book exists? For completists and Hamilton enthusiasts only."},{"rating":"2","title":"correcting erosfaust","review":"In his review, erosfaust (who seems to like any book provided it espouses a view of life to the right of Ghengis Khan) makes a serious error.He claims the residency requirement was placed in the US Constitution to prevent Hamilton from being elected to that post. The US Constitution, in fact, says you must have been born in the country, OR BEEN A CITIZEN AT THE TIME OF RATIFICATION. Hamilton was always eligible for the Presidency.Oh, and he wasn't \\"hated by anyone who had anything to do with the founding\\" of this country, unless you want to eliminate George Washington from that number."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"As I struggled to finish this book, my only thought was to tell other people what a horrible book this was. It is very poorly written. The focus changes within a few paragraphs and the author goes back and forth in time in ways that is very confusing. Having read Joseph Ellis' Founding Brothers and David McCullough's John Adams in recent years, I was curious about Hamilton and how he antognized these two political opposites. But, as another reviewer pointed out, there is very little written about his last 10 years. There is a few paragraphs about Jefferson and Madison funding a Philadelphia newspaper to rival Hamilton's newspaper -- but there is never any mention of his starting or writing anything for that paper. His starting the New York Post rates only a sentence. I'm afraid I will need to seek out another biography of Hamilton to learn anything (besides his affairs) that occured after the Revolutionary War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This is an excellent book that gives the reader clear picture of how God worked to accomplish his grand Creation. It was my first glimpse of a God who created everything that is - from nothing. No formless mass, no promordial soup, no cosmic lava - but bothing. As FS states so well, the earth was created from \\"nothing nothing\\". Five stars because it is \\"Great food for thought and presents a clear explanation of the roots needed for a truly biblical worldview.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Creationism at it's Best","review":"This book is without a doubt one of the most valuable reads I have ever had the opportunity of indulging in. I highly recommend it to anybody exploring the concept of creationism. I bought it to use as a research book for a class I am taking, but I would suggest any Christian doubting or struggling to stand up for their belief that God created the world in six days, should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, the horror.","review":"I read the reviews, and I guess there were enough positive ones to lead me to ignore the negative ones. To my regret. It doesn't zero out, it doesn't pick up a good vacuum read, it has no adjustment. It was a real waste of money. Don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already broke...","review":"This piece of garbage already broke and I've had it a month. The needle now points about 4 notches to the left of zero without the vacuum turned on and moves to the space after 30 at the bottom of the gauge when the vacuum is running. Spend a little more at your local hardware store or elsewhere online(couldn't find a better one currently on Amazon) and buy a quality gauge because this one certainly isn't(quality that is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Solid Product","review":"It seems like anytime you want to have quality even slightly above \\"junk\\", you have to pay out the ears. It's nice to know that quality products like this exist that debunk that theory. This product is solidly built, with a large, easy to read metal gauge housing. Best of all, it is accurate and CHEAP. Don't hesitate to purchase this vacuum gauge. No regrets here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knows if I'll need it again, but it did the job","review":"Build quality is adequate, but not substantial, but I expected that, so I'm satisfied. I got it to test the vacuum line going to a secondary air valve which was triggering a Check Engine Light. I was able to verify that the vacuum was present, so I could go on to eventually diagnose that the valve was faulty.It was an economical purchase that did its job. If I were to use a gauge like this more often, in a shop, perhaps, I would go with something more rugged. But for my purposes it did a commendable job and I feel confident that it will be around for future use as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled!","review":"Purchasing this CD taught me to read the fine print. These covers are horrible, nothing like the original. You think your getting the real songs and they aren't even close. Why would anyone enjoy this???? You could get drunk with your friends and sing these and it be would about the same quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bursting Out","review":"The Backstreet Boys are back again with their new album \\"Black and Blue.\\" Now with the Imported CD you get your favorite guys plus two extra songs. \\"What makes you different (makes you beautiful.)\\" And the acapella version of \\"All I have to Give.\\" I love the Backstreet Boys and I have always in enjoyed their music but Black and Blue truly expresses and shows how much the boys have grown to men, musically. Their sharp songs and upbeat tunes truly express the heart and determination they put into the album. This cd is a giant step into greatness for the boys. It is far better than any other cd they have created so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Travel Guide Ever","review":"I 've had this book since 1995.Using this as my guide, I have walked most of the city from Wall Sreet to Harlem. As you walk along, you are informed about architecture, facinating details you would normally overlook, and wonderful gossipy history. ie \\"Boss\\" Tweed, dying in the jail he built, and \\"the Bloody Angle\\" on Doyer St. in Chinatown. See Wall Street, Chinatown, Soho, the historic squares, the Lower East Side, the Village, mid-town, Upper East, Upper West, Central Park, Morningside Heights, Harlem, the Cloisters.

I checked them periodically just to make sure the alarm was still functioning. Lately, the alarm has been beeping in intervals, scaring me into thinking that someone is trying to break in. Besides the scare factor, it's annoying to hear a 90 decibel beep randomly throughout the house. I do not recommend these for use on windows at all. Even the chime feature wouldn't be good, say for children. It is VERY loud and not a pleasant notification that a door has been opened. It is indeed an alarm. It is a lot cheaper than a security system and if you can live with the random loud beeps, then go for it.

Sex is boring, written from teenager point of view. There are no illicit details, no kinky explorations, and very weak plot. The end was obvious from first 20 pages. Since when masculine women wearing jeans and baseball cap became major attraction?

This is second book of Larry Brooks that I did not like."},{"rating":"2","title":"survival of the craftiest","review":"With SERPENT'S DANCE, Brooks is back on firmer ground after the misfire of PRESSURE POINTS. This, his third novel, is a heady cocktail of Topping From Below, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and Blood Simple, with a little Michael Crichton thrown in for good measure. That he is able to pull it off is a tribute to his talent, and I found it to be an enjoyable roller-coaster ride from start to finish. I don't want to give away any plot secrets, but I will say that this one will keep you guessing right to the end without sending the needle on your BS meter into the danger zone. The only complaints I have (and they are relatively minor ones) are that the writing could have used an editing pencil here or there (there are some muddled metaphors and obscure references that had me scratching my head) and the character of Jerry was a little too naive and not as convincingly nerdy as he should have been.

He said the stench that drifted from the convent was the most horrible odor you could imagine and the people could hear the terrible language that the possessed woman screamed. This was a terrifying event for the people who lived in that town.

Even though it is short (it can be read in one afternoon) it covers a lot of important points on the subject. Since it is only one case-study, the book is a little limited since no two cases are exactly the same. But, from what I have researched, the possession covered in Begone Satan! has many of the classic features of that affliction. The only drawback is that it is a translation from German and so the grammar is a little awkward at times. I would highly recommend this work for those wanting to know more about possession and exorcism but do not have either the time or interest to read a longer work on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant even get to the end","review":"I started watch it because the good reviews, but I gave up after the 3th episode...really boring and really bad actors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the SECOND thing that Amazon has NOT sent me!

I recommend the series unconditionally.This DVD, though, is disappointing. The menu and episode navigation is very awkward, to the point that it discourages me from showing this series to others.

I read some people make a comparison to Heroes...not in plot, but in storytelling style. Mmmaybe. Still. Very entertaining concept. An \\"event\\" many years ago in a motel room creates the doorway through all doorways and all of the objects in that room gained a special power. And everyone wants them. And this cop's daughter disappears into the room. Thus begins the journey to bring his daughter back and unravel the secrets of room 10. My blurb is just the tip of the iceberg. A very fun trip for the viewer. It could have resolved itself a little better. (And I don't mean having everything explained. Hey, I like a little lingering mystery.

An excellent combination of sci-fi/ suspence / thriller / and humor centered around the love of a father and daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth watching","review":"I don't disagree with the previous reviews, but I think the unresolved mystery at the heart of the show is best left that way. The joy is in the journey. The peculiar characteristics of the objects have a surreal quality, an exercise of pure imagination, that is very engaging (Andre Breton would probably have loved this story). The really compelling aspect of Lost Room, I think, is the variety of reactions to these objects. People band together to collect them, worship them, or suppress them; individuals seek them as personal talismans, weapons, valuables, or just to enhance their own self-worth. It gives the story depth, and lifts it into the realm of intelligent SF. Fans of PK Dick, Star Trek, Firefly, and the golden age of SF would probably all enjoy this show. I don't usually watch the SF channel, but this show was simply too good to dismiss. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked from the get-go","review":"Here in the UK, we are currently watching this fascinating mini-series.The story is original and the parts are well played.It's Science Fiction but, because of the contemporary setting and the restrictions governing each 'object', it doesn't feel like sci-fi. Yes, there are objects with incredulous power, however, it is the characters that drive the story and not the objects.Personally, I'd like to see this as a regular series on TV but I get the impression as another poster has already stated, that story-lines would quickly become stale tracking down the objects each week.It may be an idea for the producers to periodically release a two-hour special that would keep our interest and yet not dilute the show. That way, more money could be ploughed into the writing and production, rather than spreading it thinly across 6, 13 or even 20 episodes.I've no doubt that a series would be popular and yet less would definitely be more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the Series, HATE the DVD assembly","review":"The idea for the series and the stories themselves are really imaginitive and well done. I'd love to see more. But the construction of this DVD by the production company is HORRIBLE! The menu doesn't work! There is a \\"Bermuda Triangle\\" startup session that you are forced to watch EVERY time you start this DVD or hit the MENU button to see the main menu. When you watch the first story it automatically plays the 2nd story as well, and when you play the 3rd it automatically also plays the 4th. If you try to go to the main menu to select an individual story you have to go back and watch the startup session again!

It basically illustrates the abduction, humiliation, raping and terrorizing of a female. The main problem with the film, aside from its pointlessness is that the acting is extremely poor. The whole idea of the film is to witness the interaction of the victim and her abductor, but this is entirely undone by the lame acting. The direction is also very poor with continued use of static camera placements that only highlight the fact that these actors are unable to portray their characters. At no time is their any sense of terror properly demonstrated by the female actress and at no time is their any sense of malevolence demonstrated by the male actor.

It actually crossed the line of cinematic fantasy, meaning you know its not real. Most pictures like this one, have an element of substance to them... like an actual story and plot. A plot where the action moves the story along. Not Scrapbook. It was just ugly for ugly sake. The actors & crew just wanted to shock.

Having boxed and being a 1st Dan in TKD since 1986 I have seen a plethora of fights as well as a having been a competitor. Any of these women if trained properly could become pro's but that is not the case here. I though that Ultimate Fighting is the worst title for this DVD. How about ultimate embarrassment.If you want to see good female boxing then Lucia Rijker in \\"Shadow Boxers is a great pick. Craig Barr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title... Don't Bother!","review":"This video had the potential of being a great piece if only it weren't for its incompetent producers. The title is misleading. The fighters are pure amateurs; they exhibit no boxing skills. Video and audio is low quality. The DJ tries to keep up, but he is always out of sync. The ref is good though. But that's not my main contempt considering this cheaply produced film is about emerging fighters. It's the immature interviewers who kill the whole thing; asking stupid questions, making fun of the fighters and taking away the seriousness of the matter.Overall, this seems like a you-tube film and definitely not worth $9."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"I didn't know anything about polar exploration before I read this. I was entralled. It's also a deeply insightful book about human motivation, competition and honor. Well written, I especially like how the author would make glimpes into the future with small digressions in his narrative (like when he speaks of the ironic death of Cook's brother, who never set foot in the arctic--I won't spoil that small footnote by saying how in this review). I know the author tried to couch it in neutral terms, but there's no doubt that this is a pro-Cook book. Fine by me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Was First?","review":"If you are a lover of Arctic adventure and history this is a must read!Bruce Henderson does a great job comparing the two men who claimed to be first to the North Pole. Was it Peary? Was it Cook? This is so well written and interesting you'll find it hard to put down. I have always had my opinion as to who can rightfully claim the title of \\"First\\", but after this book, I changed my mind. You may do the same. Each explorers journey is detailed along with a close look at thier personality and inter-action with others. I guarantee you will love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"I love fantasy and crime books. This author combines both. I look forward to reading more from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series but.........","review":"I really love this series by C.E. Murphy. The first book was a special favorite as I liked all of the characters right from the first page. I looked forward to the second book \\"Thunderbird Falls\\" with great anticipation. The plot, as described elsewhere, was well developed even if somewhat predictable. The characters, as always, were likeable. Perhaps, the relationship between Joanne and Gary almost feels a bit incestuous and I would like more development between Joanne and Morrison.I really like this author and this series and would recommend it to any and all. And I look forward to future developments and the discovery of what happened to \\"Coyote\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel weakness?","review":"Worth reading, but definitely weaker than the first book in the series, Urban Shaman. Hopefully, the next installment in the series will be tighter.C. E. Murphy is on the right track (for me, anyway) with this series. I doesn't go off on interminable sidelines dealing with the heroine's romantic entanglements. Instead, it is focused on her self discovery and growth, and on the problem/mystery to be dealt with."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok....","review":"Would you try another book from C.E. Murphy and/or Gabra Zackman?I think I'll pass on both of them.Would you ever listen to anything by C.E. Murphy again?C.E. Murphy wrote a romance book and that is what it is. I wouldn't think C.E. Murphy would want to change anything. It fit the book that C.E. Murphy was trying for.What didn't you like about Gabra Zackman's performance?It was a very flat performance. Very dry.Any additional comments?It was to more romance and not enough Urban Fantasy for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Obvious","review":"It's an okay read, but not spectacular. It seemed to rely heavily on Joanne not noticing things that she really probably should have--specially considering that she's a cop and been walking the beat. Surely when Faye pops out of nowhere, Joanne should have been at least suspicious and certainly very cautious before jumping in all the way. When Faye started talking about bringing over a powerful god (or whatever he was) to \\"fix\\" things, that should have raised all kinds alarm bells. Never once did Joanne even bother to ask her teacher anything about the god other than to go see him. Joanne just seemed to walk through the book without really actually thinking about anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Like many of the reviewers, I read Urban Shaman and really enjoyed it. As a matter of fact, I devoured the book and had trouble putting it down. But Thunderbird Falls, was a big flop. It really felt that Murphy was wandering all over the place. There were pages and pages devoted to Joanne's journey on the spiritual level. Quite frankly, I found it totally boring. I found myself skimming large portions of this book. I also found the plot with the witch coven to be unbelievable and weak. I couldn't even find it in Joanne's character to get involved with these people.I was really disappointed because I enjoyed Urban Shaman so much, and really think that the character of Joanne Walker is a great one. I do plan on reading the next book. Every author is entitled to a dud now and again. I am hoping that Murphy gets her focus back for the third one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"I read the reviews for this book, I was sceptical that I would like it.

The lost love storyline is what caught my eye because I love those type of stories, but as the story inveils itself, it was not much of a love story. But I am glad I read the story for myself to see just how the book was all about. Many a person had told me that it was not all that good, always be your own judge! I must say they were right, but I'll let you see for yourself!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I DUNNO ABOUT THIS ONE....","review":"Well, to be honest with everybody, I wasn't really into this book. It was long and drawn out, and unnecessarily BORING. I cannot tell you how many times this book came close to boring me to sleep. Yeah, the cover of the book looks good, but you know what they say about judging a book by it's cover.

I would recommend it if your budget is as tight as mine. However, while I found it adequate, I will likely replace it when I can afford better. I have arthritis so my main issue is the handle, which is very smooth, slippery plastic. I found it difficult to grip and use to feel out obstacles. If you purchase this cane, you should also buy a roll of rubber sports tape to wrap around the handle, as that will greatly improve its usability. An elastic strap would also be useful to help bind it when folded. If you do purchase this cane, you should do it through Amazon as the shipping charge is lower and delivery time was astoundingly fast, arriving even before the charges cleared my card! Over all this is a good buy IF you also use to rubber tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live Album","review":"If you like Holly Golightly's music then you will not be disappointed with this album. The reviewers who gave this album low ratings because of quality must have missed that this is a LIVE album. Yes, you can hear people talking in the back ground and glasses clinking but that's half the appeal. You can tell it was recorded at a small intimate venue. It's definitely not a polished studio album but that should be obvious. As far as live albums go the quality is just fine. The small interactions between the band and the crowd are a cute addition to the music which is well played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Live Holly Golightly !","review":"This CD is very listenable ! It's as good as Up The Empire. It was recorded purposely on an older recording device -- the way Holly wanted it done ! It's like a very good bootleg !

He enjoyed the animation. I think this will be a great video to help him learn his ABCs, colors and counting. My favorite part was the interaction encouraged by the narrator - a mouse wizard. I also like that the video gives the parent some time to interact with the child too. There are some \\"bigger\\" words that I think will keep him interested as he grows and develops.The animation is not too fancy, but is still interesting and has some cute touches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak plastic gears","review":"I wish Irwin would improve this design.

I would highly recommend buying the assembly verses just the gears. The assembly is much easier to install and saves quite a bit of time, instead of just a few dollars. Also, the assembly has new bushings at the top where the chain gear is. I knew when I installed the gear only that the bushing there was a problem and going to cause premature failure of the gear and it did just that.If you are desperate to save a few bucks then get the gears alone, but you would have to be extremely desperate considering the time and frustration that can be saved by getting the assembly."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFTMASTER GEAR ASSEMBLY KIT","review":"I'M A DO IT YOURSELF TYPE OF GUY.

Do listen to all the other reviewers and instructions when it says to first run the opener through a full opening cycle (without door attached) - - - before you go ahead and attach door trolley to chain! This ensures you attach trolley to chain at end of its opening cycle and not, somewhere in the middle where you door initially quit functioning...Bought the part for $25 and spent maybe 1 hour total removing and then installing new parts - q huge and worthwhile savings.

The instructions were thorough and complete. I was able to do the repairs without having to remove, or drop down, the whole motor assembly. Being able to do the repairs with it in place probably saved me about an hour. The tricky part is the initial setting of the Full Open Stop, and the Closed stop contacts. Before reinstalling the chain on the gear, I made sure the motor was cycled to the closed stop position and the door was all the way down. Then I locked the chain into the door lock, and then installed the chain on the gear.

I assumed that the supplier had forgot to ship the part and was blaming it on the USPS but after the second part showed up and I installed it I received an envelope for USPS. Guess what.....they had lost the package and the only thing they had left was the invoice/packing list that Open Door Discount Remotes had placed in the package.

As one of the reviewers has mentioned, I replaced just the gear assembly which saved tremoundous amount of time and effort (no need to replace the sprocket if it is good).The other important tip is to make sure the nut assembly for loosening the chain is close to the garage door opener and not near the garage door. The instruction says close the garage door and loosen the chain.. Not quite, i had to keep the garage door open.Also, trust me, it is far more easier to replace the assembly if you bring down the entire garage door opener. All it takes is 4 bolts (2 on each side of the railing, and 2 on the top that attaches the bar to the opener). Trying to replace the gear assembly while on the top is more difficult than doing it on the floor.Over all, it is a good product. 5 stars, no less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper alternative....","review":"than replacing an entire garage door opener or getting a service call.

The part number seems to be the same, but I saw no warning about this anywhere. Only when we were done did we see that the drive gear on top did not match our belt.

Loved the price for the repair kit, much better than buying a whole new garage door opener. Took about 7 days to arrive with free shipping! The assembly was a little tricky for the worm nut assembly, but other than that the installation was easy following the instructions. The only hard part was adjusting the chain tension and fine tuning the up and down on the garage door itself.

I had to take the part out and take it apart. I don't have the tap that is required to make the top plate screw in! So I ended up using most of my old part with the new gear. I bought the whole part because most said that if the gear went bad the rest usually was or going to go bad. Besides the temperature being freezing it went together easily. E grease that comes with it ran right out of the holes when screwed in. The old part still had the grease from when it got put in 20 or so years ago!

When it comes to sententious pop music I am as hardy as the next guy but this is too much. Elton John is one thing, at least he seemed to have some verve when he started out, but Billy Joel wrote what might just be the worst song ever, \\"My Life,\\" which is right up there with \\"American Pie\\" and \\"We Built This City on Rock and Roll\\" as totally reprehensible examples of popular songwriting and performing. I admit I can tolerate \\"Allentown\\" as a sort of dinky version of something that Randy Newman or Springsteen might have done better. But I can't countenance the Boss either, this is way too populist for me, and I know my opinion is worth about as much as that nether region opinions are oft compared to.

Entirely heedless of the fact, it seems, that the last person who conquered the Afganistani's was Alexander the Great in about 320BCE these 2 unlikly aspirant royals establish a modest kind of a kingdom that looks OK on paper, until the paper gets wet and it all falls apart.When push come to shove in their 'kingdom' the 'soldiers' ignore orders and flee after, eventually, the kings.Who ever said the lot of a king was better than that of a commoner!

So this short story of two greedy, stupid Englishmen who think that they can just show up somewhere with some guns and become their own self-proclaimed kings was a frustrating waste of time for me. And remembering the ending ahead of time didn't help. (Don't give up on Kipling based on this book - I just LOVE his Captains Courageous, an upbuilding coming-of-age story about a rich kid who was washed overboard and picked up by a fishing schooner and made to work.)

In the decades that followed, he has explored many (new) musical styles, and has done much more than most of us guess at (he's done a lot, for example, in symphonic rock, disco, ballet and jazz in addition to soundtrack music).After his huge 1995 hit \\"Conquest of paradise\\" Vangelis seemed to be exhausted musically. The same year, though, he amazed fans by releasing the absolute heavenly miracle \\"El Greco\\". However, the new album \\"Mythodea\\", actually his first new full-length album since 1996, comes nowehere near all these diamonds. Mythodea is overblown, over-bombastic, endlessly tiring, and with very little variation.

I was so mad that this game pack is advertised for 1st and 2nd graders, and my four year old was bored and frustrated with it. The second Pixar disc doesn't even work, it says it's a \\"Print Only\\" CD-Rom when you try to run it, I have no idea what that means. The Aladdin disc would have been challenging for her, if only it was actually included! Don't advertise something as being 3 discs of distinctly separate games when it's not!

After reading four or five of these stories, one can't help but wonder \\"where's the beef?\\". Not only are the stories themselves rather uninteresting (what's so outstanding about an organ player with a hand ailment?), but Roueche's writing style wipes out the feeble grip the book has on the reader. It doesn't flow; rarely do you find a sentence with more than one simple idea in it; and strangely enough, both he as the narrator and his QUOTED interviewees use exactly the same pizzicatto narrative...

It is certainly a good place to start for information on various projects but comes up short on construction techniques. Perhaps an older source, Procedures in Experimental Physics (Lindsay Pubs), is better. Of course, it was written in 1938, so materials cited might be out of date, but the construction techniques aren't bad. I recently decided to build a good sized water tank (40\\" by 6\\" by 3\\") of acrylic and found nothing about construction tips. I was thinking of building something that probably required casting, and found a paltry two pages on the subject.It would be good to see it updated every 5 years or so. I see the pub date is 1991.

I haven't been a fan of comic books for a very long time, and I haven't been around long enough to have followed the adventures of the Avengers or JLA from the start. But being a fan of both teams I can say I certainly wasn't disappointed in this book. A lot of comics are coming out that take a more realistic view of things. This on the other hand is what comic books are about for me. Galactic scale adventures. There are a lot of moments that I loved in this book and if you're a fan of either team I'd recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very superficial","review":"I thought that the dialogue of the Avengers was very juvenile; it seemed that Hawkeye, Cap, and Thor didn't like the idea that the JLA were well respected by their world. Rather than trying to solve their problems and work together like adults (as Scarlet Witch intimates), Thor unleashes a savage attack on Superman--and for what purpose? I am looking forward to Supes teaching a little bit of humility to the god of anger and hubris. Perhaps the comic illustrates the one of the common problems we readers experience in the real world: we fight with our fists rather than with our ideas. The storyline is pretty good, I would have liked to see the Martian Manhunter actually intelligently communicate with the Watcher. If I were part of the cast of heroes, I would have seriously questioned the story they were given by these demigods. So much for logic, but the artwork is good, except Aquaman appears with both arms in one scene and with a spear prosthetic limb in another scene--very sloppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"the book was great but the seller was way too slow getting it to me it was litterally a month befotre i recieved it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Nice!","review":"I had wanted to try one of these before ordering but there weren't any local.

I've never before experienced a writer who more accurately portrayed the inner life of someone watching a loved one suffer a debilitating illness. When people rank a piece of fiction as \\"for adults only,\\" we usually mean it contains sex and/or violence. This novel has both, but I would keep it away from children because the strong, ambivalent feelings of a tortured spouse are for grown-ups only. I'm a mystery and suspense fan, and I recognize the plot weaknesses in Summer of Fear, but I would recommend this novel to anyone who appreciates well-drawn characters. But be prepared to look at real life in all its conflicted, ugly, transcendent, messy glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Look","review":"The is an excellent character study.

I guess I just don't like mysteries about serial killers -- some psychotic stranger kills a bunch of people for some bizarre reason and has no other relationship with any of the other characters in the book -- this is just not interesting to me. Plus, the murders in serial killer books tend to be more gruesome than most -- ick! The writing was plodding too. We'd get one sentence about something happening and then 3 pages of boring background material.

Admittedly, I'm not a fan of chick flicks, but be warned: This one really stinks. Even my wife thought so! Horrible acting, incredibly trite dialogue. You name it, this flick has all the worst that incredibly bad romantic comedies have to offer. Claire Forlani is going to have a tough time getting a real acting gig after this stinker. She's got this cutesy schtik that is so played out! Even when her beau craps all over her, she comes back with her quirky smile and all is forgiven. Really??! And what is up with her face! Isn't she a little young for a Joan Rivers style facelift. She should sue the plastic surgeon... her mouth actualy looks crooked now.And some people might think Irish accents are cute... but we could barely make out what they were saying.

That's how I feel after having read the poor reviews--but I watched it anyway. I have to say I either have pretty low standards or a really high tolerance for bad movies (I've only ever walked out of two: The Money Pit and Joe vs. the Volcano) but this movie was just FLAT. It was almost weird how lacking it was in...anything. Clair Forlani is not a good actress--sorry, but she just isn't.

The songwriters have a sense of humor about the genres they operate in (gothic and heavy metal) and this adds a dimension to the album that many albums of these genres lack. Macarther Park is a great example of this-- a rocking, fast-paced version of this classic song which gives it a totally new dimension. My other favorite track is 'Too Late', a surprisingly melodic tune that Patt Briggs sings elegiacally. The new band members sound tight and together, and if you have a chance to catch the live show, don't miss it. Psychotica puts on a lively, energetic show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply bad","review":"The original Psychotica EP is one of my favorite albums. When Espina was released, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it; when I did, I was terribly disappointed.

This Candy Cane shower gel is not actually Candy Cane. It smells like someone opened a bottle of peppermint extract, actually.

Meditative, eloquent, and wise, Anne Valley-Fox's poems rise gently to the surface of consciousness and reach outward with the grace of ripples on a still pond. Both sensual and spiritual, they know of joy and grief, of loss and redemption, of the mystery that hovers always beyond our grasp.

The book is similar in approach to Niederhoffer's \\"The Education of a Speculator.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not about trading","review":"There are about 20 pages having anything to do with trading. The rest of the book was about his experiences with his Christian faith. What's funny is that for all his searching, he basically concludes that one has to invent Christianity for themselves, so it's not even a good book FOR a religious Christian to read.

I would say watch it but I would warn you that you will be disappointed. The actually Heist scene was awesome but that scene only lasted 20 minuets. The rest of the movie was to be kind, boring.

The packaging box is stronger than the material used to build the table. While we were playing 2 of the legs broke off. I had thrown away the box because it was a Christmas gift for my kids so I could not return it. We tried to make it usable by adding a pine board on the back of the pool table to make it more durable and we also attached new wood legs to it. Really, really bad quality.

It is technically horror, but really a meld of horror, mystery, and detective, with a 1940's feel due to some of the interesting costume choices.

Bernstein provides extensive coverage of the personal and political events which lead up to the eight year dig. At page 199 he begins a well organized outline of the 300 mile excavation and the 100 plus locks required to deal with the elevation issues. The book had few maps and drawings, and the reader needs a separate atlas to grasp what is happening. Except for that lack, the work is highly recommended.If you are expecting the equivalent of McCullough's \\"Path Between the Seas\\", you will be disappointed. That book deals extensively with the physical aspects of construction on the Panama Canal. Bernsteins book is mostly about the history of the period, the people, politics, and financing of the Erie Canal. The actual dig is treated lightly. It depends on your taste: people or shovels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Mistakes","review":"I was considering buying this book for a birthday present but fortunately happened to see a copy in my local library. It reads easily but has several gross historical and geographical errors which make me wonder about the accuracy of the facts in the rest of the book. The most egregious of these errors (page 66 and elsewhere) places the Cumberland gap near Cumberland, Maryland, when in fact it is at the Kentucky / Virginia border some 400 miles to the southwest. Also, I wonder about the cotton mill in Utica, New York in 1811 (p-150). How did the unspun cotton get from the south to a frontier town in upstate New York at that date ? I feel that there is simply no excuse for any non-fiction book on a historical subject to be marred by errors which could and should have been easily detected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Product","review":"This book was somewhat enjoyable, until the FIRST time he mentioned that \\"Daniel Boone's road\\" through the Cumberland Gap was near Cumberland, Md. In fact, Daniel Boone's road through Cumberland Gap is more than 350 miles from Cumberland, with an entire state (West Virginia) between them. Disappointed, I continued reading until, about 50 pages later, he made the same mistake. Where I'm from, you learn about the Cumberland gap and Daniel Boone prior to 6th grade graduation. How the author, let alone editors, missed this is hard to comprehend. Unless of course one assumes that they wanted to rush a shoddy product to market so that they could make some money as quickly as possible. Then I suppose it makes sense, in a twisted way. I agree that it could use much better maps, and spend more time on the actual building of the canal. But that's background noise compared to glaring, easily discoverable and correctable factual errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating topic, tedious telling","review":"300 mile canal, ties the young nation together, opens the tremendous flow of commerce, further pushing New York to the economic forefront, keeps the nation from being divided by the Appalachians, out of the hands of European nations.

Make it a topographic map so you can understand the ups and downs of the canal route.Fast forward through all the players who had first claim to the idea. Does that really matter?Buy a book on Tammany Hall to gain the proper perspective on this bastion of neighborhood support, and corruption.Google the references to precedent-setting canals...this book provides concise, but light, explanations.In a nutshell...this telling could have been condensed into about 80 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be turned off by the negative reviews. Whaddaya mean no map?","review":"I was hesitant to buy this after reading negative reviews. However, it's compelling enough that I've read about 100 pages a day. I can only assume that the paperback has no map or the reviewers failed to find it in the beginning. My hardback edition has a useful map in the front which I turned to many times.The book emphasizes the political, economic, organizational, and engineering facets of the project.

My other half usually prefers his minus the milk through some strange prejudice that milk or cream are not to be mixed with tea.I highly recommend Lipton's Spiced Chai--there is NO medicinal taste like some other brands, and the spices aren't as strong as my favorite brand (Bigelow), so its something that those who aren't as fond of spiced chai can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as the expensive stuff","review":"We were buying Starbucks way too much and this is a money saver.

To me it seems that people who would use such a pattern book are NOT advanced glass designers/makers, else they'd be making their own pattern from a favorite picture or print. Needless to say, the quality and skill level of the pictured pieces is excellent, and I hope that someday I can be that good at glass.The patterns do come with color and glass suggestions to help one match the pictured pieces, which is somewhat helpful, but half the fun of making your own piece is picking out your own color scheme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful patterns","review":"I have really enjoyed making some of the faeries in this book.

It doesn't seem to deplete from you own natural oils. I would definitely recommend it for anyone. This also leaves a nice shine that lasts for a decent amount of time. The scent, when you first put the gloss on, is a bit too overwhelming - but I am sensitive to that. It also can be messy so don't put too much on at once or you'll have a big mess. Every so often, I have to wipe off the applicator just so it doesn't ooze out and onto to other things in my purse, which it will if you're not careful. Overall, I recommend it.

None of the poems have been published in a journal, and for good reason, they're not very good. It's poorly written with the intention to shock, but without the originality, skill, or edginess you find in cutting-edge poetry. Lennon goes over the top in his attempt to shock, and instead creates poor poetry. You want to read a poet who skillfully plays the edge between risqueness and over-the-top, but still staying on this side of it, then read Kim Addonizio or Sarah Cortez. Avoid this book. I think Story Line, which normally publishes good work, published Lennon to try to give it an edge to its reputation.

This is a director's 'take' on the opera completely changing the motivation and actions of the principals. As such it is a travesty though well sung, played and acted. But never believe this is Wagner's Rienzi - you only have to read the libretto to see how falsely this version represents the drama.There is a wonderful and absolutely complete (not 9 hours) performance of the opera on cd conducted by Sir Edward Downes originally broadcast by the BBC in 1976 - well worth seeking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Wagner","review":"I agree with K.

Until now, the bloody story of the Montana vigilantes in the 1860s has flattered the legendary law-and-order gang with each retelling; the vigilantes remain heroes (perhaps saints?) in Montana, models of manliness and rectitude. But Frederick Allen has taken a fresh and deeper look at this fascinating tale. The picture he paints is darker, more nuanced, and ultimately haunting. Allen's vigilantes -- good men whom too much bloodletting finally corrupted, and who tried to cover their historical tracks -- provide a perfect narrative arc for a master storyteller. A great book for almost anyone: historians, fans of the West, fans of a terrific tale. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate scholarship in a reader friendly format","review":"This is the type of book that gives University Presses a good name.

In what was the deadliest chapter of vigilante justice in American history, from 1864-1870, in excess of 50 men were hanged in Montana. The majority were inocent of capital crimes and a disturbing numer were innocent. This is a riveting book that will, in addition to bringing the reader up to date on a significant chapter in western history, cause one to ponder the significance of the Vigilantes on our current political debate over the war on terrorism.

The animation is second rate, at best - cheaply drawn, with static backgrounds. (The one touch of inspiration was to paint the backgrounds in the styles of the great impressionist painters.) The music, though written by two of this century's greatest songwriters, is entirely forgettable. The story is extremely weak and entirely devoid of any charm or wit. The movie appears to have been produced for the price of a song - and not a very good song, at that. The movie's one redeeming quality is the impressive vocal talent behind it. This cartoon is best suited for young children. Anyone over the age of 9 will be bored with it.

It is not really that great at all. Why have a couple of cats get drunk? Inappropriate for little kids.

The only reason I didn't rate it a 1 star video was because the plot was great. Judy Garland shouldn't have used her voice to sing those awful songs, and that goes for Jean Tom too.

I don't know anything about the production history of this turkey, but it reeks of a cold eyed attempt to cash in on the Disney market and a total absence of real enthusiasm. The songs are distinctly third rate, the voice acting is sub-Flintstones standard, and Chuck Jones' art is some of his least inspired.The whole film is shoddy, trivial, and annoying. It might entertain small children for whom Pokemon is too sophisticated, and I suppose that Garland fanatics will want a copy.

It was uncomfortable having to adjust it everytime it slipped which detracted from the ease of use. Honestly I don't know how it has remained on the market for so long. Another useless item that will take up space in your closet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Do What It Said","review":"Have been using these two for almost 2 months now at 150 repetitions a day. Being hopeful, I kept doing all the exercises and the only part it's helped on is the bust area. It's pretty bad when you boyfriend even says there's no difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toning System","review":"These are very hard to use. The red one you use on the inside of your thighs hurts after a few reps. Because of it's design, it is twisted at the center which causes the arms to turn in an awkward way, making it hard to keep in the same place on your legs. I have to keep adjusting it and I am usually sore afterwards. The blue one works better as far as twisting goes, but you can't spread it out very far."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a toning system","review":"If you expect to lose weight with this equipment, you won't. It does what it says. You'll tone your muscles. They'll be less flabby. Don't expect to get ripped. It will increase your strength. I bought this after having three babies. It has helped to tone up my legs. I use it every day and various times throughout the day. It's good when you only have a few minutes here or there to exercise. I keep it on the back or near my couch so that when I get a breather, I can sit down and work a muscle group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, Use it and see the change","review":"I have owned a thigh master since they first came out and am now on my third one. So easy to use and keep your thighs and arms toned. I use it at the very least 100 times a day. When I first get up in the morning, when watching TV and, anytime I take a break. It's so easy to use, you can take it with you anywhere, and you get great results in just a couple of months. I would not be without one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thigh master..Easy+Great!","review":"I have always wanted to try the Suzanne Somers thigh master. And now that i have finally got it,let me just say that it is great! And so easy to use! I watch tv while working out..If you want to tone up your thighs,then i suggest you get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for exercise","review":"Great items to excersize with when you don't have a lot of time or space in your home for equipment. Instructions are easy to follow & exercises are easy to do. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"truest vanilla flavor!","review":"I ordered the decaffeninated French Vanilla, because the regular wasn't in stock at the time. I'd been meaning to cut back on caffeine anyway. What I found is that the decaf type actually had a more pleasing and more intense vanilla flavor to it which I really enjoyed even more. I plan to stay with the decaf variety from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite tea!","review":"Every evening includes a cup of Bigelow decaffeinated French Vanilla Tea and if there is a movie included in my evening plans, I will enjoy two cups of this tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigelow French Vanilla Decaffinated Tea","review":"This product was very good when I began buying it but lately it is terrible. There is no taste at all. That's the reason I no longer purchase this item. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story--Amazing woman","review":"This book is unforgettable as a story of the Holocaust from the eyes of a child. I've had the pleasure of hearing Marion speak several times and she is marvelous. My students read her book this past school year and then went to see her for an author visit. They were moved to tears--even the boys--by her life during the war. Reading the book and then hearing her speak about her experiences is sobering. Her message isn't just about the Holocaust; it is also about learning tolerance and fairness which is certainly a page we can all learn from in today's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a great story of a family's courage during the Holocaust","review":"I am in 6th grade and 11 years old. I love holocaust stories better than anything and this is definitely a five star book! I have read this book and it is fabulous. Marion and her family show great courage as they fight the battle of antisemitism. I love this book and I want Marion Blumenthal to know that it has touched me very much. It was so stirring that I couldn't put it down. If you liked this book, you should read Never to be Forgotten by Beatrice Muchman. (You can order it here on Amazon.) Marion, her mother, brother and father are wonderful testimonies of strength and courage during WWII. Anyone else who has a story like this should tell it. There are to many people out there who love these stories alot, I'm one of them. Thankyou for sharing your story with us Mrs. Blumenthal!!! It is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Survival during a terrible time","review":"This is the chronicle of one family's survival during the Holocaust. Marion Blumenthal Lazan tells the story of how she and her mother, father and brother tried to flee Germany during Hitler's regime. They ultimately were taken to the Berger-Belsen concentration camp where they endured deplorable conditions of death, disease and starvation. Their ordeal lasted six and a half years.This story is such an important one to tell. It shows the strength and determination of the Blumenthals and how they clung to each other to survive during a time of horrible acts. And it shows how they made their own happiness and rebuilt their own lives in the United States after the war. Today, Lazan continues to share her experience by speaking at schools around the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chilling look at the Holocaust","review":"A great book, recommended for 6th grade and up.
