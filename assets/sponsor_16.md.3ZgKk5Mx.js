Going to the gym just does not work without my jam bands.I chose this because I absolutely DID NOT want an iPod. We receive satellite free via Dish Network and had been toying with subscribing. This seemed like the perfect solution.We had absolutely no difficulty installing ourselves, in fact, cannot believe people pay to have it installed! I purchased an additional cable for $20 at Best Buy that keeps my signal steady. MP3's are easy to load. I especially love the fact that I can record songs that I hear on the radio--a perk that hopefully the RIAA will not take away from Sirius in court.Sound quality is great (I have a really nice car stereo). The unit is solid and I have had no trouble at all with it.

The display is big, colorful and easy to read while driving. While in portable mode, it is ultra light and slim and can easily fit in my palm.There are a few things that could be better with functionality of the device but hopefully these will be addressed with future firmware upgrades. Example: if you turn off the device while you're listening to a recorded MP3 it doesn't bookmark where you were so when you turn it back on you have to navigate back to the file and start at the beginning. For single songs this is not a big deal but for those recording 2 hours blocks of various talk radio shows this could be a mild frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fatal car accident is in my future","review":"This unit was a Christmas gift. I have three main comments.1) Core programming: Excellent - 150 stations, commercial free. Needs more international music (African, Carribean, etc).

Sometime it turns on immediately, more often, the unit powers up but it can't find a signal and sits silent. Only extensive fiddling - unplug the power, plug it back in; turn the unit on and off; remove the unit from the dock and remount; and then finally, for no apparent reason, it powers up finds the signal.

The upgrades fix one problem and but create a new problem. In particular, since the 3.15 software update, just about every unit it was downloaded to has got the dreded \\"No Signal\\" problem.

It looks great but it locks up, it turns it self on and off randomly. The unit has a lot of issues recording. When you set it up to record a show some times it records sometimes it does nothing. I am on my third unit now and this unit still has a lot of issues. There is no way to backup the unit so every time you do a hard rest you lose everything off the unit. When you record songs on the S50 there is no way to play them back on the PC. If you record a talk radio show there is no way to resume were you were last listening. Fast Forward and Reverse are very slow. To Fast Forward through 1 hour of audio it takes about 10 minutes. I can go on and on.

I live in Manhatten and dont need their stupid car kit, they make it look like you can listen to the radio while you work out and are on the go but the only thing you can listen to when its off its dock is stuff you already recorded.

It tries to do too much and fails at just about everything it tries to do.What I dislike most:1. Only executes scheduled recordings half the time.2. No indexing feature to allow you to return to a specific point in a recording.3. Hard to use.4. Way less portable than they would like you to think - It must be \\"docked\\" to receive live broadcasts5. Not Commecial free. If I'm going to pay to listen, I would expect original programming to not have commercials.6. Always feels greasy. Whatever material it is made out of is impossible to use and keep clean.7. For all it does, it could have more buttons for easier access. Worded labels would've been nice too.8. Everybody I know that's bought one had to buy two before they found one that worked9.

The screen looks nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad i chose the S50 over any other choice!","review":"yes it is pricey, but the uses of this thing is well worth the extra hours of work. basically i see it as car stereo that has a detachable face plate....and usually face plates that are detached are useless....but that is where the S50 kills others cuz its actually useful away from the car dock or home dock.---no live sirius content BUT your saved sirius stuff---just as good--- i have an ipod shuffle and how mess of songs in my itunes library, but you do get tired of the music you've been collecting for all those years at some point...for being a new sirius listener i think i've broaden my music sense a million times over in the few hours i've been experiencing it. and i'm pleased to see the S50 givin it with such style.i would recomend the S50 over all the others....the only weakness i have is he S50 software prog.

Im not in the mood to hold another 6 hours so I email with no response from them. The great part for them is they are still collecting the monthly fee from me.

Don't be deceived. I bought this unit three months ago and I am now on my third replacement. The first unit I had mysteriously stopped powering on one day. After many calls to product support they sent me a new unit. The replacement unit worked fine for three weeks but apparently there is a bug in the S50 software where it gets stuck on a radio station if you take it out of the cradle before the powering it off. Again, talked witn product support and we went through resetting the sofware, doing a manual hard restart. Finally they sent me second S50 so far so good but is has just been a day. My advice is skip this unit. It is still very buggy and has many issues and is not worth the money. The sirius product support is very good and has been helpful through all these problems. If you like Sirius I would go with one of the cheaper models you will be saving yourself a lot of money and aggravation in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"S50 is horrible and overpriced","review":"I bought one of these thinking I was getting a portable satellite radio. Only to get it home and find out it's only portable as an MP3 player. You can not get sat radio unless it is docked. Terribly overpriced for what you get. I suspect it is not portable sat radio because I hear that the SIRIUS radio signal is weak.I took it back and got an XM myfi unit. Now that is what I expected true portable sat radio. Great reception. Highly recommend XM unit over SIRIUS unit.Not to mention that the XM MyFi is about 1/2 the price of the S50. I always heard tha XM had better equipment at cheaper prices than SIRIUS. I guess you live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"so far, not so good","review":"I thought it was going to be a Tivo for radio -like as advertised.

Out of the box it would not work transmitting from the docking station to my stereo receiver. Customer service is a cruel, slow, inept joke. Techs will hang up on you. You get put on hold and then are cut off. Finally talk to a human, they'll send you to warranty who will send you to somewhere else and expect to be given bad phone numbers. I got the radio for Christmas 06, and hope I can send it back to get money back. Be warned, this product can be defective, and Sirius customer service will curl your hair if it is straight and straigten it if it is curled. I've wasted hours trying to get simple answers.

I've had to remove the battery multiple times because it was frozen.If you're a Mac user, there's no software interface fo the MP3 functions.The sound quality is pretty mediocre, even with full signal strength.Given the cost (don't forget to add $100 to be able to use it at home) and the mediocre performance, don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the sevice hate the device","review":"The S50 is a piece of crap. It is not a well thought out design. Having the controls on the side...bad idea. Every time I grab the device I push a button. If you are listening to a recorded program when the device is on the cradle and pull the device off the cradle the device turns off and you have to start all over again. The rewind and forward function...If you record a show that is 2 hours long and only want to listen to the last 10 minutes you'll need to slowly and carefully rewind through the whole show 10 seconds at a time. And don't double press the button because you'll jump to the next program. It Only records 2 hours at a time not 4 hours as advertised. Too many other problems to list, but these are the ones that bug me the most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make the same mistake.","review":"I'll be brief. I have had more than unreasonable difficulty obtaining a signal through the home kit antenna. Sirius provides almost no support for this. I have had several problems with the player itself as well. Refused to power up a few times, I had to remove and replace the battery. I don't like the navigation interface. I don't like the knob on the home kit, it doesn't seem like a very solid piece of hardware. Finally, I have also had difficulty with the computer software. It hangs and gives me errors on close.I wish I could talk about the actual service, but I have not been able to listen to it at all with this device.I am returning mine and buying a home-only unit.

It's not live, you have to dock it to record. The unit I saw was boxy and clunky compared to the XM unit, which does pick up live broadcasts and costs half as much (though I suppose the price will come down).

Though the device is slick in its presentation, the proprietory SW that is required for MP3 usage is the buggiest, most unusable software I have used in years. There is freeware/shareware written better than this. Extremely difficult to re-capture memory space after files deletion (try to explain that one!), file names get munged to some encrypted format (e.g., 12akjSU73-XSE) and the 512MB limitation for MP3 is virtually unbearable - you will find yourself forever deleting and replacing music, unless of course you want to listen to the same sounds over and over again.

Even though Tuatara has made instrumental soundtrack music in the past, this new album shows how they can take that musical finesse and add vocals to it with astounding success.

Charting the careers of the most famous composers - most of whom were European and classically trained - Tony Thomas mixes both musical knowledge and an obvious affection for both the men and their creations. Thus figures such as Max Steiner, Miklos Rozsa, Alfred Newman and Erich Korngold emerge as real people rather than just names on the screen. There is no gossip but lots of insight. Essential reading for lovers of classic films and the scores that helped make them great. And especially for those films in which the music more memorable than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy incomplete","review":"No mention of John Williams, John Barry, Michelle Legrand, or Ennio Moriconne?You have to wonder why...when he has dedicated chapters to much lesser film composers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the short time it takes to read","review":"What begins as a promising look at the odd idiosyncratic reasons that people break up with each other (which actually might make an interesting book), this pamphlet quickly devolves into unorganized, often mean-spirited lists of prejudices that leave the reader empty of content.The 48 page book looks hastily thrown together, and while it can be humorous at times, usually fails to make you laugh.

Within a week and a half of using this shoe, the leather upper has already started to detach from the sole. I am not expecting anything beyond the call of duty when I buy a pair of shoes.

The main attraction consists of a recital by lyric soprano Judith Raskin. I remember her fondly from the Sixties, but here the sound is suffocatingly close and boxy, giving her voice a shrill edge that for me was unlistenable. Nor is Raskin's style very admirable, and accompanist George Schick is stiff and dull.As fillers we get the young Kiri Te Kanawa making beautiful sounds in three very familiar songs. The interpretations aren't completely a blank, and fans of Kiri will enjoy her vocalism. The remaining space is taken up with Schubert duets done by Elly Ameling and Peter Pears. Both are expert in Schubert, but Pears is in the ugliest, most curdled voice I've ever heard from him.If these deficits don't put you off, the program is rewarding and the price is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Errors!","review":"Beware!

She never quite gets to the meat and potatoes of meditation. This is a good book to read if you've never heard of meditation - not one article, not one example of the experience - an absolute beginner. Otherwise, throw this junk aside.

You may discover that you already have activities that involve meditative practices -- you may not be a raw beginner at all!The English book has gone through three covers, but retains the original interior design, which I found to be user-friendly from the beginning. Now you can carry it around on your electronic device and have it handy when you travel.

Zeppo advocates football on campus, so Harpo and Chico are recruited to kidnap the opposition's star players. In between, there are some inspired comedy sequences (including the Marxes' \\"schoolroom\\" vaudeville act) and some excellent musical performances. The harp solo is this writer's candidate for Harpo's all-time best, and Chico shoots the piano keys in a delightful rendition of \\"Collegiate.\\" Lots of fun for comedy fans. The DVD, unfortunately, is no improvement on the VHS version: every copy of \\"Horse Feathers\\" has a damaged section containing numerous splices and choppy dialogue. The damage is very brief (maybe a minute or two) and shouldn't detract from your enjoyment. The surviving master print may not be perfect, but the film itself gets a perfect score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical!","review":"The Marx Brothers are the best comedy team ever. \\"Horse Feathers\\" is on of their very finest. Listening to Groucho singing \\"I'm Against It\\" is extremely funny. It's a shame this movie isn't longer. This kind of film will cheer you up if you had a bad day. If you ever do, watch this film. It's bound to make you chortle. However, in one part of the movie, when the brothers go over to Thelma Todd's house, the film in various points jumps ahead. For instance when Groucho and Zeppo are going to leave Todd's house (Groucho stays), Groucho kicks Zeppo, than the next frame Groucho runs to the window. Try to keep up with it if you can at that point. Than there are all of these film scratches and huge bars on the screen on every frame at one point. Universal did a pretty sloppy job at trying to remaster this movie. Other than that, this film will make you split your sides laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why the Marxes made the cover of Time!","review":"Yes, back in the 30s the Marx brothers made the cover of Time magazine. And the movie still that was placed there was from Horse Feathers. And with good reason -- this is the best Marx film of the thirteen.It's an absolute shame that a full version of this movie does not exist. Apparently sometime in the 60s, the movie was released to TV, and in the interest of time considerations some of the major negative was altered and eventually lost. We are told that there is from three to ten minutes of the film that cannot be found. What a pity! This is a movie that you never want to end. Any additional minutes would be manna from Marx heaven.You will also notice some film \\"jumping\\" in the \\"make out scene\\" with Thelma Todd. These are poor splices that have been made over time, but do not detract from the final masterpiece that is Horse Feathers.What else can I say but . . . \\"Swordfish\\"!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Poor DVD","review":"If I was reviewing the movie, I would give it four stars (good as it is, the Marx Brothers did better ones) but this review is about the DVD itself.

There is a lot missing from the 1932 version of Horse Feathers, the result of cuts made directly on the negative from the late Thirties on. These aren't even well made cuts, but chops in the middle of lines, jumps and lopping off of scenes. But this footage is considered lost - so there you have it.

I feel that eventually the rest of the seasons will show up there too. Certainly, I wish that the studio would release the entire series on DVD as they certainly are making NO money holding the shows in their vaults...and if they wait much longer people are going to say \\"Dynasty WHO????\\". I think this corporation thinks it is Disney! If they were not so greedy they could sell each and every SEASON for 15.00 and STILL make a fortune.

At least 3 or 4 times throughout the play, a short story is told describing a gruesome murder, and a lot of descriptive adjectives are used to give the reader a mental picture of what is happening.

Why do we humans feel it necessary to invent fictious worlds and examine our life not through direct observation of the real but of the invented? And in a land where personal freedoms are virtually nonexistant, how long can the storyteller survive, before he is done away with by the forces of control and order?

Although the stroller does maneuver easily, the second seat has very little leg room and we could not envision it working for our babies when they were any older than 6 months. Our babies were tiny and the second seat was still cramped. Sadly there are not a lot of strollers to choose from when you have triplets.

For almost three months we have been trying to get through to the Breckenridge Company who only seem to have part time people working to solve problems. They have no suggestions other than sending the entire stroller back to them (we had discarded the box) which will take probably many weeks instead of sending a new one in exchange for the malfunctioning one.

Then the stupid thing broke! The front seat back rest bar broke and now the seat lays down into the middle seat. The middle seat already has no room as it is. This stroller is worthless. And we contacted the company back in October regarding this, and still have no resolution. It's a waste of $300.

Although it is a sturdy frame, it is way too heavy to maneuver around when all 3 kids are in it (I'm only 5'4). It would have been easier to figure this out if it was available in store but try to find a store that will stock such an item, you can't.

Great product though, with so many uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile and Solidly Built Umbrella","review":"Overall feels very solid and the shaft is solid metal. The arms seem like they can withstand some bending, the fabric is of thicker quality and has a Velcro strap to close. The end of the arms all have ball-tips rather than the needle-like ones another reviewer posted, so there's no ninja action on my version. Slipping the black cover on and off is very quick and easy - just make sure the umbrella is not extended, gently bend each arm and it pops right off.Only con is the clear plastic holder is cheap- as if it was designed to be thrown out after opening instead of a reusable holder I wish it came with. The opening of mine came torn out of the box from the workers stuffing the umbrella into it.All in all, it works great and the price is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I got this as a gift and I was very excited to get it! It might just be my version but the construction of this umbrella is very poor. The white cloth comes off the ribs too easily (you expect that of the removable black cover) and I had to re-place each pin, for lack of a better word, back in the rib where it belongs. The worst part is that after opening it for only the second time, the white material was completely unraveling at the center of the umbrella and there's a gaping hole there.It's been babied, not man-handled so care wasn't the issue at all.I would recommend seeing a product like this in person so you can examine the construction quality. You want it to last more than a couple of times (literally)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice umbrella","review":"I think Westcott makes very nice products.

Instead I view this production of CARPET CRAWLERS against today's music scene. It is an amazing well produced version of CARPET CRAWLERS by the full team of BANKS RUTHERFORD COLLINS HACKETT & GABRIEL, and an almost sad reminder of how great a band GENESIS was at full strength. If only GENESIS could only have put out an entire album of such material, in the rock landscape as it is now, they would be leagues above everything else that's around right now. It would have been worth the wait for those of us who have been waiting close to 20 years now for a return to form from this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"This updated version of Carpet Crawlers reminds the listener how great Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel sound together. Their voices compliment each other perfectly. As for the music, it's just okay. There are too many electronic sounds that are less music than sound effects. Still, it's enjoyable and does make you wish they'd all get back together and do one more album. As for the lame Gabriel vs. Collins arguments of some other reviewers, every Genesis album has something great on it and this sad belief that if Gabriel had stayed in Genesis, they would have kept making music like they did in 1971-1974 is just pathetic. And it actually is possible to like all lineups of the group."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book of paper Quilling: Techniques & Project","review":"This book is #1I own 10 Quilling books, This book offers a variety of projects.

In my personal taste, most organ players, I have heard suffers for being slightly slower than I would have liked, but in the case of Newman, it seems that he is just testing himself to see how fast he can play. Now, if Newman makes another CD with the speed between this CD and what is considered to be the average speed, then I would gladly pay 10$ for such CD; for example, Toccata and Fugue in D minor he plays in 7:10. The \\"average\\" speed would be around 8:40 for that piece, and if he played \\"a bit slower\\" (say, at 8 minutes) then at that point the music could be enjoyable.

The phrasing is amateurish, the technique mediocre, the sense of structure practically non-existent. The weird thing is that for all the talk of virtuosity, Newman's playing and technique are pretty mediocre. Maybe it is the speed. If he slowed down, maybe he could play accurately and phrase musically. Or maybe not; it is not clear how musical a musician he really is.

I own, and have read the 1836 edition of this book. I believe the first edition was quite popular in it's day, and sold thousands of copies. While the Catholic Church, as well as Protestant churches were certainly deserving of some negative sentiments in those days, Monk was later exposed as a fraud. It should not be taken as fact, but can be used to bring about interesting discussions in religious history courses. Presumeably, the current reprint will be used for that purpose. The book is analogous to the Enquirer Magazine of today. It's not the kind of book I would want to be seen purchasing. I bought mine from a rare book store by mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull and painful read","review":"I had high hopes for this book. The subject matter promised to be fascinating and enlightening. After all no one really knows if Queen Elizabeth ever named James VI of Scotland her heir. Most accounts state that the dying Elizabeth when asked who she named as her heir simply raised her fingers over her head indicating James.I was really looking forward to reading Leanda de Lisle's account of Elizabeth's final days and how Mary Queen of Scot's son, James of Scotland, found himself crowned King of England. Unfortunately, this book bored me to tears and forced me to resort to skimming just to get through it. The book lacked organization. The author jumped from one topic to another and then back again. The writing was all over the place. If you're looking for a great source on James I's accession, look elsewhere. This book is a snooze."},{"rating":"2","title":"unsteady was the crown","review":"the transition from queen elizabeth the first to james of scotland was a difficultone. at first,it was not clear (who?)and there were other \\"contenders\\". there were many people scheming in the background. what a cast of characters-can i say soap opera?it does not get any more thrilling than this! leanda de lisle's book cuts to the chase and delves into the complexity of this time in history. her writing style is easy to read and understand. this book is one of the best on this subject and it has nice color illustrations divided into two sections. a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and Informative","review":"I have to say, I was pleased with the writing style and information provided in the book After Elizabeth.

I could not immerse myself in it and often found myself putting the book down out of boredom so that it took me much longer to read than many longer histories I've read in the past.I believe the main problem is that the author condenses too many characters in the space without rounding the characters out; I do not find myself interested in them because they appear wooden...not enough insight into their personalities and not enough color given to their backgrounds. I feel the author's past as a journalist has influenced her here. She can write volumes of information, but it doesn't seem to engage the reader on a deeper lever than a newspaper story might.I enjoy Christopher Hibbert and Alison Weir more. They convey complex historical events with a gift for giving the reader a feeling for the time and they have an ability to communicate characters on more of a flesh-and-blood level. Too bad.

Pinkola Estes and Myss make a wonderful, magical combination. However, Dr. Myss is getting pedantically infatuated with herself, to the point that she has become her own self parody and worst archetype. It is finally becoming clear in her recent presentations that she enjoys ridiculing her audience and that she uses her sharp tongue and mind to belittle our shortcomings and fears. Intuition and the Mystical Life could have been a great edition, but Dr Myss's input did not help Dr. Pinkola Estes' great contribution. I feel sorry for Myss and wish that her guardian angel would rescue her from herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nurturing with a shadow...","review":"I had heard of C.Pinkola-Estes and C. Myss prior to purchasing this CD. I've never gravitated towards Myss' work so I didn't expect a huge message from her contribution to this collaboration. Despite the jarring and borderline arrogant remarks from Myss, there are many messages that are offered and highlighted in this CD. Estes has a natural inclination to draw reference to the popular and personal experience. Myss shares lots of personal experience and often supports her opinions with the preface \\"To me...\\". I want to give this 5 stars but I'm thwarted by Myss' brass tone of voice and almost similarly choice of language. I think it's worth a purchase and the consumer could benefit from the message once he/she can get past the messenger...seeing \\"between the worlds\\" so to speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best and Only Book on EMF","review":"This is the best and only work on the Eclipse Modeling Framework, which is the code generation engine built into the Eclipse IDE.

Just look at poems as diverse as \\"The Valley of the Shadow,\\" \\"Eros Turannos,\\" \\"The Mill,\\" and \\"Aunt Imogen.\\" Or you could look at his three most famous poems, the poems that we know Robinson for: \\"Richard Cory,\\" \\"Reuben Bright,\\" and \\"Miniver Cheevy.\\" I don't need to tell you why you need to read Robinson, that should be evident already. Mezey's edition is a great one because it is an inexpensive edition that contains the best poems by Robinson--and notes to many of them. There are also three appendices. One contains various quotes from Robinson himself as well as a brief selection of comments by other poets and critics on Robinson.

Though Robinson's poetry flows in a lyrical way - it has a tendancy for ending in some dismal image such as a suicide (Richard Cory). Sure it is refreshing that he's not writing that everything is so wonderful like some poets do. However I am rather turned off by the poets who have some sort of rhyming scheme to their poetry. I much prefer Emily Dickinson - short, simple, powerful. I find myself distracted reading Robinson where as when I read Dickonson I can find myself wholely absorbed in the poetry. Some of the images portrayed in his poetry (New England in particular) are rather disturbing and making me think that his own life and feelings often seeped into his work.

Robinson uses the ultimate irony as he writes of Cory's nobility, and then describes the death of regality when \\"[richard] Went home and put a bullet through his head.\\" All in all, Robinson is a profoundly dark and probably a personally demented writer.

Second, once the dinosaur hatches, it's nothing but a slimy mess. The colors run all over the place, so that the features are completely indistinguishable. And the shape is just a big blob.

It is obvious that Pius XII was not an anti-Semite who collaborated in the destruction of the Jews - but that is a popular topic today and it sells.

BTW I am not Catholic, so I have no interest or particular reason to defend Pius XII. The argumentation of the book is poor and the evidence very selective. Cornwell ignored the mass of evidence that sustained the contrary thesis, and the reasons that led Pius to use a soft policy for helping the Jews (Hitler reacting with more persecution when the pope would condemn antisemitism strongly, and Hitler's becoming full of hate just by hearing the word \\"Jew\\".)

He then tries to strain a \\"hidden\\" anti-Semitism out of obscure comments by Pius XII; for example, a 1919 statement about an anti-Catholic, communist mob in Germany led by a Jewish leader. The leader was in fact Jewish and the future Pius XII offers no criticism whatsoever of the leader's ethnic or religious background.So bizarre is this hatchet-job on Pius XII that Cornwell blames the future pope for starting World War I!Accept the book for what it is: a bitter attack by an ex-Catholic on the church he now despises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cornwell's View","review":"A relatively easy read. The chronology is rather loose and jumps around more than I cared for. Certain positive issues and programs sponsored by the Vatican are ignored.

Cornwell apparently wants to cash in on the current Holocaust bandwagon, for, despite his claims to the contrary, he has done little original research, but has simply built a circumstantial case largely on conjecture and distortion. He counts upon his readers' ignorance of the topic, or their preconceptions, to carry his argument. It certainly fails to stand on its own.

This book starts off with a cover that is misleading, showing Cardinal Pacelli leaving a reception for von Hindenburg, in 1927. With scholarship so poor, if this was a PhD thesis, it could not be defended. Pacelli was spoken of by the Nazis as the \\"Jew-loving\\" cardinal (because of his friendship with the Jewish communities), and Pacelli thought that Hitler was thoroughly wicked. The Nazis were ruthless to those who opposed them, and they knew that the Catholic Church was opposed to them. The only way to resist was to go underground, which the Papacy had to do to save as many Jews as they were able. This does not discount those Catholics who were Nazis or collaberated with the Nazis, but anyone who paid attention to the words of Cardinal Pacelli/Pius XII knew what Catholics ought to do.

It also contours with your hand reasonably well.In all, this a great invention & tool for correcting written mistakes in a quick and easy way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liquid Paper Dryline Grip Correction Tape","review":"It works, but things seem to get jammed up or clogged near the applicator sometimes. It works better than some of the others on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking view of Latino History","review":"The Trial of Davy Crockett offers more than simply a must for Texas history buffs. In this novella, based in fact, author Fletcher Rhoden examines a dynamic character in Santa Anna and in so doing allows the reader a compelling account of Mexican history at a time when that country was shrinking under American expansionism. A subject all too often ignored by many American historians. The character of Davy Crockett does not wane in the shadow of Santa Anna. Written in a style so unique and intelligent, the reader cannot help but to keep turning the page. Santa Anna has become a sort of ogre in American eyes because of the slaughter at the Alamo and the brutality of the massacre at Goliad. The author's presentation of this dynamic historical period through the eyes of Santa Anna, definately gives the reader a thought provoking view of Latino History."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised","review":"I bought these under the assumption that it was a 6pak as advertised.Much to my surprise I received one item.

It was that good! With every page you read, you just have to know what happens next.

I'm sure that many readers want the two to end up together, but Cooney recognizes that although Annie loves the century Strat lives in, she can not run away and escape from her problems and responsibilities in the 20th century.

Cooney's books, and this, is not what I would showcase as her best. The characters and situations were sort of thrown at the reader, and little background was given. You were just supposed to feel what the emotions of the characters were on your own.She did compare the ideals of the present day to the past frequently. Annie, the main character, wants to live in the past because she would have less responsobilties, but at the same time wants woman rights. I think this shows how much society has changed.Unfortunatley, I don't believe she was going after politcal views, but where her true focus was is still kind of blurry. Her descriptions were vague, and characters were sort of tossed around like salad condiments. Throwing in scenes here and there, just overall making it confusing and uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST!","review":"Out of Time was a great book!

Eventhough I believe in Kevin's message I think he fell short when it came to specifics. The Diamond's did a much better job in that area.

I give this 1 star because my 2-year old would not watch it at all despite it saying it is appropriate for 2-6 year olds. An older child may find it more interesting.

I though it would be great for the car, but it is only interesting to a very young baby (and even then my son found it boring) and unless you have the car seat with the overhead pull down bar, you have to attach this to the car seat straps EVERY time before you go out. In addition, the strap secures are not very secure and if you were in an accident, it would be a potentially heavy projectile. Not enough to do to stay entertained.

She gets very fussy in her carseat, but loves stimulation such as lights and movement. So, we thought this would do the trick. The songs are about 15 seconds, it sits on the infant's lap (so she has to look down to be entertained, which most newborns will not know to do), the lights that blinks go back for forth a few times so my newborn is entertained for all of 10 seconds. When she is older, I still don't think this toy would be interesting or stimulating enough for her to want to activate and play with. This also does not fit across the carrier or tray table. It's very small and inconvenient for strollers and carriers.The reason we gave it 2 stars is because the remote is a great idea while driving so you can activate it. We just need a better toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Boring","review":"My son never played with this - not once.

It is a pain to affix to his lapbelt in the carseat and I couldn't get the remote to affix anywhere in my car either. When I tried letting him play with it in the house, he wouldn't go near it. This was a great idea for a toy (with the remote), but it's essentially a big pillow that sings the same, repititive song with a little stuffed animal attached to the side (which is also too hard for babies to pull off).

When it arrived from Amazon, I read through it to ensure it was the right kind of book to give as a gift. It was moving and beautiful. Having recently lost my father, the message of loss and acceptance was bittersweet and definitely drew my tears, making me wonder if it would be an inappropriate gift. But reading this as a child could be the kind of early preparation that could make it easier for people to accept great loss (as well as smaller disappointments) later in life. I remember gaining that kind of value as a child from books like \\"The Velveteen Rabbit.\\" If that kind of message is something you'd like to expose your kids to gently, this is a wonderful book for that purpose.More than that, though, it's beautifully illustrated, and the repetition within the story seems like a comforting device for many children."},{"rating":"2","title":"a loving fan","review":"This wonderful book is not well known.

He was written with all the insecurities of any human. His emotions held a wide range. I especially loved his interactions with his wife's children.

Ms. Blair has a way with words, and I intend to read all of her books.I would suggest that one might enjoy the books even more (if that's at all possible) by reading them in order, if for no other reason than characters show up across the collection. I read #2 first, then #3, and finally #1 and lastly #4. I would have enjoyed #2 more if I had read #1 first because of the glimpses of the character there which would show up more strongly in the succeeding book.

If the author had shown the heroine's hard life up front, instead of dribbling it out along the way, I might have felt more compassion for her. As it was, I found the fact that she began her marriage by wanting to take everything she needed from it without considering her too-good-to-be-real new husband's needs selfish beyond extreme. She was lucky-as-heck to even find someone to marry her (and her household) while throughout the book she remained non trusting and non truthful . Actually, I did not see much difference between her and the conniving mistress. The husband's, Demon/Rapscallions', and pets' humor saved this from being a total loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Enjoyed reading this book. To me if I stay up all nlght to read a book just to see how it come out, I know it a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Regency Romance","review":"This was the first Annette Blair novel I've read, but it won't be the last. It's not too sugar-y sweet and not so very dark either. Sometimes the heroine, Sabrina, makes dumb decisions over trust issues, but it comes right in the end. Look forward to reading more of Ms. Blair's novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud","review":"I don't want to spoil the story so I'll just comment...The ability to describe situations that make the reader just laugh out loud is a true gift. Loved the story and the little humor mixed in. Annette Blair is a new author for me and I'm looking forward to reading more of her style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I caught this book as a free Kindle read. It was a great story and I got so caught up in the characters and the author's writing, that I bought everyone of the other Rogue books in the series. Here's hoping that there are more Rogues to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, really?","review":"I got this book because of the 5 star comments. Now I am sorry I didn't listen to the more objective comments. I am so sorry I got this book. The writing style was awful! I tried my best to stick it out hoping it would get better but by chapter 4 I knew it was a lost cause. Take my advice and don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I couldn't put it down. Although, the rogue seems almost a little too perfect in that he fell in love with someone he hardly knew very quickly. Otherwise, this is a good story. The end came a little too abruptly. You knew chaos was coming, but it came only in the last couple pages. I truly felt for the rogue at the end of the book. I would highly recommend this read. I might even read it again. Not that it really matters- but I hate the cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Undeniable Rogue","review":"I enjoyed reading this and all the other 'Rogue' books. The idea of soldiers making a battlefield pledge to care for each others families touched me and made the reading of each subsequent book a requirement.

He was filled with self doubt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read...","review":"Another great book from Annette Blair. Somewhat of a tear jerked though. Wonderful characters and interesting plot, however a little frustrating at times amidst all of the deceit and mistrust between the characters. All in all it was a splendid book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeniably bad","review":"Obviously, I'm in the minority, but this book was achingly bad. The writing was plodding and predictable, and I felt no connection to the characters. Despite being free, it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starting at Happily Ever After","review":"This is my new favorite regency romance! I love the fact that it starts with happily ever after instead of ending there! It's a beautiful story of how two sincere people with abusive pasts learn to trust and love each other. The author is skilled at \\"showing\\" rather than \\"telling\\" and her literary techniques really set the moods. Love is a verb...if you give it to others and set it free, it will fly back to you. I fell in love with the characters because their feelings and behaviors were so authentic and real. Throw in a couple of steamy scenes in the marriage bed (including some without intercourse because of Gideon's promise) and a really slimy bad guy, and you've got the perfect book! I will be reading more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, excellent story!","review":"I have been reading romance novels for nearly 40 years - this has straightaway become one of the few that are highly memorable. Here we have a woman who has been betrayed and abused by the very men in her life she, by rights, should have been able to rely on without reservation. With two children and another on the way, she agrees to marry a man of means she has never met and believes to be elderly. Of course, he is not, although he has agreed to this marriage because it was a deathbed wish of a war comrade. How this couple come together as man and wife, how they all come together as a family, is one of the more moving stories I've read in a very, very long time. Ms. Blair is an author worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt Story of Romance, Love and the Special Bonds of Family!","review":"I read all Annette Blair's books, and Undeniable Rogue is a favorite. Set in Regency England, it is full of her trademark humor, warmth and lovable characters. The hero, Giddeon St. Goddard, is a kind-hearted rogue who turns a group of misfits into a family. The ending satisfies and lingers long after the book is closed, with a surprise thrown in for good measure. This is a story you will devour and at the end be left with a warm, happy feeling. A must for all Annette Blair fans, and for those of you who haven't yet experienced her books, what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST Regency Romance Writers Around!","review":"Annette Blair is one the most talented Regency romance writers on the market today. AN UNDENIABLE ROGUE is a quick, easy read with a fast-paced plot that kept me on my toes. As a hero, Giddeon St. Goddard is a kind-hearted rogue who turns a group of misfits into a family. The ending satisfies and lingers long after the book is closed, with a surprise thrown in for good measure. AN UNDENIABLE ROUGE entertains with laughter, tears and love and celebrates of the importance of family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely from cover to cover and found it hard to put it down. I can't wait to read more books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable romp with a twist","review":"Annette Blair creates memorable characters, and in this historical the heroine comes with lots of baggage--twins and a baby on board! I don't recall any other romance novel where the heroine is pregnant with another man's baby. The hero is honor-bound to marry her due to a war-time, death-bed promise, and what ensues is fraught with humor and a good bit of tension until we discover all the heroine's secrets. I read this over the course of a weekend and enjoyed every minute, and then couldn't wait to download the next book in the series. I'm eagerly awaiting the upload of #3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I am not normally a romance reader, thinking the characters generally lack comman sense, but I read the reviews and gave it a go. I was hooked from the onset. I really liked the characters and cared for them. It had good sensual scenes without being too graphic. It also contained characters with morality and principles and I will gladly purchase any following books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst ever!","review":"I only downloaded this because it was free and struggled to finish it. It really was one of the worst romances I have ever read. I am a fan of rakes and rogues and I expected the hero to be a rogue. He was not a rogue, he was a milquetoast weakling, and that was a turnoff. The opening scene when he falls for her reads unrealistic in the extreme. The characters were not fully fleshed out and the story was flat because of it. I didn't want them to end up together. I wanted the hero to grow a spine and ditch the wretched heroine for someone more deserving of his protection and kindness. However, not before years of therapy and self esteem seminars. I will not be continuing this trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeniably Bad","review":"First, I'd like to vent for a moment about the title \\"Undeniable Rogue.\\" That title leads you to believe that the hero will be a rogue of some sort. Hardly. He's not nearly that exciting.I found the whole premise of this book unbelievable. Furthermore, every exchange between the H/h seems to be motivated by lust. While that's not necessarily bad thing if some other connection between the H/h exists (see Madeline Hunter's books for example), when it appears to be the ONLY connection between the H/h, then there's a problem.Unfortunately, that's all that I can really remember about this book, which I only read a few days ago. That, I'm afraid, says more about the quality of \\"Undeniable Rogue\\" than anything else I could write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good","review":"I was extremely bored with this book. It sounded so promising and based on so many excellent reviews I could not believe it was just that bad. Things were downplayed that should have been elaborated on such as how much she was abused, yes it was mentioned but not to the point that you could relate to why she acted like a selfish greedy intolerable person. I was sick of them whining over each other pretty early on in the book. The plot was there which is why I gave it a 2. I won't be reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful, amateurish","review":"To say that this is dreadful, amateurish writing gives it more praise than it deserves.The main characters are both totally unbelievable. The initial premise is good (the first few paragraphs and as far as I got in the rest of the book before giving up seem like they were written by two different people, one talented and one not.)I'm returning this to Amazon even though it cost 0 dollars, to make a point,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is an awesome beginning to a series about rogues that are bound to become classics of the genre. Blair is a talented author in whatever time frame she takes on, and she just keeps getting better. If you think this was great, you should try The Scot, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hero to die for!","review":"I loved it!!! The characters were wonderful. Some scenes warmed my heart, others made me laugh. The sexual tension between Sabrina and Gideon sizzled, and the children were adorable. In my opinion, any man who's willing to take on a ready-made family is a hero is to die for!I couldn't put it down.Thanks, Annette for a great read. I'll looking forward to the next book in your Rogue series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't complete it.","review":"I tried, I really did. I read some of the reviews after giving up on this story and really wish I could read it.Maybe if I had it in paperback where I could flip-through the pages and get past all the unrealistic fondling of a women with two kids, one on the way and who was supposedly abused by someone.This women isn't going to fall in bed eight-months pregnant and innocently grasp his, well you know, and ask him if she can help and then act like she doesn't know what she's doing. I mean please.I hate when they come out of the 'holding pen'(first few chapters) already physically familiar with each other when they don't even know one another.As far as grammar and punctuation; I personally don't care unless it's a story set back in the days of the knights and someone pops off with 'Do ya think' or 'that's really cool'. I have come across some like that.Well, back to the book list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another delightful and engaging winner from Annette Blair!","review":"An Undeniable Rogue by Annette Blair is delightful. The characters are engaging and the dialogue is sparkling and sexy by turns. Annette Blair has raised the bar for the Historical Regency. The hero, Gideon, is a rogue in need of reformation. It's hilarious when he finds his intended bride, Sabrina, pregnant and operating a homeless shelter out of his London town house. I really respect a man who is willing to wait to see what happens next! I love the motley group of people Sabrina collects and the way they all become a family. The love story is charmingly told and the secondary characters are well written and fascinating in their own right.I read this book in one night! I just couldn't put it down and I can't wait to read another book by Annette Blair. I enjoy the way she puts together a sentence, and a plot, and you will too.

I disliked both the female and the male characters because they are too lame and poorly shaped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Lets get to the boring and stupid point of the whole book, Gideon is the “Rogue�?sissy boy duke who meets & instantly falls in love with Sabrina. Sabrina is pregnant with another mans child yet all Gideon can focus on is her “pregnancy glow�?& “curvaceous figure�? It gets even sillier, although she has been previously abused, she hides her past, denies him his marital rights & two 4 year old twins going on 20 later the so called rogue is a doormat of a man who is so infatuated with a woman who is just a plain bitch he allows her to do as she pleases. Gideon only finds out in the last chapter the truth to her past all along she appears conniving, a liar, & is mistrustful yet non of this is enough to gest sissy boy to rogue up.

Aside from the more abstract Dance Rhapsody 2 which is quite good, Ormandy has little sympathy for the Delius idiom. The slow section of In a Summer Garden is insensitive at this fast tempo, and phrasing is stiff and unyielding in the other works. Ormandy favors thick, pasty sounds, and revels not in the potential for Delius magic. This is certainly not a Delius recording I would recommend. although the VW is decently done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must!","review":"Lore has it that this is the only time Garbo appears as a bleached blonde. This is one of my favorite films of all time & contains one of the sexiest love scenes I have ever seen - one passionate kiss that ranks in the top five kisses on film that I have ever seen. A MUST see for the Garbo or any period film fan. Yes she is the Drama Queen and overplays every line but no one does it as well as Garbo matter of fact her over-acting is refreshing in the face of all the under-acting we see nowadays. This film will surely be out of print soon so order it NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm nuts about Garbo. I've seen 16 Garbo films, including 3 of the Silents. This was by far the least interesting I've yet seen. Typically, Garbo's mere presence makes a movie worthwhile, but this is an exception. It's odd to see Garbo as a blonde in the beginning of the film, but she is her usual alluring self. Unfortunatly, as the movie progresses, the plot stalls and Garbo's character is passive and uninteresting. It's not HER acting that disappoints; It's the dull plot and bored Melvyn Douglas as Garbo's hubby. Even if you love Garbo, this is still a movie you can miss or wait until it shows up on Turner Classic Movies. For an early Garbo talkie unexpected treat, try \\"Romance\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased","review":"I received this product in a timely manner and it was in great condition, I am very satisfied.

It can keep a hot beverage at temperature for hours during the day in an office setting. It also keeps the cold beverages very cold for almost the same amount of time. I've yet to experience a leak with the product as long as it isn't overfilled passed the rubber gasket.

Best of all, it fits in the cup holder in my early 90's car...that's pre-big gulp days, people. I have to give great compliments to the feel and usability of it. The metal canister itself feels nice and sturdy, and it honestly does not feel like a thermos...just a fancy insulated coffee cup to go.

The coffee doesn't necessarily stay piping hot, but it does remain warm enough to enjoy throughout the day.The reasons for taking off one star is because the liquid does not stay as hot as I'd like, but mostly because it leaks! Originally, I had hoped to drink my coffee directly from the Thermos, but occasionally it will leak and occurs more often than not. Being in business attire, I cannot afford to have these occasional leaks threatening to get on my shirt.

This thing has a flip top lid that does not leak and is vacuum insulated (air does not conduct heat or cold) to keep your beverages cold or hot. I fill it up and literally put it inside my bag sideways and have 0 worries about leaks. It does not condense w/cold liquids and is cool to the touch w/hot coffee inside.

Although there was some concern of this thermos leaking, I thought that was unlikely. Initially, my daughter LOVED the thermos, she said that is keeps her drinks hot all day and it was perfect for her; however, I now know I should have listened to the reviews because the thermos has started sporadically leaking. The first time it leaked, she was wearing a white top and the thermos leaked hot chocolate on the front of her. She thought that maybe she didn't tighten the top correctly. Since then, she has used it a few more times (being a bit more careful) and it still leaks randomly, not sure why.

I never worried about a smell or trouble cleaning this one, even though some of the reviews said different. We tried it for a few days and found almost immediately it leaked from under the band where the top screws on.Cleaning wasn't a problem and no noticeable smell.The leaking was awful though.

The only complaint (if it even is one) is that it keeps your drink VERY hot so if it goes in scalding hot the drink will stay scalding. Anyway, I work at a school and almost all the teachers have it... we have so many that we've put color coded tape around then so they don't get mixed up. I had bought one for my mother and then I just bought one for my father because he was jealous. The brown, silver and smoke are all great colors.

It keeps drinks hot or cold longer than any other thermos I know. I have left hot coffee in a below zero car for 8 hours and come back to coffee that was drinkably warm. You actually have to be careful when you fill this with hot beverages because they will stay HOT much longer than you expect. I have burned myself drinking coffee that had been in this thermos for an hour or two. I have never had this thermos leak on me no matter how much I toss it around. I don't think you're supposed to but I have put both the thermos and lid through the dishwasher with no issues.After about 7 years of heavy use the button that you push to open the lid broke. I called customer service and they mailed me a new lid for (I think) about $7+ shipping. If they hadn't I would gladly have bought another thermos.

The rest of my family bought their thermoses (Off brand) off of QVC and within 4 months theirs were peeling and looking terrible. They work good, but look bad. The only time I have had mine leak is when I have over filled it. When that happens I take the top off, dump a little out until it's just bellow the line on the inside. I then shake the excess water from the top and screw it back on. No more leaking. Usually it will leak on me if I try to fit in just one more piece of ice that I know I should not have put in anyways. Over the years that I have had this I can not tell you how many times I was so thankful to have bought this, and think it has been one of my best purchases ever. I can say though, is that I do only use mine for Ice water, as all these different types of thermoses the tops are too difficult to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thermos","review":"This thermos is the best out there!

I think not!","review":"I take coffee with me to work every day, so about a year ago I purchased this pretty expensive thermos/travel mug. I looked it over really carefully when I bought it. There was a rubber gasket in addition to a rubber protruding \\"nipple\\" to keep liquid locked inside. It is in fact Thermos brand (cobranded with Nissan Stainless), which is generally pretty reliable. Of course, there was also the cool brushed metal look of it. But now, it leaks! I could fill it up way below that special \\"fill to line\\" and it could still be soaking wet by the time I get to work. The worst part about it though is how unpredictable it is. This morning I wouldn't have guessed that it would leak at all, but I make it to work and unpack my lunch and all my little ziploc sandwich bags are swimming. So, for anyone considering purchasing one of these, I recommend you think it over carefully before you do. At the very least, hang on to that lifetime limited warranty sheet. You'll need it!

It can keep coffee too hot to drink for up to 4 hours, so make sure your coffee is not too hot when you fill the mug! It does not leak at all even upside down in a backpack. It is easy to operate with one hand and a perfect size for virtually all cup holders. It is very durable. I've dropped mine on concrete several times without a scratch. It seems nearly indestructible, but should anything happen to it, it comes with a 5 year guarantee.

I have only used it for hot liquids, but I've filled my coffee at 6:30 AM and it's still hot by noon (about the time coffee should have been gone). This also causes one to drink less coffee because it's still so hot and it has a small hole to let out the liquid that you end up having the same 16 ounces of coffee for quite some time.

When I go somewhere (away from my coffee pot) for more than an hour, I generally need to bring along two of these.They rarely have leaked, but it does happen, and it usually tends to be when I've filled them too close to the top, put the top on in a hurry (maybe misaligned or not tightly), or when I've just washed the lid without drying it and the rings were dripping wet. When I put these in my shoulder bag, I stick them in a big plastic ziploc bag just in case. Most of the time I find no leaking has occurred but once in while, I find some drips of coffee.

But worse, for me, was thae dropping of the mug. They say it is practically indestructable, but if you drop it on a hard floor and the bottom, or some of the plastic breaks, it will then leak, dribble, and destroy your clothes, books, etc. I have purchased a new travel mug, and hope to never drop it...I wanted the more expensive model, but there were none of that model available.

It keeps my coffee hot for hours and hours, and has been totally leak-proof except for one time when I filled it a little too high and the liquid got into the space where the lid screws on and eventually dribbled out a little bit, but that was my own fault. My only complaint is about the flip top. When I'm driving, I would much rather have something that twists open with one hand, and doesn't obstruct my vision so much when I'm taking a sip. For this reason, I usually wait until I get to work to drink my coffee. Also, you can't push the button and let the lid fly open or coffee may fly off of the blue stopper inside the lid. As long as you open it gently, you won't have a problem. That also makes it a little more difficult to deal with while driving.

I could spot about fourteen different mistakes on the first half an hour of reading this book,For example, in page 51 he says that Thomas Boss joined James Purdey, while we know from Donald Dallas's book -which preceded this book by several years- that Boss never joined Purdey but was rather a worker for the trade and did work by commision for all the gunmskers including Purdey.And so like mistakes on Frederick Beesley, Holland, Woodward, Manton and Scott sections.

They are all solid late mono and early stereo recordings of the standard repertoire, sometimes by famous conductors like Adrian Boult and Pierre Monteux, but more often by lesser-known maestros like Vladimir Golschmann and Felix Prohaska. Here we have the latter two leading the Vienna State Opera Orchestra in some of Mendelssohn's most magnificent works -- the \\"Italian\\" and \\"Reformation\\" Symphonies (4 & 5), excerpts from \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" and a really strong Violin Concerto with Mischa Elman.

Bowling is just click where you want the ball to start and then nothing. Then there is a game that you avoid falling objects that you can barely see. One that has like a butterfly net that you have to catch little blips on the screen that is too hard to get your pen to register when you click on them and then they are gone.The funnest part of this, which really isn't, is picking and choosing different arms, legs and faces for spongebob and then you get to watch him dance.

But it name more victims' names than the predators' names. And I found that disturbing. There are too many chapters that are copied from Michael Gross's \\"Beautiful women and ugly business\\". Mr. Gross's book is a good read. \\"Shut up and smile\\" is not. It is a waste of time, many references other than the copy from Gross's book are public informations.It is said that you can't judge a book by its appearance. But for this book, you can. Most pictures of the cover as well as inside the book are not of right proportion. And if an author and publisher are serious about a book, they will take good care of the looks. It may not be glamorous book cover but you can at least get the picture right! Also, the author is supposed to be under-cover. Why bother showing his pictures in the books?

I reccomend this book to anybody who wants to know the truth about being a model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind The Scenes In The World Of Supermoding","review":"The book stresses the sometimes ugly side of the glamorous business of modeling. An inside look at the sacrafices made by each aspiring model to try and reach the top, and the downfall that transfires. However, the layout can be confusing. Chapters are combined with top model's drug addictions, anarexia, and then jump to the successful stories of Stella Mcartney and the late Gianni Versace. Overall, this book is for people familiar with the business, interested in knowing the grisly details of the world beneath the designer clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable","review":"This has got to be at the top of all fashion books.

It has its great moments and overall the playing and singing are very good. Ben Heppner stands out well among the soloists. But the interpretation doesn't really bring any new insights, and in a market of dozens of Ninths it is merely average. I was also somewhat disappointed with the sound which seemed a bit recessed and definitely not up to the standards I have come to expect from Berlin. I had trouble hearing some of the detail. If you are searching for a Ninth you may want to check out Charles Mackerras/Royal Liverpool Philharmonic on EMI, Gunter Wand on RCA, either of Bernstein's readings on DG, or Sinopoli's recent Dresden recording on DG."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superlative--even the definitive--version of the 9th","review":"This version of the 9th is astonishingly good, eliciting the very best performances from both orchestra and singers. Music of this sublime inspiration and energy -- like many other works of Beethoven -- requires no ornamentation. And yet, too often Beethoven falls prey to conductors who overplay his music, marring and misrepresenting it with excess -- in tempo, intensity and overall interpretation. This recording is a decidedly welcome change, refreshingly clean and crisp. And, the singing is magnificent --Heppner and Terfel in particular. There is simply no better version of this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect performance","review":"I have looked everywhere for a satisfactory recording of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, and this is the only one that has met my expectations for this very special composition.

But there were some serious inaccuracies here. The one that bothered me most was the photo of a kitten tangled in string, titled \\"if you provide your cats with enough stimulation . . .\\" Many cat books warn against letting cats play with string or thead as it can cause serious damage passing through the intestines if swallowed. After having to cut a cat free from a big tangle of string, I am careful not to leave it around anymore. In general the book had some good information, but not much of it.

It isn't full of cute pictures, just good information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat Care Redefined","review":"I got a little black kitten a few months ago.

He's also gone new age with \\"Euphoria\\" but don't let that lead you to believe that's what this CD is all about. Listen to, in my opinion, one of the best tracks, \\"Forbidden Love\\" with the bass cranked up and your head will be moving to & 'fro throughout the jam!!

I have great respect for Earl Klugh finding exceptional young talent. Since I am not able to go this year I wanted to hear Culbertson. His piano abilities are excellent. I was not expecting that there would be any singing on this CD. To me that distracted from it as I was looking for background music. If you want only background music choose another of his CD - it is well worth listening to him play his piano. If you don't mind a little singing mixed in this CD is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title speaks for itself!!!!!!!!!

It worked as advertised and was much cheaper than Canon's model. A month ago, it stopped working. The issue is at the top of the base, the plastic has separated keeping the battery module from inserting correctly. Opteka has no listed service number to call. After sending multiple e-mails to the service e-mail that they have listed on their Internet site with no response, I have all but given up hope to have it serviced. What good is a year warranty, if you can not contact the company to have it honored? I would caution anyone from purchasing an Opteka product because IF you have trouble with it, you WILL have trouble getting it fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine didn't work, but I was able to return for a full refund!","review":"With all the good reviews and a great price compared to OEM, I really wanted this product to work for me. Unfortunately, new batteries just wouldn't work after only about 10 shots or so. It was even worse if I used the AA battery adapter. Coundn't get off more than one or two shots. Glad to hear that it's worked for other folks, butI can't give it a better rating.To the credit of the supplier, I was able to return it for a full refund without any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Canon Part, it is worth it.","review":"I purchased this battery grip on december 15 and one of the buttons did not work out of the box. The rubber grip is also not very well glued and constantly needs to be smoothed out. I was willing to live with this stuff because the price is good and I had read of similar complaints in the other reviews. But the one problem I didn't find out about until recently is that it misreads the battery levels and causes the camera to shut down while the batteries still have enough charge to operate it. It also disrupts the use of the other Auto Focus button on the camera while the grip is turned on. I have since purchased the canon part and the Quality difference is immense in favor of the BG-E3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runs on one battery, mind the off switch.","review":"Fine product. I've had this battery grip for five months with no problems. I use a hand strap and I've been shooting without a vertical camera grip for years, so I've gotten accustomed to, and prefer, using the buttons on top of the camera. But the grip is still useful for extended battery life, camera feel, and looks. Double battery life is great, but you can load just one and have normal shoot time. There is a switch to activate the grip buttons. If you leave it on, it will drain the batteries. But, since I never use those buttons, I always keep the switch set to off, even during shoots."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"I originally bought one of these because the price was so enticing. Initially, I was OK with the product, my only complaints being that the main dial was a bit soft and the shutter button was mushy, but I could live with those for the price. However, after a couple of days of use I noticed that the main dial would sometimes act funny. I generally shoot in aperture priority and sometimes the aperture would go the wrong way when I turned the main dial, even when using the main dial on the camera body itself. It took me a little bit, but I figured out that turning off the battery grip and turning it back on would fix it. I returned it for an exchange of the same product. The second one eventually did the same thing. I returned it as well and got the Canon battery grip instead. I just received it yesterday and so far I have been very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I have purchased the Opteka Battery Grip for my Rebel XT. This thing works flawlessly. Saved over half of what I would have paid for the Canon BG-E3, doesn't have that beacon of a canon logo on it and to be honest, the grip material on it feels more \\"grippy\\" (sometimes we have to make up words to describe things haha!). I find myself doing more portrait shooting over landscape because the grip is more comfortable to hold than the actual camera itself. Although it does add quite a bit of weight to the camera, I feel the comfort, extra controls and battery life are more than worth it.Thanks for taking my words into consideration when making your purchase.M.T."},{"rating":"1","title":"***Great, but not perfect***","review":"I recently got this order swiftly from 47th street. The service seemed to be very speedy and the product was in pristine condition.However, when I tried to use the vertical grip's shutter button, half-focus was fine, but suppressing for a full shot, there was at least 1 second lag. Nothing else but this problem thwarted me to contact their company for an immediate refund and probably buy the Canon version now.Although most people do not seem to have problems with theirs, please double check everything about our item before deciding that it is \\"awesome.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my rare mistakes :(","review":"I am not going to go into details just don't buy this junk and get a real grip, Canon, which I did after this one showed my batteries were gone in one click. No matter what I did it didn't work. A big disappointment. Sometimes you have to pay what you have to pay, so keep your money, save some more and get Canon. This WILL give you head ache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good accessory but.......","review":"I bought this BG-E3 compatible for my EOS 400D (or EOS Rebel Xti) and it has made my life better in terms of camera handling. However, after 2 months use, I felt the rubber part of the grip seems to be getting soft and loose. I compared it to the the original Canon BG-E3 of my friend who got his earlier than mine, the rubber part seems to be more sturdy and more in place. I guess thats what I get for buying a cheaper brand. Nevertheless, it still serves the purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"a dollar saver","review":"Although I've not owned the canon model, (and probably never will because this one is perfect) I can not see an advantage in buying it. the Opeka works great, is very compatable with my rebel xt, and is half the price of the canon. I've stuck with Canon brand on nearly everything else, but this is one exception that was worth the switch. UPDATE; IT HAS BEEN 6 MONTHS SINCE BUYING THIS GRIP. IT WORKS GREAT. I USE IT EVERY DAY AND HAVE HAD ZERO PROBLEMS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable at any price","review":"Received this grip today and it did not live up to the reviews of the other customers. The grip was unstable and only worked 50% of the time. If I did not hold the left side of the camera and grip together, the camera would switch off.I owned this grip for 8 hours and it could not even pass the stink test. It would be one thing if it worked for awhile and then quit, but it never worked from the get-go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opteka Battery Pack Grip","review":"Great item for the price. Didn't expect to use it all the time, but now that its on the camera, I'm not taking it off. Makes a huge difference in the feel and balance of the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good For The Price","review":"First the good stuff...This grip really makes the Rebel XT work very well in the portrait mode (ie held vertically). All the controls are where your fingers expect them to be (with maybe the exception of the AV button). It seems solid and well built. It was uncomfortable for me to use the XT in the portrait mode. This grip changes that completely!!!The shutter on my grip is not hard to press, and the wheel is not loose. However...Sometimes the wheel does not change the function it is set up to change. For example in the Tv mode, the wheel should change the shutter speed. Sometimes the shutter will cycle back and forth between two values when the wheel is turned. I should mention that it is not as bad now as when I first installed the grip so maybe it is working itself in.I'll have to keep an eye on this but 47th Street Photo has been GREAT so far. Shipping was very fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe this is a Canon in disguise","review":"Bought this in the first few months of 2007 due to price. Worked great, although I don't use my camera very much (once a month??). Then, in July, I noticed my camera frequently shutting off as I was composing a shot, or it just wouldn't turn on - a little frustrating. Took off the grip, and my XT has worked flawlessly, obviously there's an issue with a contact point somewhere.Even though this supposedly looks like a Canon product, I do no believe the quality is something Canon would put their name on. Yes, it's cheaper than Canon's product, but mine's now useless. Was it worth it? No. 1 star for price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy!","review":"This is one aftermarket item that I'm very happy with. It fit my Canon Rebel Xti perfectly and It seems I can shoot forever now on just a single charge. Of course, I can't shoot forever, but it sure keeps me from having to stop and change batteries. I have 3 batteries, two in this, and have never had to remove this pack to use the third battery. I'm a happy camper! Thanks Opteka!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This Grip feels great on my camera. I can't think of another item at this price that will see as much use. I am very excited that this camera has a BUILT IN rechargable battery. I was planning to buy additional batteries along with the grip but will not have to. The feel of the grip makes it seem like part of the camera. I will have heavy use this weekend... so I will have to see how it acts under pressure.The grip's shutter button feels sturdy(Identical to the one on the camera) unlike the reviews previously state. I was pleased to find this a fact.The grip has a little storage compartment for the battery cover allowing for quick reinstall of my battery just in case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This thing is awesome.

I would highly recommend getting this over the more expensive Canon batter grip."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you pay is what you get","review":"I bought this product based on the many positive reviews here and after receiving the item two days ago, I was disappointed.

Bly's helpful, amusing and slim volume is jam-packed with wisdom and plenty of tips to help you organize, manage your time better, cure procrastination and increase your productivity.

Just one look around your office may show you how many people have heard some of this counsel before but are still hopelessly disorganized time wasters. Bly includes pertinent data from surveys of leaders and working stiffs who feel overwhelmed by information, too many demands on their time and the constant struggle to fit 25 hours of work and real life into a 24-hour day.

PAGAN. And it doesn't take a genius to do a little homework and come to grips with that. Why not just allow your children to be children, and ditch the dogma until their old enough to decide for themself? Or are you afraid that Whelchel might put 'hot sauce' on your tongue?

I agree with another reviewer, that much of this book is trite, and even cheesy. I had hoped for devotionals tied into activities, and a daily format, that builds upon each day in Advent. It's more of a crafty history scrapbook for elementary-aged children. This is a book to borrow from the library, as a helpful, one-time reference for crafty ideas + history.

The story takes us over the first days after the accident -- a time when the parents are trying to balance their son's options -- and the possibility of terminating life support. This is a very moving book, and I could not help but be profoundly impressed by the son, Jeffrey, along with his family and the network of supportive friends. I recommend this book without reservation. On another, perhaps less important note, I should mention that the author is also a very good writer. It is frequent in memoir books that I overlook style because of the content. But in this case, the content was very moving, as I said; the writing was very, very good. One last comment -- I cannot help but wonder if the negative reviewers finished the book. They might be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Richard Galli!","review":"For Richard Galli to think of killing his son because he became paralyzed is bad enough, but to write a book about it too is over the top!

I first heard the music on this CD while watching the Olympics in 1996, then \\"Summon the Heroes\\" was in the movie \\"Without Limits\\" in 1998 (which by the way is my favorite movie). This CD is VERY inspirational. It has most of the music used by NBC in the Olympics. The best tracks are Williams' \\"Summon the Heroes\\" and the \\"Olympic Theme\\". It also has the immortal \\"Chariots of Fire\\" theme in it. If you are a runner and need some music to help you get motivated, get this CD. If you just love music, get this CD.

John can make composing music an exalted art. His music is purely genius and captures the ideas of the album in which the score is in. Back to the album . . . it is AWESOME! This includes many well-known songs but also many undiscovered treasures.

A TREASURE!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performances","review":"After reading all of the reviews written ahead of mine, I have noticed something that all have them have failed to mention, Tim Morrison. His playing on Summon the Heroes is amazing. He is easily one of the best lyrical trumpet players in the world. John Williams wrote Summon the Heroes with his abilities in mind, and Tim Morrison plays his part better than anyone else could. The rest of the CD is amazing. It is one of my favorite recordings of Festive Overture. This is a must have CD for people who enjoy powerful, patriotic sounding music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Music","review":"John Williams proves he still has the Right Stuff.

I played a couple of the pieces recorded here (Olympic Fanfare And Theme and The Olympic Spirit) and I know well the Shostakowich's Festive Overure, and I have to say that the playing of the Boston Pops is simply incredible! The brass in particular.

Although \\"Money Maker\\" is a true club joint, he also extolls the shadiness of the music business and the importance of being your own boss. To paraphase - you should get your label, sign yourself to that label, and then write checks to yourself. Luda even gives props to Jay Z, president of Def Jam, which is the label of Ludacris. There are selective artists that provide hooks that make a song. For instance, Nate Dogg, Missy Elliott, and Mary J. Blige. The list wouldn't be complete without R. Kelly. The collab btw. Luda and R. Kelly is classic! The melody and cadence go hand in hand. Are there a lot of head bangers on this CD? No. But is it worth adding to your hip-hop assortment? Definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best so far...","review":"If you're a hip hop head or just a fan of rap music in general, you've more than likely noticed that a Ludacris LP is about 15% lyrics/concepts and 85% commercial garbage.

If you can get past the club joints and focus more on the conceptual work on this, you might enjoy it as much as I did. 4 stars is the perfect rating for Ludacris' Release Therapy.

To be honest i used to look foward to his freestyles with 4 ize and he hasn't had one of those since word of mouf.

There are the requiste club bangers (\\"Money Maker\\" & \\"Girls Gone Wild\\") and songs that fans of luda's previous albums will be sure to appreciate (\\"Mouths to Feed\\" & \\"Do Your Time\\"). All in all, while there is nothing industry changing about this album it is another quality album in a series of consistantly quality albums from cris. If you liked his previous stuff definately pick it up, if not it's still worth a listen if you have the oppertunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened? Luda!!!!","review":"Ludacris has dropped release therapy, which IMHO is just that release. therapy. This album is not his best, or even second. I was rather dissapointed and confused listening to the album. The beats and rhymes seem off. Being a native Atlantan, from the SWATS (grew up with the Outkast, Goodie MOB, Ludacris, etc) I felt like the air let out a ballon this one. I hate to give bad reviews, but I...oh forget it.

As a reference book it is invaluable but there are also ideas that can be adapted by anyone who wants to learn more about classical proportions. My only regret is not to have been able to have seen these interiors in color. M. Boyd"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any person interested in great architecture.","review":"It's hard to believe that we, as a people, once created the kind of interiors that are so splendidly recalled by this book. It's even harder to believe that so many of the interiors presented have been demolished. Will architects and artisans and craftspeople ever again create such impressive works? The answer, likely, is no. As such, should we not, absolutely, save all such remaining treasures? This book makes an excellent case for this argument, with its beautiful images, beautifully printed. The text is crisp, and the author nicely opinioned. All this volume lacks is a map showing the houses and neighborhoods discussed (helpful to us non-Londoners)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing here","review":"I'm glad I looked at this in the bookstore before ordering it from Amazon.com (it was on my wish list for a while). With the exception of some pretty pictures similar to what you can find in any decorating magazine, there was nothing inside other than several pages showing block of color combinations. Nothing really new or meaningful about color theory or why the combinations might work. Nothing about how one might use them. I fail to see where the guideline was. Furthermore, while the book jacket advertises paint chips to take to your retailer, there were none in any of the books I examined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful to the color-confused!","review":"I bought this book to help me choose a paint for a central room in my house easily viewable from several different living areas.

I enjoy the way she takes a simple occurrence like seeing an eclipse, looking at a weasel or taking a weekend trip and applies a universal meaning to her experience.

If you avoid the blandness of Marriner on Philips, the slick emptiness of Karajan on DG and EMI, and the sight-reading of starving Eastern Europeans on the white box labels, you can do pretty well.But above all, be sure to avoid this one. The performances are usually slack (without pulse, purpose or payoff) and always swollen and self-indulgent. It's interpretations like this that give Romanticism a bad name.And though the New York Philharmonic plays very well, the recording quality is coarse and artificial, often combining overly close miking and chaotic reverberation.

It's a shame that the latest ed is from '98 - if that wasn't the case I'd have no problem relying solely on this for pathology class. Now I back-up with Basic Robbin's. I have no idea why Lange stopped updating this marvelous book; it's one of the best educational texts I've yet to come across.

It's filled with lots of helpful charts, a decision matrix and a whole chapter of questions and answers on everything from what to do if you miss a dose to why these drugs need refrigeration. It even explains how patients without insurance or pharmacy benefits can get help obtaining these medications. The patient stories and quotes also make the book interesting.This book is an ABSOLUTE MUST READ for people with Rheumatoid Arthritis (and Psoriatic Arthtirits and Ankylosing Spondylitis), or anyone considering or now taking Enbrel, Humira, or Remicade.This book is perfect for physicians and nurses too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is pure hype","review":"I got this book hoping to get info beyond the pharmaceutical industry hype and found it to be a pure ad for big pharma.

His writing style is simple and direct. It is worthwhile reading for anyone who wants to get a better understanding of what VN was all about.To establish my credibility, I too served as a rifle company commander during my second VN tour, though in a different unit a year later.

This one ranks perhaps tops on my list. Rubin not only provides perspective on the differing views of Churchill's life and character, but also deconstructs, in witty fashion, the entire discipline of biography. I was also amused by how Rubin jumped right into topics like sex and booze that other, more hagiographic Churchill biographers delicately avoided. About the only tiny mistep in Rubin's narrative is when she hinted that the great Gandhi was a better man than Churchill. G. B. Singh's \\"Gandhi: Behind the Mask of Divinity\\" instead shows that Gandhi himself would have also been a worthy subject of Rubin's perceptive gaze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish effort: Boring, repetitive, uninspired","review":"It is incredible that a major press would waste wood pulp on this pathetic book. Given the state of the American reading public, I suppose one may anticipate more \\"books\\" of this kind. If you wish to know about the historical debates that attach to Winston Churchill's public career and private life, consult Robert Blake and William Louis, eds., CHURCHILL (W.W. Norton, 1993). The book contains more than two dozen essays that assess Churchill as politician, statesman, journalist, and historian. If you want an eminently readable, sympathetic, and wise introduction to his life, read Geoffrey Best, CHURCHILL: A STUDY IN GREATNESS (Hambledon, 2001; Oxford has just published a paperback edition)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shallow faux biography","review":"Tucked into the Select Bibliography on p. 284 is a telling detail, a confession by the author that \\"Forty Ways to Look at Winston Churchill rests on the work of more comprehensive biographers.\\" A more honest book would have included this key piece of information up front. The author is neither a biographer nor a Churchill scholar, but someone who combines her reading of other people's work with the not-very-earth-shattering (and by the end of the book tiresome) idea that a life can be seen from a variety of perspectives, and Churchill was a complex and sometimes contradictory figure. Rubin comes across as a dilettante (complete with a self-promoting website, duly noted on the dust jacket). All in all, an irritating book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you want to read more about Churchill","review":"A good summary of Churchill's life, that gets better as you go along.

And when sub-biographers turn their hand to popularizations one gets, well, sub-biography; the standard judgments taken from the big biographies but in too brief a compass to give the reader much sense of the subject of the biography beyond the biographer's predilections. One way out is through a cutaway like John Lukacs' superb Five Days in London. Another is through the lens of a skilled and constantly shifting pararazza like Gretchen Rubin, who excels in delivering a biographical portrait that is digestible for those with less than Proustian appetites for bulk, but is very far from a \\"popular\\" biography.Someone has distinguished between the simplicity that lies this side of complexity, and the simplicity on the far side. I'm in no doubt where Forty Ways to look at Winston Churchill is to be found.Nigel Cameron"},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Make Winston Churchill Accessible to All","review":"Gretchen Rubin has the merit to make the complex personality of Winston Churchill accessible to a wide audience. Rubin is very good at reducing a mass of information and data about her tragic hero to the key talking points about a wide range of topics relevant to the life of Churchill. Some biographies about Churchill can intimidate many readers because of their size and/or complexity. Rubin, a lawyer by training, plays the devil's advocate in some chapters by arguing both sides of an issue without taking side. Some readers, understandably, would have preferred that Rubin took a clear stance in these chapters. Although Rubin deeply admires Churchill, she ultimately passes the test of impartiality by acknowledging his most egregious shortcomings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winston Churchill","review":"The book arrived quickly.

What a waste of time, at least on the reader's part.This book should be retitled \\"Gretchen Rubin's 40 ways to look at Winston Churchill,\\" since it consists mainly of snippets of facts interspersed among her slanted views of the man. Her clearly leftist personal sentiments have an influence over this entire work.It adds nothing to the knowledge of Churchill, even for those without the fortitude to read the Manchester or Gilbert works. If you're looking for an introductory work, or a short-cut on a very long and varied life, then go to either Roy Jenkins' Churchill or John Lukacs' Churchill.But don't waste your time or money on this tripe... go see Gigli instead -- It's a more enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discovering Churchill and Learning Biogaphy Technology","review":"Gretchen Rubin favors her readers with an honest presentation of Winston Churchill and reveals how biographical authors use their own interpretations to \\"spin\\" facts to suit their own ends.

She seemed intelligent and well-spoken. I was surprised to find her writing was not up to her oratory.

Chapters were subdivided into alternate views: \\"Winston Churchill Was Well Suited to High Office\\" and \\"Winston Churchill Was Ill Suited to High Office\\". After only a few paragraphs, the section would end with lines right out of high school debate class \\"It was for these qualities that Churchill was hailed as the savior of his country,\\" or \\"Because of these qualities, Churchill was an irresponsible and erratic leader.\\"The only redeeming quality is the character of Churchill, that manages to still come through despite the very immature style of writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forty Ways to Look at Winston Churchi;;","review":"This is a great book for those who have read Gilbert and Manachester as well as those who are not familar with the extradinary life of Churchill. Rubin has written a wonderfully concise review of this dominate figure of the 20th century. She is able to present various views of a Churchill's very full life in an extremely engaging way. It will make you think or rethink how Churchill was able to accomplish so much. She even provides the reader with a quiz to test their knowledge of the subject.

After using the ladder for a while, the leg lock joints began to loosen, so each time I used it, I was careful to exam it. And then the inevitable happened.

I tried putting her indoor piece about 3 feet away from her sliding glass door and the signal for atomic updates won't come in, grrr. Thought maybe it was just defective so I tried moving mine at home to another location. Same thing, no atomic signal. Bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good product","review":"This weather statiom was easy to set up, the screen is very readable, and the remote sensor has a surprisingly long range.

I found this weather station easy to set up following the written instructions and it seems to be fairly accurate, easy to read and attractive.I knew it couldn't be wall hung when I ordered it but lack of this feature is why I only rated it 4 stars.Time will tell if this one lasts 12 years. Somehow I doubt it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the temp?","review":"We have our Weather Station in the kitchen. It's the first thing we look at every day.

But that's OK with us because it does every thing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a Lemon","review":"Partially worked after several resets, accomplished first from product documentation, then from recorded message played back repeatedly if you call the toll free #. Clock worked only briefly then never again. First tried email. Next tried getting a live body, but only recorded msg cycling through different menu choices, giving email address, or telling you high call volume but your call will be answered...eventually? I held twice (2) for over 1 hour each time (phone on speaker nearby) - never answered - only recorded message. After that, requests for RMA# to return unit have also gone unanswered. Will never buy another OS anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless Weather Station - Great product","review":"Works as advertised. Great distance reception and accurate readings. The atomic clock is an added bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product!","review":"The worst! Outdoor sensor only works when it is right next to the indoor unit. the atomic clock only sets itself if I put the indoor unit outside for a good signal. also outdoor sensor is not water proof, good luck trying to find a dry location outside with a good signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"well...maybe not our weather, but it must be someone's...","review":"Smaller than I had orginally hoped, but easy to read. The biggest problem is that the unit seems to be confused as to what the weather actually is. It will show rain falling on a very sunny day, and then a bright sun on an overcast day!! Our outdoor thermostat also seems to be difficult, almost finicky. It doesn't often register, although we have checked where it is located and do have a signal..Overall, a VERY disappointing present for my weather enthusiast husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"I followed the instructions - more complicated than should be necessary - meticulously and used fresh batteries, but the unit simply didn't work. I would give this item zero stars if such an option were available. The technology for these weather stations isn't so complicated that it excuses out-of-the-box malfunctions of this sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I selected this item after a search for one made in USA. Oregon Scientific came up so I purchased it. After unwrappping it I saw that it was made in China, just what I did not want. I have used it and parts do not work, such as memory of high and low readings. I should have rewrapped it and returned to sender."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with the performance of the weather station. I bought it to be able to monitor the temperature in an office building in a couple of different locations. First, the temperature indicator is 2 degress off. Also, I have found that the additional sensor that I bought does not work with my device. Lastly the weather indicator is not very accurate -- it frequently predicts rain which most of the time doesn't happn -- even a broken clock is right 2 times per day. Was hoping for a little more accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and easy to read","review":"We ordered one of these weather stations so we could have a general idea of the current and general weather outlook when staying at our condo in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico (weather forecasts there in Spanish aren't very helpful to us!). This unit does receive atomic clock signals from Boulder, Colorado, and the internal barometer is able to predict the likelihood of precipitation in the next 12-24 hours.We have been very satisfied with this weather station, and ordered another for our home in the US, where we use the outdoor transmitter as well, and everything works as it should and is easy to understand.And--what we didn't know until very recently (by accident)--this thing even has an alarm clock you can set.Very useful in our daily lives :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value for the money","review":"Great product. I've had zero issues with it. It updates everything frequently, and appears to be very accurate. Set-up was a breeze, though it did take a while (still less than a day; it says it could take up to 24 hours) to make the connection to the signal that provides the atomic clock/date data. One minor drawback is that the Comfort Level feature (indicates whether Wet/Comfortable/Dry outside) and the Weather Forecast feature (the sun & cloud image at the top), seem to be based on separate functions, because there have been a few times that it says \\"Dry\\" and has a cloud & rain image, at the same time. For me, this is not really an issue, as I bought it for its capacity to gauge inside/outside temp & humidity and specific barometric pressure. Its the most versatile and best value weather station for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice but one caution","review":"The weather station operates flawlessly and is very clear. I chose it because unlike some other models, this one shows both the indoor and outdoor conditions at once for both temp and humidity.One caution: Although the description does not say so, this is a desk unit only not a wall mount unit--there's an immovable rest sticking out the back (most of the other models are not like this)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this...stopped working within a week!","review":"This is the second one I've purchased. I love it when it works. The first one lasted about a year and stopped displaying the outside temp. The sending unit would display the outside temp but the receiving unit would not display the outside temp. I bought a second one and the range was about 10 feet, much to short of distance to be of any use. Now, after a week, the outside temp does not display on the inside unit but the outside sending unit does display the temp. Yes, I know how to reset it and make sure the channels are correctly set. Avoid this unit...you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oregon Scientific","review":"We had to return it due to the fact that it refused to be set to Eastern Standard Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift Idea","review":"I bought my husband the weather station for Christmas and he loved it. When his mom came to visit this summer, she was so intrigued with it that we purchased one for her, too. For her it was like Christmas in June ... she was so excited when she got it and calls to report the weather in Tennessee to compare with what we have here in Georgia. Both our families are miles away from the airports where the weather reports originate so it's great to have instant readings for our own homes. It's wireless so if the power is out, you still have date, time and weather.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features/Design, very poor reliability","review":"Less than 6 months pass and the unit went bad. The sensor doesn't collect the right outside humidity and the receiver doesn't sync the time. Hopefully Oregon will support/replace the unit. After waiting 6 weeks for the replacement product, I'm told it's in back order. Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work.","review":"I could not get the base unit to receive information from the remote transmitter. The transmitter would work if set immediately adjacent to the unit, but one wall in the way and there would be no reception. Also, I thought that this unit would mount to the wall, but due to the design it is not possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused","review":"I bought this weather station along with two remote sensors. After about two days I was skeptical about the inside humidity (reading 4%). To test the accuracy, I placed the remote sensors side-by-side with this unit. The temp seems to all be in sync, but I get different humidity readings on all three...this morning was 4% 27% and 31%. I have no idea which one is correct. I'm going to return this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well.","review":"I really enjoy this weather station. I put the remote on my shed under an overhang about 30' from the back door. The base unit is about 20' inside the back door with near line-of-sight. My original location for the base unit was about 15' further away with no line-of-sight and it would work sometimes but often lost signal from the remote. In this new position it works fine.It does take about a day to get the atomic clock signal, just be patient. The unit does read a bit high on these hot Texas afternoons, even though I placed the remote where it would be out of the sun in the late afternoon. But it's mostly accurate. The buttons on the back of the base for heat index, etc. are not very convenient, but I don't use them very often either. I like the bigger display so you can see both inside and outside readings without having to push a button. I also like having humidity reading from the remote - not available on the smaller models. Overall I'm very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"Product is great.

I purchased the Oregon Scientific BAR608HGA as it was less money only to find the thing has never gotten the outdoor temperature right! Off by 3-20+ degrees - and unfortunately not consistently so I could merely make a mental arithmetic adjustment. The remote unit appears to be the issue as the indoor temperature has been correct.

This excellent book is a collection of short stories by Mr. P.G. Wodehouse; it was first published in 1919 and contains some of the earliest stories containing Jeeves and Wooster. (Actually the first Jeeves and Wooster story, Extricating Young Gussie, was published in 1917 in the Wodehouse short story collection, The Man with Two Left Feet.)Only half of the stories contain Jeeves and Wooster, while the other half star a separate character named Reginald \\"Reggie\\" Pepper. Reggie Pepper is an OK character, often considered to have been a prototype for Bertie Wooster. Overall, I found him to be a good character, and someone I would not be surprised to meet at the Drones Club. However, it is true that he feels too much like Wooster sans Jeeves.As for the J and W stories, they are pure gold. There is a reason that these stories are still celebrated all these years later - read this book and find out why!

Once he picup again he wrote and wrote and wrote nearly 100 books. NEARLY 100 BOOKS! Fun and funny was his forte. My Man Jeeves can act as an introduction to two of Eng Lit's most beloved characters.

An intelligent writer, Wodehouse's colloquial style involves the reader in the zany antics of Bertie Wooster and his man Jeeves--everyone's idea of the perfect butler.

There are a lot of narrated versions of Wodehouse on the market, and you will be quite happy with this one, though I think the version recorded by Charlton Griffin is so far my favorite.

I can't think of any other resource that is chock full of so much information. I applaud Ms. Weld for her boundless enthusiaism and her research skills. I love this book and would like a copy for myself as I loaned mine out several years ago and will probably never see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rommel - the origin of 'JUST DO IT'","review":"I imagine a good business lecturer would translate lessons from this book into 'Rommel on Business'. However, for me, it will suffice to say that Rommel writes an exciting account of the terrible and sometimes gruesome conditions of war in World War One. His clear examples of 'leadership by example', and 'be a bold risk taker' would seem self-confidence overblown, were it not for the historical reality of his successes in the battles named. There is also an element here and there of the blind nationalism that would lead him and many of his fellow officers into the follow-on fiasco a mere 20+ years later. A 'must read' for modern military historians and Rommel fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Infantry Attacks\\", Wonderful!","review":"\\"Infantry Attacks\\" is a very good read, very tough to put down. Rommel gives the reader a personal view of command that is rare in books about WWI. His compassion for his men and his icy cold view of battle combine into a very compelling account of his early learning curve. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a while, but broken easily","review":"I bought this because I thought it looked durable. The truth is, this thing lasted only a few months and eventually stopped working. The design is flawed because you have to bend the flash drive to take it out of the holder. Eventually, this wears on the metal part that connects to the computer, and the inside wiring becomes loose and eventually disconnects. It was nice for a while, but broke really easily. I don't recommend this product for people who use a flash drive frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor moulding.","review":"I bought this because of all the people that recommended it for the stampede.

Naturally I rushed out to get the album and on my first listen I found the album to be weak, especially the fast tracks. Seven years later I re-bought the album and gave it another listen; as an adult I found the album to be stronger than I thought. Boyz II Men like Jodeci before them have always been the strongest with ballads and this is apparent on the singles Doin Just Fine,Never,4 Seasons Of Loneliness. Shawn's writing skills were apparent on the song Doin Just Fine which is one of the strongest songs on the album, however there's is a lot of weak material on the album. Songs such as Girl In The Life Magazine, Baby C'mon and To The Limit all seem forced and aren't song with that much heart. In my opinion truly evolved on their EXCELLENT fourth disc Nathan Michael Shawn Wanya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, and Boring","review":"I bought this CD 'cause people told me there was great music.

This is music that I WANT the blues to be, but all too often gets bled dry by producers who think they know more than the audience does. CG has been around long enough to be very, very good at what he does, and to know absolutely who he is. This, apart from choice of instrument and degree of musical training, is what makes Mozart and Beethovan and Eric Clapton and Carlos Guitarlos guys we want to listen to over and over again.

If you need to raise the curved piece, a piece of 3/4\\" white PVC tubing slides right over the tubes with enough support for the top piece and the shower head, without throwing off the tripod balance too badly.Also, on first assembly, we found how poorly the curved piece at the top was welded to the supporting upright; it came off in my hands with very little pressure applied (the other reason why the PVC sleeve became necessary; I have no welding facilities, and didn't think solder would be as strong as I needed.)It looks good in principle, but the low height and cheap manufacture work against it in my books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for midgets","review":"Quality is only fair, and the unit is so short that you have to stoop to take a shower.I dumped the pole and stand and used the hose and shower head by fastening it to the top of the Zodi shower enclosure, and it worked fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"You have got to be kidding me!!!

It does not use the Tamil script-- it only offers romanised words, which I find frustrating as a beginner trying to learn how to spell Tamil words. The phrases seem useful; the two-page cultural overviews and tourist tips are just half-hearted attempts.

I think it is a great gadget. I wear it in the office. I can listen to my music without interupting others and I can tune others out as well.I only have a few complaints. The head gear is adjustable for length, but not width. After wearing the head piece for a few hours it feels a bit tight on the ears. However, this can not be adjusted. The sound is quite good considering how small the device is. Don't be surprised if you can not receive some stations indoors. This radio is not that powerfull. Also note that the ear pieces that actually fit on your ears are very delicate. They seem to be hanging by a fine piece of plastic. \\"Do not drop this item on the floor\\" the ear pieces break off and can not be re attached. \\"sigh\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"great sound quality and reception, double headbands may not secure enough for jogging but are great otherwise, station presets and clock are great features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let All buyers Beware","review":"I am a contractor who wears radio headphones all day when I work. When I received the headphones, I found them rather heavy and clunky, but the digital tuning and the presets were quite an improvement from what I had before and the sound quality was excellent. The next morning, I put them on and pushed the power button. Nothing. Nothing happened. I looked at the display and saw three battery icons blinking, telling me that the batteries were OK. I tried doing everything, pushing all buttons, removing and replacing the batteries,with no success. And the bloody battery icons kept blinking. So I changed the batteries, and the headset came to life. One hour later I turned off the headset to talk to someone. When pushed the power button...nothing...and there were the three battery icons blinking,blinking. Since then I have tried many times to make the thing come to life with no success."},{"rating":"1","title":"The visual and performance of this radio is very poor","review":"I bought this on New Years 2006 and I used it for 5 years already and the radio got static after one or two years. It lasts good on alkaline batteries but it doesn't indicate correctly like it does it in random.The battery cap could easily slide off and I have to put all my data in again. The radio isn't loud enough (but it has AVLS thats the good thing) when I go outside. Plus, this radio is uncomfortable to use. This radio comes with less presets only 5 FM and 5 AM. Come on, I need more presets Sony you could do better than that. Plus, the weak stations comes to another station that maybe strong enough for the real station. Also, it got thrown out in the trash because I got in trouble back in May because I wasnt where I was supposed to be after leaving the Saturday Academy. Look it was 5 years of use after the 2nd or 3rd year of use like I said the ears were static. I rate this radio poor (2 stars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk; Sony's quality is fading quickly!!","review":"This radio, at first sign, is great. But, live with it for a while and you will change your attitude quickly.First of all, the plastic that contacts your ears is hard and funky, which is painful after 10 minutes or so. Second, the battery life is HORRIBLE!! I get 1 3-hour baseball game's worth at best. I get a message in the display stating that the battery life is gone, then I can remove and replace the batteries and get more life. Good or bad? This sucks, because the excessive handling and ineffective display are a joke!!I own many other Sony products and I feel that they are living off of their past branding successes. It is apparent to me that they are no longer \\"top of the line\\" and are cutting too many corners on the quality.

I would recommend you purchase a version by another publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"An influence","review":"This was one of Faulkner's favorite stories--one he would re-read every year, according to his biographers. In my opinion, Narcissus is one the key texts that Faulkner's own style is derived from (Proust seems like another inspiration).

This is a great, lyrical work worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine writing, disappointing print quality","review":"Conrad's fine prose is marred by countless printing errors in this Digiread version.

It's priceless to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit of Eden Unplugged","review":"Take Debussy's Claire de Lune, add some feedback and silent bits, sprinkle in a touch of Martin Fetltham's awesome electric harmonica, an upright bass that could stress a hip-hop addict's car stereo, lyrics that are more intrumental than clear (they are quite poetic and are in the liner for the curious), and an excellent production/mixing and you will come close to this. Much more mellow than prior releases...Robbie McIntosh and Martin Ditcham are back, but Tim Friese-Greene is gone. :-( Still, Mark has certainly stretched even -his- envelope with this one. Much more disciplined, yet there is still evidence of creative freedom. Well worth the extra currency. Go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk Talk, it sure ain't. Nothing to dance to here.","review":"I bought this hoping for some of the excitement bottled in Talk Talk's greatest hits disc. Instead, this is a sparse, minimalist plate of acoustic jazz.

Talk Talk fans' money would be better spent simply mopping up whatever 'Talk' records you don't already have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Time, is the right time","review":"If you liked later Talk Talk, and if you like Sarah McGlaughlin enough that you know of Hollis' strong influence on her music, you'll love this album. Moody, wise, sad, done with a savy acoustic fusion second to none. Dusk, tea lights, melancholy and Mark Hollis. A perfect lonely evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The quiet genius of Mark Hollis","review":"This is an incredible album, and gets better with repeated listenings. Personally, I make quiet time in the dark and watch out windows while listening to this - so, it takes patience to adapt your ear to it, even as a fan, but it's well worth it in spades when you settle in to it. Great piece of work - we need more like this from Hollis. He's a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect blend of silence and sound.","review":"Mark Hollis takes you to a musical landscape that you always knew existed but had never heard. A blend of beautiful harmonies, chaos and silence glued together with Mark Hollis' distinctive, soulful voice.

Definitely one that can be skipped if you are trying to select a good book to read this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted more of an autobiography","review":"I know the title says the women who raised me, but I really wanted to read more about how she got into acting, what it was like to be on the young and the restless and work with dick van dyke. She spends many chapters about her ballet years, but doesnt mention what it was like to get into tv acting, which is really her career, not ballet. She is known for being a TV star. She did a great deal of research into her families/friends - I think too much. I had to skip many many pages because it got boring. She mentions her marriage, but never talks about getting divorced. I never knew if she married Wynton or not, had to look it up on the net. She doesn't get into her relationships with men much or her children. I got the impression Wynton was raising her son? but who knows. She seems very multi talented though and it was great that she put so much time into writing a book in addition to her other charities/career."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I was expecting a great read. Instead, I got a long, drawn-out, account of the individual foster mothers. It seems to me that if they were so loving they would have put forth a better effort to keep custody. I also feel that Ms. Rowell gives her birth mother credit that is not warranted. She is quick to point out her mother's \\"beauty\\" in her youth, i.e., \\"creamy skin\\", etc. This great \\"beauty\\" is not apparent to me. This statement alone is surprising coming from a strong black woman such as Rowell. Her mother cared absolutely nothing for her, \\"schizophrenic\\" or not, yet her name is first on Rowell's thank-you list. Please do not waste money on this book. Not one interesting character. I can't wait to sell this and be reimbursed. This is truly the worst book I have ever read - I had to skip half of the chapters because they were so repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connections","review":"Victoria Rowell's wonderful book is about connections: \\"blood\\" connections, and connections that transcend blood connections. Her keen knowledge of history places the reader in context to appreciate the \\"slings and arrows,\\" as well as the nurturing blessings she receives as \\"a ward of the State of Maine.\\" Thank God that her foster parents, Bertha C.

The first thing that happened was both brake calipers falling apart followed by a brake pully snapping and then the other brake pully snaped. Then I noticed that The rear derailer no matter how it was adjusted would not function properly. I brought it to a bike shop and they descovered that the derailer cables were incorrectly installed as well as a flaw on the rear of the frame where the bike tire and rear derailer attached to the bike. As long as you dont get a incorrectly welded frame and are willing to replace brake calipers this bike should be ok for some one wanting a economy road bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the price great","review":"had it out for the first long trip today and it was fine.

Stefan Sharff's shot by shot analysis of Hitchcock's work is painstakingly executed, and painful to the reader. Not that understanding a great work of art should require no work on the part of its audience but in this case simply having the the plot of a classic movie told repeatedly and then gone over shot by shot adds little to the discussion of a much discussed work. Also, as another review here noted, there are many errors in Mr. Sharff's re-telling of the movie, which could easily have been avoided. I ordered this book along with 'Writing with Hitchcock' by Steven DeRosa, which offers a fresh analysis of 'Rear Window' and tells the complete story of its making - that one I do recommend along with seeing the movie again."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting, informative, feel closer to Alanis","review":"This is a great book!

It was great to hear Roots Manuva expand his musical horizons, and he came up with some great songs. But as an album, I thought it was unfocused and at times boring. I picked up this remix version of Run Come Save Me cautiously, but as soon as I put it in my stereo it blew me off my feet. Original and creative, it took me back to the simple yet powerfull statements of Roots' first album, while at the same time exploring new and exciting ground.

When experience talks, wisdom listens. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and Informative","review":"In a series of 'interviews', the book talks about \\"macro\\" investing from the viewpoint of a few relatively well-known managers. The reader should essentially be ready to use the book as a framework for his or her own critical thinking on what the \\"next big thing(s)\\" could be in the investing realm. While the points made by the interviewees often jump out of the book, the format of the interview and presentation leaves an incomplete picture. Given that most questions asked to the different managers were similar, it would have served the reader much better if the book was organized thematically and not as a series of disjoint/stand-alone interviews (typically, that is a magazine format?). Other than that, the reader will be able to pick up some interesting observations on risk management, asset allocation, information gathering and analysis and behavioral aspects of trading. Overall, a decent addition to the library. The reader shouldn't expect any hand-holding, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good glimpse inside","review":"I love this book. I've been trading personally for just under a year and have been getting creamed. I know why now. This book interviews several of the best traders in the world.

Each of these interviews contributes to what is an extraordinary inside look at the complexity of global financial markets.

Some of the interviews were excellent. I say some, because those that trade closer to my style are obviously more interesting for me. but theres plenty here for everyone.I liked the interviews of so many different styles because it just proves my personal theory that anyone can make money. Every trader in the book trades differently and they still all make money.I also like the comments from many of these traders that said that we were heading for a sub-prime meltdown and that the banks would be having problems. This was written more than a year ago, and thats exactly whats happening today. Dow is now down 8.6% off the high it made last month. The volatility is crazy. And these guys predicted it long ago.

Sponge stays fairly true to their sound, but true to their nature they do explore a bit too. It all works, cuz this is Vin on vocals and pretty much the original band giving their all. They understand melody and have soul --they write meaningful lyrics. They've got something to say, and it is worth it to listen in.This disc is only slightly grittier than 'New Pop Sunday'(a great album) but this raw emotion is why we liked Sponge in the first place. We liked them right away for the all time gem that is 'Plowed'.If you like that song and have wondered what Sponge did later on, then you should get this. They are still a great band here. Sponge is no one-hit wonder. Turn off that crappy radio station and put this disc in, and remember the good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Statler Bros","review":"What can I say.

In fact, they've made quite a few! This disc reissues one of those records in its entirety, 1978's \\"Statler Brothers Christmas Card,\\" which has a nice mix of old classics and new material. The new stuff is best: the boys pick out plainspoken, sentimental songs like \\"I Believe In Santa's Clause\\" and \\"Christmas To Me\\" that wonder what's happened to the old-fashioned, love-your-neighbor flavor of the holiday, and long for the good old days...

The entire narrative of the text is almost a hypothetical due to the lack of solid evidence, which is no fault of the author. Breslaw brings up some very important ideas regarding the culture that Tituba could have come from as well as the culture that she would have then been immersed in and how that culture would have viewed her and for what reasons. Parts of the monograph also seemed repetitive or having little to do with any of the main points that Breslaw was making, the majority of the 2nd chapter for instance. In short, the book is lacking as far as historical writing is concerned but full of ideas that are important to the Salem witch trials and therefore an important event in early America.

He makes no effort to hide his flaws, nor his accomplishments. We learn about court intrigue, food, household management, plays, the foibles of kings, taverns, music, the navy, architecture, preachers, marriage, family relationships...the man was open to the world around him in an unbelievable way, and conveys it all with zest. It is absolutely enthralling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere","review":"Paul White has a nice little earner going with these titles. They actually tell you very little specific, practical information about each subject. They do however contain a lot of generalisations which anyone with a slight understanding of audio engineering could come up with. The book on digital audio didn't even include a means of calculating how much disk space is required for digital audio files, something that is very important as well as fundamental to the subject. Every book also contains between 50 and 70 pages of the same glossary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading","review":"This is a good serie's of books,they are small enough to carry anywhere and have enough information to get things running smoothly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Romance","review":"Just loved the book and it kept me on the edge of my seat.

It even took XP down with it ! Note that ULEAD's products (and others) had no problems with these files.I see this product as a black mark for Arcsoft and HP.

Try to get from the authoring screen to the EDIT screen and the button is greyed out; it takes 1 or 2 pointless clicks to get it to appear. It won't capture until video is present, so you have to rewind your source to get the beginning, then edit out the rewind.

It is easy to pull the four corners out into a square, but to push them up and lock them into place is very, very hard. Unless you have older kids or another strong person to help, do not buy this product. Look for something that explicitly states that only one person is needed.

Useless After 1 year.","review":"I puchased an E-Zup Canopy early summer 2007. It worked fine that first season. The second season I noticed the top had stretched and water pools up on all sides after it rains. So 1 year later the $300 canopy is now useless junk. I went to the website and a replacement top is $150 and it is not under warranty as the rep told me it is meant to be up for only 4 hours at a time and never let rain hit it. So if you purchase an E-Zup it is useless in the rain. Absolute junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temporary Use Only","review":"This product should be used only for temporary use, when someone is there to watch it. My first canopy was the victim of a sudden unexpected rain shower. The pitch on the roof is insufficient to let water run off, so the water pooled on one side, the canopy collapsed, and the struts were mangled. After repair with expensive replacement struts, a moderate wind picked the canopy up and smashed it against a neighbors fence. End of EZ UP canopies for me. The problem lies in the fact that the canopy material is impervious to water and acts like a kite in the wind.A much better product is the Koolaroo canopy available on the Internet. The material is woven and porous but still shades the sun. I left one up all summer in wind and rain with no problems. I would rate the EZ UP as unsatisfactory except for temporary use, and the Koolaroo as exceptionally good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Frame","review":"I bought this as a sun shade for my daughter's birthday party. It works for that purpose. However, you have to be very careful setting it up because the frame is very, very easy to bend. It's a two person job to get it up without bending supports. And hope it doesn't rain or blow very hard, because one good shower will destroy the frame. It was bent in half. It's not easy enough to put up and down every day, so it's really only good for single-shot use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy piece of junk","review":"Buy the Sierra II 12x12 with an intent to throw it away. I've never seen such flimsy steel, such tedious legs. The claim that it's 12 ft by 12 ft is the kind of lie you can expect from corporate marketing. Maybe the feet of the legs,which stick out like the legs of an inebriated stork, are 12ft apart, but the covered area is less than 10 ft across. I was SO disappointed when I opened this thing at a crafts market. I'd gladly have paid $50 more for something that will last a while. Now i'm just hoping a strong breeze comes along and destroys the thing so I can get something better.

I would reccommend it to anyone interested in World War 2. While reading Mr. Taylor's story I was often tempted to shout, \\"Wait! Don't do that!\\", as the author described what his next plan was. It seems almost like a comedy of errors that Mr' Taylor stumbled through, though there was nothing comical about being in combat, being captured and certainly not about being tortured day after day with unimaginable pain derived from the most medival of techniques. The jump into Normandy, the capture, the POW camps, the escapes, recapture, the near-death torturing, the final escape, fighting along side the Russians. It's all here in great detail.

It mostly consists of the monotonal narrator writing a tiny bit of code and showing it execute without explaining why things are as they are. It talked about data types in PHP as though booleans, integers, and strings are the only data types. The section on setting up PHP on windows discussed modifying only two lines in the php.ini file (register_globals and magic_quotes_gpc) without discussing why those modifications were happening.All in all this is truly horrible and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite up to expectations","review":"These headphones don't quite produce the the bass quality I thought they would.

He's one of the greatest Buddhist masters of all time. A true genius in every sense of the word. If you read his more esoteric books you will be astounded at the clarity and brilliance of his mind. This book is one of his most accessible texts -- it is essential for anyone practicing Dzogchen because it focuses on integrating the practice with ordinary daily life. The translation is especially accurate having been approved by Namkhai Norbu, one of the most eloquent and erudite contemporary Dzogchen teachers. It's a definite must-have for anyone interested in Tibetan Buddhism and in particular Nyingma philosophy and Dzogchen.

Koss has my total respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I know a lot of people have reviewed and liked this product. Perhaps it works for them, but I hate it. This set of headphones is already in the garbage. Why? The sound quality is not nearly as good as the reviews led me to believe it would be. I have other headphones with much better sound, but that is not the primary reason that I dumped them. The wire placement for the headphones is in an uncomfortable place - in front of the ear-coverings, so the wires are over my cheeks as they drop down to my ipod. I would rather have the wires toward the back and out of the way. Also, I like to drop the wires down the back of my shirt to get them out of the way and hook my ipod onto my belt. The wires on these headphones are too short for this, and with the wire-placement, the wires cut across my neck when I tried wearing them this way. I have purchased two Koss products. I've been disappointed with both. There will not be a third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never tried before but great result","review":"Never used this product before. Introduced by a relative and very pleased with the result. The sound was awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor quality","review":"These headphones work well if you want to listen to music but still be able to hear extraneous sounds (like the phone ringing, baby crying, etc.) without difficulty. The problem with them is that the wire is coated with a canvas-like material that, in my case, without extreme use, opened up in several places exposing the wires. Koss does have a lifetime warranty on the product, however it costs one third of the item's price plus shipping to send it back, and it will most likely have the same problem. Don't waste your money, get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted a few months...

I liked them but didn't find that much of a difference with the sound quality. Also the folding headband function didn't work that well, the thing kept falling off of the back of my head. Then a few weeks ago the real problems started. The headphones would start only working out of only one side, I would spend twenty seconds twisting the jack, trying to fix just to have it stop working again as soon as I moved. Then the headphones stopped working altogether. My reccomendation, take your 25 dollars and by some quality headphones instead of these ones"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"This is my second pair of SportaPro's. That says a lot. I've been an audiophile for 20 years and have owned many high end phones. These are simply the highest quality portable phone ever made. Full spectrum uncolored sound for $22.72. What's not to like? They're legendary.They will eventually break due to the plastic components. My last pair did and they were promptly replaced under the lifetime warranty. The second breakage, and I must say I abused them pretty badly, I decided to give Koss a break. I could go on for a lifetime getting them replaced them over and over but I like them so much that I paid for another.Highly recommended, these phones have impressive sound, flexible wearing options (over top of head or behind) and the price is unbeatable. If you don't mind the slightly retro design, get a pair. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sounding","review":"Bought these to use with my ipod.

I have heard many good things and stellar reviews about the Koss Portapro and Sportapro headphones. In the store I had trouble finding anything that I could afford (...) and finally came across the Koss Sporta Pro. For [the price], and all the good reviews I have heard, and the fact they are lighter and fold up, I decided to buy them.First I tried them with my minidisc player and they sounded pretty decent. They also sounded fairly decent with my cassette player as well. But when I listened later this evening on the noisy bus I could barely hear my music over the groan of the engine. To make matters worse, with the increased volume there was terrible distortion. The bass was excessive and the high frequences made this awful \\"fluttering\\" effect.Nonetheless they are back in their package and will be returned to the store tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS ...","review":"They collapse but what the heck? How on earth are you supposed to jog with these things when you wear it behind your head? The fit is EXTREMELY and SEVERELY awkward.

There are MUCH better choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean sound spirit","review":"I've migrated from the PortaPro to these in the attempt of a more sportive / clean look than its twin offers. It was a success, the sound quality makes this headphone the best in its class as the PortaPro has as historical factor. The sound is so clean, precise and powerfull like it's supposed to be. I would ever think about earplugs while these exists.The bad side of this headset is that the headband while behind the head can press your skull quite a bit if used more than 3 hours straight. Or may just be my big head! Nevertheless the sponges that help the confort of this usage, may rip apart sooner than you expect dependingon the type of usage you give. It comes with a carry bag which is great for protection. I do love abd carry them everywhere I go. A must for every \\"portable\\" music lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Headphones","review":"I had been testing out several different pairs of cheap headphones before these came in the mail so I already knew what to expect. However, the first time I put these on and played some music, I smiled. They sounded great. The bass is very well-defined and the other frequencies are very clear as well. The bass is so good I can feel the headphones vibrating on my head (I am not sure if other phones do this I didn't test). They are very comfortable because of the pads above the ears. Whenever I look at them before I put them on, the thought \\"comfort\\" runs through my head. They are also very durable and portable. They can fit in a pocket when folded, the headband is metal so it can't be broken, and the casings on the outside of the drivers are very hard plastic. Other good features are the mute button and the two different ways of wearing the phones (although I only use the convential method). Even if you get a very expensive portable, don't use the included headphones.

I wear these headphones at work and at the gym for durations of over an hour. These headphones will hurt after being worn for around a half hour as they start to dig into your ears. They are not comfortable, and they're pretty ... flimsy looking. The cloth around the ear piece also acts like a sponge if you sweat when you work out. Bottom Line: I *HIGHLY* (can't stress this enough) suggest trying these on before you purchase them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound good, but...","review":"...with a name like \\"SportaPro\\" I assumed they'd be pretty good for, you know, sporty things, like jogging.When in behind-the-neck position, they tend to drift a bit. You have to get the band EXACTLY right, since that's the only thing holding them up - the band resting on your neck.Also, I'm not saying these things need a manual, but a small piece of paper with little arrows showing which way the things can fold on the headphones will be nice. They're a lot more adjustable than most headphones, but it's not immediately obvious.For the price, they sound really good. Despite the drift I've been using them for over a year and have no plans on switching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Head People Beware","review":"I love these headphones in behind the head mode (especially now that I know the earpieces can rotate). In over-the-head mode I find the band a little tight. It works, but the earphones barely cover my ears. I have a large head, and doubt most people will have any discomfort using this in over-the-head mode. But I'll likely be using it in behind the head mode even when I'm not outside wearing a hat, just because it's more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"I got this for my 5 yr old Shih-Tzu that has many allergies.

The most recent of her books - Dark Melody, Shadow Game and now Wild Rain are some of her best. Her characters have matured and are much more developed.Wild Rain gives a romantic look at the rain forest as well as a cool idea of shape shifters that have both animal and human instincts (it could have been more explored but she's usually more interested in her character's relationship and how the *weird* aspect effects their relationship or world). The plot of Rachel's past was somewhat over the top - but hey - it fit. Rio had enough sensitivity and toughness to make him an appealing leading man and Rachel wasn't just a hysterical or voiceless twit. The secondary characters were equally enjoyable and hopefully if the idea continues into a series - Elijah gets his own book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I thought that there would be no match for \\"dark gold.\\" I was completely wrong.

I won't be following \\"the leopard\\" series that she's created, it just reeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative Trash","review":"This is just a horrible book. The characters are flat, the writing is unimaginative, and the subject is trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"I am a major Feehan fan and looked forward to the new book. I ran out the first day and bought it...only to be disappointed. The story line was somewhat interesting but did not grab my attention. The characters lacked depth and had sparse details on how they came to be. I enjoy her other books and will continue to read her but this was a major let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. One minute the heroine is gravely ill and the next she wakes up and is joking with the hero. The dialog jumped around. One minute they were strangers and the next they were speaking as if they had a long history with each other. The book started out with promise but within a couple of chapters I was skimming just to get through. NOT a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I read this book at the local library because I had been recommended it from reading Mary Janice Davidson and the like. I found the plot slow, and the emotions very unjustified. It seemed silly most of the time, and I couldn't get over how they would give each other such \\"noble\\" qualities without actually showing them. Rachel was crying most of the time, even though Rio described her as \\"brave\\", and Rio was supposed to be all \\"hard-hearted\\"...hardly. However, since this book was said to be a \\"super-natural\\" romance by some; I read it. I gave it 2 stars because I felt that it did hold more water than most romance fluff, but it didn't hold the plot standards to make it interesting enough or exciting enough to be good. If you are just interested in a cheesy romance, go ahead and read it. But if you want a good supernatural romance, I suggest you read the UNDEAD series by Mary Janice Davidson and the SOUTHERN VAMPIRE SERIES by Charlaine Harris. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love that Leopard","review":"This is my first book by author Christine Feehan - and you can bet I'll be reading more by her. This book grabbed my interest from the very first page and kept it to the very end. I loved it! And she even had me \\"worried\\" several times during the book that something bad would happen here, or here, or here. She definitely had me on the edge of my seat. And that doesn't happen often. And now that I know this book was one in a series, I'll search out the others of this particular series, as well as her other books. It's always so much fun to discover a \\"new\\" author - especially if she's already written lots of other books because you can go from one to another in quick succession."},{"rating":"2","title":"love to read","review":"this author is the best I've ever read. great details and sexy scenes that put right there with the main character. Christina makes you think you are the main character. The sex scenes are steamy and not for younger readers but they are very intense. she simply has a way with words, if you havent read anything by her then you are totally missing out she's gotta to be my favorite author yet can't wait for more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"my first feehan novel","review":"This was my first C. Feehan book and I was pleasantly surprised. I don't care if my books are reality or sci fi based as long as they are done well. She kept it in the scope of being beleivable and still you could relate to the different \\"human\\" and \\"primal animal\\" instincts going on. I enjoyed the chemistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunted and Hunter","review":"The mysterious Rachel captures my attention. However, The animal instincts of Rio holds me. Who is she? What is she hiding? Who is hunting her and why? They questions unfold about Rachel. Rio the loner leopard is attacked by a visitor(Rachel) in his own home. His cats attack Rachel leaving her vulnerable to infection and Rio's care. Rio has secrets of his own. Rio's honor and code reaches out to the hunted Rachel. Feehan reveals the beauty and dangers of the jungle. Rio and Rachel embrace their sensuality and revel in their passion. The brother sister relationship feels real and loving. The friendship, loyalty, honor, and responsibility between Drake, Joshua and Rio is 'to die for.' The ablity to acknowledge 'mistakes are possible' and 'people can change' leads to acceptance. The only reason I'm not 100% thrilled is that it doesn't equal the hungry passion of \\"Burning Wild.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved This Book","review":"I was getting a little tired of the Carpathians and have loved the Ghost Walker series. I ran across this book by accident, picked it up and started reading it and loved it! I found it hard to put it down. I kept waiting for Rachael's first shift. Actually it was sort of anticlimatic, but interesting. I think there are more in this series and I will be looking for the rest. I couldn't find anything not to like about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watse your time or money","review":"I don't normally write reviews but I had to make an exception this time... I was so disappointed with this book. It bored me from start to finish so much so that I had to force myself to finish it. The main characters had no real chemistry only a connection through past lives. Mid way through the book I kept thinking I got it they had a past connection you don't have to keep ramming it down my throat. The main character Rachel annoyed me because she seemed so one dimensional. The hero Rio didn't really make me want to do anything but feel sorry for him. The story seemed stilted and forced as if the author ran out of ideas so she kept repeating the same things over and over again ... Rachel has a secret, she doesn't know she's a shifter , she can't trust anyone and she loves Rio but can't trust him and she can't talk to him about her secret.... and oh yeah they were together in a past life.Bottom line don't buy this book, borrow it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - HOT!","review":"This is my first Christine Feehan book and it will not be my last. She is an excellent writer. All through the book, I felt like I was in the rain forest with Rio and Rachael. The descriptions are so good, I could almost feel the humidity and hear the sounds.I really enjoy paranormal novels and this one was excellent. She draws you into the world of the shape-shifters.This is definitely a must read keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I am not usually a big fan of paranormal books but this book was well written and completely captivating from the beginning! The only thing I would change is Rachel's reluctance in sharing her secrets... that slowed the book down a bit... BUT with that being said I didn't want the book to end, I felt like I was transported to the jungle and I too wanted to stay there and have my own Rio. I would have loved an epilogue telling whether or not they had children because at points in the story both Rachel and Rio had flash backs of having a child. A story of Drake would be a nice way to get back to the jungle!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas and Beyond Made Easy... Well, Almost","review":"The authors wrote a very insightful book on the theology of St. Thomas Aquinas. It is meant to be an introduction to his work but do not be fooled. It is not light reading so I would advise the reader to take their time and read it in \\"chunks.\\" It appears to be written in a prayerful spirit and their insights are so beautiful that it may cause the reader to pause and pray themselves. Hopefully, it will lead the reader to study St. Thomas further and directly. One would do well to also read the small book by Jean-Pierre Torrel,O.P. entitled \\"Aquinas's Summa: Background, Structure, and Reception.\\"However, in my opinion, I believe the authors are not merely presenting an introduction to the theology of St. Thomas Aquinas. They are also sharing their interpretation and development of some of his thought. This is not a bad thing; in fact, it is a good thing but it is difficult to discern which is St. Thomas and which is the authors' development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive product description","review":"In every description of this item it stated that it is a 10ft X 10ft shelter.

However, the maps printed in our copy of the 4th edition are unchanged from our copy of the 3rd edition, while the numbers in the text have changed as entries were added and deleted. As a consequence, the numbers on the maps often bear no relation to the numbers in the text, making the book less useful. Try to find the third edition -- not that much changed in the fourth edition -- or wait a few years for the fifth edition. It's a shame, the Access Guides are generally among the most useful for the casual tourist. Don't try looking at the URL given on the back cover of the 4th edition for corrections -- that web site has no content. E-mail to the publisher has not elicited an acknowledgement of the problem after ten days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baaad Guidebook -- Publisher doesn't care","review":"Do not buy this book!

I've always been satisfied with them and the price is right. Who cares if you lose one? Who cares if one stops working? Just get on with it and grab another. Well, last weekend, my wife and I were shopping in one of those huge warehouse stores and we found a 9-pack (12 pens each) of medium point, blue ink pens. The price was just ridiculously low (less than ten cents per pen). How could we pass this by? It's a good quality writing instrument and we'll get a lot of use out of them.Gary Peterson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure pleasure for serious jazz fans.","review":"Chain of Events is more a master class in contemporary jazz trio, than a simple listening experience. The depth of interaction and creative brilliance in these tracks is amazing. Genna, along with drummer Bill Jones and bassist Gary Mazzaroppi playfully toy with rhythm and harmony and present the listener with a challenge to keep up with them, using an almost video game-like complexity of energy. This session contains the musicianship and essence of musical magic that is so often missing or beyond the ability of many of today's artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Suspense","review":"This was a great book. I gave it 4 stars because I never give anything 5. This book was filled with suspense, action, terror, humor and love, all the things that make a great story. I found it great because it was true to life, but thrilling at the same time. The story is about Lara Bello an artist who is being followed by the man in the blue baseball cap and her husband Tony Bello a NYPD cop who is being left bodies of homeless people to find. I thought the characters were all true to life. The villians were not only well developed but even likable. The police information was accurate. My brother who is a police officer said it was right on the money. I highly reccomend this exciting novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and romantic. Pablo at his best.","review":"I am a huge fan of Pablo's I have 7 of his books and find his breathtaking way with words beautiful. I love poetry but am very fussy about what I like as some poetry can be boring but Pablo's is wonderful.This book is in English and Spanish, set out so that the Spanish version of the poem is on the left hand page and the English translatiomn is on the right. (very handy if you're learning Spanish!)You will find yourself lingering over his poetry as it creates beautiful images in your mind, it's very romantic and sensual.With lines like \\"Leaning into the afternoons I cast my sad nets towards your oceanic eyes\\" and \\"The light wraps you in its mortal flame\\" his descriptions and his way with words are wonderful.I highly recommend his love poetry and this is one of my favourites of his, he has even inspired me to make my work more sensual!Review by Juliette Westbrook-Finch, author ofThe Poetry of Passion (for People with a Pulse)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Introduction To Pablo Neruda","review":"If you have not read any of Pablo Neruda's poetry, this is a very good introduction.

In my opinion, the TRV5504 is the rules. It has a Ethernet connector built-in so you don't need adapters like you do with a TiVo. I also like the user interface much better. It might not be as fancy as the one of the TiVo, but in this case less is more. Another advantage is that the unit offers the 30 second skip (great for commercials) right out of the box. On a TiVo you have to use special codes to activate that feature. Other great features include the component output, streaming shows between multiple units and programming over Internet. After the first day, I said that this is the one gadget I will never give up again. The only minor disadvantage is that conflicts between scheduled recordings can occur due to a bad priority list. Overall it is still much better than any other PVR/DVR I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than TiVO","review":"Don't be fooled by the TiVo ads -- this is the real thing. Replay has made great strides in making their machine stable. It also lets you transfer shows to a computer without anything more than an ethernet cable and FREE software. Then you can burn it to a CD or DVD, or just tote it around on a laptop. Can TiVo do that? Nah. Replay also added a new feature that lets you skip around in your shows, similar to how you can skip around on a DVD. Can TiVo do that? Nope. If you have two Replays in the same house (like one upstairs and one downstairs), you can use one to watch shows recorded on the other. Can TiVo do that? Um . . . . nosiree!

I have both Tivo and Replay and while both are good, I really do prefer the ReplayTV. This is especially the case due to the fact that they have retained the commercial advance features that so many believed them to have dropped.

The replacement was a refurbished piece of junk. It would repeatedly freeze up and lock up.Called technical support again, unplugged all the cables and plugged them back in, did a factory default restore and a software upgrade, and it still didn't work.

I paid the high price of the old units, and get to pay the high registration fee of the new units. Unbelieveable.

You are missing this item and then that item,then your Activation key doesn't show up in their database even when I have been having service for the last 4 months and getting billing emails from them. Got the TIVO rebate in 6 weeks. Finally sent the last letter to them with a copy of my monthly bill, telling them if they can't get it right I will probably cancel service soon and get a Tivo. A week later they billed me for the next month and 2 days after that( a week after the warranty was done) my RePlay died, the AV plugs ins will not take a Video signal in.

Without a paid subscription you cannot record manually nor can you even view the programs that have been previously recorded. Simply put this device, without a monthly subscription, is useless. The subscription rate is an unnecessarily high $13/month (all you get are the listings and the privilege of using the device). If you choose to drop your subscription and then later desire to reactivate it that will cost you an additional $25. I'm sick of the money pit subscriptions that companies force you to sign up for.

This gets to my second question; if it will not work without the activation how do I return it?The reply: Thank you for contacting ReplayTV. You are correct, you will get a 3-day grace period to try out the unit. After this grace period and the unit has not been activated, the unit will cease to function.

Then on the morining of 12/29 the company de-activated my unit. According to them, their policies have changed and I'm now required to pay a subscription.

Instead there would be either a 299.99 fee for the lifetime of the unit, or a 12.95 per month charge. I called Circuit City and was told that the ad was in error, and is the result of a change in ReplayTV policy.

I have it networked with my brother's ReplayTV and we can use both to record and I can watch my brothers recorded shows through my box.

I'm not saying it is a bad company, I just see Tivo commercials more than ReplayTV.I haven't had a problem with it but....I hope ReplayTV would make a change so you don't have to use the Infrared blaster to change channels on DishNetwork boxes.

AND she still uses it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy construction","review":"I've had this toy for my cats for at least 14 years. The only thing I've had to replace is the cardboard insert.

It's hilarious to watch some cats' heads twirl while they are watching the ball spin in the track!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ball chase","review":"my cats LOVE this scratcher/ball chase combo.

She also loves to take brief naps on it, and will pile her toys on top of it, though she couldn't care less about the ball. The only downside is that it tends to scoot across my wooden floor, but my cat just braces her back paws against it and scratches away without any concern. Overall a product I would highly recommend, especially if you have a catnip lover.For the people who say their cats totally ignore it, try being patient. The cat I grew up with took literally 3+ years to take any interest in his turbo scratcher, but now he'll scratch on it, sleep on it and play with the ball. Cats are fickle, what can I say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat LOVES this thing!!","review":"My cat LOVES this thing!!

The indoor cat thinks this was the best invention ever made with or without cat nip added. The 2 other cats are in love with it, but one of them swears there is an animal going around and around that he must catch and catch it NOW!!!!The indoor cat uses it all the time to scratch with no nip added. I'm surprised sometimes since he really enjoys doing it. The other 2 do not use it since they can find a tree when they are out side a few hours a day.The only draw back is if you put this on a wood floor since it can be loud with the ball whipping around. The problem is corrected if the toy is put on carpet.Oh, do not give up hope if your cat doesn't play with it right away. Just add the nip once and over time they will wonder what that is and figure out the ball moves.Have FUN!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hit with the cats!","review":"My cats LOVE this toy. They can scratch it, play with the ball, watch the other cat play with the ball, or just sit in the middle so the other cat can't play with it - hours of fun for cats.This is one of those toys that all cats love - and is inexpensive enough to replace when they scratch out the middle (which they will - because they love it!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitten won't even look at it!","review":"This was a total waste of money as it just takes up space and is ignored by my little kitten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"My cat has played for hours with this toy and as the ball does not come out it can never be lost.

After only a few weeks with this, he is now trained to \\"get his ball\\" and will come running if we start it along the track without him.

Simple or not, it is a hit that never gets old with the kitties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cat scratcher/toy","review":"I own three of these and keep them placed around my home. The cats use this scratcher instead of using the sofa or rug. They also have a blast playing with the spinning ball. It's not just a good way to keep the cat/cats from scratching your furniture but a great game for them to play with. If you have more then one cat, they actually play together with the spinning ball. Fun to watch -- Fun for the cats -- and it saves your rugs and furniture!!! GREAT Product!!!! You will have to keep replacing the round scratch pads every month or so. I just put the old scratch pad insert into the paper recycling bin & just replace the center scratch pad and your good to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ollie very, very happy","review":"I did have problems opening the packaging owing to a couple of extra paws trying to help- my cat Ollie was almost frantic to get to it so I would say that this item is a definite hit.

So now we have 2 very happy kitties and peace in the house again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the GREATEST gift I have bought my kitten","review":"My kitten loves this toy. She plays with it all the time....it is so great! This is by far the best gift I have bought for her. It keeps her so busy and so entertained. It is SO much fun to watch her play with it. She hasn't learned to use the middle as a scratching post but I think that will come with time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Product, But My Cats Prefer the Bergan Star Chaser","review":"This is a okay product, but my cats don't play with it. However, I recently purchased theBergan Star Chaser(by the same company) and my cats LOVE that one! The main difference is it has a lighted ball. This one does not.The concept is the same in both Bergan products: a central scratching post area, a track, a ball, and catnip. The lighted ball in the Star Chaser does not stay lit continuously. It only lights up for a few seconds after your cat bats at it. This makes it very exciting for your cat! Even my 18-year-old deaf cat watches the Star Chaser. The Turbo Scratcher with the plain ball lacks that excitement factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, if your cat will use it","review":"In general, my cat Loves toys, as well as scratching things. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to transfer to the turbo scratcher. She will use it occasionally (rarely).. but for the most part it just takes up space. I tried adding some catnip, too, but that didn't seem to help. From the reviews, it seems most cats love them. It looks like a lot of fun, I just don't understand why she doesn't play with it.EDIT: I loaded this thing up with catnip a few times a day for about a week and now my cat uses it occasionally. Even still, it's rare for her to hit the ball.. but she does sometimes. She mostly likes to scratch. Maybe that's because the cardboard is now loaded with catnip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cats not interested","review":"This toy did not do it for any of my three cats.

Ever!","review":"The day I brought this home, all four of our cats stood around enraptured with it, despite the fact that two of the cats hate each other. It gets played with by each cat, every day.

Perfect for some good fun....I will say they never use the scratching part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, frequently used","review":"Purchased this toy from a local pet store. Great buy. Our kitten loves to play with the toy and she uses the scratch pad in the middle fairly frequently. It's the perfect toy to keep her occupied when she is by herself. It also provides her good exercise, as she likes to get the ball with a running attack. She has not lost interest after a month and a half. We had to remove the toy from the bedroom because the sound of the ball rolling in the track would wake us up at 3AM. Most valuable cat toy so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for some cats","review":"The product is good quality although it doesn't entertain my cats very much outside of the catnip that came along with it.

I've had one for the past 10 years and it has been great & held up well. All the cats I've had have loved it. Even an older less playful cat will at least use it for scratching.

In fact, she batted it around a couple of times and then walked away. I had to BEG her to play with it, which she obliged a few times then went on to bigger and better things, like the extension cord. My cat is very active, very playful, and not a couch potato. The cardboard stuff in the middle----she just sits on it, she is not compelled to scratch on it at all. She much prefers my couch, much to my disappointment, I was hoping to distract her with this contraption. The construction of this product is not great, but it's a cat toy, and it's $12 so not very high expectations anyway. It will certainly suffice, but sadly, my cat is not going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine product, but Cat has no interest","review":"Seems to be of good quality, however the cat has no interest in it.

Needless to say my cat is not interested because it doesn't spin, it just moves a little can get stuck in the specific spots. Worst of all, I am getting a message saying there's a \\"Problem with your request\\" when I try to use the Amazon refund page. I just emailed Amazon, so we'll see. Btw, I normally get cat toys from Ross that my cat LOVES for like $2 to $5 dollars, which are brand name Purina toys, so this thing, being $12.51 was \\"expensive\\" and defective AND I am having issues returning it.

She's way too damn cool for a piece of plastic with a ball that weighs five times as much as the foam balls she'd much rather kick around like the awesome little soccer player that she is.She just loves scratching the couch. I've rubbed lemon/lime/orange zest on it, I've put double-sided tape on it, I've even duct-taped the cat scratcher replacement pads on the areas she scratches. She still finds a place on the couch to scratch, and if I try bringing her to the scratcher right as she starts to scratch the couch, she gives me this look like \\"I'm over it. Nice try though.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toy that will keep your cat busy","review":"My 8 month old kitten loves this. The first thing he does when he wakes up in the morning is use the scratch pad in the center. Then he enjoys batting the ball around the track. It keeps him occupied for quite a while each time he plays with it. It's a great toy and scratching pad in one. It keeps him from scratching the furniture too! It includes some catnip to sprinkle in the center to attract your cat. I'm very happy with this purchase. I'm ordering the replacement pads too because this is one I think he'll be using for a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbo Scratcher Cat Toy","review":"I received this today and the new kittens haven't stopped playing with it! They love it. The ball keeps them active as they chase it, and the scratch pad is good for working out their claws and AVOIDING damage to my furniture.

They have both played non-stop with the turbo scratcher since it arrived.

My one year old cat Lulu is still a play-baby and loves this thing. She went for it immediately. She's an 'only' cat and although I love to play w/ her it is ever so nice to have a toy that she plays w/ on her own.I must admit that my only 'criticism' is that I received the turbo charger in a truly unfortunate (to me) royal blue color but then, one is warned the 'colors may vary'...I understand though why they don't show this color in the ads. None the less, this is a real winner"},{"rating":"2","title":"CAT-AEROBICS! :)","review":"This cat toy is FANTASTIC! I don't think there is a single cat out there that can resist it. My two cats lunged at it in about two seconds as soon as I gave the ball a little shove to get their attention. They played with it together for about ten minutes straight and it was so amusing to watch them really get all energized over this toy jumping and slapping the ball to each other. They come play with it every time I pull it from the corner of the room.The cat scratcher middle is fantastic as well. I don't have a scratching post so when ever they start getting frisky and clawing my upholstered chairs I just slide out the scratcher and they immediately use that instead! Fantastic toy ...buy one for yourself and any friends who may have a sweet feline!I've had mine since August 2010 and im now on to the second side of the scratching card in case you're wondering if to get extras. You'll have some happy cats with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess some cats are just not interested.","review":"I bought this item after reading all the positive reviews.

She was very timid, whereas my first cat is outgoing, and was bullying her. The rescuer said that she has seen cats get so caught up in playing with this toy that they forget to be enemies...I haven't seen my cats playing with this *together* yet, but they each love it, despite their very different personalities. Both love to bat the ball around, scratch the cardboard, and sit in the middle. This is especially remarkable considering that my shy cat doesn't even bat an eye when I wave very tempting feather toys in front of her, which the outgoing cat would go ga-ga for.This ball track toy is much sturdier than those offered by other brands. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbo scratcher great for kitten","review":"This toy is a must for anyone who has an adult cat and then adopts a doozy of a kitten. When all little Jupiter wants to do is play attack older sis Olive, the turbo scratcher is the only toy that can distract him. Then, a half hour later, we realize he is still there, mesmerized, watching the ball go round and round the track. Can't speak to it's ability to keep older cats entertained though; Olive is SO above the T.S. Only seen her paw at it once. Oh, and ours is blue.

My cat loves to sit, scratch, sleep, play, and do just about anything on this thing. It's large, but not intrusive, and stores nicely under a piece of furniture if company is over. It comes with a small (very small) baggie of cat nip that really sends my cat into a frenzy when she's playing with this thing. The ball is about the size of a golf ball, and although some reviewers have mentioned the ball coming out easily, that hasn't been my ( my cat's) experience. She bats the ball pretty aggressively at times and it stays put. One potential drawback would be having this on tile or hardwood floors. There is no padding or rubber backing under the toy, and if on a non-carpeted surface, it's easy for a cat (or dog) to push the toy around; in fact, it would be all over the place. Overall, this toy has cured my cat's incessant meowing out of boredom and that makes me happy :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"complete waste of money for MY cat","review":"I bought this after reading the glowing reviews here.

The scratching part itself is easy to take off and flip over, so each one you can use twice. With two cats, I'd say the scratcher lasts a good 2 months per side which is good for how small it is.It does make some noise when the cats roll it around.

This came in the mail today and my cats can't get enough of it. Without the catnip even! Daisy laid across it as if he was saying Mine Mine! He was batting at the ball and trying to bite it. Sayeh was rolling over in front of it, hitting the ball and then putting his paw on it. Twix who is reserved had a blast with it. I have to get another. There are going to be fights over this toy. My house is going to be a mad house with all the turbo tracks around."},{"rating":"1","title":"my cats didn't respond","review":"The reviews for this product were glowing but my cats didn't respond to it. My male kitten played with it briefly; the female never even came near it. It is quite large and clutters up the room. So I eventually threw it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Cat or Defective Product?","review":"I just received this cute toy however my cat has already managed to remove the ball from the ring. I didnt think the ball could be removed by a cat, but it was. I do not own a lion, tiger or cheetah. I own a regular house cat. My question is, do I own a Super Cat or is the product I received defective?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 6 cats love it!","review":"From the beginning when I took it out of the box my 2 year old and 7 year old cats couldn't stop playing with it. At first they all shared it nicely and took turns. However, once they saw how much fun it actually was one of them would sit on top of it and sleep so while they're napping no one else could play with it, lol. So they turned it into a playing/sleeping sort of thing. They love scratching on the center and prefer the turbo scratcher rather than my new furniture! thank goodness. I am definitely buying about 2-3 more just so they don't have to wait their turns. It's inexpensive and yet effective =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cat #1 loved it right away, cat #2 warming to it","review":"Out of the box one of the cats got very excited about the Bergen Turbo Scratcher. At first cat #2 ignored it, but after a week or so she's started playing with it, too. Originally I rated this as 4 stars but if I could add another star to my review I would. The toy is sturdy, the ball is heavy (not a ping pong ball) and with it's low profile I can slide it under the sofa or coffee table to put it away when company is over. I like this product and recommend it, however there is a risk (as with any cat toy) that your cat may love it or leave it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a MUST have if your furry kids scratch the furniture!","review":"I have three \\"kids\\" who, sad to say, have a tendency to claw the furniture. This is without a doubt the best alternative they have found. After trying a number of other scratching pads, they keep returning to this one. AND the very good thing is the durability of the scratching pad itself. Other products were getting torn to shreds, literally all over the house, and the cats... or they weren't getting used at all. Replacement pads are available, but so far I haven't had to replace one. Oh, and once in awhile, they play with the ball in the track. Definitely try this Turbo Scratcher... purrrrr"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy kitties","review":"So far our kitties love this, especially the ball. They haven't taken to the scratching pad quite yet, but hopefully soon. Our's is a navy blue color which was just fine with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"My 4 month old kitten bats at it and plays a little with it, but he prefers the 4' cloth tube (he loves that) and small mice with shaky things inside, as well as a bunch of browhn crinkly paper stacked up in a corner - he runs and jumps into it and when he turns to walk away, the brown paper makes a sound and he jumps back in - the cheapest cat toy ever. Every cat/kitten is different, but this just bores my kitten. He likes to bite and claw his prey and this does not satisfy that craving. He has NEVER touched the scratcher either and he is a horizontal scratcher. He prefers carpet, rugs and uses a flat mat scratcher I bought for him. I guess you just have to get to know what your cat likes first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very noisy","review":"This toy is VERY noisy. Not recommended if you live in a small place. Is not very sturdy or stable, either--the cats move it across the floor when they play with it. They like the ball, and sitting on the center, but have not seen either cat use it center bit as a scratching surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cat toy!","review":"This is one of the few toys that my cats actually use, and it helps me out by giving them something to scratch! It doesn't take up too much space on the floor, and they love pawing the ball and using the scratching center. I wish the replacement pads were cheaper, but that hasn't stopped me from buying another turbo scratcher or replacement pads! Give this a chance-your kitty will thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have TWO of these & LOVE it, BUT...","review":"I live in a home with 19 cats (indoor/outdoor) an 6 dogs. All are rescued and spayed/neutered. Finding ways to keep all these little critters occupied is time consuming. A friend shipped me one of these a few months ago and my cats have loved it from the moment it came out of the wrapper! There are two drawbacks to the design of the scratcher, however. (1) The replacement pads CAN be removed by the cats if they shred the cardboard (and they will). (2) The ball with the laser in it is incredible (!) but it is EASILY REMOVED by an ornery cat. Be prepared to have extra chaser balls around because they quickly disappear and it's difficult to find them unless you move every bit of furniture to find them. Still highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cat toy ever","review":"I bought this as a toy for my kitten Shinzo and he absolutely loves it. This is his favorite toy by far. He even enjoys using the scratching post in the center of the toy. However, I did not purchase this product from amazon because pet smart had it for two dollars more then what is advertised here. Definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for cats","review":"The cats love this thing. The ball seems to come out more than my old ones did, but it is doing its job. Got it in good time & was just what I ordered. They use this one lots more than the one that is supposed to file their claws. They won't touch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kitty Toy","review":"This is a great and inexpensive toy for the curious cat. My cat spins the ball around for 10 minutes several times each day. The center is for scratching. You can put cat nip in the middle to really get the cats attention. For the price it is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"saved my sanity","review":"I was looking for a kitty toy with movement for my new kitty. I needed something to hold his attention other than my pet bird Lefty. The price was reasonable and the reviews were positive. With Amazon Prime, the Turbo Scratcher arrived in two days. What a difference! Instead of chastising my new kitty for hanging off the bird's cage, kitty played happily with the Turbo Scratcher and then fell asleep behind the bird's cage. Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat Couldn't Care Less","review":"My cat means business when he's playing. He will jump 5 feet in the air, grab the toy with his paws and shove it in his mouth before he hits the ground. And once it's in his mouth, pulling it out is a tug of war accompanied by growling and glares. He does not mess around. I've always thought it was a good thing for local wildlife that he's an indoor cat.If that sounds like your cat, then he probably won't be interested in plastic ball rolling in a predictable path. My cat scratched it a couple of times, batted at the ball a little, and then walked away in search of more challenging, erratic prey. But overall quality is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"We purchased this for our 2 one year olds and they love it. We have found this to be a great toy and entertainment. We purchased another for our daughter's 2 cats as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth it!","review":"Got this toy for my cat about a year ago. He still loves to play with it and he plays with it every single day. The middle scratching part does come apart after a while, but I was pleased to see that you can get replacements, which easily click right into the toy. I got him a new replacement scratcher today and put a little catnip on it, knocked it into the holes, and he is in heaven playing with it again. It may seem a little pricey for a cat toy, but it is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat loves her Turbo Scratcher!","review":"I was a little skeptical only because my cat has never been one to play with toys, but her scratching my furniture was getting out of hand, so I went ahead and ordered this. She's been playing with it for almost 20 minutes now, ever since I took it out of the box! It satisfies her need to scratch and I love watching her play with the ball. I only wish I'd bought it sooner. I did buy a couple of refills because I think the cardboard will wear out quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"ChemE Undergrad view","review":"This book isn't bad, but it does leave a lot to be desired. I was hoping for a comprehensive desk reference on commands, syntax, and maybe even suggestions on strong and concise code for frequently used and frequently problemmatic routines (ie, iterations and for if elseif until stuff). If you are also looking for this, DON\\"T GET THIS BOOK. If you have some limited programming knowledge and just want to get an overview of Matlab so you can play with it, this would be a fine book. It's written so that it is meant to be used hand in hand with the often inscrutable matlab help files. But if you need a more authoritative source for lengthier and more difficult programs, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bizarre, but not in a good way","review":"I don't mind bizarre in a kid's book, usually, in fact, I love it---books with wacky pictures and weird ideas. However, the bizarre world has to have some internal reasoning and structure. This one doesn't. A girl, for no reason explained, decides to eat a TV for dinner. She eats it bit by bit, saving the remote for last, gets a little sick to her stomach, recovers, and then plans to eat her house. That's it. The pictures are detail-filled, but don't really add much to the story and don't have the kind of details kids notice or linger over. It doesn't bother me she eats a house or TV, but WHY? This is just pure out-there without any plot or reason, and my kids were just perplexed, not really interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"woefully misunderstood and underappreciated","review":"The young Norah Labiner has given us a novel about a first time novelist that has ironically damned itself with its own complexity. Her aspiring novelist, Pearl, makes all the mistakes an intelligent, hyperliterary, naive first novelist would make... but the mistakes are Labiner's intention. It is Pearl, not Labiner, who has created a \\"novel of promise, undone by ambition.\\" Labiner, in turn, has created a book that just may be brilliant and is certainly extraordinary in its subject matter, its language, its humor, and its depth . It deserves much more than the casual reading most critics will give it."},{"rating":"2","title":"life changing and then some","review":"I read the first few lines again, but I have to put it down. It takes the air from inside me. I have to walk. I feel as though I am on the verge and each word is a precipice I am so anxious to leap from. Teeming with the mulitiplicity of being I am overhwlemed. I leave after the first few lines to savor over the next few miles of walking frantically the thoughts it has turned over me, exposing so many dark roots to the sun. The author never lets you know which of the narrative rides you are on, the same way in life we never whose stories we are telling: our own, our own authored by us, our own authored by us but told by another to ourselves. Superb new fiction, metafiction, and prose style. Makes you questions if we posess an authentic voice, and then get excited by the possibilities of that question, even if the answer is no, we don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"too convoluted equals failure, not extraordinary genius","review":"Clearly beloved by reviewers, who were willing to take wordy, empty prose as mark of genius, this tiresome book was made barely tolerable by the movement from character to character in no definable order - and occasionally the characters were engaging for a few pages. The draw towards some kind of unifying conclusion or a return to those lucid intervals did carry me through to the unremarkable finale. Perhaps to those steeped in the English Lit department, the subtle references to classic novels would be enough to titillate, but as is I find this a definite first novel of an author who has promise that shines through in turns of phrase and character development, but whose verbiage and, perhaps, project for the novel overwhelm the end result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio but not for Kindle!","review":"I bought this book only because it is sold for Kindle and (I thought) featured audio.

The symphonic version on this CD is excellent. For me, that alone is worth the price. The other tidbits are pleasant enough, though short.

Some people just don't pay attention when buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disapointment","review":"Yes, this disc has some stunning music...about 2 minutes per selection of it.

The writing was terrible. The clues as to the killer were so obvious, you knew who he was in the first couple of chapters. In addition, the phrase :Oh, My God\\" and it's variations were used to express every emotion from suprise to disgust to dispair - over and over again. I had to force myself to finish reading it just to see if maybe I had been wrong about how the murderer was. Unfortunately, I wasn't. Sala has written so many good books but if I had read this one first, I would never have bought another one.

In the midst of the chaos, the hero bodyguard and the heroine writer fall softly and gently in love.The mystery part had me guessing on the identity and motive of the killer.Sala is a master story teller.

Great ensemble cast, in a strange, but possibly hilarious premise. I was dead wrong. I know that there are a lot of critics that knock movies like Grandma's Boy for being dumb \\"stoner\\" comedies, so thats why I never listen to their opinions; I watch for myself. But in this case, I should have taken their advice. This movie is absolutely HORRIBLE. With the great comedic talents that are in this movie, it absolutely amazes me how it manages to never gain any momentum. The characters are just weird and the plot is absurd, and there is maybe 1 or 2 jokes in the entire movie that actually land. So for all of these people who are telling you that this movie is \\"just like Grandma's Boy\\", I have to disagree. That movie was funny. Strange Wilderness is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's FUNNY! Don't let the dullards fool you!","review":"Okay, people, this movie was hilarious!

It had it's clever moments, but altogether, I just didn't find myself laughing very much. Maybe it would have been more fun if I had watched it with a group of friends. The plot, also, seemed really thrown together.There is one thing that almost makes this movie worth all of the bad stoner jokes for me - the laughing shark scene.

General Bradley has an easy style of writing. He's objective, yet unabashedly loyal to his own forces. He does not hide his occasional criticism of Montgomery, yet quickly gives praise in the same breath. As Bradley says in the beginning of the book, he felt compelled to \\"set the record straight\\" and provide reasoning for his decisions that may not have been clear to either the war correspondents or the foot soldier under his command. Although some similar descriptions can come off dry, the author injects enough anecdotal humor that I found myself smiling or quietly chuckling several times. I also recommend \\"An Army At Dawn\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"No wonder Monty drove Patton nuts!","review":"After watching the movie Patton more times than I can remember, I FINALLY got to buying Gen'l Bradley's book. The new Modern Library reprint is nicely done. The maps are good and you'll notice how much more real estate the U.S. army gained as compared to Monty sauntering along the coast road. Also, within the U.S. forces, it's amazing how Patton's 3rd army gained ground and killed Germans.Bradley writes well and this is terrific summary of the North African, Sicilian and European battles.After reading this, I can see why two seemingly different people, Patton and Bradely, got along so well with each other in Europe.

The details listed in this book were given in a manner that made it easy to understand and process with the text. I felt that even though this was a history book that it read with the prose of a novel. I have read many history books on both the war in the pacific and in europe and have never seen a book that got into the why's of what was going on.

It does take a good amount of caution in lifting the kayak up; you always have the feeling it could easily tip and fall off the extension.If you're not quite certain you could get the kayak up, even with this assistance, you're probably better off paying for one of Thule's more expensive 'lift assist' models.If you just need that 'little extra assistance' to load the kayak, these are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but worth the money","review":"I bought this one together with theSwagman Yakart Kayak Cart, and they work together well at a reasonable price. See my separate review for the cart.When I first bought the Kayak, they helped me load it on my minivan. Once we got home, my wife and I had quite some trouble to get it down and inside. I was wondering whether I could ever get it on the water. The cart and outrigger took care of the problem.The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that, it is sort of weak. I wouldn't use it alone to load my 75lb Hobie Odyssey. I cut a wood rod of 1.5x2, at the length from the Outrigger to the ground. Before I use the outrigger, I pull it out and tie the wood rod to the outer end, to give it the extra support. In addition to the strength (or lack of), I think it has a design flaw, that putting too much weight on the extended outrigger can cause problem for your roofrack as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truly outstanding recording","review":"This is breathtaking music that's a fantastic inspiration for contemporary musicians/DJs like David Holmes and Dimitri from Paris. Herrmann's ability to create memorable, short motifs prefigures the scratch'n'mix styles of contemporary music. You'll most likely have already heard much of this music as samples. And it's powerfully emotional. A superb recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, rushed, perfunctory performances with altered orchestrations.","review":"These recordings are ALL WRONG. The music is pushed and rushed, with Salonen's typical efficiency, but he doesn't let the music or the orchestra BREATHE. Listen to Herrmann conducting this same music and it's VERY clear. Also, in the Torn Curtain cut, the orchestration has been altered, due to the producer being CHEAP. Originally, Herrmann called for NINE trombones, grouped in threes, one open, the other two muted with different mutes, straight and mega. The idea was to produce a kaleidoscopic vamp of three trombone chords of different colors. THIS IS NOT ON THIS RECORDING. The only place to hear it is on the original soundtrack.Don't waste your money on this. The Taxi Driver music is so sexless it's pathetic. UGH... This is the worst recording of Herrmann's music I own... and I have the SACD...Stick with the original composer-directed recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate and misleading","review":"This book claims to offer complete original language texts. Unless Borodin, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov and Tchaikovsky wrote their operas for Italian librettists, and Smetana for a German one, this is quite untrue. Where I have been able to check the translations against others, or can follow the original language myself, the translations offered are wooden and pretty inadequate. There appear to be extensive cuts in the libretti given, so that the book can hardly be described as complete. The choice of operas is somewhat strange. Only three by Mozart (not Cosi or Entfuhrung), but all ten of Wagners!). I purchased this book because I find nowadays that the print on the libretti given with CDs is becoming harder to read. While this book is rather clearer, the defects that I have outlined above make it in my view a very poor buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift for an opera lover","review":"I bought this book and had it shipped to my grandmother for Christmas - thanks to Amazon.com.

This book contains an element of these experiences, however it is a very different book about cancer. Practical concerns such as charts for medication, breaking the news to the family,telling friends how they can help, as well as a very personal experience in the day to day and hour to hour care of someone who is terminally ill - all are related in a very straight-forward manner from someone who has been through it all. Not a depressing book, rather one that relates the simple joys and sharing experiences during the last stages of the life. Jeri Lampman writes from the viewpoint of someone who has been both a caretaker and a cancer patient herself. Hers is a story of amazing courage and inspiration, a true testament to survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mountains","review":"This CD is really cool. Very different types of ambient sounds.

I wanted another unit to put in another room in the house, so ended up purchasing this unit -- it was only a little more money but had some cool extra features (humity, heat index, etc...). BUT this unit comes with just a wireless temperature sensor that does NOT detects humidity levels so the humidity percentage readout in the center of the screen along with the heat index and other features DO NOT WORK unless you buy a different sensor!! The manual tells you half the features do not work unless you buy a different sensor than is included and provides the model number (sorry, I dont have it, I already returned the unit with it's manual)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and Unpredictable","review":"This instrument is a joke. It comes with a base and a remote sensor unit (temp only) and the accuracy of the temp readings is way off. The remote sensor reports temps consistently 2 - 6 degrees too high and neither the base or the remote can be calibrated sooooo you're just stuck with an inaccurate instrument. Even set side-by-side, the temp readings from the base differ from the readings of the remote sensor by 2 - 4 degrees!The instructions are some of the worse I have ever encountered. The website offers no additional help at all. The radio communication between the remote sensor and the base is poor and unreliable. The lag time between actual ambient temp and sensor readings can be upwards of 10 - 20 minutes! So if you are watching for rain changing to ice or snow be aware that the displayed temp is perhaps twenty minutes behind reporting the actual temperature.Overall, an inaccurate and unreliable instrument good for - what?

Author Paula LaRocque is one of those few and shares her knowledge in her book \\"The Book on Writing: The Ultimate Guide to Writing Well\\". She divides the book up into three sections - A Dozen Guidelines to Good Writing, Storytelling, and Language and Writing Mechanics.

She quickly finds herself in trouble (before she even makes it to her destination), and she learns that she is often too innocent for her own good.In the first book of the Diamond of the Rockies series, Heitzmann weaves a story full of suspense and romance.

The kids were even excited about putting their clothes in the correct sorter as well! It is so much easier to do laundry, before it would pile up with all colors and fabrics mixed together while we 'picked' what we put in the washer.

But, buyer beware! When I loaded this set into iTunes I noticed that it referenced disc 1 of 3 and 2 of 3. Apparently iTunes knew what I didn't - there is a third BBC disc. I dug a little deeper and found another \\"Jam at the BBC\\" set on Amazon that features three discs - another 18 tracks. The cost is only 21.99 for a used set (much higher for a new set). The other set is listed as an import (which my two disc copy also was stickered on the shrink wrap), but as of this review had not yet been reviewed.

The only weaknesses are the lack of material from Sound Affects and a horrible horn sound on the later performances. If the liner notes didn't give credit to the horn players, it would be very easy to assume the horn section was actually a Casio keyboard.Aside from the cheesy horns, every track is full of energy and fire. In particular, the songs from All Mod Cons and Setting Sons hugely benefit from the stripped down, no BS attack of live Jam. The influence of the Who on Paul Weller has never been more explicit--the Jam is truly the second coming of \\"Maximum R&B;\\", down to the perfect cover of \\"Sweet Soul Music\\".Overall, this is a must for any Jam fan, not just completists, and would serve as a fine introduction to the band for anybody not familiar with them.

On multiple systems (vista 32-bit and windows 7 64-bit), one needs to go into the management utility, switch it into 16-bit mode, then run the audio test before any sound will play.

The only time I've noticed a lost signal is when there is electrical interference with the computer (ie plugging another appliance into same outlet.I mainly use it to play music or movie audio from my laptop to my stereo.

My only gripe is that it could come down in price a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound quality, but unstable and does not support newer operating systems","review":"The sound quality is great. It has more complete I/O options than other small USB audio interfaces. But this thing does not seem to be treated seriously by the manufacturer, and is essentially ignored by its development team. It's been on the market for several years and has never had a usable driver for Vista. For a long time, they had a beta driver which was dangerously unstable and would not only fail to work but would cause sudden blue screen death of the computer. Three years after the release of Vista, they finally posted an official driver, but it could not be installed properly at all. I don't think the companies is supporting this product at all. So buyers be aware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable","review":"Typical of USB interfaces, the transit is quite simply unstable. At best, it loads your audio with dropouts, at worst it quits working altogether until it is reset.

Don't waste your time with the transit or any other USB interface, go firewire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works after a bit of fiddling","review":"I'm using this to get audio out of a Mac Mini, which I'm using to stream DVD content.

The title A Delusion of Satan depicts and puts into a sentence the entirety of this book. Frances Hill takes the human imagination and fills it with thoughts and vivid pictures. It seems as if the trials happened just days ago. She brings each character to life giving each of them their own distinct character and personalities. The book brings back to life the reality of the trials and the outcome of the accused. Frances Hill's extroadinary writing jumps at you with her vivid words depicting every word and step that the accusers took. The way the accusers accused each of their victims and the results of the so called spells that were cast. This author is very compelling very vivid and very drawn to the imagination. I rater her 5 stars for her excellent writing and depiction of the Salem Witch trials."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Anatomy of Religious and Cultural Hysteria","review":"Before I read this work I was unaware of the amount of documentation that existed on the Salem witch trials. Ms. Hill takes this data and presents it in a cohesive flowing manner that draws the reader right into those terrible years.Her analysis of the social and political aspects; detailed sketches of the players in the horrifc drama; and discriptions of the remarkable cruelty and inhumanity that superstition, self righteousness, and strictly controlled cultural repression generates is spellbinding.Beyond this, it has applicability to our times: fanatical unquestioning devotion to a \\"truth\\", whether secular or religious, can lead otherwise well meaning people to commit terrible acts. We are well served to remember that.Excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get into it","review":"I am a huge reader, I love history, but I just can't get into this book. It's well written. Starts off pretty slow. I wanted to love this book, but couldn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Straight Ahead, Recommended Narrative Account","review":"Frances Hill does what her subtitle (A Full Story of the Salem Witch Trials) promises. In a Delusion of Satan, the author tells the grippping and horrifying story from beginning to end in a fast-paced narrative that takes the reader through every pertinent detail. Along the way, she discusses motives, both psychological and material, that may have influenced the participants, as well as briefly glancing at the number of theories that have arisen in our more modern times. The author does not provide a large historical context in which to slide the events into, perhpas, but she does give just enough details to keep this story comprehensible and fascinating. The book does not dwell on modern analogies (they are too painfully obvious, at any rate). A recommended look at this terrible time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive book about the Salem Witch Trials!","review":"Throughout history man has been plagued by one common trait, fear. Fear is the core of the Salem Witch Trial and this book is a true masterpiece in documenting that fact.From my days is history class I was taught about the Salem Witch Trials, but what high school history failed to cover this book made up for. I was impressed by the author's meticulous attention to detail.You'll read about how a small community in Salem Massachusetts, in 1691 was transformed from a conservative and rigid Puritanical society into mass hysteria by the ranting of a group of young girls.Read the horrifying details of how these girls charged a black slave that turn the lives of 19 men and women in mass murder by hanging. I am truly thankful to have the opportunity to review this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An author with a more than obvious ulterior motive","review":"Francis Hill gives us a backlash attack on childhood incest and abuse in the guise of a book on the Salem Witch trials. She fails to stick to her stated topic and comes back again and again to her feebly argued case.She bases much of her analysis of the witch trials on guesswork that she calls common sense. She argues Tituba's morals are lax on the basis of the fact that Tituba was not a Puritan and not on any first hand accounts of her that have come down to us, for example. Her research is sparce, her thesis unproven. She fails to cite evidence for her claims.The main thrust of this book, on the rare occasions the author stays to her stated thrust, is a psychological analysis of the persons involved in and events leading to the Salem witch craze. Not only is the author not a psychologist, psychoanalyst or psychologist, she fails to consult such an expert relying instead on supposition and hunches.This book isn't worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was...","review":"This smells like someone's agenda. Maybe living in Ann Arbor made my angry-radical-secular-feminist detector go off before I gave this book a fair shake, but this seems like a revision of the standard take on what happened. Probably a good read if that's what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting read","review":"If you've visited Salem and read \\"The Crucible\\" and still want to know more about the Salem witch trials, this book is for you. It's history, but reads like a novel (truth is actually more interesting than fiction in this case)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Creepy, Very Inflammatory","review":"Just got finished reading this. When I first started I didn't know what to expect. Frances Hill is a very good writer, however I think she tends to go overboard when she posits what certain people \\"must have thought\\" or certain things that \\"must have happened.\\" In other words she draws too many minor conclusions based upon her own beliefs and religious opinions.If you can stomach that...it was noticeable to me but didn't stop me from enjoying the book...A Delusion of Satan will be an informative, enjoyable read. If that type of author interjection gets you down you probably want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for history of Salem witch trials.","review":"Frances Hill presents a mildly entertaining but historically deficient analysis of the Salem witch scare of 1692. Focusing primarily on factional and familial conflict as the cause of the devastating craze, Hill neglects to give adequate attention to other, more plausible explanations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite informative, but dreadfully boring","review":"This book appears to be a well researched product, but it is very poorly written.

In other words, real Christmas music about the birth of Christ!Christopher Parkening and Kathleen Battle work so well together; flawless guitar accompanyment for a beautiful operatic voice. I can see that I will add more of their music to my collection. This is such a refrershing break form all the other noise that attempts to pass itself off for Christmas music.I did find one tech issue with this recording. It is a little low on gain.

Sadly, I have another Leslie DVD package that has from 1 to 4 miles and the 3rd and 4th are the same two routines. Oh well. I do like the three-with stretchie band, and the 4 mile challenge. It's Leslie and her gang and there is no 'boosted' walking. Instead it is a heavy duty workout that still has me sweating and feeling I've got a good routine for the day. Be careful if you have WATP Ultimate Collection, though, you will have a duplicate DVD with 3 and 4 miles."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout but take note stretchie not needed for both","review":"Please note the 2nd workout on here doesnt use the stretchie. Also (and I know I have seen comments on this before) but it finally happened to me. I now have the same workout repackaged differently. I have the 1st workout on here in VHS form & it's a green cover. I was hoping the 2nd one was a 4 mile with the stretchie but nope.I like the workouts especially the 2nd because she uses some new patterns including double kickbacks which I have never seen on her any of the others.Also the pacing is really nice on the 4 mile so you can get through it! Total time is about 58 minutes. So definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"This is a really great workout.

She had played a leading role in Midsummer's Night two year's ago at her St. Paul elementary school. The experience won her over to Shakespeare. Since I didn't start reading Shakespeare before age 18, I wondered if Coined by Shakespeare would be too far out-of-tune with the romance novels that she was devouring. Well, I've read it now. It is a dandy. A real banger, as Hardy would put it. Rarely does a scholarly book meet the needs of anyone less versed than a PhD. This book, I'm making wager, will charm a 13 year old word lover.

Visually it looks as though the master was a VHS tape and the sound is just as irritating.The movie itself combines poor acting with a script that can compete with any respectable porn movie.

I wish I had watched it when I was 12. I didn't like it at all. It is VERY dated. Sean Connery in his red outfit was very funny, though.

I am glad to say that the Blu-Ray did not disappoint in the least. The colors are all rich and vibrant. The scenes are very clear for the most part, every so often a scene is a little \\"grainy\\" but not enought to affect the pure enjoyment of watching this classic movie that is finally on Blu-Ray. It actually felt like I was watching this movie for the first time, a big accomplishment as I have watched Highlander many, many times. The sound quality is also excellent. This Disc plays fine in my Blu-Ray player in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst DVD, ever!","review":"This disc has one of my favorite 'guilty pleasure' movies on it - unfortunately, the quality is worse than my VHS copy. The video is poorly compressed, the sound is so variable that no sound designer could ever have dreamed of such an atrocity, and the overall quality of the presentation is lacking at best. This is a hack job. Folks, there is a reason this disc sells for 10 bucks - and it's not because it's *that* bad of a movie. The only worse disc I've ever seen is \\"Metropolis\\" - and at least that movie was 70 years old.

The video quality was beyond terrible, rife with artifacts and breakup. The resolution was worse than you'd see with a 20 year old tape on a 20 year old VCR.

BUT, the conversion to DVD is only half complete. The audio is incredible, one of the best sounding movies I have heard through my sterio. The video on the other hand looks more like early computer video that looks good in a small window and bad in full screen. The video is always grainy and you can actually see rectangular blocks of solid color in many scenes. Instead of seeing a movie in over 500 lines of horizontal resolution, it often looks like 100 thicker lines on parts of the screen. In watching the movie I could almost get beyond the video quality, but it definitely detracted from the movie. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture and Sound... WOW!","review":"If you don't have Dolby Digital (AC-3) go out and get it. Watching Highlander in true surround sound was incredible! During the scene on the lake you could hear Ramirez and MacLeod's voices echoing around the room like you're on the lake. The video was spectacular. Use the S-Video connector for highest quality. The quickenings were wild to watch. All the blurriness was gone on the DVD. Watching the movie with the directors and producers talking about the scenes was fascinating. You learn all the tidbits about the movie -like the intro scene with Ramirez reading was recorded in Sean Connery's bathroom. Fun for Highlander buffs. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Terrible encoding job!!!!!!!!!!","review":"If you like this movie, don't but it on DVD go out and buy something better, the VHS. Even though the disc is encoded with 5.1 sound, I could not get passed the terrible visual experience of the DVD.

Especially for those who have seen the series and want to know how it all started. The pilot episode of the series attempts to explain the \\"Game\\", but the movie lets you experience it first hand as Sean Connery imparts his knowledge and skill on to Christopher Lambert in a centuries-old struggle of immortals who live and die by the sword. Through excellently directed \\"flashbacks\\" which are intricately woven into the plot of the movie, we trace the life of Connor MacLeod of the Clan Macleod--a warrior who dies in battle in 1518, only to be \\"reborn\\" into immortality. Clancy Brown plays the villian superbly. Also, the director's commentary and the additional footage are a MUST!!! Don't see this film unless it's the director's cut!

I did want to comment on the sound and picture quality. Maybe it's because I have a TV that's not that great in the first place, but I don't really see any major video or audio problems with this DVD. I guess if you have a home theater system the low quality is obvious, but if you just have a \\"regular\\" TV with the DVD player plugged right into it, I doubt you will notice any problems. This one plays better than some other DVDs I have, like THEY LIVE, and the director's commentary is fun to listen to and informative. Hopefully they'll release an improved version in the future for the true videophiles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic DVD","review":"While I am a fan of the movie, I bought the DVD in the hope of owning a quality copy of an excellent movie but was shocked by the fact that the DVD is only slightly better than the VHS..which is truly awful.I would not recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THE DVD, WAIT UNTIL IT'S RE-RELEASED","review":"EVERYONE WHO SAYS THE DVD VERSION IS RUBBISH IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

This DVD edition is bare-bones, which is ok for the price being charged. The only extras are 2 original movie theater trailers and some written (outdated) bios of the cast.

I was so hooked i even watched the animated series, but this was absolutely awful. This was just a paycheck for Christopher Lambert, he didn't put any pizazze into this character at all. I found myself wondering what had posessed me to rent this in the first place. The sword fights were even bad, i mean its just sword action, can't go wrong there i would think.

You have to be kidding!","review":"This is not the first THX-certified movie, but positively the worst. If it wasn't for the movie itself, I'd rate this DVD with a lot less than even one star. Even Queen's audio track sounds awful, a lot worse than the same tunes on \\"A Kind of Magic\\"! If THX is trying to market its ratings as quality trademark, they just invited a lot of competition to join this field...

Some of the dialogue is laughable, the action is stilted, and the story is somewhat hokey. Still, I love the flashback sequences in Scotland, as well as any scene w/ Clancy Brown's eeevil, behemoth character! He pulls off his role w/ gloriously demonic glee. He's the most interesting / exciting thing about the movie, especially when driving a stolen car maniacally or offending nuns in a church! Sean Connery is also good, while Christopher Lambert is mostly a wood by-product, especially when speaking.

I probably won't get it since it scared me..., but that Evil Dead cover has got to win an award for creativeness.I like the sequels to this movie, but only keeping in mind that with Highlander 2...

Highlander is the story of Connor McCloud of the clan McCloud who is immortal and must battle other immortals until there is only one. His enemy is the evil power hungry Kurgen who is bent on killing all the immortals and winning the prize. The acting is great, I especially love Christopher Lambert as Connor and Clancy Brown made for one awesome villain as The Kurgen. The fight scenes are all epic and the scenes to the past are all meaningful and emotional as we see Connor's life and how he came to be where he is now. The DVD was great quality and played perfectly with no jumps or freezes. A great buy and a great movie for anyone a fan of the action/sci-fi genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, Unacceptable DVD!","review":"Highlander is one of my favorite action adventure movies. My review is not about the quality of the film, it is about the Horrible lack of quality of the DVD version.Simply put, the DVD is unwatchable.

How dare Republic pictures/Lumiere distribute a poor product like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great example of how NOT to master a DVD","review":"The package quite clearly labels this as \\"Digitally Mastered for Superior Sound and PICTURE Quality\\". HAH! The picture on this DVD is the worst I've seen on any sell-through product - YES, VHS included. I've seen clearer freeze-frames on a ten year old rental tape. Absolute waste of money.

Si-fi, romance, action & adventure. Even my husband, who hates sword play, loves this move. Connor McCloud is an imortal who fights to keep his head while tormented by images of watching those he loves die one by one, and althewhile knowing he never will. He is a guardian of the human race keeping evil from taking hold. The only thing I would do different is keep the sex scenes out of it. They ruin an otherwise good family film that gives a good example of loyalty, friendship, trust, love, and peoples inability to accept that which they do not understand.

I really enjoyed the movie. Highlander is really a cult classic. I just got a DVD player for my birthday and bought this 10th Anniversary Edition on DVD. Man, what a let down! The picture quality is terrible! The movie looks grainy and has little white specks flickering throughout the movie. Plus the sound quality is lousy. I have never seen such poor quality in a DVD! Don't waste your time buying the DVD. If they do another edition on DVD, they need to go back and do a better job! Go and buy the regular Director's Cut on VHS. It's a waste of money buying it on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to see what all the fuss is about","review":"The premise is, indeed, very cool -- but the execution just seems very off. Clancy Brown has delivered much better performances than he does here, and it's hard to take him seriously as the main villain. The character development in the flashback sequences is OK, but it makes no sense why anyone does what they do in the modern era, and some of the dialogue is just ear-gratingly bad. Worst of all, though, the gathering itself just doesn't have the sense of drama you'd expect it to. There doesn't seem to be much of a sense of urgency to any of the characters, and that makes the film itself seem kind of slow.I was also disappointed by the film quality, as I think other reviewers have observed . . . haven't really looked at the other DVD extras, but I don't see them overcoming the general disappointment I had in the movie itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story, could be better","review":"Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery star in this interesting sci-fi/Fantasy story set in both the present and the past. Conner Macleod of the Clan Macleod is a Scotsman born in 1538, and he cannot die. He is an immortal, through the ages he has blended in with society to wait for the \\"gathering\\" when all the immortals will come together to fight for the prize. The prize being master of the realm of earth. It has an interesting prospect, but sometimes the film is bogged down by incredibly cheesy special sound effects, way too overdramatic. When Macleod faces off against his arch-enemy Kerigan, or something, the swords make a way too overdramatic \\"chinging\\" noise when they contact. Oh well, it could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD blows!","review":"The movie is good, but this is without a doubt the WORST looking DVD I have ever seen.

I actually bought this disc at the same time I bought my player... And I was horrified, HORRIFIED by what I saw. Worse, by far, than even my well-worn VHS copy! I actually had to go rent some other DVD's to make sure that it was the disc, not the player.I was very pleased that subsequent rentals and disc purchases showed me that it was merely a bad transfer. Highlander is one of my all-time favorite films, but the DVD version is so bad that it looks like it was edited by a five year old with a box of crayons. This disc needs to be redone... And the only way I can recommend you buying it is if you have very bad eyesight or if it is cheap. REALLY cheap, like five bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay as far away from this one as you can!","review":"Since everyone already knows that Highlander is a great movie, and since the Queen sountrack is entirely a matter of taste, I will limit my comments to the technical quality of the DVD.In short, this is the worst DVD I've ever seen.

I am sure if there is an improve version of this DVD, many people will buy it one more time but until the time comes, this DVD should be considered by fans.I am giving it 4 stars anyway as this is one classic movie and would have given it 5 stars if the sound and picture not letting me down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was way too cheap, now I see why!!!!","review":"The picture looks terrible, grainy, with specs flickering like it was a much older film.

I first saw this film right after college and remember loving it. I suspect that had more to do with the group of friends with whom I saw the movie than the movie itself. At least I hope that is the case. The acting is horrific and the film just doesn't hold together. Too bad they didn't hire a choreographer for the fight scenes. Pathetic. My teenager says he now has confirmation that I have zero taste in action films.As far as the DVD itself goes, it was noisy in the machine. The sound was at times too low to be heard, and at other times too loud for comfort. The picture was grainy and often much too dark. At least running the volume control up and down gave us something to do while watching it.After the credits ran, we threw it out. I don't recall doing that with any other DVD I have purchased.

I have an old video tape, recorded off cable, that is FAR superior to this cut. Don't buy this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 simple words - DO NOT BUY","review":"I am still seething having bought what I believed to be the ultimate Highlander experience. Not only is the quality of the picture grainier than a bowl of cornflakes but the THX \\"experience\\" is, bar none, the WORST soundtrack I have ever heard. In short DO NOT buy this dvd - maybe some day people like Mr. Aaron Spelling will realise that consumers are not the slack-jawed yokels he believes us to be.What a complete waste of time and money (my money that is). Mr. Lambert, Mr. Connery and co. are rolling over in their respective graves - figuratively speaking of course!!I tried posting this review with a 0 star rating but was unable to - needless to say the 1 star I had to give is 1 star too many."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting, but dated","review":"I just saw this movie for the first time ever tonight. It's ineteresting but dated. You can really tell the movie was made in the 1980's - - not to mention, they say 1985 several times in the movie. Why does the Egyptian have a scottish accent, while the Scotsman doesn't? It's just a question. Where did Christepher Lambert get his accent in the first place? It's a nice accent, but I don't recognize it. Anyway, I can tell why it aquired so many fans. It's an interesting movie with an underdeveloped premis. Or maybe it's over developed. It's a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"a master piece of art","review":"A great movie , when i saw it at the first time i couldn't believe how good it was , and until now i can't forget any of it's sceens , i believe it is the greatest film in the eighties , a very deep and sensitive one .."},{"rating":"2","title":"KURGANITIS","review":"first of all let me say that the picture quality on the immortal edition far surpasses the quality of the republic pictures collectors edition. not to mention all the extras you already know about.as far as the movie is concerned it is a classic.when i had first seen this i had just read all the \\"CASCA THE IMMORTAL WARRIOR\\" books and thought this would just be a rip off.but it turned out to be one of my favorite movies as well as the sequels 3 and 4....(i don't think there was ever a 2.....i refuse to acknowledge the existance)unfortunetly the television series far surpasses the original movie (as i own every episode of the six season show i can vouch for that )so that when i watch the original movie it does not have the same zing that it had the first 50 times(just kidding i've only seen this movie about 5 times)but the movie is light enough for repeated viewing as well as always entertaining..it will fit nice in any dvd collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?!?","review":"I can not believe some of the positive reviews on this site like the one below. This transfer is INEXCUSABLE for Blu-Ray. This fantastic movie deserved to be properly remastered. The sound was hallow and tinny. The picture quality was poor, appearing quite grainy. People can refer to that as a \\"look\\" or a \\"style\\" all they like, it is an excuse for a completely botched, poor transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will we ever see the Theatrical Cut Again?!","review":"The extended \\"Director's\\" aka \\"International\\" cut of the film is all well and good, but I am still looking for the original US theatrical cut of the film with the excellent pacing and the trimmed down story.I know that DVD came out back in 1995 / 1996 when DVDs were still new and since then its never resurfaced.I bought the Immortal Edition DVD in hopes of getting the US theatrical release as one might expect when something is billed as \\"The Definitive Release of the film\\". Alas I was lied to and the US theatrical release was not present.In the age of Bluray discs capable of 50GB or storage capacity, one would think that a disc containing both versions of the film was possible. Apparently not..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...I guess I didn't get it.","review":"I must not understand the genre, because I though this was one of the worst movies I had ever seen. I picked it up because it had Sean Connery in it, and I have never before seen a Sean Connery film I didn't like. Not what I expected at all. Too weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S JUST A SHAME","review":"Why? Why god why? Why did they have to ruin it? I was walking through the store looking for Highlander on DVD. When I came across it, I wasn't sure at first due to its low price at 10 bucks. I just figured it wasn't that popular in that store, so I bought it. As I unwrapped it, I couldn't wait to see the clear picture and the great sound of a classic movie on DVD! I then place the DVD in the player it turn it on. NOOOOO!! There are white specs flying across the screen! There are dust particles in the film! The pixles are visible! The music is blasting! The dialogue is almost muted! AAAAGGGGHHHHHH!! turning up the volume and turning down the volume constantly and then finding no special features to the movie. I love this movie, and it's a shame to watch it be carelessly converted into a CD that is actually worse than the VHS version! Please! Re-do this DVD!! Call it back!! Re-master it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I saw the film in the cinema a long time ago and it impressed me much. I was 23 at the time. The good memories blossomed in my mind so I decided to buy the DVD because I thought it was such a classic. Actually, with the eyes of the 32-old that I am now, it's really bad. Except for Sean Connery the acting is bad, for starters. The fighting scene music is atonal mayhem (considering I appreciate heavy metal, that is saying something). Specific to this DVD: The Director's Cut thing adds little, if anything. The sound and music is very loud in comparison to the dialogues. Sometimes there is subtitling when they're actually not saying anything audible."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD transfer is mediocre at best.","review":"The movie is good, but the transfer is mediocre. While it is superior to the VHS standard, it is only barely so, and does not live up to the quality we expect in a DVD. This is one that needs a new transfer, with a qualified team, and lots of extras to get us to pay another $10 for a new disk. Mine is about to be a coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are right; Video quality is AWFUL","review":"Well, I watched the DVD. Everyone was right (sigh). The video is so bad, it's literally unbelievable. You spend more time looking at the grains and pixels than the movie, it's that distracting. Very awful transfer, the story is good as it always was, but it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Picture Quality .. disrespect for DVD buyer ..","review":"A hell of a good movie, put down the drain by the digitalisation to DVD.

I only got part way through this turkey err, I mean Masterpiece, before I packed it up and got it ready to send back. The sound is terrible, difficult to hear and very poorly mixed. The picture is grainy as hell and the compression artefacting and wobbling makes it almost unwatchable. Looks like a bad PC video clip.I love this film and am very angry that it was so badly tranferred. Deluxe edition my eye! Get the VHS, at least that has an excuse for looking bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on the DVD!","review":"I am a huge Highlander fan and this DVD is terrible.

Don't buy this movie on DVD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You need the extra minutes!","review":"Okay, a few years ago a boyfriend of mine and I watched the Highlander on video. Then after I got married my husband and I watched all three of them back to back to back. (here's a hint, don't bother watching #2, it stinks and has very little to do with the others) Anyway, I was shocked that my FAVORITE SCENE wasn't in the movie that my husband and I rented.You see I'm kind of an anal person and I need to know all the back ground on things. (Kind of like watching \\"Planet of the Apes IV, V and VI). Anyway, in the Non-Directors cut you don't know why he is so attached to his secretary. In the Directors cut you find out that He rescued her from the Nazis in WWII and raised her like a daughter. Anyway, I am getting the Directors cut exclusively for this scene. Until one of my husbands friends at work told him that he has the directors cut and that scene was there, my husband thought that I dreamed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie, horrible DVD","review":"This is a classic, underrated SCI-FI Fantasy film from the 1980's.

Here's hoping the Studio releases a new version of this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Crappy Version - Stay With VHS","review":"I like to buy DVD's for the improved picture and audio. You won't find either of those on this one. I was really disappointed what they did to such a great film.Highlander is such a great movie and they added all this great footage, but they really made a mess of the audio. I have the VHS Collectors version as well and it sounds a lot better. This DVD will find its way to the auctions. I'm glad I didn't sell the the VHS.Don't let this review stop you from seeing the movie. It really is one of the best, under-rated movies out there. Just stay away from the DVD version."},{"rating":"1","title":"great disappointment","review":"I have no idea how the Widescreen Review can justify giving this DVD a 4.5 rating for picture and sound quality; it is easily the poorest DVD I have ever viewed. I have seen this movie on commercial VHS, and on VHS that was recorded off of a movie channel, and either one is just as good visually as the DVD version. What a waste of money. The sound was gratingly sharp, almost tinny, so that I would wince at many of the loud noises in the film.I have been very pleased with the ratings that Widescreen Review has put out on other DVDs that I have purchased, and have used it as a benchmark for determining whether to buy them. They really dropped the ball on this one. Stick with VHS, you'll be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh the humanity!","review":"Please be forwarned, you may be amazed that a DVD with allthese features costs so little. There is a reason for this, the picture quality is by far the worst I have -ever- seen, and I've seen plenty. The picture is worse (yes, worse) than VHS or broadcast TV. I have no idea what they did to it, maybe drag the source in mud and jump on it a bit, but it's really -really- atrocious.The movie you've probably already seen, and know it's rather good. If you want to own a cheap digital copy to have around, this would be it. If you want a good transfer of the movie, please look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The DVD version is horrible!","review":"I only give this one 2 stars because it's a good motion picture. The picture quality on the DVD is horrible and the sound quality is even worse. Please save your money and find this in some other format. I'll say it again--this is terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great movie but why does the DVD look like VHS?","review":"When this movie first came out, it is easy to see how it grabbed so many people in so little time. Loaded with good action and fight sequences and with a historical timeline/aspect to it also. Definitely better than the sequels that followed it. Some reviewers had found some slight problems with the sound transfer to the DVD that I didn't really seem to notice. The sounds on DVD are pretty good but I don't quite know what happened to the movie itself in the DVD transfer. The picture is quite grainy on DVD and that is unfortunate but it is still better than VHS. All in all, better than VHS because it is such a good movie but maybe this is a lesson in how to do better next time when transfering VHS to DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"highlander","review":"The laser disc is exellant and I really enjoy watching this movie, but the dvd is very poor quality.

This is the worst quality dvd i have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the warnings","review":"Thanks to all the reviewers for their warnings on the poor quality of this DVD, hopefully the manufacturers will be shamed into re-releaseing it with this problem rectified. I enjoyed the movie, it is still one of my favorites, and I am also a fan of the TV series. I think it very poor that such a classic should be treated this way. I for one will not be wasteing my money on updating to what is supposed to be a superior format."},{"rating":"1","title":"...I remembered it to be a lot better.","review":"First off, the video is not very good. Might even be worse than VHS (it pixelates! They probably compressed it too much). The sound is very good in a few parts, but overall, the audio-visual experience is pretty bleh. As for the movie itself... I actually found myself laughing at a few scenes that were just so cliche! Kicking, screaming ladies, grunting bad guys and really bad makeup effects (took me a while to realize caked mud on your face is supposed to make you look old). Lambert was dubbed over by at least five people. See this movie for laughs, and don't take it too seriously. Sorry if I offended any die-hards, but I used to love this movie when I was younger. Now I'm embarrased I bought it on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats with all the hype","review":"I love sword-fighting movies, and this was probably the biggest one that I had not seen yet. But after numerous recommendations by friends and coworkers, I got around to seeing this one on DVD, and came away from it unimpressed. All the praises sung for it by others I considered letdowns. For example, many others loved the Queen soundtrack. I found it way of mark. Half the movie took place in the Scottish highlands, and the movie would have came across better with Celtic folk music instead. As for the swordplay, it is slow and does not compare to that found in Rob Roy, Braveheart, or the various Three Musketeer incarnations. Probably the worst part of the movie was Sean Connery, who is Scottish, playing an Egyptian character, but with a Spanish name, Ramirez. How ridiculous. Good think I saw this on DVD and not at the theaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"and in the end there can be only one!!!","review":"Christopher lambert in his immortal role as Connor Mac Leodbattles his fellow immortals!!some are good others evil and in the end there can be only one!!!so better be a good one!!the battles rage between those who have chosen Good,like Mc Leod and others who have chosen evil,like the most famous Kurgan!!!this epic flashes back to us from old time Scotland to today's modern USA!those who lose their heads in a sword fight yield thier power-the power of the lightning -to the one who cuts their head off!!!thus immortals have battled through the centuries;Until Now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing, sweet books you'll love to share with kids!","review":"I have received a little flack from fellow library employees for liking these books, however, I must support Ms. Rylant. I find these books to be refreshingly sweet. In the childrens' book world today, there seem to be so many stories that present such harsh realities. While I certainly understand that it is helpful for kids to read about someone who may be going through similar circumstances as themselves, difficult as those may be, I also believe it doesn't hurt for kids to read about other kids who are actually happy, are getting along with others, making friends, and loving their families and neighbors. I know this isn't a perfect world, but is't nice to read about \\"a little good news\\"! Thank you, Ms. Rylant. I love your books, and I know the kids with whom I work do as well!

Then with no more word from the company, when I called to enquire about the shipping status on the 21st, they said they were out of stock and would not be able to deliver before the 28th. The only thing they offered me was a cancellation, but then told me it may take up to 10 days to credit my bank card, because it had to go through Amazon.

It's a tale of a cat on a mission that's suffused with the mystical power of cats in ancient Egypt. It's very inspiring, as Windrusher surmounts one unbelievable obstacle after another on a long journey, and, at times, it's just heartbreaking. You really can identify with the characters. Di Genti's verbal pallette of words paints vivid pictures in your mind's eye that makes it seem like you're IN the story, and not just reading it. I'd recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Piazzolla...Extraordinary","review":"The quintessential Piazzolla is presented here in a rapturous performance by several artists in their own right. I was attracted to this recording because I play the piano and the idea of Emanual Ax and Pablo Ziegler (another one of those classical-Tango joint venture a la Yo Yo Ma) performing Tango was too much to pass up.The transcriptions are very, very good. In fact, though one can readily distinguish the sound from the classic Tango ensemble, the music is seamless. It works! Of particular interest is \\"La muerte del angel\\". One wishes that the \\"angel\\" trilogy could be presented in one package instead of spread out over several recordings. And speaking of transcripts, a German firm now distributes piano versions of Piazzolla tangos in three volumes.While I'm wishing, it would be great if someone recorded the entire body of Piazzolla compositions in one collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Share Jesus Without Fear","review":"Excellent.

My son doesn't even realize he is reading for 'school' at the moment.I would recommend this copy to any homeschooler or teacher looking for the look and feel of the original pages to give their child.

His bank is technically in the red, so the government wants to shut him down! On page after page, our hero ponders his situation.

He loves the Thomas the Tank Engine series and loves to see the train in the Baby Einstein \\"On the Go\\" DVD, but this was a total let down. He wasn't interested at all and no wonder. It is too much standing around and talking. I tried to keep the whole tape on fast forward but even then it was dull---particularly this endlessly long segment where Harry is seated in the dining car with two school aged children-- and that's it! How is that interesting? To a child who doesn't understand conversations, the banter is not entertainment. To a parent who does understand the conversations, it is pure mindless torture. I've never given anything such a poor review. I won't even bother describing more of the same with the helicopter segment. This DVD is in need of major editing if it is to appeal to little tikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Movie. EVER.","review":"Bought this one to replace a copy from the library. Seriously, no matter how train-crazy your kid is, do yourself a favor and don't watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"So cute it'll make you want to hurl","review":"The good part first. The tunes are nice and I am sure they will appeal to both adults and children. But the lyrics... Unless you are a purple dinosaur, this is just too much. The person who wrote the lyrics for Farm Animal Friends cannot possibly even have seen a farm. (I showed the video to someone who grew up on a farm and she went into hysteric giggling.) And Selfish Shellfish teaches the joys of sharing with all the subtlety of a jackhammer. It must be possible to make inspirational music for kids without patronizing them. I suggest that G & GTG sit down and read Pippi Longstocking (or anything else by Astrid Lindgren)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Gwendolyn","review":"We learned about Gwendolyn from hearing her on the Chuck&Buck soundtrack. Fun, Fun, Fun song. Our kids LOVE this CD. Whoever wrote the mean spirited review about wanting to hurl is being harsh. My kids like purple dino's by the way to, and it's all about imaginiation and fun and Gwendolyn is Fun, Fun, Fun. My kids especially love singing along with Farm Animal Friends. It's all silly and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"just magical","review":"This is, by far, one of the greatest albums out right now. That's right...not just in the kids category, but in any genre. This album is a perfect example of where music should be going, great musicians, high energy and plain old American fun! I can't waoit for the next one. By the way, I am an adult writing this, a parent and, oh yeah, my daughter likes it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely annoying- even my toddler hates it.","review":"Wow. I was sent this by somebody who thought I would love it. It's horribly annoying. I put it on when I got it in the mail and my toddler looked at me like I was crazy, and she usually loves music and dancing. Perhaps if she listened to more traditional kids music she would like it better. If you're interested in more indie kids music, I'd suggest the Ida/Elizabeth Mitchell albums \\"You are my flower\\" and \\"You are my Sunshine\\", as well as the compilations \\"The Bottle Let Me Down\\" (bloodshot records) and \\"Greasy Kid Stuff\\". My toddler truly enjoys those albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite!","review":"Gwendolyn and the Gang's first CD is number one on the charts in our house. Imaginative, catchy, not patronizing in any way, these terrific songs put the band right at the forefront of the modern rock and roll kid's music movement, the female counterpart of Dan Zanes, or They Might Be Giants. And check out the live show if you're lucky enough to have Gwendolyn nearby, it's a constant barrel of laughs, dancing and fun that appeals to the parents as much as the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't purchase!!","review":"This is a nice bag with a fatal flaw. The major zippers break very easily. After my first bag broke within a few months, Amazon kindly provided a free replacement. Deja vu ensued. For a few extra dollars, Delta could use more robust zippers--they really should."},{"rating":"1","title":"More hype than light","review":"I had a set of these for about one year before one burned out. A common complaint. I was also disappointed as soon as I installed them. They are tinted blue to give the ILLUSION of whiter light, but they are really just blue bulbs. They are probably overvolt bulbs to burn brighter to compensate for the light absorbed by the coloring. That would explain the short life. Would you rather see better or look better? That's what you have to decide before you spend a premium for these. It was money wasted for me. GE Nighthawks have been a better alternative; a little brighter without the blue nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly made a difference","review":"I was disappointed in these bulbs. While they are good quality bulbs, they made little difference in light output and/or white-ness of the light compared to my Lexus LX 470's original OEM bulbs. Was not worth the money for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died in six months - beware!","review":"A couple years ago I bought SilverStar bulbs and they didn't last a year. I recently gave them another try and didn't even get six months out of these expensive bulbs - what a ripoff! Can't someone make a bulb that lasts more than a year?? I'm tired of being pulled over by the police because my headlights are out, so I'm going back to the Cool Blue lights that are rated for twice the lifespan of SilverStars."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP-OFF (my opinion). Sylvania should be ashamed (my opinion).","review":"These bulbs claim, in the large print and for a high price (made even higher by the short life-span) to deliver 35% more light than standard halogens. The fine print tells you they deliver 35% more light than standard halogens that are running on 80% power. How incredibly shameless could a company possibly get? I've heard of cooking the numbers, but this is ridiculous. In reality, assuming that Sylvania is truthful with these numbers, you're getting only 15% more light. They should just say that.Sylvania also \\"guarantees your complete satisfaction for up to 12 months.\\" Just like many other guarantees, this one is worthless. Your money back for their shill game? Not a chance. Ship the bulb back to them at your expense and they'll give you a new bulb. You have to dig through their web site to find that out.Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright bulbs......for a while","review":"These bulbs are very good. Driving at night is a pleasure with the bright white light. I originally bought these just prior to a solo cross-country drive from Oregon to West Virginia. They were so bright that as I got tired, I had to go to low beam because the lighted area was so bright. That is the upside.The downside is that I have had very poor survival for the bulbs. They seem to burn out quickly. I finally decided to buy a second set so that I could have a spare set in the truck with me all the time. That way, when they burn out I can swap in a new bulb and send the original in for its warrantee replacement. They are not convenient, but they are the best I've ever driven with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money--","review":"I have been through three sets of these bulbs in as many years. One set was a free replacement from Sylvania and they were no better. They are commonly available all over now, including Walmart and most automotive stores, for $40 or so per set. The light quality is good, very white, clean light. Much better than OEM, but they only last an average of 8-10 months of normal driving/use.Sylvania claims they burn out so fast because they are 'high performance' bulbs. That's the silliest thing I have ever heard and, take note, if you look carefully at the package you will see that they do not print any type of 'hours-rating', or estimated lifespan of the product anyplace on the packaging.Sylvania has obviously had a lot of complaints on the longevity of this product (versus price), but they are still selling them for full price. Unless $40 a pair every 8 months or so is not a big deal I would advise one to try another brand--"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid optical performance in lightweight scope","review":"We bought this for weight/space sensitive trips where we need more reach than binocs will provide.

I am a 24 year old university Gal who reads many books but I have never read a book quite like this. This Book Shadows Of My Past was well written I have to say. It caught my attention and let me in suspense all the way to last page. I can not believe that a 19 year old wrote this. That makes me happy to know that teens are not being taken for granted. Although how ever there a few mistakes in spelling anf grammer but over all this book is way wonderful. The mistakes are the editors fault not the auhtor's. Though the mistakes make this book even more auhtentic.The main character Rebecca is way cool, I love all the situations she gets into. The Shadow Man is very scary.

Emma has been deaf since birth, and communicates with her brother and friend by email, mail, and when they are together, sign language. While Matt and Jake search for love in all the wrong places, Em notices that they begin to fall in love with each other.I liked how Matt had her options open, and didn't just stick to one guy, like Jake only stuck to one girl.

Would advise it to friends. Great lecture. Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I was shocked to discover that this book was published by the Norton Press. Here goes my best at a Tim Parks inspired juvenile and/or hackneyed rhetorical question: \\"Have Standards Fallen so Low?\\" This is not a work of History, and it is not written by an Historian. It is anecdotal and unscholarly. The exploration of metaphysics does not warrant that word's presence in the title. It is poorly written, and moves in and out of tense haphazardly, notes are absent and sources are uncited, and finally and perhaps most egregious; Sentence fragments are the norm as opposed to the exception. Its astounding what gets published these days. So there is definitely a lesson to be taken from the business savvy here; this book is excellently marketed....beautiful cover, thought provoking title etc. Too bad its tripe. Way to go 'Enterprise', you got me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read It","review":"I bought this book at the Rome train station on my way to Florence for vacation.

He's a terrific, vibrant writer + the subject matter is gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book","review":"After reading the reviews on here it seems that most people enjoy this book, but believe me the negative reviews are much closer to the truth on this. The author states that he is not an historian, but to undertake this kind of work one would expect at least good writing. Don't. The only aspect of Medici Money that is worse than the history is the writing. There are many books on Amazon about the Medici, buy one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Effort","review":"I was shocked by how bad this book is. First of all, there is absolutely nothing new in this book that a reader can not find in other books on the subject. So, in reality, this is a compilation of facts from three or four leading books on the subject. In other words, almost anybody can create a similar compilation of pages. Poor, ungrammatical style deserves a special mention. It is astonishing that this book has been written by a professional writer. Tim Parks has no respect for English grammar whatsoever. Even more astonishing is the fact that this illiterate style has been praised by some reviewers as \\"reader friendly\\". This book deserves negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need help , you will not find it here","review":"When I decide to buy a book, I almost always rely on reviews of other readers to help me decide if I want to purchase it or not. This was the same for this book. The surprise was when I found my self so out of tune with everyone else. Everyone else Liked it, while I did not find it at all useful. Going around the world is a relatively serious undertaking, and I was looking for some pointers. This book had none. It was more of road impressions written in a non-imaginative style. I would borrow it from a library or buy it used rather than pay USD10 plus shipping for it. The author himself said his earlier books contained the nuts and bolts of how to travel while this one adopts a different style. If you are like me.... preparing ... this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Splendor","review":"With a conversational writing style and years of experience, Bruce Northam captured my attention with his \\"boyhood\\" wonder at the world.

I only hope to do a little traveling like this myself someday, Meanwhile, I will read delicious tidbits such as these to tide me over for that long journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Voyage","review":"Northam's vignettes amplify, in humorous and insightful detail, many of the feeling I have while waiting for an upcoming trip. There are thousands of reasons for putting work aside and hitting the road. After reading Globetrotter Dogma, you'll want to do the same.

Inevitably you realize the guy talking is the same guy who won't shut up about his travels here and there and how amazing this was and that was and how \\"oh my gawd\\" you have to go here but be careful to never do this when there...and all you can think is \\"Where is that earthquake when you need it?\\" so you can eek out of the conversation.I think that Bruce Northam IS that guy. But zooted.

The DVD is great and I'm planning on getting all the episodes once there available. I also dance to the music along with my kids; I just love the joy that comes out of my kids when I put it on!I recommend this show to anyone who wants something GOOD for their child to watch.

The only problem is the little tab that connects to the leash broke after a month, so it's not built to last if your going to hold on to it while using a leash. I guess I made the mistake of holding on to the bag dispenser instead of the leash itself. I bought two, and the 2nd has been fine after two months as long I hold the leash when walking my dog. Very useful when walking my dog and having a bag in the dispenser instead of carrying it around in your pocket or hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't go the generic route!!","review":"This was the first dispenser I ever bought, when I adopted my first dog. I later bought a second, generic one. Stick with Bags on Board!! They are slightly more expensive (but really cheap on Amazon!!), but totally worth it.

I like the screw top since it keeps things secure. I say \\"things\\" because I have started using it to carry a couple of poop bags, some money and my house key when we go for our walk. Often I wear things with no pockets and don't want to carry a purse around the neighborhood, so I crunch up 2 bags in front of the hole, and then put a couple of dollars and my house key behind it. We walk past a neighborhood bakery so I like to be prepared :)Since I know I will only need one bag, the other continues to block the hole while safely securing my other \\"stuff\\". So i consider this an inexpensive and convenient double-duty bag dispenser. I also took my dog to Italy last year and kept some money in this dispenser in case I was pick pocketed.

I didn't have any trouble getting the bag out - just watch for the perforation. The other reviews say the bag is really large, it's more long than large. I just stuck my hand in it, took care of business and flipped it inside out when pulling it off my arm. Easy as pie. For my yorkie's purposes there is plenty of room to tie the bag shut if i wanted. They could hold larger leavings but it might be a little trickier to put in a knot depending on the breed. The bone holder itself has a little clip so that it's easy to attach and detach.

I never have to worry about forgeting to take bags with me which is good given I tend to be kind of forgetful. The bags dispense pretty easily and I like that the open end is marked. I have it hooked to the loop part of my leash and it doesn't get in the way at all. I do wish that they would somehow mark when you're down to like the second to the last bag though for the times when I don't realize there's only one left and I end up needing two on a long walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Item Ever!","review":"My experience with this item was totally opposite Talana's. (Perhaps this model has been refined over time.) We always dispose of our dog's 'droppings' and had to remember to bring a bag or two along. This is so handy - a bag is always right at hand. We have always refilled with the official Bags on Board refill packs; the top of the bone rotates off and the replacement bag fits over a stem in the center (sort of like replacing a toilet paper roll). My husband initially had a little trouble unrolling the bag too far when he tore one off, but they have recently added a white bar to the bags so you can easily see where to tear the bag off of the roll now. This item is wonderful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely fragile - breaks easily","review":"We just went through our second dispenser. We have a FLEXI retractable leash and an athletic dog, and it seems like whenever we drop the leash (or the dog pulls it from our hand) the dispenser breaks in the exact same spot and becomes useless. The piece that breaks is the loop on the dispenser. Now the retainer ring has nothing to attach to. You'd think they would bolster this connection with stronger materials or thicker construction.Not recommended if you have an active dog or if you think you may ever drop your leash."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for dog poops","review":"small and easy to carry , little bone with bags does come handy , I used to use grocery bags, well not any more lol hehe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted three minutes","review":"Took my buddy for a hike. The plastic D clip broke within three minutes of trail time from the leash tangling with it. This product should be sold at the dollar store for the quality of plastic in it.Sure, it was easier to put the bags in and secure but what good does that do me if it is not attached to the leash? I am back to carrying the bags in my pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small Bags, cheap plastic","review":"I have a puppy so I bought one of these since I knew I'd be taking him out a lot. The bags are really small, had to fit your hand in and turn inside out without getting feces on your hand. The bags would also be much better if you could tie it close like several other brands. Nothing worse then walking around with a bag of poop that you can tie close during a long walk! The dispenser is also cheap, if you drop the leash the lid comes flying off and never really tightens before it starts loosening again. I'd look for other similar products, I've just started putting bags in my pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea","review":"but expensive JUST FOR DOG POOP!!!!!It's good to have one during travel especially if you have more than 2 SMALL dogs.

No container for bags but the bags are bigger and THICKER. These ones are SUPER THIN & SMALL."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect!","review":"cute dispenser and a must have for any dog owner.

Unless I take the time before the walk to get the bag open it's always a struggle to detach the bag from the roll and then to get it to open up. Maybe there's some trick I'm missing, but especially when I have 2 dogs pulling on their leashes while I struggle to open up a bag I'm going to go with what's easiest, and for me ziplocks are a thousand times easier to open. They do have the disadvantage of being see-through, but garbage cans normally aren't too far away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad....but NOT pink!","review":"Not much to say abvout this thing except that it's not really pink (why 4 star rating and not 5).

Very easy to refill. One gripe is that the clip that attaches to the leash is incredibly stiff. The plastic didn't have much give so trying to unhook the clip just to attach it was more of a challenge than expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doggy bags","review":"This doggy dispenser bag was really cute.

The small loop (attached to the dispenser) broke off when I dropped the dispenser on my wooden floor. Good thing I purchased several dispensers (in various colors)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going back to the red hydrant as this one won't stay closed","review":"I used to have the red hydrant bags on board sip tied to my boys leash. Had to replace the zip tie about twice a year. Saw this bone with the hook and thought hey, I like the hook. Well, the hook gets a little bump from the second leash in my hand and it pops open. And the end cap comes off too often. Had to re-roll the bags twice and search in the dark to find the cap. Then I just started putting single bags inside. Well, tonight was the final straw when I lost the cap yet again and no blue trail to follow to help locate it on 11 acres. Well, time to zip tie the old red hydrant back on.Nice try Bags On Board, but not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly good, but breaks easily if dropped","review":"I'm on my third one of these and will not being buying it again.The problem is with the design, specifically, that it breaks easily if dropped.The small loop attached to the main plastic bone is very fragile at the attachment point (which is very small) and, since it's part of the mold, cannot move. (it's like an \\"O\\" that attaches at the bottom, rather than an upside down \\"U\\" shape, as other brands have).It's also made of a more brittle hard plastic, rather than a more forgiving soft plastic, meaning that it tends to break rather than give under pressure.If you accidentally accidentally drop your leash with this thing attached (even a short distance from your hand to the ground), you'll probably cause the ring to snap off, rendering it useless.This happened to me twice already.Otherwise, it's not a bad product and works well, but until they address the issue with attachment ring design, I can't give it a full endorsement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke two within a month","review":"I got these based mostly on the rave reviews, which were spot on for about a week. By the end of my first month, I had managed to break both of these (I got two since they were so cheap) in the exact same way. The plastic is so thin that any stress on the screw-out piece on the left would shatter the plastic around the female threads on the larger piece. Once that happens, the two pieces won't stay together and the bags unravel in a sort of poop-inspired tickertape parade. Not fun. If the plastic were just a little bit thicker, this would be a perfect product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little dispenser","review":"This is a great idea, and nice, inexpensive product that any dog owner will be happy to have. We attached ours to a retractable leash.Within a week the plastic clip broke...not a big deal, I went to the hardware store and got a locking metal flexible band meant for keys, and attached it. Perfect.About two weeks later the larger plastic part of the holder cracked, right by the dispenser hole. The plastic gets thin there and is a little weaker. Because of this, the top would thread in and then pop out, thus not staying put.I put a ziptie around it and it's worked out fine...but still...Thin plastic breaks...esp. with dogs around!Still, a great product, can't be beat for the price.Buy 2 for when your first one breaks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's meant to do!","review":"I love this little dispenser. It's cute and a convenient way to carry around dog waste bags. I live in an apartment complex so it's really important to me to clean up after my Shiba puppy. This is a great way to remind me to bring the bags when I take her on walks, etc. and it carries enough bags that I don't have to worry about running out on longer adventures. My only complaint is the clip is really cheap and annoying to use. I bought a small carabiner at a hardware store to replace it and it works much better. The clip is the only reason I gave this it 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bulky and heavy, but otherwise great","review":"Great product, it stays together even if you drop it (at least it did for me) and I hook both the leash and my house keys to the latch at the top and it stays very well (less things for me to juggle while we're going out the door and on our walk!). My only gripe is that it's a little big (you have to shove it into jean pockets) and a little heavy (which is probably more b/c of the roll of bags); if they made a smaller size with less bags i'd totally get it. However, for what it is, it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bags When Needed","review":"This works great! The clip it comes with doesn't work as well with the expendable leashes if you've got one of the bigger ones so you might want to keep that in mind. We have one that's good for dogs<40lbs and it just fits on the handle awkwardly. It would work fine with any normal rope/nylon leash. Easy to install bags and it has a cute bone shape!Update: Since the entire casing is made of hard plastic is does not withstand any drops of the leash. Our puppy likes to dart off sometimes and the leash will slip out of our hands if we're not ready for it. This happened twice on the sidewalk before the entire clip broke off. Just a warning. The replacement one I bought was a canzas housing so we won't have that problem again."},{"rating":"2","title":"the standard for dog bags","review":"all my doggie owning friends have this dispenser, and pretty much everyone i see walking down the street with a dog has this one (i live in new york city)... easy to change the rolls, cute, functional. can't really go wrong. i've experienced the little plastic clip breaking a couple times (my friend's broke and so did mine), but it's thin plastic, so you kinda have to expect that with wear and tear. an easy fix: get a 99c keychain carabiner to replace it. works like a charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"We attached the Bags of Board to my yorkie's leash so we never go on a walk without it.

This is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine","review":"I couldn't decide how many stars; it's really fine. It's just heavy, and there are lots of other things like it that are nylon and less cumbersome on a leash. I keep it on my travel bag, where is doesn't pull on my dog's neck, but I have baggies with me when I'm away from home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Addition to \\"Sim Style\\" PC Collection","review":"This sim type game is very well thought out.

I don't remember having any real glitches, hangups, or crashes.Played the challenges and the \\"sand box\\". Eventually you hit the wall and get bored with it. But, that took longer than some other games. Was well worth the total of 9 bucks I bought it for.Whoever is charging 60+ bucks is nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Game","review":"Space Colony. Think Sims in space. I love this game. I bought it a couple years back but lost it so I decided to re-purchase it. I am a big fan of sim games and this puts a nice twist on the genre. It puts you and your colony in space and besides building a colony you have to attend to the colonists needs which is easy to do, thankfully. The graphics are ok for a 6 year old game. Overall this game is a great experience and now it's pretty cheap, I suggest you pick up a copy today and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to learn, enoyable trying to master, and a ton of fun!","review":"I have only played the demo, but totally enjoyed it and am buying the game. I am already addicted to it. If they had not offered the demo, I may have passed this by, since I have been burnt in the past buying PC games. Try the demo and I know you will be back buying this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Major Problem","review":"Space Colony is a fun, highly addictive combination of resource management and people sim but there is one major problem. Although the manual is well-written and contains a lot of useful information, if you enjoy \\"roll your own\\" campaigns you will find yourself pretty much on your own. The manual contains basic information on how to link two maps to form a campaign, but there is no information on how to use the menus in the campaign creation area. This can lead to a fairly high level of frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny ash stuff for the teen to adult family","review":"exceedingly hilarious and funny game. very witty and full of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give it 0 if I could","review":"I purchased this game new 3 weeks ago (not from Amazon)and still haven't been able to play it because it's stuck on \\"create a user\\".

It is made of steel mesh and steel supports. The \\"cover\\" is a paper-thin layer of foam covered in an adequate fabric cover. It's this paper-thin foam that is the problem. The steel mesh pattern is the only support and so the mesh pattern imprints on anything ironed. Shirts look ridiculous. It's being returned. It's no more valuable than the one they sell at the Asian flea-market for $4.Update: Dec 21, 2011 - Saw this nearly exact design at IKEA for $5. However, the foam pad on the IKEA one was about 1/4 inch thick therefore making it a better quality buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped!","review":"The only thing I like about this board is its size, it fits on top of my washer and dryer. The surface however is like a flat waffle pattern aluminum surface. The padding isn't thick enough to keep the waffle pattern from showing through on my clothes. I did try to put extra padding on it ( a thick towel) and that didn't help so I would not recommend this board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad padding","review":"I agree with previous reviewers that this board definitely needs more padding, as the mesh pattern gets printed everywhere. However the construction is sturdy enough for the price and size. Generally I would not recommend it, unless you have a way of adding the extra padding yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Quality","review":"Beautifully made and light to wear these earrings were bought to go with a rose quartz necklace.

In this respect he would probably win any races. Exellent, incredible finger-work, smooth lines-- nothing bothers.On the other hand, if one beleives that music is a pretty serious thing; if one appreciates such artists as Schnabel, Francois, Rachmaninov, Sofronitsky, Gilels or Richter; if one sees such virtuoso as Hofmann, Horowitz, Cziffra, Lhevinne not as piano technicians, but first of all as great personalities for which music and piano playing is all about sound, phrase, joy, energy, fire which come from heart. If one understands the word virtuoso in its iniatial meaning- braveness; if one in piano playing seeks for personality, most likely one will be dissapointed with this disc as well as with Mr. Volodos' other ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Had Hoped For","review":"I was looking for a good version of the Hungarian Rhapsody #2 and unfortunately, I did NOT find it here. It was probably the worst version I have heard. The dramatic intro was played at such a spastic and hyper speed that it could not be enjoyed. Other passages sounded rushed and even out of key at times. Sound quality was about average and recorded at a low volume. Was not the crisp sound I was looking for. I would recommend Hungarian Rhapsodies Vol 1., by Jeno Jando instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VIRTUOSO FOR BARNUM","review":"What in Horowitz and in other virtuoso pianist serves to art, here is used to have succes of mass.

Perhaps, the great russian school of piano playing is at the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"superlatives fail","review":"Volodos is simply one of the greatest pianists I have ever heard. The transcriptions on this CD are well worth your investment. I was fortunate to hear Volodos at Lincoln Center play the finger-bending Prokofiev 2nd piano concerto. I am a professionally trained pianist, and I have simply never heard a performance to equal it. I was convinced two or more people were playing. The emotional power was overwhelming. I wish he would record it. And the complete Transcendantal Etudes."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overall Outdated Disappointment","review":"I worked in Wyoming for several months in 2004 and bought this book for my \\"weekend adventures in rock hounding\\". I was and still am grossly disappointed with the book. Many of the sites that this book stated where on BLM or Forest Service land were indeed on private property. I thought that a more fruitful use of my time would be to visit the rock shops listed in the back of the book. Again, I was grossly disappointed. Many of the shops closed down, changed hands, or moved. Although this book was published in 1996, Appendix B was already outdated per some of the Rock Shop owners I did find. My recommendation is to find a phone book when you pull into a town, look under \\"rock shops\\", and call to see if they are open (or will open for you).Lessons Learned: If the black and white photos in the book use wheatback pennys for scale, the information included in the book may be as dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"We have used the guides to many sites and enjoyed searching and hunting for rocks all over Wyoming.

This wonderful compilation includes gorgeous ballads from such obscure but talented groups like Act One, The Mayberry Movement, Teacher's Edition, The Epsilons and many others whose records wnt nowhere when originally issued but that are today considered valuable collector's items. If you love Sweet Soul ballads then this CD must be added to your collection.

A must-have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raymond Chandler meets M.F.K Fisher","review":"Richard Sterling's writing is like nothing I've encountered before in food or adventure writing--an amazing cross between Raymond Chandler's hard-boiled detective writing and M.F.K. Fisher's hymns to food and culture. This is one unique talent at work, someone you shouldn't miss. And lest I forget, in many of the stories in this book, he's funnier than Bill Bryson or David Sedaris--not just laugh out loud funny, but tears-streaming down your face funny.Perhaps the book is more of a guy's book, but I think women might find it a fascinating look into a man's life...exotic shores, strange meals, poignant friendships, wartime adventures, and all kinds of nonsense that men do indeed revel in."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Union of Folk and Rock on CD","review":"David Baerwald, Warren Zevon, Bob Dylan and more...

A few chapters into it, she said, \\"This is the sort of stuff I wanted to learn in my women's studies courses.\\"Betsy Israel's writing is engaging and compelling; her approach is sensible and even-handed.

Great way to hide your electronics and still have complete remote control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good quality.","review":"This product is well constructed. However the quick release is not strong enough to hold this in place. If you are getting a rack with pannier supports, then you will have at least a few pounds hanging on this. I have no doubt that it can support the weight without breaking. The problem is that it shifts side to side and rubs the tire, even with very easy riding. I had to put a piece of rubber inside the clamp for extra grip and I have to use channel locks or a vise grip to help clamp it every time. If you are serious about wanting to have a rack you can remove, get a second seat and post. Then you can mount it permanently for the extra rigidity. If you don't need the pannier supports, then there wont be anything to rub the tire and the little bit of side to side movement probably won't be a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente!","review":"This was an excelent book for my theme of weather for my second grade bilingual students.

But what really changed things was when my partner Paul had a lok at it - probably he thought it was all about sex -and really got into it.

The gate does not work properly with the pressure mount. I purchased this gate to stop my toddler from going from the living room into the kitchen. I followed the installation instructions to install the gate without screwing it into my walls. When you attempt to move it back and forth it seems secure. However, today I went to open the gate, the bottom of it got caught, although the top was open. When I tried to pull the opening part of the gate up to open it the gate fell forward with the weight of it pulling me forward. I fell on top of it hurting myself. Thank goodness it was me and not my toddler.DO NOT BUY IF YOU PLAN ON USING AS A PRESSURE MOUNT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended for children, dogs, cats...","review":"We bought two of these gates, black and white. One is used for our two large dogs and the other is at the top of our stairs for our toddler's safety and to keep our cats upstairs, safe from cat-unfriendly dogs. They are sturdy, easy to install and use.We live in an old home with uneven door frames and have to use wood shims on the stairwell gate. It still works great and only occasionally needs to be re-adjusted. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny!","review":"This gate is worth every penny! We have a 22 month old who could climb or push over anything we had tried before in an extra wide opening. She is a very determined little girl. We set this gate up and she is finally safe and secure in the family room. She has tried everthing she can to shake it loose, climb over and work the latch. Thankfully she has failed at all attempts. The gate opening is wide enough for the adults to fit through comfortably. The gate swings back securely, but I double check just to be sure. The latch is very secure and operates easily after getting \\"the hang of it\\". It sets up very easily with little effort. A great product!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Made Product","review":"Excellent product. Keeps our dog in kitchen and we go in/out without stepping over smaller fence or bending down to unlock something. Fits our 43 inch opening. Rather than unlatching gate to get in/out, we usually just lift up on gate. Dog can not do that. Note that mounting the gate requires lots of pressure on the mounting screws (you twist these by hand). As you twist the screws, it forces together the gate sides to get proper gap. Since frame is very stiff, it can put a lot of pressure on a small area (I used the small, round mounting pads). Seems like it could push through wall board that is not supported (like on stud). Ours is mounted in equivalent to door frame area and has lots of support."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL GATE","review":"This gate has been fantastic. We have been using it for 3 years now, and it has been so easy to use. I admit the opening is too large, but safe enough for everyone to get through. It's easy to modify to suit your needs. I recommend these types of gates, which swing open, as I tripped over a tension gate (freestanding style) and broke my leg. Be safe, not sorry.

The denouement is completely absurd and there is absolutely no way the reader could possibly guess at the solution: Madoc Rhys does all the figuring in his head (making some amazing leaps of \\"logic\\" in the process) and Craig doesn't see fit to let the reader in on any of it.

Compared to the well-known Reiner recording, it sounds like no more than a run-through.I was similarly curious about Williams' Bassoon Concerto, as I enjoy hearing that instrument featured by other composers, but again I was disappointed. To me it had a disjointed singsong quality and went nowhere. It seemed neither beautiful, nor dramatic, nor atmospheric.I won't comment on the other compositions, as I didn't get this disk to hear them; other reviewers have covered them sufficiently. A final note: the recording quality as regards imaging and soundstaging is mediocre, which seems inexcusable from a major label."},{"rating":"1","title":"MC 5 - 'Extended Versions' (BMG Special Products)","review":"Ten live tracks here,mostly aimed at the true MC 5 hardcore fans and completists.Sound isn't that good,STILL I've heard worse.Not sure if this live concert has been released under any other title.If you're patient and are willing to take time fiddling around with your stereo controls,you MIGHT be able to 'set' the dismal sound to appear to be semi-acceptable.I sort of did just that.Some of the listenable cuts here are the opener \\"Kick Out The Jams\\",\\"Revolutionary Blues\\",the classic MC 5 foot-stomper \\"Looking At You\\",a Booker T.Jones classic that was made well known by Cream \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" and their eleven-minute closer \\"Black To Comm\\".If you want to check out some really great archive live MC 5,hunt down a copy of 'Teenage Lust' and 'Live At Sturgis Armory'(see my reviews of both)."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOVIE + SONG = Beautiful Perfection","review":"A beautifully crafted masterpiece of a song, \\"Man of the Hour,\\" is Pearl Jam's contribution to Tim Burton's new motion picture, \\"Big Fish.\\" Don't expect to realize the true beauty and lyrical perfection of this song however, until you see the movie.Unlike most songs found on a movie soundtrack, \\"Man of the Hour,\\" was inspired by and written after the artist saw a preview of the movie. This becomes obviously apparant when you listen to the song again after seeing the film, and the experience is likely to bring tears to the listeners eyes.Mr. Vedder, who penned the lyrics and music for the track has been nominated for a Golden Globe and Critic's Choice award for his songwriting efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie and Bruce","review":"This song epitomizes Eddie Vedder's coming of age as a superior and premier songwriter. Nothing is purer than writing about the relationship between a father and son. As far a repeating lyrics as one reviewer noted, I believe this is a moot point. Springsteen used many of the same lyrics over and over again in developing his songs. Look at the Nebraska album. Some lyrics are repeated from track to track. This makes no difference. The song, its imagery and its unity distinguish Vedder among the top songwriters today. Pearl Jam is just a tremendous band in their prime. This song both invigorates and breaks the heart. And that is what music is supposed to do, go to the heart. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adoreable","review":"I purchased this for Kitty and she really likes it.

It is smaller than I thought, but she fits perfectly into it when she curls up into a sleepy ball. At first she refused to lay in it, but after we placed her in it a few times, she decided it was comfy and will now curl up in it on her own.

I've read other graphic novels and compared to them the illustrations here are more stark but equally rewarding; Satrapi uses a simple (but not simplistic) black and white style that is quite expressive as she tells the story of life before, during and after the 1979 Revolution that changed life in Iran for so many people.Fearing for her safety, her parents send her to school in Europe, and the author does a wonderful job of articulating her maturation as an individual and as a citizen of a tumultuous country. Persepolis 2 details her experiences when she returns to her homeland as a young woman.Enlightening and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent graphic account of a real life story","review":"Very original format: telling the story of a revolution, a major event in world history, through a graphic story about a little girl coming of age. She is from a middle class family in Tehran and tells us about the fall of the Shah and the rise of the islamic republic thourgh the eyes of a child. A child who is very aware of what is going on around her and is not afraid to speak up. Through the microstory of her family, her school, her relatives and neighbors we learn a lot about everyday life in Tehran in that period.The book ends with her departure for Austria in 1983 where her parents sent her to be safe from the dangers of war with Iraq and of internal repression. I am looking forward to reading the sequelPersepolis 2: The Story of a ReturnPS I am not sure why the author chose the title Persepolis for this book, does anyone know?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoir of an Iranian Childhood","review":"This graphic memoir documents the Iranian childhood of Marjane Satrapi, the only child of Marxist parents. Beginning with the Islamic revolution of 1979, the author uses black and white drawings in a simple comic-strip format to invoke Iran's tumultuous history, from prehistory days, to the eventual overthrow of the Shah and the triumph of the restrictive Islamic regime. At the heart of this memoir, however, is Marjane's beloved family. Her supportive parents, grandmother, and relatives are as endearing as the spirited, outspoken young girl who narrates their family's story. Persepolis came to the silver screen in 2007, and was named a New York Times Notable Book. Recommended for ages 16-Up for language and violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I had to read this for my Perspectives on Youth Cultures class and I was intrigued because it was the first graphic novel I have ever read. Well, I finished it in one setting! The book is wonderful. It's fresh and being that it's from a child's persepctive she just \\"tells it like it is\\". The graphics are relevant and very effective at adding depth, meaning, and really illustrating what's going on during this time in Iran.For me, this book was an excellent tool for developing a better understaning of the Iranian Revolution. Some may say \\"Oh it's only one person's persepctive so it can't represent Iran and Iran is not really like that\\". In response, everyone's perspective is just that \\"their\\" perspective. The author writes in such a way that is first-hand knowledge and so \\"straight up\\" that she is a credible source in my eyes. I just purchased persepolis 2 and cannot wait to begin reading it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of a generation","review":"Persepolis is the story of I and many many other people who grew up during late 70s to late 80s in Iran. It is an entertaining story, yet a realistic and unbiased history lesson. For me it is like the story of my life and I can connect with it 100 percent. And from the comments by other readers, it seems that even those who are completely unrelated to the events and circumestances described in the story can connect with it easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible and educational story","review":"I absolutely loved this graphic novel. It is told in a tone I can't quite describe, but it's innocent yet heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time. What an incredible lady Ms. Satrapi is.

This is in my favorites list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can We Understand ?","review":"This book is about a little girl named Marji during the Iranian Revolution (Against the Shah) and the Islamic Revolution ( Against the Islamic Republic). In this book it jumps between periods of time. It starts out after the Iranian Revolution then goes back to the Iranian Revolution. The book then continues staying in the actual order of events. Another thing that is great about Persepolis is how it is a graphic novel memoir.The illustrations really help you visualize the events and lower the reading time.This book was great.

The story of a young girl struggling to live in Iran comes across amazingly clear. I would recommend the novel to young adults and over despite the age of the character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"The story of a young a girl during the Iranian revolution and into wartime with Iraq is at times touching and funny, and at others absolutely horrifying. Satrapi truly captures the nature of these difficult times without pandering to emotion or losing the innocence of a child's point of view. The story is split into 'chapters' which can sometimes make the story seem a little disjointed, but never enough to really distract. The artistic style is simple but effective, and really captures some of the more surreal moments, such as her conversations with God. Definitely a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate for the young - cursing","review":"I had intended to use this in my class, because it was well recommended. However, after previewing this book I was hugely offended at the thought young teens would read this. There are several, very nasty, curse words and an illustration that depicts a man's privates as he urinates on a prisoner. I understand the need to make the torture known and to stay real to the moment, but that took it too far. I DO NOT recommend this book be used for young readers. I love books like \\"Night\\" by Elie Weisel, because even though it is graphic in its description of the horror of German prison camps, it does not become crude, merely factual. \\"Persepolis\\" could have left out those cruder elements and still been a book of interest when showing a changing view of Iranian politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Recommend","review":"I didn't like this book. Sometimes you only need a bite to know you won't finish the whole meal. That's how I felt about this book.Maybe I'm not a graphic reader, but I do like The Snowman book. I wonder how it works on kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Comic Strip!","review":"Man, was I disappointed. This book is a comic strip. It may have had a lot of meaning, to those involved at the time it was written, with many government stings hidden in the strip, but for enjoyable reading, it stunk. I got through it in half an hour, hardly my idea of buying good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"I learned much","review":"This book caught my attention and sparked my interest in the history of the region. Definitely worth a read... and will probably leave you hungry for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but...","review":"It's beyond horrible that anybody has to grow up in that scenario, especially children! The problem I had with the story is that I found the main character pretty much unlikeable. I have children so I am aware that kids aren't exactly a big bundle of tactfulness but telling another little girl that her father is probably dead is reprehensible. If you factor in that she is 9 or 10 and not 5 or 6 years old it makes her comment seem more hateful than tactless. She also came off as taking pleasure in other people's misery. I didn't like her parents either. Considering all the turmoil in their country I was pretty much astounded that they decided to take a vacation for just the two of them while leaving the daughter behind. I can't even imagine parting from my children under those circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick, okay read...","review":"Persepolis follows the life of the author as she is growing up in Iran amid wars and uprisings. Told in graphic novel form, it reminded me a lot of Maus, the only other graphic novel I had read before. Personally, I liked Maus better, but this could be because I read both parts of Maus, while I have yet to get my hands on the second volume of Persepolis. In its own right, it did teach me lots about Iran that I didn't know before, and I was interested enough to want to pick up the follow-up. Maybe I'll like it more after I get the whole story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Female Perspective","review":"At first when I opened this book I was completely skeptical. The first thought that crossed my mind was, \\"Really? A GRAPHIC novel?!\\" Still, it came highly recommended, so I gave it a go.This book is a necessary female voice on the Muslim history and experience in Iran. It is witty, whole-hearted, and sincere.This book is great for bookclubs, ungrateful teenagers, women, friends, anyone wishing to understand Iran, etc.Makes a great gift. I found it to be more compelling than the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"In person","review":"Please take the time to read this striking memoir and its sequel, Persepolis 2. The language is straightforward, as is the graphic style. Satrapi's very personal story speaks to both the difficulties of living in a straight-laced, dogmatically rigid society, and the many different stories and perspectives of those who live there. Iran is often portrayed in a reductionist manner in the West, and a close reading of these books serves to broaden and deepen our understanding.Additionally, Satrapi is currently near the end of a speaking tour in the U.S. IF you have the opportunity to hear her speak, take advantage of it. She is a cogent and compassionate speaker who will further deepen your understanding of the Iranian people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like MAUS, a graphic intro to political tragedy","review":"Simple, beautiful illustration and humane tone characterize this introduction to a human tragedy, the Iranian revolution of 1979. Satrapi is a young woman of Vienna and Paris now, but grew up spending age zero to twelve in Iran. PERSEPOLIS is her testament to the crimes committed first by the Shah and then the thousandfold worse crimes created by a revolution which was supposed to address the problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling graphic novel","review":"This book was so enveloping that I ended up reading it in one sitting and often returned to it later to look over all of the great images. Satrapi's black and white drawings evoke wood block printing and draw the reader into the initmate world of her family and neighbors as they cope with the drastic changes in their society and its effect on their social lives and education.

By compiling her childhood memories, Marjane is, indeed, sharing with the world, the sufferance that Iranian adolescents went through in the époque of 1980s. Never had I dared to dream that one day, a story-teller as powerful as Marjane, would depict the seemingly insignificant anecdotes of my childhood, simultaneously embellishing them with simple yet impressive illustrations. Thank you Marjane, for engraving the memories of a nation into the pages of history, thus rendering them eternal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"For the price, the 'Glorious Pipes' CD proves to be a great value; really two CDs for the price of one. The variety of selections makes for some great listening. I recommend this CD package highly; definitely a great bargain. In terms of making the purchase I found the detailed listing very helpful. I had checked other CDs in terms of composer, compositions and organists, but kept coming back to this CD. To sample the music is a great highlight prior to ordering, though this CD stood alone, in my opinion, merely by great pieces of music being presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid !!!","review":"Absolutely splendid recordings.

I read reviews of many including this one.I am getting older and need a seat with wheels to help me get around in my office and in the garage. I ordered it on April 15, 2011 from Amazon.com and received it on April 20. What great service. I was excited to get the package and within minutes to have the stool assembled.However since then it has been downhill. When I sit on the stool each of the wheels lay down instead of staying directly upright. The wheels obviously cannot work when they lay down. Three of the holders are already broken where the wheels are attached at the bottom of the stool. Something obviously is wrong. It is a big waste of $58.12.

Unless you are not planning to use your stool, pay a little more and get one that will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"read reviews before purchasing! Mine does not adjust!","review":"I saw several negative reviews before buying this stool, mostly about being noisey or uncomfortable. But since I was using this on a carpet, I wasnt worried about the noise. I built it in minutes the casters were already on the base, which is strange because it probably was a returned item. Then I noticed it did not raise up or down and I was kicking myself for buying this piece of junk.

The size is perfect for tight spaces, I love having the easy height adjustment depending on what I'm doing around the massage table, and the wheels work smoothly.

He then talks about Israel Bissel and compares the warning to PAul Revere by suggesting Revere was chosen because of his name. This idiot then sings, \\"While I tell you a tail of Israel Bissel!\\" Again simply not funny. He walks in during the beginning with his chest out and looks like a complete tool. His dress annoys me.

For anyone even remotely interested in the 90's, lemme tell ya...they sucked completely. Fashion was asinine and except for a few small pockets of music, that sucked as well. Everything \\"hip\\" and \\"cool\\" was being bought up by big business who were running over themselves to cash in on \\"youth culture\\" at a sickening and alarming rate. It was a horrorfying time to be alive, only to be outdone by the oughts (00's). Pathetic, cruel, and no redeeming value whatsoever. Buy something like \\"Alice's Restaurant\\" instead.

Most of the shorter 1 disc Charley Patton greatest hits cds contain this classic recording, so why was it left off this more generous anthology?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD!","review":"Listening to this CD is like stepping back in time.

It is however a little small for the E-500 2 lens kit. The only way to completely fit everything in the bag is to have the body and the lens separate.

I generally have to leave one of the lens at home or I have to take the time (and find a clean environment) to attach the lens to the body.

This CD grabs you from the start and doesn't let go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put this in your shopping cart!","review":"In today's music world there is a lot of Bach being recorded and much of this is by young, solo violinists. This may make it difficult when deciding which ones you would like to have. I can only give Hilary's debut the highest possible recommendation and hope that you enjoy it as much as I have. If you want to hear these pieces performed with great emotion, passion and precision Hilary will not disappoint you. The few seconds between movements seems too long of a silence and when the disk is complete I'm usually pressing the play button again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I am an young violinist, only 11 years old. Her playing is great, it's also expresses the feelings the song holds. And since I play the violin myself, I know how hard it is to play the songs that she play. And I've met Hilary Hahn, hearing her play is magical."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's wrong with you people?","review":"The interpretations of the S&P on this cd are soooooooooo boring and mechanical. I don't know who could say they were emotional, they sound like midi files. Included on this cd has to be the most boring chaconne I have ever heard in my life. On top of that, you can hear how they pretty much edited these recordings together phrase by phrase. She does have some nice technique, but she's not old enough for this music yet. Get the Heifetz or Milstein's second if you wanna hear the way it should be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like MIDI files!","review":"Her sound and technique is nice, however her tracks sound like MIDI files and patched together! Also, her chaconne is ridiculously slow and can be so boring! I prefer the Bach of Laura St. John to Ms. Hahns because she shows more signs of life in her playing. For definitive Bach, try Oscar Shumsky, Szeryng, or Menuhin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too young to play Bach","review":"I found this CD to be clear, in tune, and boring. It is technically good, but mechanically played. While the opening to the E major partita is wonderful, it doesn't move after that. I recommend Lara St. John's CD-she captures the essence of Bach as if she were born to play it. If in ten years Ms. Hahn records the Bach again, I will buy it, with hope that being older enables her to understand these amazing works of art. I don't doubt she is a wonderful player, but I think that on this CD she sounds immature and too young to play Bach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and mechanic","review":"While listening to this album, one thing comes to mind: a robot playing a violin. Moreover, Hahn's playing shows no emotion or spirit of any kind. She sounds as if she's afraid to break away from the confines of perfect rhythm and tempo, and for a work such as this, it is fatal. Bach's work was made to be played with expression, passion, and in that degree she has failed miserably. She may have good tone and time, but beyond that, not much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning debut, artist more mature than most of her elders.","review":"I have never enjoyed any other performance of this music as much as I did this one.

Her Beethoven recording is a must-have. All of my violin students are required to listen to her Beethoven concerto when we begin studying it. Unforuntately, her Bach recording is not as special. I had the opportunity to hear her rendition of Partita No. 3 and there was a distinct lack of direction in phrasing and depth which isn't her best. If you want to add this CD to your collection because you must have a complete Hahn collection, well....but if not, you probably won't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"An OK CD by a polished violinist who has evidently not had the time yet to have any kind of life-the playing within is lifeless, and earnest, but forcibly so, as though someone taught every note to her. Pales in comparison to one of my most treasured recordings;these same great works played by Lara St John in which the beauty and wildness and passion is beyond compare.I cannot reccomend this Hahn disc of Bach...Perhaps she will soon record something she feels more strongly about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I didn't like it.It was pressured upon me by all the aggressive advertising but I've heard much better Bach. Either Kanterow or the much hyped disc of Lara St John is much more satisfying. This girl plays well but it sounds heavily edited and disjunct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbocharged Bach","review":"Hahn projects a tremendous amount of exuberance through her playing while maintaining a certain degree of outward repose. For instance, she takes the Prelude to the Partita No. 3 at a decidedly brisk tempo but navigates its tricky landscape of implied harmony and counterpoint with stunning clarity and precision. The same might be said of the Allegro in the Sonata No. 3. The famous Chaconne from the Partita No. 2, on the other hand, is played at a very deliberate tempo but with a searing intensity that stems from clever application of phrasing and dynamics. Throught the recording, one always senses a powerful musical intelligence operating in the background. This young violinist is fearless both in her choice of repertoire and execution thereof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"These bars are high fiber, low calorie, high protein and just enough energy to get through the afternoon without other snacking.

I belive you should try baking with commercial \\"instant\\" or \\"Active\\" yeast before you try her methods. All her bread is made with a natural sourdough starter that takes two weeks to create, and requires daily feeding. The result is the best bread on earth. It is a lot of work. I end up baking more than I can eat, but my friends and family benefit from this. The recipes in this book take time: In most cases two days before a loaf is completed. It is worth it. Just schedule your time around the dough rising periods."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not it.","review":"I thought I had found the secret to making delicious artisan sourdough bread. I made the starter using grapes but sadly the bread was not up to my expectations. This book turned out to be a waste of money. The secret to the bread I am looking for wasn't in this book. I have tried Ed Wood's book and starters, the special Baparoma steam pan, etc. but am still searching for the perfect bread."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete failure","review":"boring writing, boring recipes. u.s measures.just another old book. don't waste your money like i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"If you like to look at nice, glossy pics of bread rather than really bake, this is the book for you. While Silverton no doubt produces some of the best bread out there, her book leaves much to be desired. Her recipe for starter will have the unwilling participant end up with something like 7 pounds of starter!!! And, she specifically says not to scale it down. Ridiculous. Also, the yeasted breads in the cookbook all call for compressed yeast, which is next to impossible to find anymore. Why does no one use it anymore? BECAUSE IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME THING AS ACTIVE DRY AND INSTANT YEAST!!! But Silverton has to make it difficult, as some bread masochists think difficulty is necessary to produce good bread.If you want a good book on bread, buy Reinhart's \\"Bread Baker's Apprentice.\\" I feel it will probably be a classic in no time. It is, without exception, the best book written on bread baking. Ever. The recipes all work, and every step of the process is explained in great detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated","review":"This book is too complicated for the home cook. It's hard to make even a close facsimile of the La Brea Bakery breads without a special commercial steam oven. The degree of complexity is not warranted by the final result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the novice","review":"La Brea Bakery produces an amazing product that I hoped to duplicate (or at least make an attempt) at home. Although I feel very comfortable in the kitchen, I was very intimiated by her lengthy home made starter instructions and thus her book has sat on my shelf unused. Unless you are willing to make the costly and time consuming starter, this book is of no value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the Novice but Excellent for serious bakers","review":"Since I purchased a bread machine that is completely programmable I began experimenting with Sourdough Breads. My experiments were a mixed success. This book has given me a wealth of information of the bread making process and using sourdough. It has helped me troubleshoot and diagnose my experiments. It is NOT for the faint at heart baker, but if you're serious about sourdough, this is THE book to own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent reference - major snob appeal","review":"Despite her protestations to the contrary, the author is a snob with too much time on her hands. Maybe she has two or three days to spend on a batch of bread, but as any baker knows, you can produce delicious, satisfying bread in a fraction of a day. Don't be fooled into thinking you have to undergo her rituals to \\"take your baking to the next level.\\"At one point she compares yeasted bread to to cake mix (because its so-called inferior character). What rubbish. Yeasted bread has a fine history and great character. There are some useful tips, but you needn't go to the trouble she demands to make great bread. Her obsession with the topic is overwhelming even to experienced bakers. It's hard for me to imagine that she has any fun baking or serving bread..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nancy Silverton's Breads from La Brea Bakery","review":"This is a book for retired professional bakers who get up at 6 AM and retire at 12 midnight. How does the author expect any real person who is not Exphedra or other stimulants to keep her schedules on a one person/baker basis? If I had professional bakers working around the clock, I would not need her cryptic recipes. I would live in Malibu!Sad sticky fingers down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a disappointment...","review":"This book was written like a novel, alot of description and lacking pictures (only the finished products on the back of the book covers and some (less than 10) between pages, its a good book for those that like to cuddle in front of a fire place with a hot coco. Also a good book for those with good imagination. For those that want color pictures to show you every step of the way (like Wayne Gisslen), sorry, this is not the book. There are many great recipes (that is the only reason that prevented me from giving it a one star), but like I said,....its almost like a recipe book written by Stephen King. Readers should have some basic knowledge about baking before reading this book. Definitely not for beginner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"uses white flour in all recipes","review":"I was disgusted to look at this book, which i just got but haven't used.All the recipes contain white flour!!! The author is not my kind of person and it's not my kind of bread. I'm a no-compromise whole grain adherent. I read labels in the store, and anything containing white flour, i don't buy. I haven't touched white flour for decades.I was looking for a smart author to figure out ways of dealing with whole grain flour; she didn't even try; she quit before she started. Thank goodness there are are amazing new whole grain bread books available!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Wasteful Sourdough Ever!","review":"I tried this book in my search for info on baking \\"artisan\\" breads. Her process for making a sourdough \\"levain\\" is ridiculous. It requires a great deal of flour, most of which she recommends discarding along the way! If she runs her business on this model, she can't possibly be making any money. I also agree that she makes it uneccesarily complicated and esoteric. It's bread- a daily staple- that's the miracle- it's simple.Instead, I recommend \\"The Village Baker\\", by Joe Ortiz- it's here on Amazon in paperback. He also gives much more comprehensive info on why certain techniques are used and regional bread recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional caliber bread in your kitchen","review":"Worth every bit of the effort. Most bakers scale down or simplify their recipes, it appears Silverton did neither. This is bread baking ecstasy!! I quartered the recipe minimizing wasted flour and it worked fine, and I refrigerate it every so often for a week at a time. This is professional caliber bread in my kitchen, and that's a dream come true. Thanks to Nancy for sharing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guide to understanding what it takes to make good bread!","review":"I searched for years to find a way to make good \\"old world\\" style bread at home and have finally found a guide to get me there. It's not the oven, it's not some super-d-duper flour. What it takes is understanding, attention to detail, and time. This book will give you the understanding necessary to get a good loaf. The author dedicates about 60 pages, going through every phase, to the first recipe!).If you are serious about your bread this is a terrific place to start or end your search!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow and monotonus reading","review":"The author begins his story slowly, continues it through out the entire book until the last 2-3 chapters where the pace picks up for a dramatic scene and a complete let down ending. I was excited to begin this book but as of this point in time, I have no desire to finish this trilogy because the meat of the book was slow, boring and non eventfull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amulet of Nothing","review":"I was excited by the premise of this book but I must give it a bad rating since nothing really happens in it. Having a djinni serve a young magician is a great idea but the author does nothing with it. The djinni does nothing exciting with his powers and the young boy magician is a snivelling bore. It seems many are trying to write the new \\"Harry Potter.\\" Many are trying and many are failing...but they're getting published anyway. A total mystery to me. So, avoid this book and look for your young adult fantasy elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"It HAD potential.","review":"I think this book would make a great movie. While Harry Potter directors are agonizing over the amount of great material left on the cutting room floor, I think that there is only about 2 hours of decent material in this entire book, so it would make a director's job a piece of cake. I kept waiting for it to get exciting, riveting, even \\"not boring.\\" It never did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Absolutly wonderful, the mytic and style of Harry potter with a more poitical twist , also mixing some david eddings into it, I Loved it absolutly wonderful read, can't wait for the 2nd book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"This book is about a young boy who is training to be a magician and a djinni named Bartemeus.This book is a tale that all will enjoy.If you like Harry Potter,you will like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be missed. Seriously.","review":"The trilogy is incredible -- both for teens and adults. The talent to write and storytell this well is a true blessing. It's a story about magic, adventure, deception, mystery...and above all there is so much humor and sarcastic humor. Just make sure you read ALL the footnotes -- it is worth it. It was hard for me when I finiehed the last of the 3 books -- my life felt empty because the series had completely engulfed my mind, emotions and soul. Like I said, it is a series that is not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such An Original","review":"The Amulet of Amarkand is a uniquely remarkable book and the first of it's genre that I wasn't able to put down since The Harry Potter Books. If you're a fan of these kinds of fantasy novels, no doubt you won't regret giving this a go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"This is a truly wonderful trilogy, very well written, although it is quite dark.Once you get past the first few chapters, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book, very well read","review":"I got this audio on a whim and didn't know what to expect. What a lucky break for me! This book is fantastic. It's definitely dark, with dark motivations (revenge, humiliation, lack of love) for a young boy. Nevertheless, you can't help but root for this poor, brilliant boy. The genie is wonderfully witty, and the chapters told from his point of view are some of the best and most original. I hurried to get the next book in the trilogy and was bitterly disappointed to learn the next audio is not due out until August.The person who reads this book on audio is perfect, and adds to the experience.I'm an adult, but I want my 10 year old to listen to the Amulet of Samarkand as well. It's appropriate and entertaining for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amulet of Samarkand","review":"I'll keep this short. This is an awesome book. If you have any ideas about it being some kind of Harry Potter repeat, forget them and go buy books one of the Bartimaeus Trilogy. When I first saw it, and started reading it, I hadn't even thought about it being an attempt to copy H.P. And although I'd be a liar if I said this book wasn't at all similiar to the Harry Potter series, it's a book all in it's own (as many other reviewers have mentioned) and should defintley be on your must read list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"All I can say is Harry and Artemis better watch out! This was a very good read, one of the best I have had in a long time. The story itself is indepth, invigorating, and leaves you practically drooling for more. As if that wasn't enough the book is also hilarious. This altogether makes for a fantastic read, which I strongly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous, witty, and oh so EXCITING!","review":"Nathanial is a troubled young apprentice of Arthur Underwood. He attempts to seek revenge on a powerful magician who, in the past, embarassed him beyond human embarassment. So, Nathanial summons a djinni(or demon) to steal a valuable divise from the magican. With doing so, he discovers a secret so dangerous, he himself has to suffer immensly for meddling with it!Johnathan Stroud creates a new world of magic that no other writer has been able to create. Combined with wit and intelect, this writer has quite a future ahead of himself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page Turner.","review":"Just when you think that you are getting to the end of what literary wizards can achieve with Rowling and Pullman, along comes Stroud with his brilliant and inventive fantasy. Containing a narrative split between Nathaniel (a boy apprentice wizard and his mischievous djinn (as in genie) Bartimaeus, we are catapulted into an alternative modern London where commoners (such as ourselves) are hardly worth mentioning and wizards rule the government. Our journey follows Nathaniel as he unwittingly steals an amulet from a powerful wizard, Simon Lovelace, as revenge for the boys mistreatment. Little does he know that this theft will unleash a devastating train of events which he seems powerless to prevent. One of the best fantasies I've read for quite sometime. Move over Rowling and Pullman. There's a new kid on the block!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More violence, better writing than in 'Potter'","review":"Parents should know that the book contains quite a bit of violence: murders of characters occur throughout the book, children possibly commit violent crimes, and brutalities against people and magical beings are detailed.I'm not complaining! The darker passages are not gratuitous but contribute to the story's progress and fill out a captivating, believable world. If I were 12, I'd be grateful for someone not sugar-coating a good story.\\"The Amulet\\" is more tautly woven than the Harry Potter stories, and Stroud's writing is better and more disciplined than J. K. Rowling's. Then again, Rowling's characters are more vivid, and she creates more Atmosphere around them.I think bright young readers will appreciate the publisher's decision to leave in the British jargon for U.S. sales and not (as with the Harry Potter books) make an Americanized version. A boy wears trainers (not sneakers), a car has a bonnet (not a hood), a teen has spots (not pimples), etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"Well I just I can not recommend it. On each page there are explanatory footnotes to references made within the paragraphs that are altogether more interesting than the story line. Bartimaeus is some kind of ultra powerful demon, djinn, or spirit that gets summoned by a 12 year old and sent off to retrieve the Amulet of Samarkand - lackluster adventure ensues. I would not recommend this trilogy to any of your younger relatives. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magicians portraited as evil, selfish and vindictive","review":"When I read this trilogy was a combination of Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl I bought it immediately, and it was a huuuuge deception. The trilogy is awful, I hated it, it has none of the charm of the Potter books nor the cleverness of the Fowl books.Magicians are portraited as evil, selfish and vindictive, who use magic solely to their own good. Magical beings are their slaves, forcely brought to this world to obey the magicians orders, which may vary from cooking to delivering mail to killing their enemies.Did I say I hated it? I would give no stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken amulet","review":"Is it me or is it written like for 1st graders but with violence for no reason? He turned into a mole, oops no he turned into a fly, ooops no he turned into a worm, oopns no he turned back into a dink. What kind of writing is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The author shouldn't review his work here","review":"It's become painfully obvious that the author and his friends are writting all the positive reviews about this series. The fact is, this series is amongst the worst and most sophomoric of modern fantasy writings. DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER BOOK BY JONATHAN STROUD!! If it were possible, I would give this book and the series 0 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing story","review":"I picked up this book wanting to hate it, as I do most HarryPotter spinoffs. However, this multi-factured story transported me to magical parralel world with characters (namely... Bartimaeus) so unique to anything I've ever read before. The book takes many unexpected and daring turns and with Bartimaeus narrating half of it, keeps you laughing throughout the darkest events. Jonathan Stroud is an amazing story teller. I wish he would release more in the States. I'm so glad I read this- it's the best book I've read up all summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story For ? By:\\"The Fonz\\"","review":"First off i want to explain the title \\"A story for ?\\" i put this title because i dont want to fill in that \\"?\\" with a word because that would make people think it was for certain readers when in truth The Bartimaeus Trilogy which is now all out and ready to bought is for anyone who has an interest for mystery, magic, and secrecy. I will say nothing about the story in detail because I have read the entire triliogy and found it started great and couldnt stop the last book is great with a surprisngly tragic ending but enough about this and on with the review. This book is great for all ages. GO BARTIMAEUS!!! By:\\"The Fonz\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amulet of Samarkand is a must read book!","review":"The Amulet of Samarkand is a thrilling and suspenseful book written by Jonathan Stroud.I very much reccomend this book. Nathaniel is twelve year olds and is a magician's apprentice. His master is Arthur Underwood who is a magician but not a very good one. Nathaniel summons a djinni, demon, called Bartimaeus to steal the Amulet of Samarkand from a magician, Simon Lovelace, who had humiliated Nathaniel earlier. Unfortunately Simon realizes Nathaniel has the Amulet and kills Nathaniel's master and his wife. Filled with anger and revenge Nathaniel accompanied by Bartimaeus set out to Heddleham Hall, where Lovelace is making plans to take over the country. Nathaniel succeeds in stopping Simon Lovelace's plan and is rewarded with a new master. The book has a unique plot and is a must read. I advise reading this book in the morning because it is a hard book to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild!","review":"Now I have read many books about wizards and magic, but this one is different. You have a smart-talking djinni who is modern and fresh. Bartimaeus is his name and he is the best thing about the book. You will not be able to put this book down and find yourself laughing at Bartimaeus's jokes or quotes at the bottom. I love this book; if you like a little comedy in your books, then read \\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\" :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bearable","review":"I had to struggle to force myself to finish this book, and that too was for the sake of reading more of Bartimaeus' view. Every single magician in this book, Nathaniel included, has a nearly undetectable conscience. I, personally, was unable to relate to or like any character, but, of course, Bartimaeus, who is undeniably the life's blood of this book. He is incredibly witty, and the footnotes were hilarious. The book reminded me vaguely of the Artemis Fowl series, though not as well written. All in all, I will valiantly attempt to proceed in finishing the trilogy, out of pity for the author, and to see some more of Bartimaeus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Story!","review":"This book was phenomenal! I cannot wait to read sequel! Extremely well written, great story! I love children's books that I can read, being an adult, and not feel the writing is too childish. Anybody can read this book and will fall in love with it! Each character is so well described and interesting, even down to the ones with the smaller parts. A must read! Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK","review":"Of course my favorite parts in the book were Bartimaeus's parts,I love the footnotes also the little snipets about Bartimaeus's past, i hope they play a part in the other books (like who is the boy Bartimaeus liked to turn into?) The Magic is different than in Harry Potter. But this is still a really good book. I am kinda wondering if the next book is going to stay with Nathaniel or if somebody else is going to call Bartimaeus."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent adventure.","review":"At one of my summer camps I had noticed a young lady of 12 reading this book, during lunch. I make a habit of asking the children about camp; what they like most, and least - that sort of thing, for the sake of improving what, honestly, is very difficult, camp is that good. I asked about the book she was reading, and she provided the nicest positive thoughts: about the characters, the story, etc. Being a fan of this genre of book I decided, as a result of her recommendation, to read the book. Wow! Never underestimate children. Wow! A very excellent adventure indeed. No need for me to reveal any of it as the other reviewers have already accomplished that. True, there are demons, magicians, and ordinary people, a variety of good and bad. That's similar to what is real in this world of ours. Good usually wins - I like that. Mr. Stroud did good too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bartimaeus: no age restriction","review":"Like some other series, Bartimaeus is not simply for the younger generation. A wonderful and addictive read, I found many sleep deprived nights to be a symptom. Not of the horror within the book, but because I couldn't put it down! I had to read just one more chapter; and then another, and so on.I'll put it this way: I bought all three books less than a month ago. I'm finishing up the last book, as I write this. As much as I need more sleep than I've been allowing myself, I wish there were more to come!Highly recommend to anyone from 10 years old, to a few decades, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"I thought when i picked this up that it was going to be a lot like the Harry Potter series but I was wrong. It's better! It's a lot darker though. I wouldn't recommend the book for under the age of 12 at least. The plot (without any spoilers) involves a djinn captured by a magician's apprentice and forced to do his will to reek revenge on another magician for humiliating him. It gives a good lesson on how vengence can do more harm than good, but overall, while the lesson does stand out, the characters are so riviting and the story is so well written it has no sense of preachiness. Fun read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amulet of Samarkand (On the quality of purchase)","review":"Purchase was shipped in a timely manner. Lower price than if bought in store, even with shipping included. Book in excellent condition, slight damage to bottom of dust cover (most likely due to shipping). Very good purchase, 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Surprised!","review":"I started to read this book expecting it to be Harry Potter-esque and was very surprised to find this book to stand on it's own and never make me feel that it was trying to be a Harry Potter knock-off. The Amulet of Samarkand stands on it's own and I can't wait to read the rest of the Bartimaeus Trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Series!","review":"Do yourself a favor and buy all four right off the bat. You're going to want to read all of them as soon as you get into this one. Bartimaeus is a wonderful dynamic character that will leave you wanting more. I've had a hard time fining other books of this caliber. Good for older teens through adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT book! Poor quality hardback copy!","review":"First of all, this is not a poor review of Stroud's novel. It is a terrific read! My teenage sons and I all enjoyed the books in the Bartimaeus Trilogy. My problem is with the quality of a recently purchased hardback copy of the book, which I bought to replace our original paperback that was loaned around so many times it got lost. Unfortunately, this hardcover book is of exceedingly poor quality. The cover illustration looks like a knock-off and the paper is extremely thin -- like cheap newsprint. The publisher should be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Even though this book is probably written for young teens, it's still a great book for adults. Well written and fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action/comedy","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK! Bartimaeus,the demond in this story, was hilarious! He had a sarcastic nature and this is what made the book funny. It also had some action in it which made the book even better. I would recomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I needed my Harry Potter fix but got more than I bargained for - SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!","review":"In search of the next Holy Grail of books in the genre of Harry Potter, I bought this book with little expectations. Jonathan Stroud's strong sense of plot, characterization of his two heroes, young, wizard-to-be Nathaniel and wisecracking, smart aleck, Bartimaeus (his character flies off from the pages!!!) and dark, humorous storyline is simply outstanding! Don't just borrow a copy of this amazing fantasy book if you are a collector. Buy your own copy! Stroud sits beside J.K. Rowling as an amazing storyteller and in some cases, might have overtaken the throne! Nathaniel will be your next best friend after Harry Potter! Be ready to enter the world of Bartimaeusology!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, enjoyable, not perfect,","review":"Essentially what the title says. The most interesting thing about the books is the treatment of morality. None of the characters are particularly good, nice, kind, or in favor of justice. In an overcrewded market of \\"do the right thing\\", this book chooses not to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fun, Fun","review":"I loved this book. It was funny, interesting, irreverent, and a page turner. It is a wonderful, sarcastic, interesting story. It is not supposed to be a Harry Potter and does not take itself that seriously. Although I love Potter, this book has a Princess Bride element to it that is highly engaging. I love the djinni - this guy has a wry sense of humor and a love for the absurd. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Harry Potter","review":"One of the most original books in years.I really enjoyed this novel. The characters are fun to read. At times the novel dose drag on but then it gets great again. Highly recomand.Caint wait for the second book in the series. If your a fan of Harry Potter you'll love this book.

He's so witty and clever and free-spirited and funny and witty and clever and free-spirited and funny (just needed to get the message across). I love the conversations with him and Nathaniel. the way they argue is just HALARIOUS!!! But- there is one heck of an enemy here. I love the way the climax comes together with... i say no more.

In the book The Amulet of Samarkand Nathaniel is an orphaned boy that gets adopted by a wizard which is quite common in this part of England. As Nathaniel grows older he is taught the ways of magic. One day he is called by his father to meet some of his friends, and that is when he meets someone that changes everything, Simon Lovelace. Simon is cruel to Nathaniel. Now Nathaniel wants revenge. Not thinking of the consequences Nathaniel summons a genie named Bartimaeus to steel an amulet from Simon. When he gets it he hides it in his father's quarters. It's almost as if Nathaniel never learns not to mess with his elders. But by the end of the book he finds out the hard way. What will happen next to Nathaniel and his family? Read the book to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written & highly enjoyable!","review":"This book can be a little off-putting due to the brand of magic that it creates. It is definitely darker than some of the other popular series and I would be hesitant recommending it for younger children. However, for young adults (and adults of all ages), it is an extremely enjoyable story. What I most enjoyed was the incredibly dry wit of Bartimaeus, and while some have critiqued the footnotes, I adored them. It is a great example of a book which, if read with an open mind, may lead to philosophical or introspective thought on a higher order than the story itself (though don't let that frighten you away, its optional). I found myself aligning far more with the summoned \\"demons\\" than with the humans in the book. Anytime an author can create that scenario I think it points to an engaging book with at least one exceptional character, in this case Bartimaeus himself. I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book suprised me","review":"After reading all the reviews here on Amazon I decided to give this book a chance. I'm so glad I did because this book is an absolute gem. I know some people will be turned off by the magic used through the summoning of demons, but its light hearted and if anything the humans are far worse than the spirits they summon. That's one of the things I loved so much about the book was how no one was perfect. Most of the people in the book including the boy are selfish, cruel and arrogant, it's hilarious reading Bartimaeus's notes on his many observations of human behavior that oh so true. So if you're looking for a fresh and original book with a great story, and characters I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This series is a must read for all yound adult readers and their parents.

But don't worry about finding Ormandy in his prime: he had none. He was an exemplary model of bland, routine conducting masked by a velvet blanket of smooth orchestral sound.

That said, it does do a decent job of translating the GOF patterns into C#.My main gripe, and it is a big one, is that this book is *very* difficult to read because half of the relevant material is in the form of \\"challenges\\" whose answers are in an appendix at the back of the book. Please note that these \\"challenges\\" are not supplemental exercises that can be skipped -- they contain key information that is needed to understand the implementation of the pattern. Having to jump back and forth on nearly every page make the book almost unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but skip the challenges","review":"I really do like this book, but some things could have been much better like the OOzinoz projects could have been something more intuitive in my estimation and down to earth and the challenges are asking you things before they are even discussed which is a bit of a nuisance.Putting that aside, it still is an excellent resource combined with \\"Head First Design Patterns\\" and \\"Design Patterns explained\\" or if you are a more sophisticated programmer already than take on \\"Design Patterns\\" by the original authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reviews are very odd","review":"I thought the book was great.

It also explain why and how of each pattern.Its not an introduction to programming so the \\"runnable\\" code isnt really needed.I enjoyed the challenges because it re-enforces what your learning.Like the books says this is meant for the icing on the cake for developers. Not a taining session on how to program .NET.The book in my opinion is excellent. And does just what its intent says. An overview of design patterns.The reviews above are simply expecting this book to teach them fundamentals they should already know before reading this book.If you dont understand delegates, oop best practices, and .NET then get the application framework book first before reading this.Nick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Design Patterns in C#: A great book!","review":"This book is very well and clearly written, with to the point examples and figures.I enjoyed reading it, and even more enjoyed learning new patterns, and recognising some of the patterns I already did use (though without knowing it had a name).The book contains lots of \\"challenges\\" or questions, and if you try to answer them, you really get to understand the pro's and cons of every patterns... Of course, it contains all the answers, so you can check if you're thinking the right thing.Steve, please continue writing about the other 77 patterns :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a book about rockets and fireworks","review":"The book is more like a supplement to the classic \\"Design Patterns\\" by the Gang-of-Four.

Steve chooses to use an arcane fireworks company as the standard example and then adds unnecessary complexity by incorporating complex code. (At one point, Steve goes into the calculus of fireworks trajectory!) Very frustrating to struggle with the application of patterns when the sample code itself is mindboggling.Every once in a while I pick the book up to remind me how incompetent I am.

My first impressions is that it is dry, abstract, old-fashioned, even occasionally pedantic. He seems to skip the basics of each pattern, perhaps assuming that the reader is already familiar.I write software for a living, I know how important good design is, but Metsker seems to think we'll just take his word for it when he claims that such-and-such a design is the Only Correct Way. How about some examples of how each pattern could solve real design problems?While I found them tiresome, the quizzes sprinkled throughout may be useful for new programmers. But if they take this book to heart, they may \\"learn\\" that there's always one (and only one) correct solution to a problem. Real development is not so simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommened !!!","review":"This book does not explain the concepts of patterns well. For example, in the Observer chapter, the author did not give a clear definition of Observer pattern and how components interact with each other. Instead a lot of time is spent in explaining how delegate works in C#, misleading the readers to believe that event/delegate is Observe pattern. Then Author gives a \\"classic\\" example in which two rocket science formulas were given. Finally it reads to MVC, there is no MVC explained at all in the whole chapter. I do not think a beginner can get what MVC is after reading through the whole chapter.This is worst tech book I've ever run into.

To make matters worse, her criticism is disguised as helpful, comforting advice.

If her claim is at all true, one can only surmise that they spent very little time in conversation.

Within 2 weeks of receiving the toaster, the lever to raise the toast up broke. I called Krups customer service and they were not initially very responsive. They finally agreed to let me bring it to their local service center where I could get a new toaster. When I brought it to the service center, they didn't have any toasters and had to send the broken toaster to Krups and said Krups would send me a new toaster. Two weeks later, I called Krups and the order was messed up and they finally agreed to send the toaster in 7-10 days. After my complaining, they agreed to send it \\"rush\\" in 3-5 days. The hassle of dealing with Krups customer service has made me vow never to buy a Krups product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Uneven Toasting","review":"I purchased this toaster and was initially disappointed to see how large the appliance was. It takes up a lot of room on the countertop and looks like a commercial appliance.Slices of bread come up with very uneven results. The top half of the bread is toasted, the middle and bottom of the bread are not. Despite the fact that muffins are toasted at a toasting level of 7 or 8, the muffins come up hard, but not toasted, a very poor result.The only good option of this appliance is the roll warming on top of the unit but I think the price is extremely high to pay for just a roll warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Toaster","review":"I have had this toaster for 5 months now, and I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. It toasts very unevenly. Whenever I toast something in this toaster, the bottom half of the bread/english muffin/bagel gets toasted, but the top half doesn't.

It's honestly the worst toaster I have ever owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works very well for a while - limited lifetime","review":"We bought this toaster after extensive research. When it arrived, it did live up to its excellent billing - even toasting of bagels, waffles, and of course, bread - for about one-and-a-half years. At this time one side (2 slots) went bad and would not stay pushed down. Within a couple of months, the other side could no longer toast a frozen waffle reliably.

We should not have to remove an item and then flip it upside down in order to get even toasting.I would like to think that overall Krups merchandise is good quality but since this is the first time we had purchased a Krups anything you could not prove anything good about their products by us!Unless something totally proves us wrong we will never buy a Krups kitchen item again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Toaster","review":"I must have received a different toaster than the one other people reviewed.

First neat feature: You can raise the toast HIGH out of the toaster, so even small slices are high enough to take out without reaching in to the slotSecond neat feature: Sturdy guides that make certain what ever you are toasting stays centered.Third neat feature: WIDE slots for even the thickest bagelEverything about this toaster feels right with smooth action on all levers, buttons and switches. It toasts very very evenly and quickly at that. The bagel toast feature works well, toasting the cut face of the bagel and just warming the rest. I have not tried the defrost feature yet.This is a substantial toaster, a little wider than any 4 slice toater we have had before and it has some weight to it. Not HEAVY mind you but it feels well made and not like a disposable item.I think you will like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"so far, so good","review":"Have owned it now for 3 weeks with no problem. My last toaster from a different manufacturer stopped working on one side after 2 weeks. Best part is the lever which raises the hot bread up so you can reach it easier.

The 10 setting on this really toasts dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Man's Toaster","review":"I bought this toaster because it seemed to be the most substantial toaster on the market.

We were at a four-star hotel recently and our breakfast order was taking unusualy long. When we inquired about our order, the waitress complained that they had an extremely slow toaster.

I have owned much cheaper appliances that lasted more than twice as long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else!","review":"Like so many others, I scoured reviews (amazon, consumer reports, etc.) before buying this toaster. I get annoyed every time I look at it. It takes FOREVER to toast, and then only toasts 1/2 of one side. You have to flip the toast and wait AGAIN to finish (1/2) the other side.

Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing purchase","review":"I purchased this toaster and I'm sending it back. I scoured Consumer Reports and this was in the top three. The unit I received (a four slice model) had a faulty control on the left side. The lever in the slot was supposed to have three settings so that you could put something small in the toaster (like a mini bagel) and it would raise it above the housing so you wouldn't have to dig for it. Unfortunately, this nice feature (great on the right, but not on the left) was faulty. Another feature I was looking for was a cord that was retractable, and although this one is, the directions say NEVER to operate the toaster unless the cord is out fully. Also the unit is HUGE and takes up a lot of counter space. I'm really disappointed after spending about 2 hours on research to find the perfect toaster for my needs and it didn't measure up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toaster but huge","review":"I like the toaster and bought it due to the goodreviews.

The slots are nice and wide which are great for leftover frozen belgian waffles. Which comes to another get feature the defrost button. Love it!!! Another great feature, when or item is down you can turn the lever to the right and it will pop your item up farther so you don't ever have to reach into the toaster. The top of the toaster also serves as a warming tray which I love if I just want to warm up some bread a bit. It is very easy to clean, the bottom of both sides of the toaster have trays that pull out and you can wash. The warmer on the top of the toaster also comes off if you want to clean it!LOVE THIS TOASTER, BEST TOASTER EVER MADE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Krupped out after 4 months","review":"I got this toaster as a gift. Several months after using, one of the arms broke. A month later, it started toasting unevenly. Coincidentally, my brother has the same one with the same problems.I chose to send mine in for warranty repair out of state to the closest center. Bad decision. They had it over four weeks before determining no parts were available for it and they have to send a new one. The new one is due to arrive 7-10 BUSINESS days. So that means we'll be without a toaster for six weeks.The sad part is Krups gives these repair centers up to 30 days to make repairs and they use every last minute. On the 30th day, that was when the repair center decided it could not be repaired.I've had $20 toasters from Target last longer than this one.

Especially when it was just raining lightly...I could put stuff under it that I didn't necessesarily want in my tent but wanted to keep dry. As soon as the rain started coming down a little harder (moderate, really) the tent started leaking all over...not something I could patch, just wasn't pulled tight enough.

The rain shield did, basically, nothing to keep the rain out. Luckily, the rain did not last long, so we were able to dry everything and remain in the tent for the night. If the rain had continued throughout the night, however, we would have been completely soaked.

The front 'shade' is a nice feature; makes your tent look nice - it's too short and small area for adults to sit under.The one complaint is the inability to close the 'windows' on the rainfly from inside.

There are lots of sample configurations for the most common remote access configuration scenarios. He \\"holds your hand\\" as you are walked through these, including the 'show' and 'debug' commands you need when things aren't going well.He notes in the Introduction, that the book is intended more as a practical reference to use in real-life than as an exhaustive BCRAN test preparation guide, which I think is a pretty accurate assessment.

I bought the cd IMPERFECTA/IMPERFECT and I was totally in love with it. From start to finish. Then I found out she would be re-releasing it again with a new name \\"Imperfect/Imperfecta\\" and a new cover and a bonus dvd and so I thought that it would probably bring bonus songs but no to my surprise I find out that \\"TANTO\\" and \\"HEY YA!\\" have been taken out! I love her music but I think that the price is so not worth it since 2 songs are missing. The dvd is good, her videos are simple yet intriguing and the photo gallery is the same pictures that the booklet has. Overall she is a great artist at only 16 and writes her own lyrics and kicks ass performing live but the re-release sould've been better. Piscis and Tanto are my favorite songs from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"too tight","review":"the leggings were totally different than I thought it would be.

Red has had a very interesting life but the book would have been even better if he would have told us more details and stories(good and bad)to his deals and issues. Red is forever a car salesman who lives for the adrealine rush of a deal and bores very quickly with the small details(don't we all?), just as he has done in this book. He should have let Gary Woods help him by filling in some of the intricies and details just as he does in his deals. Red seems to love to deal and buy companies, then turn them over to a manager(coach) to either ride the company to success or hang himself with the rope Red gave him. He makes sure to give you enough rope to hang yourself when your success doesn't come quick enough for him. I would love to meet the man!

The author tackles a subject that few in the church are willing to tackle... how to handle confrontation. The author has a slow start of developing her point, but after Chapter 1 her point becomes clearer and she provides biblical points about dealing with people in relationships when there is a confrontation. In addition to how to maintain confidentiality and searching ones on motives during such times.

And what if he were a fundamentalist Christian? And what if he played music by The Hooters? I think it would be a little something like this. I thought from the name that this would be a collection of drinking songs. After listening to it, I could have used a stiff drink or ten. Not to focus on the negative, but the best part of this album is its short length. The songs have monotone melodies, and the vocalists can't even stay on pitch for a measure! At least the instrument is on key. I say instrument, since this is pretty obviously a rather expensive keyboard playing everything. This is quite frankly the worst CD I've ever listened to. Why? Well, aside from the vocal nightmare I've already illustrated above, the lyrics are preachy and trite, and the backing instrumentation is rigidly put together, like listening to a machine. I could go on and on, but I'm trying not to be spiteful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bidu Sayao at La Bohème, an unique Performance","review":"Wonderful and rare Bidu Sayao voice's register in her hay days. She is the first Brazilian prima donna to bring the Metropolitan under the spell of her talent. His leading man Richard Tucker utilizes sort of mechanically his strong timbre. Saving the voice in the high peak notes he does not reach the drama tone required in well known Arias as \\"Che Gelida Manina\\". Bidu's best performance would be attained in the 1951 Season in the same Opera House. By her side, Giusepe Di Stefano, though then just a beginner, gives all the vigor of his voice and gets closer to the drama colors of the scenes intended by the author Pucccini"},{"rating":"2","title":"great poetry","review":"This is a budget title and it sounds great.

It uses my scrap material but the intricate patterns make every project look rich! My 16 year old daughter found the daffofil pocket and has made at least 5 in the last week! Although some of the more difficult patterns seem to leave out a step, the directions are clear, easy to read and easy to follow. The patterns in the back are easy to copy and use and I plan to use this book to make small, quick gifts for my friends' birthdays! I was also interested in the Japanese culture and there is great introductory information on the art of Omiyage in Japan, as well as information on holidays and some folktales.

While the patterns are fairly simple. she leaves out important hints that make recreating her projects difficult if you aren't paying attention. Pay close attention to the weight and type of fabric that she uses but does not mention in her directions.

The exercises were motivating. Fun enough to still be at them at 3am after the middle-of-the night feeding. Sure, maybe not everything was documented perfectly, but that's the norm you're going to have to get used to become a developer.

The movie's about a kid who wants to be a cop when he grows up like his father (who died before the movie started) and so he has all of his father's old cop equipment and stuff and knows how to use it. He's always on the lookout in his town for trouble that might happen and when there are robbers reported in town, he trys to find a way to get them caught but he gets into trouble along the way!

Carol Gurney puts the information you need to know, in the order that makes the most sense. I have listen to other's ideas on the subject without success, but she reached me. I always had a difficult time meditating, or deliberately calming my mind down. She brought to light that I am relaxing my mind when I do needlework - my form of meditation, something I enjoy.

However, it seems that they have lost a bit of their street punk edge. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. They've matured as musicians and writers and this new album reflects that. New drummer, Chip Hanna (of US Bombs) brings a solid punk rhythm to all the songs, which is a nice compliment to Heiko's bass playing. He's also talked the boys into making the songs more anthemic. Now, you can sing along with the cd with 10 of your drunkest friends.

Besides the Brandenburg Concertos, Bach wrote many concertos, cantatas, and sinfonias for orchestra. This disc, which offers but a sampling of Bach's orchestral works, includes both ADD/DDD recordings. True, as with other ADD recordings, I can hear the background hiss (not unusual with older rocordings) on certain pieces. Fortunately, this noise is not distracting (just slightly noticeable), and in no way detracts from the performance of these pieces. Overall, a fine recording that speaks to the greatness of Bach. After listening to this disc, I hope you will be inspired to seek out other recordings of orchestral works by Bach (many of which are also at bargain prices)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grown-ups encouraged to try the real thing","review":"OK: I admit it. I own Wagner orchestral recordings. I don't have the courage to face up to 140 hours of screeching to get the odd beautiful moment.

But there are folks out there that have never HEARD a real Bach Cantata, even if they are familiar with some of the extraordinary meodies that Bach spun out. They are cheating themselves. Maybe 18th Century Luthern pietism is hard to find now. However, religion has generated splendid art through the ages and Bach's cantatas are about at the top of an extraordinary category of human creation. Do yourself a favor: look up any cantata on this present collection and get a real live copy of it - choir, solists and all.

Eva Cassidy was truly blessed with a voice that sends you with every note, with a range that is limitless (jazz, blues, rock, gospel....). Every song that she sang she made her own. I recommend ANY or Eva's CD's to EVERYONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spitfire Grill","review":"This was basically a movie soundtrack, not the lyrical music from the musical. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks!","review":"Thanks for a perfect order. Came late because it was damaged by the post office. Thanks for notifying me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This was a great product and I can't wait for my husband to open it for Christmas. I framed it myself in a poster frame and it looks so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kramer","review":"If you're a fan of Seinfeld or just Kramer, this would be an excellent addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong poster","review":"They sent me a Kramer poster but not this one. It was the correct size, they just sent me the one without the quote along the bottom, which was the main reason for me buying that one in the first place. I'm making a long trip home this weekend for father's day and since this is a father's day gift, there's no time to get a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice poster","review":"Love The Kramer!!! Came in good packaging and looks nice on my wall at work. I would reccomed this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ex-O-Lente!","review":"Poster came as described and arrived within time-frame mentioned. No creases or tears, a quality reproduction of this great moment in TV history."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged before arrival","review":"Delivery was prompt, poster arrived in a mailing tube at my front door.When I pulled out the rolled up poster it was bent right down the middle.They might as well have flattened it and mailed in in an envelope."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this was Jamie Pittle, I'd buy it.","review":"Look, this poster is pretty cool, but if it were a poster of Jamie Pittle it would be even better. Just saying..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting waiting waiting","review":"I Would like to review this item but it hasn't been delivered! Was told it would arrive around the 17th Sept now 8th October............."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received","review":"Ordered because it was on sale for a great price and my husband had requested it once to add to his poster collection in his hangout in the barn========never received. Had our postman look through our small area post office===just in case, but not here. I paid more postage/handling on it than I did for the poster, but it is the idea that it just vanished that is aggravating. Have ordered a few other posters that came from this company in the past and no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kramer poster","review":"Great print at a great price. I received this poster in about 3 days I have it in my living room and I can't help but look at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cotton hits a home run","review":"Though not a huge fan of westerns, I've been getting into them lately. Border dogs is a great tale of gunslinging action you will find hard to put down.You feel as if you're really there, out there in the desert watching your own back. The descriptions are excellent, the plot is unpredictable and original, and the characters are great.I'm a fan of this book, and would recommend it for western fans, or just action fans in general. I'll be searching for other Ralph Cotton books now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra-ordinary condition and extremely fast shipping","review":"This was a crucial book for me to receive in any condition, but the seller furnished an as-good-as-new copy, shipped it very securely in a sturdy carton with air-bubble protection. I would have been satisfied with anything, but this was a stunning surprise. The book was purchased to secure a photo of the first GE electric locomotive - it is so hard to find I was willing to accept any condition, but this is perfect! A million thank-yous for the relief and satisfaction that you have provided me. George Higgins"},{"rating":"1","title":"1T Bridal Veil","review":"I was soooo unhappy with my purchase of this veil. It does look as it appears in the picture. The seller smokes and I could not get the smell of smoke out of this veil...I tried for 3 months. I had to buy a new veil. This seller can be trusted to give accurate photos and descriptions but beware of any material items you purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Manual!","review":"This is a great manual, with tips and techniques you would think you only can get as a fly on the wall of the world's best trick and circus trainers. Fabulous insight. This manual is great on it's own, but is absolutely the best as a companion to Allen's DVDs. Fundamentals I is a great place to start:Trick Horse Training Fundamentals I"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really looked forward to this book and took it with me on my tour of mayan sites in the Yucatan. However, I found that this book offered very little more than was available on the posted signage at the sites. Also, many of the maps are inadequate. I often found myself going to my Lonely Planet guide (Belize, Guatemala & Yucatan) for more detailed maps and decriptions of archeological sites.Although the author presents the sites in a \\"tour\\" format, in practice it is hard to follow, and since the descriptions lack photos, it's very difficult to compare what you're seeing with what's written in the book. Although there are photos of the sites, but not of the specific items that the author is describing."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUT OF DATE","review":"As I live in Mexico and have visited at least 50% of the sites in this book in the last few years, I can personally testify that most if not all of tour information is woefully out of date. It needs to be updated to be useful in any meaningful way. Much has changed since the 2001 printing. At this point, it is little more than a general outline for the archaeologically minded tourist but should not be relied on for accurate details as to fees, hours, directions, site facilities, etc. In addition, I have found the descriptions are little more than a restatement of the signage available at the sites. The hours suggested for visiting each site are entirely subjective. I have spent days at sites he says can be done in a few hours and stayed a few hours at sites he recommends for a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out-dated now, but still excellent","review":"The book is a little bit out-dated today, as Mexicans continually dig and \\"update\\" their sites, but it's still very informative regarding the historical and archeological record about each site covered, which I know from the first hand, as I've visited some of them with the book in the hand. The only minus would be not including some also important sites of which I was aware, but which I haven't seen, so I personally wasn't at any loss here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I keep coming back...","review":"I own this book and have for years! Anytime I find myself looking for something to read, I always fall back on this old favorite. I like Anna and Dusty. There great characters. If you don't own it or have never read it, you are seriously missing out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about hokey!","review":"I have read a lot of romance novels, and I especially like ones with a Western flair. However, this is the corniest one I've read in a long time! I mean, Dusty Dare? Hired hands named Hunky, Ben, and Flint? I'm sorry, but I had a hard time getting past the stereotypes that filled this book. Yes, it was a cute story, if you think all ranches are dude ranches. If you've had any experience with a real ranch, you'll have a hard time liking this book. It doesn't make me excited about reading another of Ms. Roszel's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"No wonder this item was ony $6, it is so boring and poor quality, my son didn't even watch 1 minute of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stand alone.","review":"Unfortunately, for this book to be useful, you have to own multiple other volumes of the UCV series. In fact, there are photos, as promised, but they are not identified anywhere in this book. Instead, it gives you the page numbers to look up in the other books for the answers. A much better alternative, although it is slightly more expensive: Color Atlas and Text of Clinical Medicine by Charles Forbes, William Jackson, which has more pictures, interesting text, and most importantly, is a great reference that can and does stand alone. I think the Forbes and Jackson book is useful for any step of the USMLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great live performance footage","review":"I was fortunate to see Rory Gallagher perform live twice and talk to him briefly. What an amazing talent and soulful, humble guy. I have read biographies and watched several concert videos. \\"Ghost Blues\\" is a wonderful collection of live performance footage ... some of which I have never seen before. The interviews are interesting and give a perspective of Rory -- the person, the musician -- as well as how he fit in with the tremendous changes taking place in the music world, Ireland, and popular culture. For fellow guitarists, the Beat Club sessions are very clearly filmed \\"live studio\\" performances where you can really see the fundamentals of Rory's technique. Overall, there are many moments in this collection that capture the sheer energy and excitement that Rory generated in his live performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zone Blues","review":"It never ceases to amaze me that British artists DVDs are available Zone 1 and BluRay Region \\"A\\" but are not available Zone 2 or Region B - it's like inviting someone to produce bootlegs!! Why do we even have to put up with \\"regions\\" at all? It's one click to make a disc zone free :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set!","review":"I suppose I'm quibbling here,I'm thankful for anything about Rory that comes out,but the documentary could have been a lot better.It's not \\"bad\\" per se, but fewer talking heads & more of Rory himself would have improved things.The Beat Club disc makes it all worth while!Wonderful & essential stuff, despite the occasionally annoying \\"psychedelic\\" camera work.I was lucky enough to see Rory 5 or 6 times, they are the musical high points of my life.I've seen them all & NOBODY is or was a better or more exciting musician than Rory in his prime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Fantastic Musician .","review":"This is an awesome DVD of a great dedicated Bluesman.Just buy it and enjoy, you will not regret it.......need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bartok has met his match...","review":"Danielpour's Concerto for Orchestra is vibrant, refreshing, and musically intriguing. Even the most staunch critic cannot help but feel moved and invigorated by the driving rhythms, the playfully loquacious instrumental interactions, the heartfelt pathos, and the furious excitement displayed in all four movements of this phenomenal work.Experience the Danielpour Concerto for Orchestra. It is an experience you will not forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"This book started off very slow, which made this book very boring.This book doesn't hold a candle to her books Princess and the sequel,if I wouldnt have spilled juice on the book I would have returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can get in too deep, and can't turn back","review":"There's No Turning Back is about Kenya and Tony...Kenya is the good girl that wants to please her man and make him happy. She is ready to take their relationship to the next level and get married. Tony is a player that loves Kenya, but isn't ready to burn up his black book. He takes Kenya for granted and does just enough to keep her happy. While most around Kenya wonders why she can't see what's going on behind her back, Kenya smiles bright and knows Tony is her man and that's that.There's No Turning Back is a story about relationships everyone can relate to. We've all been high in love, on the brink of insanity, fighting to work it out and ready to throw in the towel. This couple takes you on an emotional ride that you can't get off until you know the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great decor item!","review":"I place this in my student apartment living room when having guests and they don't know what to think.

In an emergency you want the radio to work, this did not work out of the box. It did not come with an AC charger and it does not charge in 2 days of Hawaiian sun! I would have just bought other batteries BUT the proprietary battery is locked in the case. So even if it worked out of the box, if the battery failed during an emergency you cannot replace the batteries. That does not really sound like a good design for an emergency situation!!
