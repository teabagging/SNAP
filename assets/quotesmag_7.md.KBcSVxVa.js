Mine lasted exactly 95 days before it started to have problems. Won't turn off, set top buttons don't work, unable to access program guide menu, skips channels, etc. It is still useable, but it has lost many of the capabilities it had when it was working properly. This has happened to a couple of people I know. RCA was not alot of help. After speaking with them, I figure it is probably cheaper, and less of a hassle to buy a new receiver than return this one for repairs. I will be looking at Hughes or Sony for replacement.In terms of the satellite picture, it is very good. In my area, it is definitely cheaper than cable.

Beware when you purchase this \\"remastered\\" version because the sound quality is so low, that you almost have to cut your CD player up to full volume to hear some of the tracks (hence the idea of remastering is to give you better sound quality not worse). I find the bonus material to be acceptable, however, and the additional remixes are fine as well (if you are a fan). Just don't understand who in the quality control department, (or why even Lionel himself) let this one fly, because volume wise it is absolutely terrible. I am curious if the single disc remastered version is any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not super;More like kryptonite.","review":"I have been a fan of Peobo Bryson music since his first album onCapital records in 1977.

And the usually terrific slashing, sloppy guitar work of Bob Petric is mostly wankery here (ironic wankery, but wankery nonetheless). Only things really listenable are \\"Half Off,\\" a great little ballad Ron's been doing solo for a while, and \\"When the Entertainment Ends,\\" a smart potshot across the multimedia bow (\\"When the entertainment ends/That's when the fun begins\\"). Don't wanna bash a great band for a bad disc, though--their earlier effort, \\"Bait and Switch,\\" is among the best releases of the '90s. Yeah, by anyone.

I don't really have a problem with nudity or sex depictions per se, but he also shows Seetha on Ravana's thigh, naked, gods having sex with animals and other strange stuff. But the key thing is that his family members are shown fully clothed, as is Muhammad's (the prophet's) wife. He probably knows that if he dared to show Amina or whoever naked, there would be an immediate fatwa on him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In poor taste","review":"As other reviewers have noted, had anyone done the same, depicting the Prophet Muhammed (Peaces be upon Him) in copulation with anyone, there would be hell to pay.Daniel Herwitz should know better, given his supposedbackground on the Indian diaspora. I would question the judgement of anyone who could call such pornography 'art'.There are some very sickening and highly inappropriate drawings. It is important to note that this is the same MF Husain who openly declared that he has fantasized about the various Hindu deities.However, writing bad reviews will not stop or remove it from the marketplace.There are online petitions and efforts within India to get it banned. If you wish to have it removed from the face of the earth, it is best to start there.

Then about 2:30am one morning, the TV mysteriously turned on and started channel surfing. Of course, i get up and peep around the corner thinking some crazed person has entered my home. Well, that wasnt the case so i place my hand over the remote eye thinking someone had a heck of a strong remote or just playing a trick.

I started having problems with it within the first 90 days of purchasing it. It was under warranty, so it was repaired at no cost to me. (By the way, there's no such thing in-home repair. That just means they cart the TV to the shop for repair instead of you carrying it yourself!)But the worst of it is that within a year, (apparently) the same problem is back again. At least it looks the same, BUT now the warranty has expired! Needless to say, this is not a good record!I had a Zenith that was almost 20 years old and a Magnavox that is 13 years old. Neither have ever had to be repaired. But this RCA needs repair twice in less than 1 1/2 years!

McQuarrie is at best 'cute', and certainly not worth more than $40.I personally think the ESQC Summer School course books are the best thing available for learning quantum chemistry.

This book so disappointed me and angered me that I threw it away. The book is written by the men about their wives. It appeared to rely heavily on what I think is the 'stereotype' of a pastor's wife. I would have preferred to read items written more realistically about their struggles, lessons learned, how they handled criticism and expectations from the church community, experiences raising preacher's kids, etc. Instead it reads like rosy depictions of what a preacher's wife should be. My husband read this book with me and was dissapointed with it as well. On the up-note: these pastors speak lovingly of their wives and commitment to marriage and towards the end of the book there were a few pages with good advise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"To watch TV sometimes you do need time.

My table arrived damaged and OK, anybody can have that happen but there was much more wrong with this particular table than just flaws in the covering. The covering was stretched so tightly over the frame that tears were bound to occur with minimal client use. The padding was thin and not protecting the covering from the frame at all. The face cradle was practically impossible to insert into the ports and once in, it was uneven and you couldn't get it out without crawling under the table and hitting the insertion bars with a hammer to knock it back out again. My confidence was totally gone in this table when my husband, a man of average weight for his height, laid on the table and it creaked and shifted. No way would I ask a heavier client to lay on this table or even attempt deep tissue work. This table was packed up to return the same day I received it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I purchased the table for home use. Delivery was very quick. The table assembles easily.

I can forgive a reviewer not having the same opinion as myself but at least it should be an educated opinion. Time after time the facts of the movies are incorrect, indicating they were not watched or only scanned. Also, the lack of a depth of understanding of cinema history, the lack of knowledge of a director's art and repertoire, etc. is unforgiveable. A good example is Bertolucci's The Spider's Strategem where the facts of the movie are given incorrectly. This guide is a good reference to the existence of a video, for lists of the actors and their movies, lists of directors and their movies, etc., but its reviews are sketchy, ill informed, and unsophisticated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for group or public use","review":"Not for group or public use.Our set is set up in our front lobby, and we have jokers who come by, turn on the set, play with the controls until they are in the menu, and then we have to call in a repair technician to get the set back into factory settings.The setup for this TV is not user friendly, P52921, and the menus are hard to read, easy to get lost in, and a pain to return to use.Next is obtaining the user manual from the RCA Website.

It helped show them how other families have routines, how moms work, how families interact, and through it all, how she loves him even with all the activity. Given the book's connection to a superstar, it was much more humble than I imagined and the illustrations were very cute. I would definitely recommend it for boys, and highly consider it for girls.

Use primarily my small laptop to do my taxes while on the road and transfer tax files to my desktop computer to work on larger screen & keyboard when I get home.You can only get full functionality on ONE computer. On my desktop it won't allow me to view whole forms or print or efile. Calls to their tech support people have been met with complete arrogance and indifference.Honest users are being unfairly harassed in their attempts to thwart a few dishonest ones.Even Microsoft allows users to activate Office XP on TWO computers realizing that many people use laptops on the road and switch to their desktops when they get home.I have now also purchased TaxCut and will use it until Intuit starts showing a little more customer appreciation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Turbo Tax has added a terrible copy protection scheme.- If you need to reinstall or move to a new computer, you will likely need to call TurboTax to reactivate. Do you want to take a chance of that happening the day you want to file your taxes?- The C-dilla is an intrusive and potentailly toublesome peice of code.

This year I was unpleasantly surprised by their Activation process, which ended up with my having to call TurboTax tech support in order to get it working. Worse was in store. I upgraded to a new hard drive after the activation, only to find that TurboTax would no longer start up at all. Nor could I re-activate it. And, of course, this problem reared its ugly head on Sunday when tech support isn't available.Doing research using Google lead to the fact that a ... program (Safecast), was installed on my PC by TurboTax, one that is capable of collecting and pushing information over the internet. Intuit, naturally, says they only use Safecast to protect their copyright. That certainly made me feel much better.Needless to say, I will not be using TurboTax next year. While I appreciate their right to protect their software from piracy, I prefer to exercise my right to purchase from a company that does not put [C-Dilla] on my computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointing","review":"I purchased this recording with great enthusiasm.

I have had no delay problems due to inactivity or waking the computer from sleep mode.

The receiver attaches to the back of the mouse (which is average -- most new mice have the USB receiver slide into a compartment within the mouse itself). The battery life is good and the cherry red color is quite unique. However, the mouse itself has stopped working after 2 years later (bought in late December of 2006).Logitech has personally stopped manufacturing this mouse. I called Logitech, got a customer service rep right away, and after some testing with the rep, she just got my information to send a new mouse (the next model closest to the V200 is the V220). It was a really easy process and surprised as well since I heard reports that Logitech's customer service was quite horrible. But with the economy these days, everyone is boosting their service to retain customers.Decent mouse but failed to work suddenly after 2 years. Logitech service was outstanding.Get the V220 or higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Design for Clipping Receiver onto Mouse","review":"Pros: Very smooth and accurate mouse. Good, quality feel. As accurate as a corded mouse. Simple to use and install--just plug the little receiver into your computer's USB port and Windows XP immediately recognizes it--and your clicking away.Cons: Very poor design for clipping the receiver to the mouse. The receiver clips onto the bottom of the mouse by means of a small plastic button. This action is what turns off the mouse's power to save the battery. The problem is that the plastic button is flimsy and doesn't inspire any confidence that it would stay on if jostled during travel. And if the receiver happens to pop off the mouse, the mouse's power turns on. Then when you need your mouse the next time, it's dead. Also, if the little receiver pops off it could be lost--then you've really got a problem. I wish I would have bought a mouse with a more secure way of stashing the receiver and a more secure way of turning it on and off."},{"rating":"1","title":"never buy used idems from amazon","review":"I bought this used logitech wireless mouse V200 from Amazon a month ago.

I got tired of having to reset it after about 5 times. I will go out and purchase another mouse that I won't have to reset every time I turn around.

The first was a silver macally Bluetooth model. It functioned OK except for battery life. A few days at best.The V200 on the other hand seems more like the energizer bunny, it just keeps going. Months.I might subtract a half star due to its two part functionality.The mouse itself holds the batteries of course, but there is a tinyl USB module that unsnaps from the bottom of the mouse and plugs into the laptop. (this would also work the same way on a desktop if you don't like dragging the cord around)I know that the V200 communicates on a different frequency than my MacBook Pro's built in Bluetooth but it seems just a bit wastefull, having to add yet another process to the mix.Bottom line, highly reccommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech V200 Cordless Mouse","review":"Comfortable ergonomics, clean/clever design, smooth operation, accurate movement.

Mouse is not very compact, almost the same size as a standard desktop mouse but I like that because it fits my hand.

Battery life is great. it's small, but form factor is great. very responsive, best notebook mouse i've used.Now, the reason I gave it 4 stars. Mainly because I believe this is a design flaw. The receiver snaps into the bottom of the mouse, shutting the mouse off and making it easy for travel. That's terrific. However, there's no other way to turn this mouse off. Not an issue if you're only using it to travel, however If you sit down for hours at a time, this may not be the mouse for you. There are times where I leave where I'm sitting, and want to turn the mouse off. The old logitech notebook mice had a switch on the bottom of the mouse to turn it off. So if you left where you were sitting, you could conserve battery life rather easily. There's no such feature on this, and removing the receiver from your USB is a less than optimal solution.Other than that, great mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Rocket","review":"If you want a great little precise mouse, this is the way to go.

Upon investigating what might be the cause I realized that there is no setting to set what position you hold the mouse. If you hold the mouse at a 45 degree angle and move left to right then the cursor moves diagonally instead of left to right. Most basic mice drivers have the ability to adjust this. Second... the mouse is spastic! I have adjusted and adjusted and there is just no decent speed on the mouse. So basically you have two speeds... spastic or slow. Which may also be contributing to my newly self-diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome.I did search on Logitech for a different driver for the mouse and was unable to find one, which then lead me here to shop for a new mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst mouse I have ever had and I had about 25 bad, bad","review":"This mouse does not work unless you have a lot of time.

Even my wife can now use the Roku HD1000.* Component Video Output of upto 1080i (this is a plus for me as I have an HDTV, although this may not be an important feature to you if you do not have HDTV) -- finally some justice done to my digital photos. Actually, the UI is more readable as well because of the higher resolution.* Very good UI, although some some features (better playlist navigation, auto-playlists or sort by artist/album/genre etc) are desperately needed.* Open platform, SDK is freely available. Opens door for 3rd-party developers* No special server software needed, other than SMB file sharing.* The company engineers (including the CEO) seems to be listening to the customers and coming up with useful feature updates.* The only negative feature is its price. At $500, it seems a bit too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Joe's Pass on this one","review":"I'm relatively tech savy and this item requires very little technical capability to use and setup. But, the remote responsiveness is slow. On the other hand, the picture quality is fantastic. The biggest problem for me is the rudimentary software. While the other players lack HD they have much, and I mean much more robust interfaces that are mostly stable. The roku is slow to respond, only offers one way to look at mp3's. Video capability is barely there. Photos are ok but again the slideshow capabilities are minimal. The functional capability is so low on the scale that this item isn't even on the radar screen. Reviews that say otherwise are being very generous. If you need HD this may be your only choice, but seriously consider that need.Addendum: the software may have been updated since I tried this product in May."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for the bleeding edge adopter","review":"The Photobridge is a nice product if you are looking for a bridge device between your PC and your HDTV. The product is of the most use with the 2.x \\"beta\\" version of the software and a couple of third party applications called Mplay and SlimRoku. It takes a healthy understanding of computers to get this device working, and with the above software and a 100Mb network connection there is little this device wont do.

For starters, the company openly states their goal as being to use their consumer electronics products as simple proof-of-concept products to highlight what the hardware and softare can do. They're not their to provide end-solutions - they're an OEM manufacturerer. That justifies the beta software, which I installed and ended up frying my machine, so it's going back tomorrow. Also keep in mind that it's a shell with bare-bones functionality, and you're expected to downlaod and run a thrird party app to actually mke it run, There are 2 or 3 available, but that's a lot less palatable than having the functiomality built it.Good Luck!'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Purchased the HD1000 for audio streaming and photograph display. The high definition digital display of photographs is great. Easy to set up and use. The audio capability is much more limited and not at all easy to use. I believe Roku is somewhat misleading in their claims about the audio capability of this unit. Many popular formats are not supported although Roku suggests using third part software. This is very limited and I am not a fan of having to use third part software to upgrade a product to meet its marketing claims. If audio is important to you, look elsewhere.

Unfortunately, I found that it didn't live up to it's premise of modest nursing coverage. It did not stay in place well, and needed to be constantly tugged back in to position to keep my cleavage covered. Once I managed that, my sides and back would be exposed. I was uncomfortable using it even at home around our older children - I certainly wouldn't take it out in public. I finally found what I needed with a well constructed nursing tank.Nursing Tank By Undercover Mama (Medium, Dark Brown)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it","review":"I tried it out once and didn't like it. I was not able to see my baby to help her latch on despite the large neck opening. And the opening was too large to the point that in some positions I would've felt too exposed if around anyone else. I decided the ribbed neck covers are much better for me. However, if you've somehow mastered the nursing covers without the ribbed neck, then this might be okay.

I have used a towel, it falls down all the time and it's not practical in public since the towel needs to be adjusted all the time. The over-the-shoulder nursing cover is good but it also needs to be moved so it covers the right places. after many researches, I came across the nursing shawl, it is so easy to use and I can see what the baby is doing. I liked the fact there are so many uses for a product. I have used to cover the car seat and I used to nurse in public all the time now. While I don't mind to use anything to nurse in public, I do have to say this nursing shawl makes nursing in public stylish and discrete. I ordered 2, one in grand sand and one in true blue. Love this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufficient coverage for breastfeeding","review":"While the fabric is nice and soft, and the shawl is attractive overall, this product fails miserably in its fundamental task: providing coverage for public breastfeeding. Although it gives you adequate fabric in the front, the shawl is so short on the sides that it exposes the bare skin of your abdomen when you lift your shirt from the waist up to breastfeed. I suppose it would work well with specially-designed breastfeeding blouses which open from the shoulder downwards, but you definitely cannot use it with regular shirts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cute, but really not functional","review":"After receiving this cover from my registry, it looked very chic and easy to use. Once I started using it, however, I realized that without the built-in hoop that many of the other covers have, it is very difficult to see down while your baby is trying to latch on. Also the hole for your head is way too big - so most of my time was spent trying to keep myself covered while I stummbled with my baby underneath the cover all the while, not being able to see what was going on to get the baby in the right position."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ended up getting another one","review":"Couldn't write the review until the baby was here :) And now that I am breastfeeding, this shawl is pretty annoying. I agree with one of the reviewers here. The hole is too big so I struggled with trying to cover myself. at the same time, I can't see my baby. The best I can do is what you see in the picture, but I you can't see my baby's eyes. and at that exact position, I'm not even sure I'm decent in front of everyone. so I ended up buying another. I got the bebe-au-lait one and am going to give that a try.i liked this one b/c of it's multi function use. but if the main function I need it for is not working, what's the point? maybe it'll fit better when the baby is older. my baby is 6 weeks (exactly how long it look me to breastfeed). I liked how discreet this looks too..poncho vs an apron look but by the time you tell everyone you're breastfeeding, they will be expecting your apron look anyway--made popular by The Office, I think :)Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, my wife loves it.","review":"Fast delivery, product exactly as described.

The neck opening is too big and so hangs down too close to the breast. As other reviews said, the sides are also too short to provide good coverage.

This book can be recommended for fun, but not to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived plot, inexperienced author","review":"This is the third book by this author that I've read (bought all at the same time or I wouldn't have repeated my mistake). I kept hoping her writing would improve, but alas--far too many exaggerated, flowery similes and metaphors that jerk the reader away from the wandering plot. \\"Pat\\" solutions to circumstances, i.e., a character just happens to have been given a gun by her father when the need for one arises. Then said character cannot decide if she trusts her husband or not--she does, she doesn't, she listens to others and changes her mind yet again . . . I spent way too much time rolling my eyes at absurd comments during supposed crises and wondering just how much longer it would take to finish this book and be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatness from Previn","review":"Andre Previn has given us many fine recordings, but this Dvorak 7 is one of his best. The sound from this Telarc disc is big, bold and lush, though the woodwinds could be a touch more forward at times. The LA Phil sounds gorgeous and plays its heart out for Previn, and he paces the work very well. The first two movements are both beautiful and powerful with impressive climaxes. Even though this is the most Brahmsian of Dvorak symphonies it has plenty of Czech soul. There's plenty of foot stomping in the last two movements. The horns are splendid and the strings are refined and smooth. This is as good as Szell but with better sound and a bit more warmth. I like this much more than Colin Davis. Get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent rendition","review":"Los Angeles Phil does a remarkable job with this old war horse.

This book was tossed together to make a fast buck without any reguard to the game player. Just because we like to play video games,does not make us stupid. This book is insult, and a disgraceful ploy to remove some extra cash from game players pockets. There other guides I have found to be very helpful. This one should be recalled like an 1972 Ford Pinto, before it does some real damage. It does not show or even speak of the 6th Lic. Skull and cross bones is my rating.

Its features were adequate but not intuitive. After 4 months of minimal use as a second-room receiver the unit stopped receiving 2/3 of all channels. Tech support offered very little information, aside from the fact that the warranty expired after 3 months, and would cost [$$$] plus shipping to repair - we paid [$$$] as a new unit. I would look elsewhere for this price range. You are likely to find better support away from RCA."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW MOTION","review":"I made the mistake of upgrading to this model. There is a \\"lag\\" time of 1-2 seconds between the time you push a button on the remote or on the unit itself to when you get a response on the screen. I have been with Directv since they started service and this is my 4th upgrade and I have never come acrosss such a slow receiver. I called RCA Tech Support and after 3 different techs, I was told that the delay response is normal because of the Dolby Digital feature(?). I don't really buy that but there's nothing I can do because RCA said my unit is fine and there is no repair for the problem. You won't believe how irritating this problem is until you actually have to use the receiver every day. You overshoot everything on the menu because you think the remote signal didn't get through because of the non-response and you push the button again and then you get the response and you have gone too far. Amazing that they can actually sell a unit like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisted scripture","review":"It is very scary how the author subtly twists scripture to push her diet plan and capatolize on her business in Jesus' name. She has made millions and cheated people out of their money. Families have been torn apart due to her dangerous cult and one child even died. It looks good on the outside but it is not pretty when you dig deeper. I don't want others to have to go through what I and others have had to go through so take my word for it and stand clear of this woman and her products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwen is a false prophettess!","review":"For someone who claims to be a \\"prophettess of God\\" most of the things she says don't line up with the true Word of God. The scarriest of all cults are the ones that take the Truth and twist it just slightly. On the surface her teachings seem good and well intentioned, but if you look a little deeper you'll see that her teachings are straight from the pits of Hell. She takes verses out of context and adds a TON of her own commentary to make them seem Biblically sound, but they aren't. In my own church we had a family leave our church to join Gwen's cult Remnant Fellowship. Be warned of the false \\"Christian\\" teachings in this book. Stay Away!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Fantasy Series","review":"Mr. Brust is a very fine storyteller. His plot construction techniques and style are sharp, witty, intelligent and engaging. His characters are believable not only because they are flawed, but also because their lives are not composed of epic quests, but of real lives. Whether or not Mr. Brust is aware of it or not, he has also done something very unique in the fantasy field. He has utilized American influence as much as European taking elements of organized crime drama and detective stories in a world of very strange creatures and even stranger people. I've read seven of the Vlad Taltos books and have not read a single one that I did not enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth picking up","review":"I liked this book. It was well written over all with wonderful dialogue and intersting characters. The main character, Vlad, lives up to his bad-ass name, he's a sort of Mob boss assassin (of course) who seems to get mixed up with some odd characters. Followed by a short trip into death, some blood, a few twists a couple turns and he's back to being his bad-ass mob-boss self. I recommend all of Steve Brust's books, Vlad is an enticing character and draws you along. I wanted to hate him, but found it very, very difficult to do so. A must read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good bood from Steven Brust.","review":"The second book in a trilogy of the collections of the stories of Vlad Taltos, this book is just as good as the first. Though it only contains 2 books instead of the 3 of the previous one, the writing has improved and it provides both good back story for Vlad Taltos and picks up where the last book left off. Again I find it annoying that the books couldn't be published in chronological order, but even so, it is still a very good book. The stories are as interesting as always and the characters are even better developed than they were before. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or mystery books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was very helpful for adventure racing. The book was practically brand new and the product came very fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in a Poor Dusty World","review":"A beautiful, spare story that illuminates life in a very poor culture. It's not often that we get to see, from street level, an exotic world that hasn't been scrubbed clean and fancified for the mindless tourist. I suspect the impact of the story is due as much to Bowles's translation as the storyteller himself. It was a little disappointing to learn that the author, Driss Ben Hamed Charhadi, later moved to the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get more for the buck","review":"I wanted a 25 + inch LCD TV on tight budget and this was the obvious choice.

Her daughter captures it all, the Hollywood of the 30's, the people, lovers and, yes, the sad moments. The truth and adventure are so readable. The pages just fly by! This book was written while Marlene was alive -- she approved her daughter writing it! I can see why -- the truth always illuminates. Bravo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and disturbing","review":"How sad! I wanted to learn about Marlene Dietrich's life and this is the first biography I've read, but it will not be the last. I felt sorry for the author (her daughter), but that changed. Being confused and unhappy as a child is one thing, to stab your mother in the back after she is dead is quite another, especially as it is so obvious that Dietrich trusted her daughter. Also, I noticed a mistake about Yul Brynner (he had a Swiss passport, but was born in Russia to a wealthy family).There were some interesting stories and information that only a family member would know, but I can't recommend the book, unless the reader realizes that an ugly reading experience awaits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - What a shame of how to remember one's Mother.","review":"Trying to get through this book is like watching paint dry. It's written so poorly. Every stinking detail about Marlene's life. Could've been written better. I don't care how many times her breasts were taped up or how many times she wet her pants when she laughed. I'm sure there were more important things that happened. The way this story about her life is written and all her lovers and how she flaunts them in her husband's face, makes Britany Spears and Lindsay Lohan look like saints. Even Paris Hilton is looking more saintly after reading this book! What a shame of how to remember one's Mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Pity and Bitterness","review":"Undoubtedly, Ms Riva had greater access to the details of her subject's life than most biographers, inasmuch as Marlene Dietrich was her mother. What is distressing about this sad book is the picture it gives us, not of Ms Dietrich, but of her embittered, peeved, self-pitying and unforgiving daughter. Doubtless, Marlene Dietrich's flaws were as large as her outsize personality, but Ms Riva's insistence on seeing these failures as conscienceless personal attacks on her and her sanity is wearisome and, in truth, a banal and hackneyed cop-out for whatever feelings of inferiority she suffered through the early years of her life.This is the biography of beautiful, selfish woman by her plainer, self-obsessed daughter. It leaves a very bad taste in the mouth and a feeling of true sorrow that Ms Riva could not resolve her scarcely ambiguous dislike for her mother outside the pages of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a superb, intelligent, well-written book!!!","review":"Just two words: the least important character here is Marlene Dietrich, whom I worship. But she had this daughter, so brilliant, sincere personality and, in result, we have here a superb portrait of an epoch and many passionate personalities.By far, one of the best books I have read in many years, and, in fact, the best, most compassionate biography I have ever read about a contemporanean artist.But this is a wonderful work of art, not just a biography!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My life with Marlene Dietrich.....","review":"At times this book was a good read.Then you get intricatedetails of Maria's life, hiding behind this legend is a little girl(&Tammi) wishing praise from the world in a book she wrote in order to fulfill her need to write about herself.Truthful and full of detail as it is.This book may captivate you,then may make you upset because you took the time to read...Marlene dedicated herself to her daughter,loved her! Maria managed her mother's professional life and experienced the up's and down's of legend.She deserves praise for this. For all of us we see fame as the ultimate way to cheat death.Marlene suceeded!

This is just another sad example of what happens when a star's daughter tries to become Mommy, cannot, and takes out her revenge in book form. Riva, lacking her mother's talent, dedication and smarts, instead penned this often self-contradictory memoir, full of mean-spirited attacks on her mother. Oddly, one comes out admiring Dietrich all the more. She was a nice person, a hard-nosed businesswoman, a brillant and versatile actress. But she certainly cannot have been much of a mother, as her daughter is a sad and sorry piece of work. Get this, if you must, for the photos, but take the \\"facts\\" with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Annoying","review":"There are a great many reasons to dislike this book. It is badly organized, written, edited, and proofread. Perhaps the most annoying thing about the book, however, is Riva's inclination to use what is ostensibly a biography of Dietrich as a vehicle for Riva's own autobiography. I'm sure it comes as a bitter disappointment to Riva, but we're still not really interested in her."},{"rating":"2","title":"TDK Tremor S60 2.1 speakers","review":"I bought these speakers as a replacement set for my old computer after they just stopped working (power supply failed). So, after a simple listening test I chose these over all other products my local Domayne store (AU$120), and this was no-where near the most expensive 2.1 system. They have excellent sound from quiet to loud volumes and low to high pitch, and are a joy to listen to. However I only realised just how good they are when I got a new PC and some generic 2.1 system, which had no bass and ultimately were pathetic in comparison to the S60, especially in games and music playing. I definately recommend them to anyone, especially if you think you \\"need\\" a 4.1 or 5.1 system."},{"rating":"2","title":"TDK S150 Speakers- Awesome Value","review":"I sold my Klipsch Promedia 4.1 system because it took up too much space (I live on a boat).

Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handsome speaker","review":"I just got this S60 speaker,even it is an entry level but it sounds great and the silver color just matching my new flat panel. I compared many speakers (price $40-$70) before I made this decision some are they just sound louder instead of nice.I feel this speaker can re-produce human voice clearly, enough bass and H/F sound quality, even I never trust a PC speaker will sounds great, but I accept this S60. Also all those other brand name speaker came from an old fashion design cannot be compared. One thing this S60 should have a power switch on/off button. Overall from the price to the design, what do you expected... it is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment :-(","review":"I just purchased the TDK S80s from [a local store]. After installing them (I am replacing an older 3-spk. set of Altec Lansings), I immediately started playing some songs. The sound quality of these speakers is passable at lower volumes but as soon as you try to blast it even a little bit the frequency response buckles. Treble is crackly as hell and bass is a lot muddier than I would have expected from such a cool-looking tube. I adjusted both my PC sound card settings, Winamp EQ and Bass/treb controls on the right speaker, all to no avail. I have an Audigy MP3 sound card, and just hooked my Altec Lansings back up. Now I have to box these TDK things up and take them back.I give these speakers a strong thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers!","review":"I bought the Tremor S150 because of its neat metallic design and the dual subwoofer drivers (2x21 watts RMS so it's kinda like having 2 subwoofers). The 75 watts RMS system delivers ample power for both game and music. The subwoofer delivers a bass that is deep, rich, and crisp. The satellites can either stay on the desk or be hung on the wall (hangers are included). It's unfortunate that TDK did not include a remote control or any software with this 3-piece system.

I want to add that Previn's use of crescendo in the main brass statements of the first movement creates an emotional impact literally unique to this recording. I've listened to many, many recordings of this symphony and only Previn adds this. I don't care if it's in the score or not - it is wonderful! This is just one of the many felicities Previn brings to this music.

Whitman is more than a value investor, of course, he is a vulture investor and proud of it. Though this book is as fresh today as it was in 1979, we await his new book eagerly for more wisdom from the master.

He does. It's just that it takes a backseat to an ego that demands full-frontal nudity in the first five and final five minutes and this man is not Brad Pitt. He's not even Ben Stiller. I won't even get into him trying to pass for 20-something. It's well shot and unlike far too many films, does truly feel like NYC, but at the heart of it is this very unappealing man who wants you to believe he's irresistibly charming and could bag a supermodel (you'll have to suspend your disbelief to accept Amanda DeCadenet as a supermodel, though lovely she is) from the front seat of a cab. And if you've ever seen If Lucy Fell, you know this isn't the first time he's done this. His ego is go great he actually tosses the film's basic premise out in the final act to cement his greatness.

It is about the chase for a Nazi war criminal who has managed to erase his tracks and has emigrated to the US where he managed to integrate the good society of a small town. He was responsible for the final solution in one important concentration camp. The first idea that comes clearly from the film is that a criminal of that type can never reform and is a perverted mind and man forever. He has to be caught and neutralized. He has to be brought to court to answer for his crimes. The film is quite well done and the suspense is rather well built. The end is spectacular and very demonstrative of what such a criminal can come to if he feels menaced. Even love cannot erase his crimes and cannot make him come to terms with his responsibility because he has no conscience any more. To be shown to young audiences for them to see what war and fascism can lead to.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressed!","review":"I thought that a few songs were okay, but for the most part... Well, let's just say that the lead singer of most of the songs has that annoying ALL-4-ONE voice, like he's trying too hard (like he constantly had to push out his vibrato) and the music sounds too much like the instruments were recorded directly from a keyboard. I don't mean to be too harsh, but I really didn't like the CD at all. With all the 5 star ratings that everyone was giving them, I thought I'd take a chance and purchase it.

The characters in this book are utterly wooden -- one doesn't even care when Stonewall Jackson dies, though this should be a central point in the plot. The author rarely describes any event from a character's perspective, preferring a distant third-person voice, and thus the reader cannot engage with the events.

It's a fascinating book, particularly if you've either been on one of the boats or are planning to be. One of the misconceptions I've seen in various writings is when a particular liveaboard is called a 'party' boat - I've been on many liveaboards and none of them have been party boats. After getting up at 6:00am everyday and doing a day's worth of diving, everyone generally goes to bed at a reasonable hour in order to be well rested for the next day. Who wants to be hungover when you've paid good money to dive in these exotic locations? If by chance, a boat becomes a 'party' boat, its because that week's charter is more interested in drinking than diving, and that hasn't been my experience on liveaboards. People go on liveaboards because they want to immerse themselves in scuba diving and the wonderful world that opens up to them below the ocean's surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"Living in Florida one gets to know the ways of a hurricane--Esp. living on the beach and having it come right at you. Joe does a great job keeping you involved in the development of both the storm and the people that will face the storm in a boat of all places. A hurricane is a unique experience and the people that faced this one needed better information than was given to them to protect themselves. A must read for anyone going on an \\"adventure\\" vacation--not just a diving experience--because everyone should have the ability to go against bad judgements to keep themselves safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy the Brazilian edition of Put it There (DVD)","review":"A warning, the Brazilian DVD of Put it There is missing the the intro about cruelty with animals and missing some songs, eg., Fool on the Hill.

As another reviewer noted, the picture and sound are acceptable, but if you'reexpecting excellent DVD-style video and audio, you're not going to find it. I'm hoping that MPL will re-release this in such a DVD format in the near future.The content is great and a must have for any Beatles/McCartney fan.

I thought \\"Other Voices, Too\\" was a poorly done album, but this is worse. The beauty in her music is in its spare, gentle (or spare, rocking) arrangements, which accurately reflect her lyrics. This stuff is simply overwrought and dumb. The lines at the end of \\"Wing and Wheel\\" reflect her growing conceit that she can do whatever she wants and people will say it's fine. James Hooker, please speak up! You know this isn't good, right? Stop her before she becomes nothing more than a caricature of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her next album will feature all duets with Wayne Newton.","review":"This is beyond laziness, because it is crass and calculated. While her nasal vocals bother many from outside the Lone Star state, she always brought an intimacy to her songs, something lacking in the woodwind section of the London Symphony. I'm sure her next album will feature all duets with the likes of Wayne Newton, Englebert Humperdink & Tom Jones and, by the way, it will sell more units than any of her stellar releases on Rounder. She's lost her edge which often happens to great performers after they hit paydirt. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush, sweet and forever memorable!","review":"In this age of screaming vocals and so much electronica you don't know which end is up, this album is a beautiful throwback to days when singers connected with their audience. The addition of the London Symphony Orchestra only enhances music we all knew was excellent! The new material makes this even more special. My only regret is that this isn't a double album. Thank you Nanci, for the music and the memories!

For me, I am taken back to the first time I saw her in concert in Seattle on Pier 62/63 on a rainy, summer night. For those who have not ever seen Nanci in concert, this CD is still worth purchasing, for it will transport you to a world where all is right with the world. This is truly an artistic accomplishment of which Ms. Griffith and the Blue Moon Orchestra should be proud. The lending of the London Symphony brings such legitimacy to music that, though not always commercially viable, is truly the greatest ever! Congratulations to Nanci and all the musicians involved in this wonderful production!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Down the slippery slope","review":"Back in the day (as the kids like to say) Nanci made good albums with some great songs. Now she's taken some of these songs and made a truly sorry album. What she and Hootie do to Love at the Five and Dime is just plain wrong (but not as wrong as what she and Will Lee did to it on Letterman). Her major label albums have tended to be over-produced but there was always solid, NEW material underneath that made them worth listening to. But ever since she got the cover bug doing Other Voices (which, of course, moved lots and lots of units), the new material has dried up. And now this latest bit of laziness. Doing these over-the-top cover versions of her own songs should be beneath a songwriter of her caliber.Do yourself a favor and buy a copy of Last of the True Believers and hear Love at the Five and Dime without all the gimmicks. Oh yeah, there's a great Hootie-less cover of it on One Fair Summer Evening too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspirational but not Instructional","review":"This book is in French.

It's really more a showcase/review of the piece highlighted. The pieces are creative and beautiful but this is not the book for someone without expertise in the field.For the price I expected a more of a textbook.

Not as simple as my wireless keyboard and mouse!Even worse, the headphones are not adjustable.

Headphones look ok, with just the right amount of Geekhood proudly announced afterwards (reminiscent of the last generation of Geeks with the tape on the glasses). Sound is very good (better than most earbuds), they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated Logitech transiever, and range is outstanding. My only beef is how long I have to hold down the power switch to turn them on, and so far I have not successfully established a connections with my Treo 650. 1 star held back because of need of customer applied ECO, and they are only partially functional with the Nano (can't use the advance track feature of the headphones)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably fragile, terrible design.","review":"Loved these when I first got 'em. Not bad sound at all, and a decent range. I used them maybe 5 or 6 times, with the iPod, as well as a CD and Cassette walkman. Move over sliced bread, WD-40 and those leetle cup-holders for your car window, this was a great invention... until after only a few, very gentle uses, the connecting band on the headphone cracked. In about 3 places! I tried to tape it up, but JEEZ, people, this is the member that supports the entire headphone. Once cracked, the phone is a flabby mess, and is useless. Who cares how cool it is, if it lasts so short a time? This product needs, and is worthy of, a complete redesign. A setup so versatile and functional shouldn't be hobbled by being so fragile. Beef it up, Logitech, and I'll buy it. Fortunately, Amazon has a very fair refund policy, though I might question why they're still selling this white elephant (which also comes in black, I understand)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitec Wireless Headset - DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$","review":"I purchased the Logitiec Wireless headset for my wife and she loved it.

Performance wise the product is pretty good, I use mine at work and am in a large open cube farm and I actually get a range of 86 feet!!, sound quality is a pretty good, however those who are used to earbuds will have to get used to a difference in volume, earbuds sound \\"louder\\" at lower volume setting than compared to same setting using the headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be perfect if only.........","review":"Logitech has done a great job with this iPod accessory.

And lastly, they're terrible if you're moving a lot in relation to the base. I was cutting my grass, staying well within the 30 foot range, but my signal kept cutting out. I put the iPod in my pocket and it was fine after that.

I was so sick of wires getting tangled in so many situations. Now, no more wires! Plus, my partner complains that with my headphones on I can't talk to her. With these...one tap to the ear the the music is paused and I can hear her. So great to be able to switch tracks, adjust volume, and pause all by tapping your ear. Fun around the house, also, while you clean up or whatever. I know all the negatives about the plastic headband and lack of adjustabilty fo different sized heads. Sorry, but they fit me. I'm sure logitech will ofer a new model in the future, but for now, these things ROCK. Almost instant blueooth pairing. Good sound. Lose your wires forever! n.b. this is the first time I've ever been inspiried to write a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"THESE SNAP!","review":"I read reviews before that said these headphones snap down the middle but I figured these people had large heads/weren't careful, etc. THAT IS NOT TRUE. I am very careful with these headphones and one day I noticed they were way too loose. So I took them off and noticed that they were started to snap down the middle. I glued them with super glue but that wore away and they stopped working all together. I tried regluing them but they are very fragile now and now much use to me since I wear them while working out. These are WAY too expensive to have such a major defect. BUYER BEWARE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with the latest iPods","review":"I ordered these headphones with great anticipation. I had read a review of them in PC Magazine, and thought they would be the perfect solution for my work music needs... I move around a lot in a large cube, and like to leave my iPod on the desk.Imagine my disappointment when I got the headphones, only to discover that they will not work with either iPod I own - an iPod Nano and a 60GB Video iPod. These headphones only work with the older type of iPod that has a little extra plug next to the headphone jack.I was able to use them - sound only, no controls - by plugging in the included extension cable. But since the main reason I wanted these was to be able to pause and unpause music directly from the headphones, I reluctantly sent them back.So - fair warning to owners of the newest iPod models: These don't work. Wait until Logitech comes out with a revised model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!!!!!","review":"Mine head band broke in TWO places!

I'm surprised there aren't more products on the market like this. The manufacturing and design of the headphones however is severely lacking. After only having this product for 5 months, the back of the headphones have cracked.I just got off the phone with the customer service folks and as long as you have the receipt they are refunding money and not replacing them at all. I think there are too many fundamental flaws with the design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy - Great idea bad design","review":"Logitech, makes nice products; however this is not one of them.In fact it is not longer being sold off of Logitech's website because, the headband is prone to breaking/cracking when used.It worked great initially.

The headband very quickly cracked and the whole headset stopped working. I loved all other features so much that I bought a second pair and tried to reinforce the headband with electrical tape right out of the box. This did not help as they headband on pair #2 cracked as well. Once cracked the wires stretch and break and the headphones then become worthless. Too bad, except for this flaw these are great headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headband has broken","review":"I read the reviews before I bought them - I thought I would be extra careful and that they would not break. Bought them in late November, 2005 they broke on Friday, March 3, 2006. They lasted a little over 3 months - but I only use them maybe once or twice a week. I liked them otherwise. Logitech told me that would replace them - I will wait and see if they do. The bigger questions is, will they continue to replace them?? Have they eliminated the obvious design flaw?? I am not apt ot buy another Logitech headset. Otherwise I like them.I paid $139.99 because I bought them when they first came out. I see now after rebate they are only $50 - that drastic price reduction must be telling us something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound, Bad Design","review":"The sound quality is great and the wireless controls for volume and such are excellent. The headphones are easy to setup and use.But a major problem is the headphone design. It is made of plastic and within a week's use the headphone band had cracked a little (not completely in two). In a few months' time I'm afraid the band will be completely snapped in two.Wait for a better design for bluetooth wireless headphones. I would not buy these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cracked band ... major flaw","review":"I bought this from an online auction site and it arrived with a cracked band.

They were the model in black, not the white \\"Ipod\\" model here, but the same product none the less. After about two months of use I started to have problems where the headset would stop communicating with the transmitter. A few weeks later I noticed that the headband started to crack. Eventually, the unit stopped working altogether once the headband cracked enough to sever the wire inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"works good but breaks","review":"i bought two of these logitec bluetooth headphones for my ipod. they both worked great, but both cracked in the same spot. middle of the headband. not happy with my purchases. 300 bucks in one year? too expensive if this is logitec quality?"},{"rating":"1","title":"alright for a while","review":"These headphones a great while they work. Unfortunately, my first set just stopped working and I got a free replacement but on those ones, the headband cracked. Overall, the sound from them was great. Also, the functions controlled the ipod really well and I would say that if you are very careful with them they are worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"were these things ever tested?","review":"I got my set of these headphones yesterday, and charged them overnight. Today I came into work, plugged the transponder-like part into my shiny new v5.5 30GB video iPod albeit crooked because the thing isn't compatible, and was ready to go! Not so fast. It took a minute or so to get the headphones to \\"talk\\" to the main unit. OK.I got music! I can only control the volume with headset, however. The pause/play button in the middle and the fw/rw buttons just result in a \\"beep\\" noise and no action. This sucks. I'm not sure if this is because the other metal portion of the transponder part doesn't fit in to my new iPod, or what.So far they haven't cracked but they are tight. I give them a week.Don't waste your money and read the fine print, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fragile to use","review":"I immediately returned these as they seemed ready to break the first time I put them on. The strap is super thin and brittle."},{"rating":"1","title":"They break !?!","review":"My first pair broke within a week. Just normal wear and tear, taking them off my head. No snowboarding, no car wrecks, no toddlers. They just snap under their own weight. Then the crack expanded and must have pulled one of the wires loose because they stopped charging. Logitech, to their credit, sent me a replacement quickly. Then those broke too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes they break","review":"What a shame - read the reviews and chanced my arm - however the first ones (black non-ipod) broke within 2 weeks use, at the apex of the headband v.v.poor.Logitech replaced them with the white ipod ones, not what i wanted, so beware when specifying a replacement to make explicit which model you want, but I can't be bothered to send them back.However Logitech replaced them without question, which was good. But I'm off to buy some superglue and something to reinforce the headband.There are 3 wires in the headset one/all of them fracture when the crack traverses them - but they can be soldered together again, will probably do so and put them to use somewhere dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphones Break","review":"Nice idea, works great until they break.

I'm a 5'6\\" person, and the headphones were too big and too heavy. I could have ignored the too big part...but the heavy weight of them was just too much. So I returned my headphones, and will wait for a second version that will hopefully be smaller and lighter. I hate having to return these, as I really love the freedom of being wireless...but at $150, they need to be more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful awful product UGHHHHHHHH","review":"I was so excited to paint outside with my new wireless headphones.

I consider this song like the exact opposite of easy-listening music, a feeling catalyst, a vehicle that can raise you to the sky and gradually take you to the deepest level in hell. As derrotista said, it is perfect to describe the meaning of a word like \\"death\\", but more than that, with an inevitability emphasis.The rest of the compilation also honors the meaning of intensity. No one song in this disc will let your attention go away from the sensations mosaic this record constructs. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor's New Music","review":"A lot of people seem to love this guy and I just don't see why. I find it dull, intellectual (in the most pejorative sense) and defines what's wrong with a lot of \\"post-modernism\\" in music today. This guy doesn't write tunes as much as he writes concepts of tunes. The music fails to connect on an emotional level and fails to be interesting enough in purely intellectual terms to compensate for it's emotional hollowness. His craft seems a bit lacking too- filled with the trappings of minimalism without the basic musical values such as memorable melodies, logical harmony and innovative form that make a composer such as John Adams worth listening to. His often odd choices of orchestration tend to strike one as merely grotesque rather than imaginative. I'm afraid that Michael Nyman is a musical poseur and it's a shame that so many people have bought into his brand of soulless artifice.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"We got it and found it hard to read and set.

Finally, while not transparent it's clear enough to read even very small text through it, as the accompanying video shows.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews, accompanied by detailed videos, can take the place of first-hand experiences that are often lacking in online shopping.

So this is especially good for repairing stuff around the house. It's much more expensive than the regular duct tape, so I'd save it for cosmetic fixes. It's quite useful for small plastic trim pieces in older cars. Blends in pretty well and holds well.The duct tape part, well, it claims to last 6x as long as traditional duct tape (the package says \\"based on accelerated aging tests\\"). I don't verify the factor of six, but the tape does seem to hold up pretty well.If you need a roll of duct tape for cosmetic work, then this is your tool of choice.Consider also the very small, <$2 rolls for a single project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"My biggest concern is that this tape is not sticky at all.

These fits into a plastic dispenser which makes it easy to wrap right onto a package, and then use the edge to tear it off.I tried this tape by itself and in a dispenser, but had the same trouble trying to keep it from folding over and sticking to itself. I have wasted a lot of pieces trying to get just a flat piece onto a package. Once it is gone, I'll go back to the thinner but easier-to-use transparent tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING, HIDDEN CHARGE BY AMAZON!!!","review":"What can I say, it's clear duct tape, well, not completely clear the fibers are visible, but it's still one of the best products ever produced.

I listen to alot of different kind of music and have heard my share of self-obsessed songwriters. Many of whom have the artistic talent for taking private moments and making them seem universal (Meshell Ndegeocello, for example). This is NOT one of those cases. I'm glad that this songwriter is happy and I'm glad the hard times are over, but to be frank, I don't need to hear you sing your Daytimer, which is what much of this sounds like. Musically, the album is average, rarely catching fire.

But when you have two receivers sitting side by side, reading from the SAME sensor, and showing temperatures 3 degrees (F) apart, you might question if either one is right. Two sensors in the same place will show different readings as well. So sticking your hand outside might be more reliable.Resetting them is painful: if you change a sensor battery, you may have to go reset all the receivers, because they gave up listening for that sensor when it died. If you change a receiver battery, you may find yourself grabbing all the sensors and receivers and going through several reset cycles in order to get them all to be friends again.And the coup de grace: they don't last long, maybe 2-3 years if you're lucky, after that the sensor's signal seems to become too weak.

The book is very attractive but is filled with factual errors. It is a collection of very many (too many) short (just a page or a few pages) discussions of very disparate topics. There is no connection made. More disturbing than the factual errors is the overall lack of understanding of historiography that comes through. There are scenes described that could only have happened in an Errol Flynn movie. Great emphasis is given trivial issues whereas germinal events in carto-history are ignored.My overall impression is that the author is not knowledgeable in this field and has produced an error-ridden potboiler.

The guided imagery is able to relax me even after the most stressful of days. I have never listened to this type of recording before, but Alicia's voice is able to put the listener at ease.

The sounds of the hammer dulcimer elicit a very relaxing feeling and the addition of the recorder is lovely. This is especially appropriate for those with health problems, but also perfect if you just need to relax or meditate. My favorite song is titled \\"Gift From Above,\\" although they are all beautiful.

They had no way of knowing that Shackleton had never begun his trip to the pole and was instead fully engaged in his own epic fight for survival. This lesser known side of the story deserves to be remembered as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm returning this...","review":"This book contradicts itself. First it says there are no dictionaries that have correct IPA (which is reassuring--NOT), then it says in the middle that we should consult a dictionary for proper pronunciation. By no means should you tackle this book without a teacher who actually knows Italian and from whom you can hear it being spoken because this doesn't come with recordings of how to actually pronounce words, which would be most helpful. I guess that's just the limitation of any diction book without a CD. But anyway this book is still ridiculous because it also doesn't clarify the difference between open and closed Os and Es. Sure, it really may not be that big of an issue because you can't really tell open/closed Os and Es anyway when they are sung, but this book is also just too convoluted. Find a good Italian diction teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF I WAS YOUR TEACHER-I WOULD HAVE TO GIVE YOU BOYS A C FOR THIS RECORDING","review":"I am a fan of Big & Rich-and I think they are capable of much better stuff than this-what a let down for me.

With special guests John Legend, Wyclef Jean, and Lil John, music without prejudice hits a new high, and I for one couldn't be happier with it! For the AC/DC fans in the house, the cover of \\"Shook Me All Night Long\\" may disappoint, but to me, it just goes to prove that a great song can transpire across any genre of music.

I was able to get both to focus most of the time by using my \\"live view\\" focusing, but it is slow and you can't use the viewfinder. I just couldn't justify keeping this large, heavy, no doubt very high quality lens if it was going to be that difficult to use.The kit lens that came with my Canon XSi focuses much more reliably, maybe because that lens is designed for small sensor cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST WIDEANGLE LENS I HAVE USED","review":"This lens is awesome.I wanted a wideangle for shooting indoor low light. This filled that void and then some. I wasnt satisfied with the idea of getting a f/2.8 wideangle lens for shooting indoors. I wanted something faster, then I stumbled up on this lens. I could not find many reviews, but I figured Sigma was a good brand, and anyways the lens turned out to be fantastic.I use it primary for indoor shooting and for situations where I need a wider angle of view.I would highly recommend this lens to anyone who just needs something wider than a 50mm on a DX sensor.I am using this on a Nikon D90 and have been overwhelmingly satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy it again.","review":"I had used this lens maybe 3 times.

Honestly I thought this album was just as good as anything that he has touched. You gotta love \\"got ya money\\" and the female backups on \\"rollin with you\\". True enough, this album is shorter than the first one in many ways. But on the other hand he's still keeping it real and being himself. The only suggestions that I could think of is that their should have been some WU appearances on it and possibly a few more songs on it period.

While other MCs may come of menacing, it's hard to truly take ODB all that seriously...because he's a lunatic.

I have read plenty of magazine reviews that hail this as a \\"ground-breaking\\" album. I think O.D.B. is playing a joke on listeners--the album title supports this and he says it in so many words on the album. \\"Baby I got Your Money\\" is a phenomenal song, its funky, and it's a real dead on parody of the Hip Hop climate, as relevant today as it was when it came out.

There are much better time wasters out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL HAIL THE SECOND COMING OF THE HIP-HOP JESUS","review":"This album is the s***, everyone who whined about how disappointing it is (or, even worse, about how disappointing the masterpiece \\"Return to the 36 Chambers\\" was) are simply wrong. To even compare this to any other Wu albums (besides \\"Enter the 36 Chambers\\") is wrong, ODB is in his own league from the other Wu-Tang members (notice how Wu's record sales have fallen since ODB's imprisonment). Claiming that ODB put this out just for money is wrong too (for an example of this type of album, see ODB's recent \\"Trials and Tribulations of Russell Jones\\" or his greatest hits album). The beats on this album are hot, ODB's lyrics and vocal style belong in the same league with the classic rap vocalists. When Ol' Dirty yells, \\"I get the cocaine, it cleans out my sinuses,\\" you know you've reached the pinnacle of hip-hop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I can't listen to this all the way through. Infact, half of the songs are pretty unlistenable. Even the best songs are a bit horrible to listen to. ODB added an interesting dimension to the WuTang Clan, but as a solo artist, was just too much. RIP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't kid yourself...","review":"...this is a bad album. You can't pretend it's not.I really really don't know what Wu-Tang/ODB/Elektra Records was thinking when they released \\"Nigga Please,\\" but... ... at least with Dirty's first album, you could enjoy the beats and try to tune out the yelling, screaming, etc. AND on the first CD, there was actually a little bit of RHYMING here and there. Remember RHYMING, Ol' Dirty? Apparently not.This CD is nothing but a collection of alright beats (and often not even that), underneath Russell Jones screaming and yelling and ranting and raving. It just doesn't hold anyone's attention anymore.But I can't call it a total waste. \\"Recognize\\" has a sweet beat courtesy of the Neptunes (who do a lot work on the album, most of it poor), \\"Cold Blooded\\" is mildly enjoyable, and there are a few clever lines in \\"Got Your Money.\\" Also, the title track is very tolerable, one of RZA's better new tracks. But on the whole, this album is not worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Thrown together to make money!","review":"I was hyped for this album before its release. When I listened to it though I was very disapointed. I was in with the WU from the beginning when RZA was cutting the beats. O.D.B's first disc, Return to the 36 Chambers was unbelieveable and I gave it 5 stars and it might be the in the top 3 WU discs. He changed his styles 5 or 6 times on the CD and blew my mind with some sweet rhymes. This CD sounded like he ran out of the welfare checks he was collecting on MTV and he needed some quick cash. I suggest you stay away from this one. Peace out and big up to a Masta Killa solo albumn. Wheres it at?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ODB is back again.","review":"First, I am not one of those people that go around giving rap cd's 2 stars because I don't like rap. Wu Tang is one of my favorite rap groups out there and odb is brilliant in every wu tang song I've heard. I just don't think odb is ready or capable of putting out a solo album.You will not like this album if you don't enjoy hearing odb screaming out a bunch of nonsense. There is no doubt that odb is extremely unique in his own sense, but he shows no talent in this album. \\"Got your money\\" is a good song that earned the 2 stars.Over all, if you are a fan of odb, I suggest you buy a wu tang clan cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Serious.....","review":"What few listeners realize is that behind all the clowning and moonshining, ODB is a lyrical master. However, someone has led him to beleive that throwing together some 'nuhs', yells, and bad singing is a way follow up a great debeut album. Outside of \\"Baby I Got..\\" this CD was a waste of my time. When I buy a hip hop CD, I want to hear lyrics not comedy skits. Theres a difference between Biggie singing \\"Playa Hata\\" on one track and OLB putting out this mess. As a member of group that prides themselves on lyrical skills, ODB should know better. I hate to see a waste of talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"BIG BABY.........You DO need to wait\\"","review":"Well first of all....I'm not a Wu-Tang fan, but I did buy Inspectah Deck, and Raekwon, and this garbage put out by Ol Dirty is ridiculous. I think all those times of him going to jail finally got to him.In jail, they might have made a punk out of him,and this album is a direct reflection of it. Only like 3 tracks are hardly worth listening to, and that is not good. 1/2 of the time he tries to show off his vocal skills, and that he can sing but he cant. I cant beleive RZA would even allow something like this out on the streets. The best song is the one produced by IRV GOTTI, and the 2nd one is the intro w/Chris Rock.

We know right off, from the first paragraph that Lori Jean is dead yet we are hooked by this unique narrator. The story is truly tragic.

Ms. Miles does an expert job of crafting the characters, even the vile ones. so that they are quite believable, as is the entire novel.Lori Jean's innocence comes across along with the wisdom she gained through her short life.

I would have stopped reading had I realized the disturbing scenes go clear to the end of the story and in fact increase.I found no redeeming value in the father, although the author tries to develop some compassion for him at several points.Clearly, I am in the minority, based on the other reviews I see here! Just thought I'd pass along my 2 cents worth in case you're considering this book based on the reviews, like I did.

I now wish I hadn't finished it. Maybe, I read to be uplifted and that's why I didn't like this book.

That's the best I could do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roseflower Creek and Cold Rock River","review":"I very much enjoyed reading Roseflower Creek and have also read another book, Cold Rock River, by this author.

The US title match between Konnan & Eddie Guerrero was a good solid match but still not enough to save this PPV. The Steven Regal-Fit Finlay match was a great brawl which was ruined by a DQ ending. The Man vs Woman match between Madusa & Col.Robert Parker was crud to the 10th power. the Bootyman(subbing for Johnny B Badd who left to join the WWF)-DDP match was second-rate at best. The Giant-Loch Ness match was pointless and a big letdown. The Chicago Street Fight between the team of Sting & Booker T against The Road Warriors was a third rate ECW ripoff and a bad reminder of the Harlem Heat-Nasty Boys match from the 1995 event. The Tower Of Doom Steel Cage match was nothing more then as The Nostalgia Critic would call it a \\"Big Lipped Alligator Moment\\". I give this \\"PPV\\" a 1 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Social Commentary Story","review":"I'm having issues trying to get 3.5 stars to work. I read this book hoping for something as compelling as the next in the series (I read them out of order) and was somewhat disappointed. _Facing Rushmore_ is an entertaining read that is part social commentary and part story. It includes what I would refer to as the fantastic, as it juxtaposes the themes of Native American or Indigenous storytelling and narrative throughout the book.At times the story feels forced, as if the social commentary overrides what the author is actually trying to do--tell a story. It can be frustrating to read a book, when an author is trying too hard to be witty or hit you over the head with a point.Don't get me wrong, I will read more by this author and have found that I read his books in one sitting quickly. I think the stories/books are original and insightful. The audience for this book is a wide, general audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already","review":"I really enjoyed this author in the past. But it's unfortunate that he has also turned into another writer who seems to love the spoils of being an American (or as he calls us in his book Europeans) yet loathes what we are. I'm not sure where people get suspense out of this book. I believe on every page there is dialogue about how bad we American's (or Europeans) are and have been to the Indians. Will definately think twice about even reading this author again. Frankly, I could have done without the WHOLE book going over and over and over the same theme. Tiresome, I believe, to even those that are going to agree with the theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"took almost 2 weeks to deliver","review":"It took almost 2 weeks to deliver with standard shipping.

I found other insightful theologians, such as Arthur Peacock, referring to critical realism as the foundation upon which they developed their arguments. I have always felt Empiricism was lacking in its explanatory power. Critical Realism describes why Hume and Kant, among others, have left their descriptions of reality wanting for deeper elucidation. Critical realism goes beyond the simple sense derived observational phenomena to the root of what drives the real nature of the universe, the underlying generative mechanisms that may or may not be perceived but must exist in a universe with or without the presence of man. This is a stumbling block for the explanatory power of classical Empirical Realism. The book can be tedious at times and one should keep a dictionary available as the vocabulary for nonphilosophy readers may be tedious as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read This Book Unless If You're Going For PhD","review":"This book is the source of a distinct paradigm in management research. The author raised many issues related to the assumptions that had been used as a basis for positivism, and suggests new approach of what he called realist science.I can bet that 99% of normal people will find this book a mental torture, very few will ever proceed beyond page 2 of this book. If you imagine a long bearded person with long hair, sitting in a room full of books and muttering to himself of something totally incomprehensible while jotting something in a book, THIS is exactly the kind of book that you are going to read. In short, stay away unless if you have a commitment to enhance your knowledge in the philosophy of social science, which is not typical unless if you're enrolled in the first year PhD in Management.

I ordered my MBP on May 30th, and since then I've had three(!) replacements due to terrible build quality. The first MBP went back because the case was buckled above the battery, the lid didn't close properly, and it kicked out huge amounts of heat. The second MBP went back because the screen catch was broken on delivery. My third, and final MBP is about to go back because the LCD has extremely uneven illumination and the lid doesn't close properly (one side closes flush to the keyboard, whilst the opposite side has a gap of almost 0.5cm). My advice to anyone considering a MBP is to wait until they have ironed out their quality control issues.

His argument on the relationship between limit, game, and narrative is especially thought provoking. His analysis of parables as cross-expectations is one of the more interesting and thought-provoking studies of parables.The net result of his line of thought is that the reader gains a pratical rather than strictly theorectical understanding of narrative theology ... and comes to see it as a natural tool of interpretation of life - one's own or Christ's/"},{"rating":"1","title":"much too much","review":"I purchased this dvd to show to my students who were studying Romeo and Juliet and who had read the novel, Romiette and Julio.

We include a power inlet mounted in the transfer switch when plug-in connection is desired, as in a garage installation. But when the transfer switch is hardwired, as in a basement installation, the inlet is not needed, and can be removed. A professional installer would remove the inlet from the transfer switch and reinstall it in the power inlet enclosure...So you're not paying for the inlet twice. That was our reasoning behind the decision - to save the consumer from paying for the same component in the kit twice.

After it was done I gave it a test drive, it was so nice to just have one cable from the outside to the garage.

I can not agree more with Barbara Fisher \\"Beyond Lame\\". If you are considering spending your money on this movie, re-read \\"Beyond Lame\\" then put your credit card away!

This movie fulfils that desire."},{"rating":"1","title":"The house built upon the sand","review":"This book gives a clear and detailed exposition of the author's aproach to orthodontic treatment. The triangular brackets he uses have been heavily promoted elsewhere and his system is claimed to give major reductions in treatment times. The book is particularly popular with general pracitioners who have been on short courses in orthodontics. Unfortunately there is little or no evidence to support the claims the author makes for his system and the triangular brackets have not been shown to achieve any substantial advantage. Many of the author's arguments are not valid and are misleading. The one good idea in the book is the use of 020x020 nickel titanium archwires for alignment. A mainstream orthodontic book would be a much better buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This CD is great! It's got some great fast songs like \\"This Time Around\\" and some slow beautiful ones such as \\"Now You're Gone\\". He is a lot like all the boybands combined into one.

Move Over NSYNC Fredo Fever is coming","review":"I knew Michael when he sang in the church choir I directed. He was great then and I knew he would go far, but he just keeps amazing me. His voice is so smooth. We used to call it \\"angelic\\". I think the term should still apply. He has mastery of a wonderful range, both vocally but artistically as well. My favorite is \\"This Time Around\\", but I am also entranced by \\"Heartbreaker\\". I feel the emotion and pain in his song for his father, \\"Your Gone\\". What a song writer. I hope Mike continues in his success and that he continues to surprise us all. You can help. BUY THIS CD NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This time around... lots of tears.... for Fredo that is.","review":"Michael Fredo is nothing special, so to speak. His songs are produced with the chorus coming up quick and he doesn't have a great voice to make up for the sap. Maybe he would be gaining in populairty if he came before Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, or even Britney Spears (but then again, BSB, Nsync, and Britney _have_ talent). But, he did not. I would also like to give my review of Michael Fredo singing live (he was an opening act on Britney Spears' 1999 summer tour)... let's just say that he was not good at all. His performance did not keep the crowld interested and his voice could not carry in a live situation. Another thing that annoys me about Fredo is that he is being backed by his Uncle Tommy Hillfiger, even getting his own commercial that is totally fake. One last note of warning, do not pick up this cd, borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth A Listen","review":"MICHAEL FREDO's debut album is unfortunately very weak. His voice is mediocre but his choice of cuts on this disc has done him total wrong!

FREDO has penned several decent tunes on his album, perhaps he should pursue song-writing for other up-coming pop bands......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hype with talent","review":"Mike is great. I saw him twice open for Britney Spears and although the songs didn't change the set did. He is a pop singer with a love for the school of rock 'n roll.

The music here is inherently listenable; this is something to admire in an era of squeaking, squawking classical music that is meant to \\"challenge\\" more than it's ever meant to \\"delight.\\" This doesn't mean that Kernis' music is trite or simplistic. There is real beauty here, with sweeping gorgeous melodies in both works. As for \\"Symphony in Waves,\\" its cleverness is its claim to whatever fame it has, but the truth is that it's bursting with creative vibrancy and energy. It's an early work by Kernis, and only a sign of amazing things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful use of the Orchestra","review":"The Symphony in Waves is one of the most sensuously orchestrated works of the last two decades, reminding one of early John Adams, although the musical language is different. Rautavaara with an American sound is the way I'd describe it. I have listened to this CD 5 times and even given it to friends. This is not music to Break New Grounds, but manages to have a distinctive personal sound, something to admire in an era of sound-alike composers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a stand-up routine comedy album","review":"When I bought this CD I thought I was getting a comedy stand-up routine about the Christmas Holidays. Instead, these are songs that Bill Engvall co-wrote but are sung in a country/western style by studio musicians that you've never heard of. Bill introduces each song and then someone else sings them. Sometimes Bill will talk some of his comedy in the middle of the songs. Is it funny? I think it's OK. I was disappointed in the format. I thought it would be more like Jeff Foxworthy's Redneck 12 Days Of Christmas but it's more like Bob Rivers Twisted Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising Mix","review":"I must say, this isn't quite what I expected out of Bill Engvall for a Christmas album. I expected wall-to-wall chuckles, but the songs he's put together for this release are an interesting mixture of comedy and genuine, sweetly emotional tunes like \\"The Christmas Sign.\\" It's different from his usual work and different than most Christmas albums as well -- well worth it for his fans, as long as they know what they're getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the family","review":"I bought this CD a couple years ago and Ireally liked it, some of the songs were funny, and others were weird, the only thing i didn't really like about it is I like to place the album on random with songs from other Christmas albums for parties and things and he talks in between tracks, now if he were to seperate the talking parts in to a different tracks instead of having the songs and the talking on the same tracks, i would prefer it a lot more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas With Bill","review":"Hi folksSome of the songs are fun. I happen to find Bill Engval very funny. However, my problem with the album is that he talks before each song, ruining the mood of silliness. I went into the album with Amadeus, and edited out all of his talking and re burned it & then it played better. I'd suggest that for anyone interested in buying this album.Happy New Year!

The book basically hasn't changed for years, and the contents are barely phoned in. It's full of stale information, aggravatingly trite and ambiguous player comments, and valuations that make no sense the way roto is played now.

If you turn on the light and wind it while using it, I suppose it could, also it's a lot brighter when winding it. As soon as you stop winding it gets a lot less bright and in about 2 minutes becomes so dim that it isn't very useful for any real purpose.I suppose if you want a light that you can count on for a mad max post-apocalyptic world where there is no more power and no more batteries, this would be your only real choice. I have the light for 2 years now and it still works, even with kids using it as a child's toy, so I'd say it's durable. But as you can see, we just let the kids play with it as it not very useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I purchased this because I wanted a hand-held wind-up flashlight.

Tested each before putting them into the kits. After being in storage for a couple years, I actually needed to use one of them a few weeks ago.IT DID NOT WORK.The entire purpose of an emergency light is, to provide light in an emergency.

This one is probably the one I like the least. It is hard to charge and it does not hold the charge very long. The crank is very easy to turn but you have to crank it very fast, 2 to 3 turns per second, to even build up a reasonable charge. Other units I have are much harder to turn and as the batteries in the flashlights charge they progressively get harder to turn.This flashlight at its best could hold a 10 minute charge but even after limited use it quickly declined to about 3 to 5 minutes. Other units I own can operate the flashlight for up to 1 hour and the charging took the same time at slower cranking speeds. For dependability and the duration of the light, this one is not a good selection. You should look for better alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I purchased three of these.

I bought one of these and my husband asked if I could please buy a real flashlight. Intent on proving him wrong, I always brought it out and tried to use it whenever it was needed.

Won't be buing it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold a charge","review":"I got this flashlight because it was cheaper than the LL Bean dynamo light it was replacing. I ended up returning this light and just buying the LL Bean flashlight again.There are two problems with this light. First, it doesn't hold a charge. If you wind this up for a few hours to use later, the charge will have dissipated and will have to wind it again. I could understand if it were a few days, but it shouldn't be hours.Second, the handle is very poor. It wobbles, making winding more cumbersome than it needs to be.I don't recommend this light for emergency use, as I was going to.

The chocolate flavor is quite good, similar to Met-RX's (my other favorite protein powder). I also like that almost all of the calories in this protein powder are from protein -- no added fat or sugar here. This mixes up to a nice consistency, particularly if done in a blender. I like to use 1/2 1% milk and 1/2 water as it tastes better that way than when made with water alone.

No extra magic ingredients, no picture of an heir to Greg Valentine's Ugly Deformed Arms crown.Of course the jar is covered with amazing claims about what whey protein will do for you... all the brands do that. But at least this one is actually just whey, priced reasonably. As in, cheap, which it should be.In particular this brand is creatine-free. You won't instantly lose 5 pounds if you stop taking it. Also, supplement-level amounts of creatine are impossible to get from food, so I consider them unnatural and cheating.Twin Lab mixes well in a shaker bottle.Only downside is the scoop size. 5 pounds of this doesn't go as far as 5 pounds of some other brands. But 68 scoops x 25g protein = 1700g which for 30 bucks is well under 2 cents a gram. Hard to beat that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beat expectations!

I got 1 of those blender bottles and that worked a lot better, but I would not recommend this product.As far as effectiveness it didn't seem to work all that great.

From the point of view of a fan used to the more 'rocky' Blondie sound I have always found this slightly frustrating. However, now is the chance to here Debbie explore further the realm of jazz, as first heard on the excellent 'Faces' on Autoamerican, an under-rated Blondie track, but one that has stood the test of time well.Debbie has an excellent voice, and the songs range from humerous to more traditional smooth, jazzy ballads and love songs. One of the highlights is to here Debbie duet with Elvis Costello on 'Doncha Go 'Way Mad'. Elvis Costello also writes and sings another track, 'Aubergine'. There is an excellent 'jazzy' version of 'The Tide Is High' with Chris Stein on guitar.All in all a great CD that I will listen to, from start to finnish, again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be invisible","review":"Would love to review this item, but my August 31st order has not yet been shipped (so much for \\"usually ships in 1-2 business days\\").

They have similar central sharpness at f4.0 but the sigma corners are fairly soft, and no way as crisp as those on the canon 17-40L lens. There is little vignetting at f4.0 on the sigma, but the vignetting at f 1.8 is fairly marked.I am not sure of the best use of this unique lens. I bought it for nighttime photography of the constellations as a poor man's version of the very expensive canon 16-35L lens, but it may prove to be to soft for this. I will have to try it some. It does focus quite closely, and the large focusing ring is pleasant to use. For people travel photography, with a diffuse blurred background, such as from photographer Phil Borges, this may be quite a useful lens. It's is a fast lens, but you have to really just want the center to be sharp, as for landscape photography it will be too soft and the 17-40L lens will be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been smarter","review":"A 20mm f1.8 prime for $400.00? What was I thinking? At f1.8 the lens is unacceptably soft. Better at 2.8, but still not great. It's not until f4 that the Sigma matched the sharpness of my Nikon 17-55 f2.8 zoom. A full stop slower! This begs the question - what is the point of having this lens if it's soft until f4? Answer - no point at all.

This is the only Sigma brand lens I own; all my others are Canon brand.

I cannot comment on it's capibilities for full-frame cameras, but for almost all Sony/Minolta digital users, this will not be an issue anyway. The 1.8 aperture, combined with Sony's anti-shake feature allow for some really nice low-light photography.It worked equally well for candid portaits and any kind of landscape photos on the Sony, I was surprised how much wider it felt than the standard 24-xx mm zoom lenses, and the quality was always miles ahead.Downside: not the fastest focusing, and IQ in low light is not that great; it does tend to hunt for the correct focus. Not sure how much of that is the camera, and how much is the lens. Also, be prepared to get the lens focus calibrated in order to bring out the best from it.Overall, great sharpness, color and contrast for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fabulous images","review":"I've had this lens for three years. It takes absolutely wonderful portraits. If you want to see someone as you have never seen them before, take a full frame portrait shot of them using a Canon 10D or 20D with this lens. Gorgeous.The lens rounds out such shots just slightly and really enhances facial features. The effect is almost like a very mild fisheye. I have used this to create some of the most compelling captures of the human range of facial expressions that I've ever taken.Highly recommended product. Stunning clarity. John Kahrs was wrong in his review.

Perhaps the microphones were placed too far away. Perhaps they were too sensitive and affected by the passage of circulating air. They definitely should have had better isolation from the environment (by using foam covers?). There also seems to be some rumble from the recording machinery or passing traffic. Too bad, -such nice music, and it is a shame to have it spoiled. The King's College Choir needs a better recording company.

There's a nice mix of familiar carols with a few not-so, and my only complaint is I'd like more of them; it's a relatively short cd. No matter.

What I don't like about this book is that it seems to undermine the process of going to the potty by repeating the message that 'i don't think i can go now' or 'i don't feel like it' [paraphrasing, not direct quotes]. the kids also seem to find this minimally interesting compared with the sesame street potty book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great...","review":"My almost-two year old son absolutely loves this book. He loves the illustrations, the flaps, etc. He has also already shown interest in going to the bathroom on the toilet and has gone \\"#1\\" and #2\\" quite a few times - although we are not actively potty training him or trying to get him out of his diapers (he's a bit early for that). (Note: I don't think his early interest in the potty has anything to do with the book.)I, on the other hand, am not too crazy about the actual story. The rhyming is a bit abrupt in some places and almost forced. I also think the story focuses too much on the obstacles. Of course, toddlers aren't going to be potty trained the first time they sit on their potty. However, I think that spending so much of the book focusing on the struggles is a bit confusing for little ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"This book is just ok. My 21 month old doesn't seem very interested in it even though I thought she would love the super cool flaps. I'm not really crazy about the story line either.

It does the job though and gets them thinking about the potty, but it is not ideal to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, daughter LOVES it. Therefore, I love it.","review":"Things not-so-great about this book:1. The flaps, unlike other katz books, are all the same size as the page. A disappointment.2. Like other posters have noted, it's an inane best story- the child in it spends the first part of the book saying things like \\"I'm not ready yet\\" \\"I want go run and play instead\\" and then is magically potty trained at the end. So, I go off-script a fair bit when reading.One thing outweighing all negative things:My 20 month old daughter inexplicably LOVES this book. In the month we've had it, it's become her #1 favorite book, and she's 180'd from not wanting to get anywhere near a potty of any kind to being genuinely interseted in using one, talking about pee, and bringing me this book and insisting she sits on her potty while I read it.So, it's a winner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan and neither is my daughter","review":"I completely agree with other reviewers that this book is contradictory and confusing.

However, this book was a big disappointment. Instead of teaching the child how to use the potty, the story contradicts using the potty. The child in the book spends most of the time rejecting the potty. This book basically confused my child and I stop reading it. The illustrations are great, but the story indicates that this particular child is not ready to use the potty. The lack of encouragement and motivation of potty training in this story is not great at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I SURE HOPE IT WORKS!","review":"Well we have a two year old that we are hoping to get potty trained very soon. He has his own potty...he knows how to sit on it and what it's used for. Now it's all about getting him to know when to use it. Karen Katz has been putting out wonderful books for babies and toddlers for so long that she was the natural choice when we were looking for a fun book to read about potty training.With interactive gatefold flaps, this book addresses the perennial toddler issue of potty training. In a very realistic, child-appealing text, it describes how a gender-neutral toddler struggles to learn how to use the potty. As with her other books Karen has illustrated this lift the flap book with fun, colorful pictures that kids relate so well to. My son really gets a kick out of seeing the child sitting on the potty. Hopefully it will payoff very soon.

This one looked good, but I ended up not using it. In the book the child trys it but decides not to use it, he wants to play instead. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but we were having an intensive training day in which not using the potty wasn't really an option. The overall message of the book was good, but we aren't even showing it to our daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost the same as another book-buy the other","review":"Our son really loved Karen's \\"Toes, Ears and Nose\\" and although I was disappointed with the text in some of the manners books she wrote, I thought I would give this a try.

I was extemely shocked when we read this and, low and behold- the words in this book are almost exactly like the other book!

This seems to fit the bill. It has a clear message with nice pictures but doesn't specifically talk about (or show) poop. It's a sweet story that is encouraging but allows for mistakes (the child has an \\"accident,\\" but does better the next time).

It does rhyme and that's good but it has too many negatives in the wording. Instead of encouraging use of the potty it talks about not being ready and not wanting to go. That is the opposite messaage I want from a potty book. It doesn't describe what the potty is for or get you excited to use it at all. Then it jumps to playing outside and wetting your pants. Then jumps to bedtime and wearing a diaper which I found confusing. I think it could do a better job of explaining the process and why we need to go in the potty and not our pants. It also could explain the other aspects of potty training better, such as wearing underwear, wiping, flushing, hand washing etc.., Overall I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"my kid loves it!","review":"I introduced this book to my daughter at a year and a half with her own little potty. She has always loved books so this was an easy choice for me.

The pages are the thickness of cardstock. This book lasted one week before my 2 year old son tore a page out. The flaps are not your typical \\"lift the flap\\". Rather, the pages fold out (think magazine centerfold). My son likes the fold out feature; but again, it's just not durable enough for a toddler who is anxious to flip through the book. Also, the flaps aren't cut to the proper size; so when they are folded back into the book, if not placed perfectly, the book gets \\"bound up\\". I recommend you get a sturdy board book. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are MUCH better books avaliable!","review":"When I first brought this book home for my daughter, she liked it. The pictures are simple and the text is pretty straightforward. Two days later, it was already gathering dust, and my daughter reads most of her books until even our neighbors have them memorized! There are SO many potty books avaliable, and this one just isn't up to par. I obviously saw some value to it, I bought it; but this book lacks \\"substance\\". I know what you're thinking, \\"it's a toddler book about going potty\\", but this book reads like assembly instructions and even I can't tell if the main character is a girl or a boy. \\"My Big Girl Potty\\" by Joanna Cole is a FAR better book, and I believe that there is also a version for boys. The story actually makes my daughter want to go on the potty, or at least give it a try.

The 2nd Quartet ranges from the fast pace & danceable 1st moment to the slow & beautiful 3rd movement which almost brings tears to my eyes. I agree with the other review in regards on the 1st Quartet, this was on the boring side. But after years of being a Phillip Glass fan (Einstein of the Beach & Koyanisqatsi) before he made it famous & now just writes carbon copies of a certain single sad rift (Naqoyqatsi), Micheal Nyman does a better job (The Piano & Songbook with Ute Lemper) & only once did I not like a CD (6 Days 6 Nights). Micheal Nyman explores more emotions & has a more expansive instrumentation than Phillip Glass. Do listen to the samples in the Window Media & Real One Players, they focus on the best part of the CD, & if you like them, the 2nd Quartet is worth the price of the whole CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably dull","review":"I bought this CD with an open mind, and very little exposure to Nyman's music. After listening to it twice, I began to fear that prolonged exposure to this music would cause higher brain functions to cease permanently. I put the CD back on the rack, where it gathers dust to this very day.With some satisfaction, I see that the novelty of Nyman's music has worn off. No wonder --- everyone who liked his music must be in a coma by now.This music is mind-numbingly repetitive and not particularly original. I suspect that Nyman wants to be Philip Glass in the worst way...and he may very well have succeeded. He does indeed appear to be Philip Glass in the worst way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Sound","review":"This group has always been a joy to listen to--their unique arrangements and a capella stye can be mesmerizing.

If you want great music by Take 6, please buy their first album or even their second album. After that every album gets worse and worse.

This new album, full of Christmas classics that the guys have taken and made there own is again a masterpiece. Sending out the message of Christ and the meaning of Christmas. Whilst in my estimation not as enjoyable as their previous Christmas offering, my enjoyment was only marginally less. Notable songs on this album amongst others are Go Tell It On The Mountain featuring the wives of three of the guys and Joy To The World - an arrangement that has left a number of my musical peers and myself speechless!

To read it you must be more than familiar with probability theory, and at ease with going through rather tedious calculations and using mathlab. Yet all a sophisticated reader finds here is technical sloppiness and absence of fresh ideas.I am giving it two stars rather than one because it could provide some probability theory buff with a nice set of \\"real life\\" applications -- good as an auxiliary text book for an undergraduate probability class e.g. Apart from that, you will find a better puzzle book almost anywhere you look."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Those Tired of the Same Old Christmas Music.............","review":"Now, I do wonder a bit about whether or not these are all Christmas songs.

James Dobson's reading of his own words is a poignant description of the journey he and his father make towards the end of their relationship. As with many aspects of life, golf and this journey reflect upon each other. The goals on the course mirror those in life; balance, harmony, relaxation while trying to achieve important goals. James Dobson narrates this journey, on and off the golf course, with compassion and humor. It has helped me in my thoughts about both golf and my father.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but not really worth the price","review":"The Networking Essentials Flashcards is a nice little resource to have, especially the poster-size crib-sheet, but it's not really worth the money.Buy a stack of white, index cards at the drugstore for $1.50, and make up your own set of flashcards.

Unfortuately, radio stations have yet to get the ETA bug. I personally do not get it. It blows my mind that radio stations will not get behind this band. If they did, then the request lines would light up constantly.In addition to the great CD, these guys are even better live. I saw these guys play twice in DC and I was floored. You would think that these guys have been playing together for years and years. They are definitely ready to play in front of thousands at big stadiums.That is the one thing that these guys need to do more of, which is tour. They've toured with STP, Tonic, Vertical Horizon, and others, but not to the extent of other bands.BUY THIS CD.

It's filled with empowering advice from the perspective that children actually grow through the challenges; without obstacles to overcome, their emotional muscles weaken and atrophy. Not that we want to make them have a challenged-filled life and not that we don't guide them through these challenges. But children benefit from not having their parents rush in and make everything better all the time. This, however, is not always easy for parents who want the best for their children. \\"Blessings\\" helps parents deal with their own guilt over seeing their child struggle. While they do mention the Torah (the first 5 books of the Old Testament) a few times, this book is not filled with biblical references. I am not Jewish, nor any practicing religion and I found the advice here very helpful. It's a very interesting and quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common Sense We All Forgot","review":"Written by a psychiatrist who was frustrated by the answers she found in the medical books, this book reminds me of things that are so easy to forget.

It is about wisdom our great-grandparents knew but that we, in our technology-driven, everyone is special, achievement oriented society, have lost.The book is easy to read without being cartoony like other parenting books. It is organized perfectly into chapters that include a few examples and instructions without being listy or bossy.I have a two-year-old and I am starting to glimpse the difference between my expectations of what my daughter is supposed to become and what her personality is.This book is reminding me that children are not things to be molded but are people to be unfolded.

To be honest I was expecting a lot. I really enjoy the line of music glogal underground has been puting out. However, this cd reminds of the goa trance I have from 4 years ago. If you want some real music go and get Oaknefold's Resident, Seb Fontaine's Prototype, or Gatecrasher Wet. I could think of 20 cd's I would listen to before ever putting this one in my radion again.

In all fairness, it is possible that those tracks work very well in a club environment but at home on my discman they just sound monotonous. The rest of CD1 is fine but nothing to write home about. All in all, I find Dave Seaman's track selections to be much better; just check out Seaman's Renaissance CDs and his GU012.

(I'm OK with that.) When I ordered, I kind of wished that it had the taller legs, like the Bayou Classic SP50. But it turns out it didn't really matter. When it was set up with a 35-qt stockpot, it was the perfect height for him to watch while sitting in a patio chair out on the porch.The stainless steel hose and the connectors all seem to work correctly. I didn't measure the hose length (I read some other reviews that said theirs was less than 48\\"), but it's perfectly sufficient for reaching a propane tank, and really, what more is needed of it?

When I contacted Bayou Classic on 12/13/12 and requested a replacement hose, they informed me that they don't make a 48\\" braided hose nor have they ever. In fact, they had never heard of anyone reporting a complaint for a 48\\" braided hose and instructed me to return the product. The End.

Works great, but be sure to burn off the paint before using the unit. The paint is to make it look nice and to keep it from rusting before use. All paints will burn off at these high temperatures so expect it.I had to call the company to make sure I got the 20 lb. regulator because the hose came with a 1/4\\" male orifice connector and not the 3/8\\" flared fitting shown in the pictures and on the box. The company said it has two different hose assemblies and that the regulator is indeed the high 20 lb. one. Still I am not sure the smaller 1/4\\" hose end will not reduce the btus of the unit.

I don't like the odors and I don't want oil/grease in the house. We don't have a big outdoor vented hood in the kitchen. Now I'm able to fry outdoors much of the year.It's a very simple unit.It's light-weight and very portable. The propane tank weighs far more that the cooker.I use the cooker for wok cooking. Although I have a very good gas kitchen stove, none of the burners give off nearly as much heat as this Bayou cooker.

First time the cooker had 4 gallons of water at a rolling boil in 20 minutes. Could have been faster had I opened the valve further. Second time I brought 5 gallons to a rolling boil in 25 minutes and all the cooking was done on schedule.Great little burner but the paint does burn off after the first use.

The instructions say to use screws (which aren't included) but the spring does the same job. Another thing to be aware of is the type of propane tank you have.

Second use was boiling water for yeast harvesting, this was done on a breezy day without ever losing the flame.Only recommendation is on initial burn to burn the paint off, have a stockpot with some water on top also. The stockpot disburses the flame so the outer edges get the burn off also.

My husband loved how easy it was to adjust the flame--with just a minimal touch. It fit our 32 qt stainless steel pot pretty well, but it is sitting on top, so if it would get bumped it would slip right off. (have seen some propane cookers that have a \\"lip\\" and the pot fits into it for a little more security. We will see if we want to add some side supports later.

It does a boil fine at 212 degrees but the lowest i can really get it without the flame going out is about 180 degrees.

I moved up to full boils and my home stove doesn't have the oomph to get a good rolling boil in a 5 gallon load. The SP10 definitely does! It sounds like a jet at full power. Once the load is hot, you can throttle it back to a rolling boil very nicely with the valve. Despite this, I got my first boil over out of ~10 batches with this thing because I didn't pay enough attention - be forewarned. It has a solid base, is small enough to store easily and functions well. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is that it's a bother to light the thing. I don't know how to make it better, but basically I open the gas slightly, strike a match and chuck the burning match at the burner. Next time, I'll grab one of those butane candle lighters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Burner","review":"This burner is one of the sturdiest I have seen.

There is no excuse for a mistake of this magnitude, so I can only assume that ADV must have done it intentionally, perhaps because one of the characters is a bit androgynous looking.I have all of the original Japanese volumes of Tactics and was looking forward to buying the English translation as well, but I can't support a company that makes such serious translation errors. Nor a company that so blatantly ignores and looks down on its fanbase by assuming that no one would notice such an error."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinarily Real!!","review":"This is an incredable little book on the \\"magic\\" of other lands.

I am one of those that believe that what is narrated is \\"real\\" - is just that is in that other realm of \\"other ways of knowing\\". I constanly quote it and suggest it as reading for others. It is an eye and mind opener. It is a book that challenges our \\"Western\\" ways of knowing. It is a book that easily can be denied as true, but if one has read other books impossible to believe or has had similar \\"weird\\" experiences in life, then it has that intuition that it might be true and it can then be accept it as patentable possible.I highly recommend it to anyone, you will be surprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my outlook","review":"This book made me a better person and I have to promote it because of that fact.

She is described as an intelligent young woman, but she doesn't behave as such. She knows quite well the customs of her tribe, but in the 1st chapter behaves in a way that is certain to end tragically for someone she loves. She never acknowledges her part in the results.Then she is captured and taken to the seraglio, where she clearly understands what's up, but continues to behave in a naive or foolish way. Her behaviour and the forebearance of her captor are both completely unbelievable.I like Jane Feather, and it is very rare for me to set a book aside after reading the first chapter or two. I hung on for 124 pages, but finally just realized I didn't want to spend more time with this idiot Sarita. Sorry, Jane!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree....BORING!","review":"The only thing good about this book was the very first chapter and because of that chapter, I thought the book was going to be a page turner.

Despite repeated requests to have it replaced noone will take responsibility. The Bible comes with instructions to not put in loose peices of paper because the binding might be compromised which tells me that the manufacturers are aware of the problem. So if you are looking for a Bible that you can use everyday and one day pass down to your daughter, this is not it. The Bible itself is a wonderful translation and the devotions and insprational pages are lovely so I am very sad that I have had to go over to using another Bible.

If you want your first projector for the house, for family or use at weddings and get togethers, even to use as a home theater, I would highly recommend it. I would also recommed buying it on Amazon from Graham & Graham, as they were fantastic to work with and gave me a level of customer service and a genuine concern for my needs that surpassed the service I have received from the major chains after purchasing products that were much more expensive.

It is real rock n roll!!!! The BoDeans are one of the most criminally ignored bands in the history of music, along with The Del Lords, The Michael Stanley Band, Pavlov's Dog, Donnie Iris and the Cruisers, The Rockets, etc. I've been a fan of the band since the first album and with each release I thought that \\"This is the one that will break them into the national spotlight.\\", but it hasn't happened yet. This recording, along with their other live recording \\"Joe Dirt Car\\", shows the band at their best, live and rockin'. Get this CD and hear what great music sounds like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Let me start off by saying that the BoDeans are one of my Top 5 favorite bands of all time. Joe Dirt Car was my introduction to the BoDeans and I was immediately hooked. I've seen them live at the Basilica Block Party in Minneapolis and they rocked the house.First off, why would they even put out this album? Most of the songs (12 of 18?) are already on Joe Dirt Car (a previous live album). Second, the versions of the songs on this album blow chunks. The tempo/BPM of the songs is WAY WAY to fast. It sounds like the are rushing to get through the songs. Plus, the songs are uninspired and devoid of emotion.Even though I love the BoDeans, I hated the songs on the first (of two) albums that I almost hit the skip button on the media player. The only song worth a listen on this double album is Fadeaway. They did a GREAT job on that one.Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the nice reviews!","review":"Hi, as one of the actors in this small film, I really appreciate the kind words about it. The screenplay by Beth Henley was very funny, infact, in it's original form, the script was a laugh riot. Somehow, either by cost cutting or by director and editing cuts the film was whittled down to a quirky romance, with a lot of the comedy missing. It's still a sweet and funny film. So buy it or rent it, but if you like quirky characters, you'll like this film. -Dean Ricca"},{"rating":"2","title":"High level of maturity needed absolutely. Great movie!","review":"Most people won't understand the heartbreak of being pregnant and abandoned. I never see any movies that try to deal with this type of personal tragedy. If you can imagine the pain that Rosanna Arquette's character is dealing with, you can enjoy this movie. The pain of giving a child up must be severe. This poor girl has no one to talk to but brainless idiots and a friend who tries to understand. Did she grow up with no one to care for her? The father of the child marries some rich girl while Arquette's character is still pregnant. OUCH! This type of heartache is something that young women should make it their business to avoid. Watch it and learn. Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding !","review":"Outstanding screenplay, direction, acting, and musical score. I have watched this film several times, it is an amazing feel good romantic drama/comedy (more drama than comedy, but very quirky and funny in many spots). Rosanna Arquette shines in this film as our hero seeking love, and escape from her small hometown, perhaps more importantly her character seeks to find her inner self. I wish they would have released a soundtrack CD for this film, or perhaps now they could at least distribute it as download as digital music (hoping). I give this film five stars as a romance drama-comedy, but of course it is drama, and independent film, so do not expect huge budget special effects. The film is shot in the New Mexico/Arizona region, with some nice backdrops. Note: The Amazon description of the DVD here says it is 1.33:1 (4:3 TV mode), but I already purchased two copies and the DVD includes both 1.33:1 as well as widescreen mode (which I have viewed off the DVD)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and adorable!","review":"I saw this movie late one night as it was offered on netflix's streaming to computer option and I instantly fell in love with it! It's a romantic comedy but as it was made in 1986 it has such a different, in some ways more authentic feel to it versus the more modern \\"rom-coms\\". I instantly fell in love with the leads and I just had to own the DvD myself.As a 22 year old female that isn't too fond over the over the top predictable romantic type comedies coming out these days, this movie was refreshing and genuinely funny.

This CD is pure class!! The sexuality that is portrayed in the songs is not overdone and crass. It is enticing and tastefully done. The variety of music on any M.C. CD is sure to please, and this disc is no different. These guys are new-jack R&B at its best, and sets a high standard for other bands to aspire to.

Mint Condition seems to be taking the generic hip-hop route that many other R&B bands are selling out to. Gone are the salsy interludes that show just how well this band can jam--they are replaced with electronic hip-hop loops. A handful of the songs retain Mint's original groove, but the majority attempt to break into the mainstream by emulating music that's been prooven to sell records..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented musicians, disappointing recording.","review":"Chops, chops, chops. While I've always respected M.C.s talent, I've often been let down by the quality of their music. This CD is no exception. In fact, I'd say they've taken a step backward from a songwriting perspective. \\"If you love me\\" hardly holds a candle to \\"Pretty Brown Eyes\\" or \\"What kind of Man would I be\\". And like their previous works, the other songs seem to be little more than filler, a band displaying great talent and potential, but lacking a certain something, a certain FIRE, that makes for a memorable music performance. Maybe they need to change their line-up, simplify the music, or just play jazz or something, but an R&B act this loaded with talent should be able to put out a better effort than this...WITHOUT SELLING OUT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mintcondition the most underated band in the world","review":"Mintcondition has done it again.

This is an excellent album that, sadly, will never be played on Country radio nowadays. My only complaint (and the thing that's keeping it from a 5 star rating) is that Hank III at times sounds so much like Wayne \\"The Train\\" Hancock that it's scary! Admittedly, Mr. Hancock has borrowed heavily from Hank Sr., as has the latter's grandson. Hancock is also starting to get much more heavily into Texas Swing music on his own 3rd CD. Hank III's album eerily recreates the sound of WH's first 2 albums here, although he does just plain flat out rock more of the two (and uses a drummer full-time - something Hancock does not). Ultimately, the voices of these two sound very similar - and the comparisons will NOT be unaided by the fact that Hank III does 3 Hancock songs on this debut CD, plus thanks WH in the liner notes.

He borrows from the best of both Pa and Grandpa, and evolves with his own touch and style on top of that.(AND he sounds and looks like his Gramps) Sure he only wrote a few of the songs on this CD(I'm sure there's more to come!) but that's more than any other country artist these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrying on a Family Tradition....Hank III does it his way!","review":"I wasn't around when Hank Jr. lived in the shadow of his famous father by singing his songs and everyone told him, \\"You ain't as good as your daddy was\\", and I was only 5 when he cut the landmark album, \\"Hank Williams, Jr and Friends\\", which took Jr. on to success in his own right. When I first bought this album I was expecting a Hank Jr. flavored CD. Much the was Hank Jr's early albums had the same sound as Hank Sr. When I heard it I was over whelmed. The only way in which Hank III carries on the family tradition is....he also is a musician. Now we have three generation of Williams' with THREE DIFFERENT SOUNDS. This album is a must for all country music fans especially traditional country fans. Edgy yes...but wasn't Hank Sr. and Hank Jr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album Stinks","review":"Hank III has done nothing but prove what a whiner he is by trashing other artists. I have not heard one song on here that suggests any artistic ability. This guy needs to clean up his mouth and worry about himself instead of trashing others."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's a family tradition","review":"for hank III it's a great start .i'll be keeping a eye out for any concerts with hank III. i'm sure HANK JR. proud of his son just the way hank sr. would be his son"},{"rating":"2","title":"Country the way It's meant to be.","review":"After seeing Rolling Stones review of Hank III debut album I couldnt wait to get my hands on some real down home honky tonk, and I wasn't disappointed. I'm urging anyone who is disgustingly tired of Nashville's pop/country, swing on a rope garbage to go out and buy this immediately. But then again if you think Garth and Shania are great artists, stay away. This has substance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best country cd in recent years...","review":"I've seen Hank live a few times and lemme tell you, if you have the chance, go see him!!!This album is wonderful. Hank sings like his grandfather and is a lot more old school than his father. The songs on RISIN' OUTLAW are real heart-felt country music. In these dark dark days for country music, the album shines a bright light on what the future of country is going to be.In short, just buy this album because Hank is the kinda guy we SHOULD be supporting more, and less of Toby Keith and those other tools on CMT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional Country Music Fan","review":"In my opinion, Hank III is just as wonderful as his grandaddy!!! He has the traditional country sound of fiddles (which seems rare nowadays), and that absolutely wonderful wail!! Every song on this album is great, he's destined to be a HUGE star!! He's got a lot of his grandaddy in him and a little of his dad, plus his own style all mixed in together. It's absolutely great!!!!! I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the real traditional country sound!! It's GREAT!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music really IS in his blood...","review":"Hard to believe that Hank III released this debut CD TEN years ago. Harder to believe that he has not made a bigger splash in the commercial country/rock music business than he has. While none of the 13 songs on here has the staying power of his father's rowdy hits or his grandfather's broken-hearted ballads, Hank III demonstrates that he is a class performer, with good instincts for picking material. Young Hank only contributed to the writing of four of these tracks, but all are interesting enough to reward frequently repeated play. This is my first purchase of a Hank III solo disc, but I also greatly enjoy the collaboration \\"Three Hanks\\" which features his dad, Hank Jr. and via the wonders of technology, Hank Sr. doing a bunch of grandpa's lesser-known songs, and doing them very well. I can't predict Hank III's recording and performing future, but if he does not achieve a long and prosperous career, I would be quite surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"about time,musics gets its edge back!!","review":"Finally,someone whos not afraid to say what he wants and sing what they feel comfortable with,and at the same time reminding those in high places that the artist really knows what the hell is going on with the fans.A singer/songwriter,who like his daddy and granddaddy before him blazes his own trail while not forgettin what it cost for him to be able to do this,and who isnt living off his daddys name,but who is kicking down his own doors and being heard and in my opion should be taken very seriuos,this cd only scratches the surface,of what shelton is doing and is capable of,highly recommend buy the cd,and or see him concert,you wont be sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor aid for mastering French","review":"This is one of the useless tool for learing French. It does not do anything that it is said to learners of French. The sound files are very poor and speakers talk the way only fluent people can understand it.

The denouement finally comes in the last pages and she rushes it in a few paragraphs. It is a labor to read because of the dull writing and lack of imagination. Many issues are totally unbelievable. For example we are expected to believe that a woman running a castle in her 20s does not understand the loss of virginity! Lamb adds an elephabt to the story who adds nothing to the storyline. She creates characters that are mentioned a lot and then have no real role in the storyline. Time is precious.

The style of music, though released in 1987 is still rather current. The lyrics and music are quite intro-spective and \\"deep\\".

I believe it is also her best because you cannot make better album than this is. Not even Keith Green's \\"For Him Who Has Ears to Hear\\" or Petra's \\"Beyond Belief\\" is as good as this album. No Amy Grant's \\"Lead Me On\\" or Larry Norman's \\"Only Visiting This Planet\\". This is it - the best album of CCM - let the critics say what they want. Every track is just great moody Christian music. Every track is a classic. At first when I saw this album at top100 CCM list - I thought - what is that? Well, I heard the song \\"River of Love\\" and I decided to buy the whole album. Now - it is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard.Stars: Down, The Turning, Libera Me, River of Love"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Illustrations","review":"Purchased this book for my four year old granddaughter.

The sound quality was better than the Philips but I can't wear them for more than 30 minutes at a time. I can wear the HS500's for hours on end and no discomfort.Though the sound is great, if you can't wear them, what good are they!I'll gladly stay with my HS500, which are now extremely inexpensive..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect!","review":"bought these super cheap since they are discontinued. the sound is pretty great, very good actually. the only flaw is the flimsy plastic neckband. my neckband snapped after a year of regular use(exercise). the store i purchased them from no longer had any stock. i shopped around and purchased some sennheiser pmx60/pmx200, skullcandy lowriders, and a variety of other 75.00 and under headphones, nothing compared to the logitechs, at all. i ordered 3 pairs of of the logitech identity's here on amazon for under 20.00 shipped. the only other worthy headphones i wanted to try but did not were the sennheiser px100/pmx100, and the koss porta pro/sporta pro. i actually did order a pair of koss porta pro's just the other day based on their rave reviews and lifetime warranty. the logitechs are still excellent in my opinion and hard to beat, especially at a couple bucks a pair. with careful use they could last a longtime i think... the sound is great though, nice tight bass but not overpowering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price","review":"I bought these a few months ago and they have held up well. The sound is amazing for how cheap they are, definitely the best pair of headphones I've tried for under $75.I like the way the headphones look, but the way they sit on my ears pushes out the top of my ears, making me look kinda goofy. Also the way they rest on my ears they're never in the optimal position to get the most out of the speakers, but its not uncomfortable.I highly recommend these if you are looking for cheap headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"got suckered into buying something pretty again","review":"it looks nice in its retail packaging, and i own some other products such as two webcams, and mouse and others from logitech, so I bought myself this headphone. Its personal preference, but I do not like how it doesn't sit on the ear but instead your head is squeezed between it. it feels like it is going to fall when I wear it, so i can't imagine listening to my mp3 with this headphone on the bus or something. the changing the color plate does sound kind of cool though, but the around the head piece of plastic is not the comfortable. finally, yes it does look good, and works alright, but comfort wise, i'm gonna stick with my sony single U above my head type headphone that doesn't leave my ear hurting after just one song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle Giant at their best","review":"I agree with the reviewer below. Other than a couple of the really early - and rare - tracks from 1970 on CD 1, and the home demo on CD 2, the sound quality and playing on the rest of this set - from 1973, 1974 and 1975, are superb. In addition to most of their studio work, I have Playing the Fool and the KBFH live CD, and these live sets are better. The BBC studio captured Gentle Giant in a perfect setting, playing with stunning precision. In fact it's hard to believe that recordings that sound this good were made back in 73-75, much less live in the studio. My personal favorite track is \\"Aspirations\\" which is IMHO better than the studio version on \\"The Power and the Glory\\". The drums towards the end are in my living room. Free Hand is also the best version I have heard.I am always upgrading my sound system, and this recording is one that I use as a refererence for sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"An inferior hodgepodge","review":"This double CD contains what seem to be inferior alternate takes on many Giant classics. Overpriced too -- for a couple of dollars more you can own, for example, Octopus and Playing the Fool -- a vastly superior sampling of the band's work. True -- at the moment this collection is the only way to obtain some of the cuts from Giant's best album, In A Glass House, but the versions of The Runaway and Way of Life here are simply not as good as the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be Good","review":"This sounds like a wonderful idea for a garden glove.Since no size range is given,I imagine these are the teensy,dainty size gloves that women are SUPPOSED to wear.What about those of us who have large hands,yet are not men??????"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential Introduction","review":"This is an excellent companion to Pound. Anyone who has tried to crack Pound knows it is difficult going with all of his allusions and his affinities for retelling stories of old troubadors, etc. Froula gives the context for the New Directions edition of Pound's Selected Poems and has informative notes on many words, phrases, and lines that contain more meaning than is possible to grasp otherwise, even after several readings. I consider this a must read for getting acquainted with the various projects of Pound's early poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancehall","review":"I really enjoyed the book.

I never forgot it, because it had that same fun feeling as Monty Python's Flying Circus, and Mel Brooks films.The humor is broad, and Dudley Moore is just terrific in three roles.

I guess it's my own fault for overlooking the regional restrictions on DVDs but it is irritating.Do I blame Amazon? I suppose not since I should have figured this out myself but anyone else (who don't purchase stuff on the internet very frequently) should consider this before buying DVDs from North America if you don't live there. My main reason for buying is that it's very difficult to get this video any more and I had a nostalgic wish to see Peter Cook and Dudley Moore in what I think is a very funny takeoff on Sherlock Holmes (incidently I also love reading the original Conan Doyle books).So I am not complaining - just a bit frustrated- that's all"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!

This CD, however, is simply awful, and is devoid of melody, harmony, impressionism--anything musical, no matter how far you stretch the definition.

Don't waste your money on this crap and get their albums from the 90s....much better.Scott is one of my favorite players, but this is just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately disappointing output from great musicians","review":"With this album it seems that Tribal Tech have decided to settle into the chair they claimed with their previous release \\"Thick\\" - that of great band in waiting.Whilst their earlier releases had both great playing and superbly structured songs, they have decided to eschew this approach for a more improvisational approach. Unfortunately, as talented as they are (and they are amongst the greatest musicians currently on this planet), even Miles Davis needed a set structure to improvise from. The album starts off strong, but quickly sinks into a musical morass from which it never recovers.If you want to hear truely great playing, then check out some of their earlier releases, from their first \\"Spears\\", through to 1995's \\"Reality Check\\", music doesn't get much better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it if you like to HEAR jokes told !","review":"See my review of Volume 1; sound quality simply unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddles, not analogies","review":"This book presents far more word games than analogies--the relationships between the words presented are too often not the type seen in the SCAT test, or the \\"old\\" SAT.

I have taken (and scored very well on) many tests with analogies and studied and prepared my daughter for the SCAT, and was hoping this book would be useful for my son. I was ready to throw it across the room.

There are some pretty cool mods and scenerios added here. The actual gameplay for the basic game doesn't seem to have changed much.

There are the usual new leader and units provided as you would expect in a Civ upgrade, but there are many more enhancements. Spying is completely revamped and there are now Corporations to be built, which are similar in nature to religions in gameplay. Through corporate expansion, you can give a city a needed boost, at the expense of gold. Each country now gets a unique building enhancement in addition to a unique unit. The AI of the computer is a lot smarter than in the original game too, so watch out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great upgrade","review":"This is a great upgrade for Civilization IV.

It seems to me that knowing the gender of the child would be the least important factor in selecting a book on learning how to play an instrument.

Okay, I don't think it's fair to jump to conclusions that Tammy and her family had anything to do with the changes in her story that the film makers made. They always take true stories and make changes and the story always comes out loosely based on the true stories so it may be possible that the Maidas didn't even know that the movie was going to not tell the full story and honestly I really I don't give a fig that the movie isn't 100% faithful to the actual story about Tammy!

The were over $100.00. I returned them when I checked Amazon for a price comparison and it was half the price with free shipping. Now about these shoes. I work on my feet 12 hours at a time and although my legs get tired, they dont ache like the did with another shoe. I would purchase them again and would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"DMX FlowPak just a lump of air under my foot.","review":"I've worn Rockport ProWalkers for at least ten years. A week ago I bought the new Astride ProWalker with the DMX FlowPak technology. While they felt okay in the store, after wearing them for a few hours my feet began to hurt where the DMX FlowPak is located (just below the balls of my feet). I've worn these shoes for a week now and they continue to hurt my feet. This \\"revolutionary\\" DMX FlowPak is nothing but an air pouch in the sole of the shoe. Nothing about it \\"flows\\" as I walk. These are the most uncomforable ProWalkers I've ever owned. I'm going to try to return these shoes, but my shoe store has a no return policy. I've contacted Rockport customer service. We'll see what type of response I get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely uncomfortable and sloppy construction","review":"I've had four pairs of Rockport before and always loved them.The sole insert they put in these shoes has a big piece of plastic glued to the bottom of it. That's their \\"DMX Dynamic Suspension\\", that they say is made by Reebok. So I'm sure any shoe made by Reebok with this DMX junk hunk of plastic must be just as uncomfortable. They were also put together kind of sloppy with glue showing and \\"sealer\\" missing is spots, so how could they be waterproof?I would give them a zero if possible.I returned these awful shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful design, horrible calibration.","review":"This is a great looking thermometer. The case, dial, etc. are all top notch and worthy of design awards. The actual performance of the thermometer is an entirely different matter, however. It seems to be fairly accurate up to about 60 degrees, but after that it seems to add about 10% to 20% to the actual air temperature, regardless of where it is placed. Case in point: on a cloudy day in the low 80's, the themometer read anywhere between 108 and 114 for six hours straight. It was shaded from any direct sun and was in an area that had great airflow, so my only explanation is that it was very poorly calibrated. I think the minimum and maximum tracking needles on this unit would have been very useful, so I'm disappointed that it did not work and I had to return it.Obviously my experience is only a sample of one, so factor it in with caution, but there certainly did not seem to be any manufacturing defects with the unit I received."},{"rating":"1","title":"good grief! torke's music is so tedious and wearisome and..","review":"...utterly boring -- why is this fellow such a success as a composer? this is music for morons. how long can torke keep his career going writing the same old sludge he's been churning out for more than a decade?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of inconsistencies and errors","review":"How in the know is Leamer?

The fact that this book 'EXPOSES' the private moments of some of the country stars really angered me. I am also an author of country music and I too, had a lot of inside information on the private lives of the country stars!

Things get ugly when the mafia declares an all-out turf war on their rival, a Latino drug king. I don't want to say this movie was poorly made because it wasn't. It's just that maybe it would have benefited from a bit of fine-tuning. The movie in itself is decent except the plot becomes too convoluted for its own good, and the narrative becomes garbled. Consider, for instance, a scene where the detective is fighting a street battle and then the movie instantly cuts to a scene of him making love to his girlfriend. I guess that symbolized the fact that the man was looking for transcendence or something from all the violence, but that sequence, and the movie as a whole, could have profited from a just a smidgen of subtlety."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard for a four year old to use","review":"thread included in the packaging was too flimsey. bracelet broke right away. needle was hard to use. hard to thread then hard to pull thru beads. breads were OK, but rest of kit not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"this film will make u sleep...","review":"i was very disapointed when i watch this film,i was using fast-forward all the time and i didn't find any good sex scene..nothing was special here,..i just love to see a beautiful woman who played as the receptionist in the office (i don't know her name) but she didn't do any sex scene or nude scene...save your money,the cover is hotter than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Jacket !!!","review":"Introduction:This jacket is a steal at anything below the retail price.

The acting, directing and production quality was awesome this year, but the writing was absolutely flawless. As a writer of fiction myself, I can tell you that there are very few well-written sci-fi shows out there, but the writing in this series kicks ass! The story line flows logically and secrets are only revealed in small increments at a time, which keeps up the mystery of the characters and of where the writers will eventually take them...Brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fringe is its only competition","review":"I have the entire series, except season 5, which I truely hope is released soon.

Too afraid to send both brothers to Hell or kill one off permanently, and too scared of the public to go with the fact that like 90% of Lucifer's criticisms of his universe's angelic hierarchy were 100% true, he invented a third brother we never heard of before so that we would have a spare floating around. He decided that Kali needed a human to rescue her, even the good gods in other religions are all demons who all like to eat humans, and killed off almost every interesting supporting character except Bobby."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Supernatural Fifth Season\\"","review":"Franks online, is JUNK!!!!

It does start out fairly well IMO but the continued struggle back & forth between Dean & the Angels just seemed to prolong the agony of what needed to be done.. It just kept going back & forth & wasting time w/what they could have been doing. And bringing in the old favorite characters & doing what the writers did, really ticked me off. I think it was definitely a cheap move. Not sure if they had planned a 6th season but why just obliterate all the supporting characters.. It was Stoopid. I collected all of the 1st four seasons but have no intention of owning the 5th & don't have a clue what happened in the 6th. They really should have went out in a blaze of glory instead of jumping the shark. I will remember \\"The Boys\\" fondly & Loved the 4 years of Pure Entertainment they brought...

Season five did well but I kind of knew that since the show would be renewed for a six season that the grand finale was not what Kripke was going to do it felt a little short. One thing I would like to see for either season six or seven is why don't the brother go world wide? Why do they stay on in the states I am sure their are demons in other countries and in other parts of the world.

It's interesting how the roles of Sam and Dean have slowly reversed. Dean the sensitive one? It makes sense, I think he is slowly beginning to understand the normalcy he missed growing up and wants to capture that feeling before the end of the world. Love the finale and how Sam's drinking demon blood is now a good thing. Also liked the humanization of Castille, I think the show is good to make you think about your own humanity and faith.

I read the book and thought it was reasonably well written. However, scientifically there is a BIG problem with this book. The author doesn't refer to her sources, with the exception of an out of print book on mythology by a person named Bankroft. That a white person travelled all over the America's, from the Artic to the Amazon, with his followers before Columbus is scientifically impossible. There is absolutely no scientific evidence to back this up. Moreover, I have been involved in Native American issues for more than 25 years and have never read any of the \\"myths\\" the author recounts in this book. So, people that are seriously interested in Native American history and mythology should skip this book. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is for the wonderful illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOOK, & bIBLE COMPANION.","review":"THIS IS THE BEST HISTORICAL RECORD OF JESUS'S LIFE IN THIS WORLD.

Some concepts get great explanation. Many simple techniques have painstakingly done proofs and then the complicated techniques just get lots of hand-waving or worse...no explanation.If you interested in actually learning some pchem, buy Lionel Raff's new text from Prentice Hall (ISBN: 013027805X).

Inevitably with so much crammed into a single volume some of the chapters lack depth, but it almost always gives a good foundation for further reading on everything from diffraction to colloids, while the thermodynamics chapters provide everything an undergraduate needs to know.

The professors, however, go far beyond the book even in the introductory class. This is not a book that you can just pick up, read, and expect to know anything more about p-chem than you did when finishing general chem. So, read it.

Daren does add since to the fact there is a bully, but it gets aggravating hearing Kyle complain and not do anything to make him stop. The part I liked was when the in they where staying at the Inn and it was on fire. The book Escaping The Giant Wave was an O.K. of a book but I've read better. Over all I think Escaping The Giant Wave was good for third to sixth grade. A really good part of this story was the part where Kyle went in the woods and the second wave hit.

In other words, this album takes good material and ruins it in delivery, by trying to stretch it to their particular style.To conclude: don't buy this album unless you like harmony singers doing cover versions of songs.

A great investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird and wonderful.","review":"This album is definitely not for everyone. I saw the show and loved it (mild understatement) and was thrilled to buy the CD. The Tiger Lillies are creative and free and the music is really good. What could be better than singing along in a weird falsetto voice to a song about the nasty death of some horrid kid? Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Everyone's Cup of Tea","review":"I had previously seen the video of this group's performance. It was quirky and dark and nothing like any \\"Three Penny Opera\\" I'd ever seen before. And I couldn't get it out of my head! It's children's stories with death and dismemberment! Played on toy instruments, catchy little tunes, it was genius to me! I just wish I could have seen this live, I don't know if they even are still performing together, but I'm on the constant lookout for the return tour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a huge Tiger Lillies fan, but was a tad disappointed...","review":"I was introduced to the Tiger Lillies by going to see Shockheaded Peter in the theatre. I LOVED it. I saw it twice. Then I became obsessive about finding out all there is to know about this absolutely fabulous band. I ordered this CD. And I dunno..I was a bit disappointed. It's still good, but I guess it's like seeing the movie after reading the book...it just wasn't as good as seeing it live. It was too polished. And some of the eerie little sound effects between the songs in the play were missing on the soundtrack. I'd have to say that this isn't my favorite CD by them, although it is still rather good, because, after all, it's the Tiger Lillies and they rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well crafted - unusual plot","review":"This novel is written primarily in sexual terms - memories of infidelities, present maritial and extra-maritial sex, and sexual fantasties; if detours here and there to explore death - real and imagined. It explores the relationship between a couple on a cruise ship vacation following the marriage of their daughter - an only child. While that description may not make the book sound interesting, the book is excellent - it has a tightly written plot with unusual relationships between its characters and with surprising twists that provide the insights into the characters' personalities that hold the story together.However, if you've read nothing by Montero, I would suggest either of her other translated books - In the Palm of Darkness or The Messager - as more indicative of her style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"Not much to say about this - it works like it is supposed to.

One reason is that you move your knife perpendicular to the blade edge, as it was ground before you got it.

Try it, you'll like it. But only if you want sharp knives."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent sharpening pad.","review":"I am impressed with the quality and function of these blocks.

I found the first and last movements of the the symphony to be incredible. One thing that Daugherty manages to do is to keep the listner interested. The second, third, and fourth movements lack the interest and excitement contained in the first and last movements, but that is not enough to change my opinion on this particular work. I feel that Bizarro is also a quality work. The thing that I like about Daugherty is that he is not afraid to fuse rock and roll with contemporary music with jazz. It turns out to be one of the most interesting cd's I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"numbingly repetitive...","review":"I came across this disk the other day, and remembered that I'd listened to it once, then put it aside. WHY, I couldn't remember. So I listened to it again. The answer was -- it's pretty bad music.Most of its five movements take moderately interesting ideas, then beat them to death with tedious repetition. Mr Daugherty has apparently never heard of the principle of \\"development\\" -- that one of the things that makes music interesting is that it starts somewhere, goes somewhere, and ends somewhere.I have no objection to a \\"Superman symphony\\" -- composers have based works on less-worthy topics. It's just that I'd prefer to listen to something that doesn't make you feel as if you've been beaten about the head for a half hour. Most of Schoenberg's atonal music is more-appealing and entertaining. Really.If you think hearing metal trash cans being banged around is fun, you'll probably like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Piece of Post Modern Music","review":"I bought this to find out what the orchestra I play in was getting into for a concert last spring. What a great piece of music! Fun to play, fun to listen to. I was a little discouraged to discover that his \\"Dead Elvis\\" (from another CD) was VERY close to \\"Red Cape Tango,\\" but all-in-all, it's still full of interesting ostinati and fun little hooks.I'd love to see Bizarro done on a marching band field, but I know it'll never happen. There's a great interplay in the piece between the horns and percussion that I just scan back and play, scan back and play, scan back and play..."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Williams does it better.","review":"A good title attached to dreadful music. If post modern deconstruction of the superhero \\"ethos\\" - Daugherty's incredibly pompous phrase - is the point, the best is the second Superman movie. I'm sure this music impresses somebody, but by no stretch of the imagination does this piece inspire, mock, enlighten, or sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell is this?","review":"I am serious. What is this? What does this have to do with superman? I don't understand. In the program notes, Daugherty makes no sense in explaining his rationale (or non-rationale) for the structural models of each movement...but I can even see what those explanations have to do with Superman. The music is uninteresting in all aspects, repetitious for no reason, and extremely dull to the ears.-I wonder how much money he got for getting the Baltimore Symphony to play it? I think Daugherty composed this, most definitely using only a sequencer, ...over-orchestrated it, and then stuck on a title, probably from an encyclopedia of pop-culture that sits at his desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corregidor","review":"Excellent read for any one trying to understand the truth of the Battle of Corregidor.As the son of a Corregidor veteran I found this book very helpful to understanding the Battle of Corregidor. My father like, like many veterans, struggled with his experiences at Corregidor and as a P.O.W.

There's nothing origional here; it's a restatement of the works of others with which you're probably already at least partially familiar. At times, the book is tedious and technical but, since the author is pretty much preaching to the choir, that probably doesn't matter too much.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Waiting For","review":"Worth Waiting ForAnother jewel full of original research from Rand Flem-Ath. His first book WHEN THE SKY FELL (a concise classic) was the first in the surge of popular ancient history books and provided a lot of fuel for other books and a lot of food for thought. I enjoyed Wilson and Flem-Ath's friendly style and although radical in many of its ideas the book deftly delivers its points without undue sensationalism or self-aggrandisement on the part of the authors. There is always the sense of being invited along on the journey of discovery and whether its the fascinating account of the lost opportunity to make Giza the location of the prime meridian and possible buried jungle cities or the speculations (and detailed measurements for those who want to examine it themselves) about the 'blueprint' and the evidence of an ancient worldwide grid, THE ATLANTIS BLUEPRINT has been worth waiting for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wading through hodge podge to get to an interesting ending.","review":"This book is an almost absolute waste of time (and money). The cover lists Wilson and Flem-Ath as authors, but it seems like Wilson does most of the writing and that large part of the book is just a bunch of stuff that reads as if it has LITTLE-TO-NO relevance to the topic of the title. In fact, the only interesting part is Rand Flem-Ath's ending to the book. This ending talks about external layers of the earth rapidly sifting around its core to cause a quick planet wide destruction, and is used as a possible mechanism for a catastrophe that wiped out an ancient advanced civilization and almost all of humanity as well.

Some may find it a bit repeatitive and really lacking a continuous development of the themes, but those who appreciate minimalist music will enjoy the cd. MGV is based around driving rhythms throughout the piece, very similar to the music written in the Peter Greenway films for which Nyman is most famous.

However, there is a tendency amongst students who are bogged down on reading cases to pass over this sort of material too quickly, thus getting only a shallow apprehension of the subject. The author notes how words often do double and triple duty such that \\"You may want to join the bar but may be barred if you fail the bar and wind up tending bar or selling candy bars.\\" Page 13. Thus, the author points out a critical feature of legal reasoning: \\"Legal rules characteristically require interpretation, which is an important part of legal reasoning.\\" id. I recommend this book for honing those much needed skills in the practice of law and recommend that it be read slowly, not quickly. I also think a reader should consult Martin P.

No.The one piece here that swings a bit is Bird's \\"Donna Lee\\".If you're into mellow, slow-tempo balads, then this CD is for you.

I first saw him at the Kool Jazz Festival in Philadelphia in 1982 where he got into a cutting contest with Freddie Hubbard, and they blew the roof off the Academy of Music. \\"Sister Cheryl\\" from his first album is one of my all time favorite songs. \\"Hot House Flowers\\" was the very first audio CD I ever bought when I transitioned from vinyl LPs. And I consider his version of \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" on Marsalis Standard Time Vol 2 absolutely transcendent.All that said, I've just listened to \\"Live at the House of Tribes\\" for the third time and am fairly certain that I'll never listen to it again. The music isn't bad, but the audience just ruins it for me. It's like sitting next to a table of drunks who won't shut up.

It is music to the ears and to the soul. It feeds energy and excitement. It carries you to new experiences and levels which are mesmerising. This is what one would expect of the New Mellinnium. Tract six reminds me of the best of the Moody Blues, and I experienced a surge of creative energy that comes only with beauty, love and ecstasy. On My Way ( Tract Nine) compares to Dream Theatre.

I hope she will return to the political realm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not going to change the world, but...","review":"As witty and ironic as we've come to expect from Dowd, this book is a playful little romp through the battle of the sexes that entertains from start to finish.Don't take it too seriously though. Are Men Necessary will keep you amused while you're reading it, but probably won't make a lasting impression - the book lacks a coherent argument or point. Many of the points it does make apply almost exclusively to the elite New York set; broader acceptance of cosmetic surgery aside, most women in their 20s aren't injecting themselves with preventative botox in their lunch hours, for one example.Still, Dowd's style is typically delightful.

I recommend she get therapy instead of putting pen to paper; but she warns us that it isn't a scholarly work (I'd settle for anything adult-like in the book).You are just going to read piles of carefully-screened anecdotes about this crazy idea that men & women are different. Nothing new or insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorbed nonsense","review":"OK, we get it, she's clever.However, Dowd is extremely superficial in her treatise on whether or not men are necessary. Maybe in her conception of feminism (which is that of \\"Me Generation\\" Baby-boomer trash), give-and-take is impossible within the confines of a relationship.It is possible for a ultra-successful woman to be happy in a relationship (in fact, it is likely) with a man, provided that the woman is not a self-absorbed harpy like Dowd. The reality is that a relationship is an entity in and of itself that must be given constant consideration -- this is hard to do when either partner only looks out for number one.Gee, it is a wonder that no one has snatched that lil' lady right up and married her, huh?

She's considered a comedian, not a pundit. Both Fey and Dowd excel at catty bon mots and knee-jerk liberal sarcasm. But people expect more content from Dowd. She's amusing in small doses, but too much at one time, like in \\"Are Men Necessary?\\" and you feel like you've eaten too much unbaked chocolate-chip cookie dough: just a little nauseous.The Dowd problen could be solved if she would quit the Times and go into stand-up comedy; or, when Tina Fey inevitably leaves \\"SNL\\" to make movies, Dowd could take her place.

Imagine her reaction if a man came out and said the same thing about women! If men are not necessary, then why spend all of your time writing a book to prove it is so? Nature will inevitably make it so. She argues this is happening, only at such a slow rate it is indiscernible to the naked eye.....kind of like the logic she is purveying.No man with an iota of self-respect or intelligence would get involved with a woman who actually poses the question of \\"are men necessary?\\" On the other hand, Ms. Dowd would never get involved with a man who is not intelligent and who cannot discuss world affairs. Perhaps this is why she is a bitter 53 year-old, single woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conflict Sells","review":"While I agree with some of what Dowd writes, I also think it's an affinity of American media to capitalize on (and sometimes exaggerate) conflict and difference. I'm all for equality, but I find it interesting that some feminists aren't just interested in a fair shake, they're interested in putting men down and asserting superiority. In fact, I personally know a few women who have bigger egos than the most men (and yes, that's a bit of a turn-off). There are also those who decry stereotypes, but then turn around and apply them to others.Regarding the trouble many successful women apparently have getting a man or getting married: It may be that the more successful women are, the smaller their pool of potential candidates (because many tend to \\"marry up\\"), but the same could apply to women who prefer men of equal socio-economic status. Sometimes there's a little more to the stats than meets the eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"My issue","review":"If Maureen Dowd wants to write a tongue-in-cheek book to argue from a cultural point of view, that men are unnecessary, I would have no problem. But she tries to pass her \\"insights\\" as being pseudo-science. She tries to somehow amalgate declining Y chromosomes as some sort of scientific evidence that males are dying out, with anti-male propaganda. Feminism is just fine, and powerful women are just fine, but writing against males for anti-male's sake is just offensive.As a man who supports feminism and the power of women to choose their lifestyle, I'm offended by this book. This does not nothing to advance the cause of gender equality. how could it...the title itself is a jab at the male sex! What equality is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flippancy is not funny and neither is this book","review":"MoDo used to be a decent writer, but this book highlights her decline.I'm not going to comment about her politics or other opinions. What bothers me about this book is her constant use of flippancy. Being flippant is actually not funny. Sarcasm can be extraordinarily funny, even when you're on the receiving end. MoDo displays little actual sarcasm, less humour and loads of flippant off-the-cuff remarks.This is a book you will enjoy only if you practise the humour deadening art of flippancy yourself. Otherwise, this is a dull, dreary read and not worth the death of the trees needed to create the paper to print it.My main hope for this book is that it's flagging sales will prompt MoDo to consult a good editor for her next book and take that editor's advice.It really is sad to see a once-talented writer in such a state of decline."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was a real book","review":"and I bought the hardcover.

So I read the first 50 pages, wondering when it was going to get real, when I realized that the entire book is a sad attempt at comedy. Most of her examples refer to the made-up world of movies or literature. As for the rest of her source material, all I can say is that this woman must live in a very differant world from me. I've never met anyone like the people she refers to. Either she is going for hyperbole or else she lives in a very isolated and superficial world.So, the book is mildy amusing if you are looking for comedy, but don't be fooled into thinking she actually addresses any real issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"All New Yorkers know Maureen Dowd, so lured by the publicity, the provocative cover and catchy title, I picked this up.

Maybe you have to read it with a person of the opposite sex and laugh a lot in between. Tried to read it twice on my own, but couldn't do it. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Dowd should stick to being a columnist","review":"This book is more about women vs. women and what a feminist is or should be vs a book about men and women. The title is totally misleading as is the cover illustration. I was looking forward to a fun lighhearted read about the ongoing battle of the sexes. Men who are offended by the title of this book will be pleased to know that Ms. Dowd spends more time attacking women than men. It doesn't seem like Ms. Dowd could make up her mind what she wanted to accomplish with this book. At times it is fun and light hearted but turn the page and she's making unsupported arguments of a more serious nature. It doesn't work for this book. Either make it fun or make it serious. And please will someone burn Ms. Dowd's thesaurus?If you are not a fan of Ms. Dowd this is probably not the book for you. This was a painful read but I kept at it hoping this book would eventually redeem itself. No such luck. Can I have my money back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An entertaining read, but no substance","review":"I read few of Dowd's columns, but I enjoyed reading them. They are witty and insightful. I expected to be entertained, but also educated. I thought I'd get a substantive, albeit tongue-in-cheek, analysis of feminism, women's progress, etc. This is a great disappointment. Not only is the book not substantive, it's sloppy. The book came out a couple of months ago, yet Dowd mentions events that happened in the middle of this year. This means she slapped the book together in a month or two, and it shows. That's unfortunate, because she squandered an opportunity to write a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"new\\" doesn't always mean new","review":"Even though I ordered the item \\"New\\" from amazon, the book was obviously used, with wear on the binding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd question from a lonely gal...","review":"Is it so strange that a single person in her 50s starts to write books titled \\"Are Men Really Necessary\\"?Too much alone time, hon.

While her writing is excellent, and her intelligence cannot be challenged, her ability to stay on subject left a lot to be desired. And, her far-left liberal bent found its way onto her pages over and over again.

Expensive, but only half as much as new printer (and I really like this printer). Directions for install were clear and EASY. I'm pretty sure that the problem was electronic and not ink related, but I'm now looking into third-party ink because I don't see where the Canon print head cleaning helped at all and even if the problem was not electronics, none of the cleaning methods made a difference.

For $300 you shouldn't HAVE to buy a protection plan for the 2nd year of a products life; unfortunately the poor quality of iPods makes it a necessity. BUT, the protection plan is riddled with clauses that exclude any number of reasonable issues.I've bought Apple for the last 15 years, but never again will I send them my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it!","review":"Although it may seem like anouther expense when you buy your iPod, it is well worth the price! I had a 1st gen iPod Nano that was a year old and had so many scratches on it! My battery was also starting to not hold a charge so I sent it back expecting them to replace the battery and send me back my old iPod.Instead, they sent me back a fully functional new iPod Nano. Thats a 200 dollar value! It sure saves you money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive, limited coverage","review":"Considering that this policy only extends the warranty for one year, it is expensive. Coverage for the iPod's biggest problem, its battery, is vague. Apple simply defines as non-defects some apparent battery problems, such as the fact that the battery drains very rapidly when the unit is not in use and turned off. Plus, the battery can drop drastically in usage time, and Apple protects itself by saying this: \\"Service coverage is available ... for battery depletion of 50 percent or more from original specification.\\" What other company clearly states that precipitous product failure is not covered by either the original or extended warranty?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less expensive policy available for 29.95 from Crutchfield.com","review":"Although this policy is thru Apple, it is 2x the price of similar policies available from other companies that also have very good reputations. One is Crutchfield.com which has a 2 yr. plan for $29.99 which starts *after* the standard Apple 1 yr labor coverage (for a TOTAL OF 3 YEARS). Apple extended warranty is a total of 2 years for $59.99, rather than a total of 3 years for $29.99 thru Crutchfield."},{"rating":"2","title":"You do have to buy this with Apple products!!","review":"Ok, even though i am telling you have to buy this, i gave it 4 stars, and the reason is that with Apple you will need more than 1 year warranty!! Google and you will see how many problems people have with the iPods. I bought my iPod 40gb 4g on July 2004($399,00 + tax), and after 7 or 8 months it began skipping. I thought at first it was a software glitch and overlooked it. Shortly after my warranty expired (1 year) it totally stopped working, i went to the Apple store i had bought it and they told me it is a hardware problem (and they had seen a 'few' with the same problem) and it will cost me $280,00 to fix it. :(So, do yourself a favor, pay the extra, but know that if this thing breaks you won't have to pay an absurd ammount of money to fix it!!For further accounts of people's experiences with the iPods malfunctionings, go to:http://jon.blogs.com/mopho/2004/03/ipod_quirks.html"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this for the battery!","review":"The guy at a local retail store tried to convince me I should buy this plan because all iPod batteries die within a year and a half or two years. With this plan I can supposedly get a new one for \\"free\\". But that only lasts 2 years. Why pay now when you might not even need a new battery within 2 years and Apple already offers an Out-of-Warranty Battery Replacement Program? From the Apple web site: \\"If your iPod requires service only because the battery's ability to hold an electrical charge has diminished, Apple will replace your iPod for a service fee of $59, plus $6.95 shipping.\\" Just wait and spend the money when/if you need to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"My Ipod never worked correctly, and when I tried to send it back they said the warranty was void because of a few microscopic dents in the casing. They wanted $255 plus tax for repair. How are you not going to get wear and tear on a product meant for being on the go? If you get this plan, what are the chances that you wont get any dents in 2 years? The chances of something going wrong internally that wasnt related to some outside force is slim to none.

Double delicious! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"This book ended much, much differently than I thought it would when I started it. It is utterly captivating, in the true sense of the word. Jakober draws you in to her characters; they become real. The stories themselves are complex - the way only stories with a ring of truth can be. The plots are intricate, subtle, and maddeningly intoxicating. Once you get started, you don't want to stop.Jakober is a gifted storyteller, and Edge Science Fiction Fantasy Publishing has produced a stunning book. I saw this book from across the room and knew I had to have it. If you get the chance, get the hardcover copy. This is one of the best-written stories I have read in many, many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entrancing","review":"If I could, I would have given this book 6 stars. I haven't read such an absorbing fantasy for a long time. Excellent characterization, interesting approach to narrative, vivid magic, high drama, moral ambiguity ...

But I think \\"amusing\\" is about all the book is. I was very disappointed because I was essentially bored by the books \\"morals\\" after only a few pages. Don't think I even have managed to read through the book, short as it is, or even to read all the morals over time -- there just isn't enough entertainment for the effort. The attraction might be the artwork and aggressive use of mixed typeface. But the humor is relatively lame often. I keep thinking that this book is a classic \\"appeals to critics\\" but fails to deliver educational or entertainment value. In sum, the \\"idea\\" of the book (offbeat \\"morals\\" collection) is way better than the execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid book","review":"Don't waste your money.

We never got to the end of the book. My children will not let me read the book to them. A disappointment from such a fine author as Jon Scieszka."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squid & Slug - just misunderstood","review":"Squid is a genius. Squid won't bother doing boring things like watching tv, playing frisbee, or going shopping. Slug is pretty smart too. Slug realizes she is better than everyone and everything else, so she only pays attention to the important things; herself. Why Squid is depicted as a party-pooper, and Slug cruelly bumped off I cannot understand. I can only suspect Jon Scieszka is jealous of the real-life versions of Squid and Slug.So, basically; beside his obvious prejudice toward these awesome characters, this is an enjoyable book you can read all the time, and stuff. You can't take it places, though, 'cause it's big and you'd look weird carrying a kid's book, unless you are a kid. Oh, and I don't like the paper book cover. It's always sliding off one edge, or the other, and it's starting to rip. I guess that doesn't have anything to do with the contents of the book and I could just take the book cover off, but complaining is good for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, funny, easy for children to read and understand","review":"At our house, I eagerly anticipate any new book from Jon Scieszka (We have all of his books). I jumped at the announcement of this book and immediately placed my order. After receipt, my eight year old son and I sat down to read together. From the first page, my son was reading and laughing with each story. The stories are brief yet extremely clever. Each story concludes with a \\"moral\\". Parents can utilize these stories and \\"morals\\" to explain to our kids how these stories are actually real-life experiences and situations in disguise. This book offers parents a non-threatening tool with which to teach kids how to deal with and hopefully understand social relationships. Aside from all of the above, this book is just a lot of fun to read and view. The art work is on par with or exceeds \\"The Stinky Cheese Man\\" and \\"The Book that Jack Wrote\\" - simply terrific.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S HELPFUL BUT THE OFFICIAL STRATEGY GUIDE IS INFINITALLY BETTER","review":"This book is helpful but it focus too much on the MAP ITSELF ( LIKE THE TITLE SAYS ) :) and it became a little confusing so its better to buy the official strategy guide that not only cover the map part but also the secrets, monsters and lots and lots of hints about the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing.","review":"We wanted this to get rid of bean beetles.

I think this version of \\"My Favorite things\\", though it does slow down, is one of the most intense Coltrane performances ever. I first heard it about 4 years ago, and I still play it continuously; Trane is really burning the saxophone on this one. I'm not a big fan of Archie Shepp's, though his material is fairly strong on this album, and \\"One Down One Up\\" is decent... but \\"My Favorite things\\" MADE this album for me. I had to write a review when I read it wasn't that great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album - Actually Quite Accessible","review":"The best way to think about this album is a nice set of Archie Shepp live, with a bonus live Coltrane track thrown in for context.Never mind all the theories and the musical philosophy: what's here some great live jazz from a historical period - and much more accessible than folks make it out to be. I really enjoyed this one! It sets you up nicely to explore the catalogues of these musicians in further depth, particularly Shepp, Hutcherson and McCoy Tyner, not just Coltrane. But make no mistake the rest of the players on these tracks are all heavy hitters. All worth exploring too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable to appreciating the wonder of Shakespeare","review":"This book examines the influence of a typical grammar school education on the word power and appreciation of the likes of Shakespeare. It is presumed that Shakespeare enjoyed a reasonable degree of schooling and in the last section of this wonderful book, the author outlines the typical course in language and its uses that a student would cover.Firstly it certainly puts to shame the watered down nonsense that passes for English grammar and clear thinking in schools today. Secondly, it helps us to understand just where some of the theoretical genius of Shakepeare developed from.A wonderful work. It has thrown me further into the study of language.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile & Wonderful","review":"Allow me to echo the favorable reviews above. This book is so timely and insightful that I bought four used copies and added them to our library's book sale to make sure that it stays in circulation. The tone was a bit to religious for my tastes, but that does nothing to deny the importance of the subject, how it is portrayed, the unexpected 90 degree angle turns, and the overall message underlining the truth that racism is indefensible.

Run very far away from this tired flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...she should have stayed with Destiny's child","review":"This movie was not worth the $6.00 I paid for it. Ms. Franklin is a beautiful woman, and that's it! She should have taken some acting lessons before trying to pursue an acting career. The movie was really boring, the music came in too loud and the whole cast was terrible, nobody could act! She was supposed to be a singer, but you never heard her sing...how convenient.She should have stayed with Destiny's Child..or maybe not! Maybe she should try modeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE SCRIPT AND ACTING!","review":"This movie was probably the worst of any low budget film that I've ever viewed.

It works very quickly and is light to carry. This was a much better value for the money than the Lansky basic system I bought around the same time. Purchase this Smith's stone with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok..","review":"when i purchase this product i was just getting into sharpening by hand, and it did a fairly good job.. a razor's edge on two of my EDC knives, but then the plastic frame holding the diamond stones broke, i bought a second one, and with in a week it broke too. maybe i got defective ones, but its good for what it is"},{"rating":"2","title":"effective, convenient, fairly priced","review":"I work with knives in sailor's ropework, and am the one who keeps the home kitchen knives sharp. Having used one for over a year now, this product is my favorite for it's effectiveness (the diamond stones are the quickest hand sharpeners I've used), and convenience. The handle/guard attaches securely and allows the stone to rattle around in a kitchen drawer or ditty bag without damaging itself or other tools or utinsels. The price is very reasonable, and I also like that Smith's is an American company, so the profits support jobs and taxes at home. This is not what I would call a pocket-sized model, so I keep a smaller sharpener with my backpacking gear. A minor \\"con\\" for some users: This is not an automatic-angle device, the user must judge the angle at which to hone their blade, but it doesn't take long to learn that technique. This is a \\"Plus\\" if you want to sharpen different devices with different honing angles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, durable, the best.","review":"This sharpener is simple, durable and the best of all the various ones I have tried. I use it frequently and have several. One in the kitchen and others in my hunting/camping gear and my workshop. I have started giving them to family and friends as gifts. Stop your search, buy this one. It is simply the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"For excellence is sharpening","review":"This little gem is amazing for putting a really fine edge on your blades. After you have worked with your stones and have your angles correct, this combo really makes the difference in the finished product! A great addition to your shop or field sharpening routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't sharpen any of my knives","review":"So I bought this sharpener at the local Cabela's because I needed something to sharpen my knives (other than my parents kitchen knife electric sharpener). I've been using this for about 3 days on every knife I own and it won't sharpen a single on of them (in fact, they are duller than they were before I used this sharpener). I am not sure if I am doing it wrong (I'm following the instructions that come with this and have watched instructional videos online on how to use it properly) or maybe the blades on my knives are complete garbage. Either way this sharpener has not been what I expected it to be. There are some positive aspects to this though which are the size, the ability to store it in the handle, and the price. I am gonna look at buying Smith's TRI-6 Arkansas TRI-HONE Sharpening Stones System instead and see if that makes a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, bombastic and blah!","review":"Without a doubt one of the worst musical scores ever written for a film. I really wanted to like the film because of the fine performances by Emma Thompson and Jonathan Price. But I was almost driven from the theater by the wall-to-wall, repetitive, droning, boring dreck Nyman forced on the audience. A little restraint would have been nice. Avoid this one like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"No support from Atari","review":"The game looks like fun, but I had the same CD Key problem that many other people have had. After a week of complete silence from Atari, ignoring my 5 support requests, I had no choice but to ask Amazon for a refund. Disappointing,because I really wanted to play this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"No CD Keys!!!!","review":"This game came with a blank cd key page. Went to Atari's support website, and this is a known issue. They requires you to send a scan of the blank cd key page, and wait 7 to 10 days for a response. They also state that telephone support is no longer available. Extremely poor quality control by Atari, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"No customer support","review":"It has been months of E-mailing customer support trying to get new CD keys as those sent with the game were defective. All I have gotten was the automated E-mail informing me they recieved my message. I am going to ask for my money back and never purchase anything from this company ever again. They seem to be trying to get people to buy multiple copies. The reviews says the problems are fixed are plants or idiots, or both. If I could I would give zero stars. Bought in November 07, it is now January 08 and still no help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun RPG","review":"If you want a cheap RPG with pretty good graphics and tons of gameplay, then NWN is for you. The second one is still 50 bucks which is quite a bit so why not get this one for only 15-20 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrating trying to install! Buyer Beware.","review":"I bought this game and the geniuses at Atari printed the same product key for all three games, instead of a different product key for each game, effectively rendering this game useless. I spent 3 hours trying to install it only find under the online FAQ that apparently Atari shipped a lot of these games with either no product keys or the same product key replicated three times. Bioware and their cursed product key!! Anyway, this game is buyer beware! I sent an E-mail to Atari requesting new product keys, if I don't hear from Atari in a few days, I'll be returning the game to Amazon and I'll let Amazon deal with it.I've played this game before and it's a great game, but if I can install it, it's just a shiny drink coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duplicate CD key","review":"The product came with three identical CD Keys, which means I cannot play the game after installation. I had read about this issue before, but thought I was in the clear when the game installed without any problem. Atari support is difficult to contact, and requires picture evidence to get corrected keys. That would be alright, except that their online form does not allow for attachments! This is the last Atari product I will ever buy, and I hope Amazon stops selling this before Atari is able to work this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD KEYS ARE WRONG - DON'T BUY THIS RUBBISH!!","review":"The latest version of this game has had the CD keys printed wrongly in the manual so you can't play the game. After spending two hours on their support sites trying to find this I emailed to receive this response:If you can, please either scan or take a digital picture of one of the following items.1) The front of the game CD2) The box3) The game manual showing the CD keys (if available)4) The sales receiptFunny I thought I had paid money for this game that will not function!!Do not purchase this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neverwinter Nights Diamond","review":"This is hours and hours of pure fun.

DVD makes install a breeze. A lot of replay ability and classes to choose from. Definitely a good way to spend twenty bucks.Con's: While it is hard to find con's with the game itself, here are some problems I had. 1st, Windows Vista, you must download all the Bioware updates before even trying to play this game. Otherwise, windows will block it completely. Along with this you still get loading screen crashes and it may take you a few attempt to get into the game (Right clicking and running as Admin helps) The 2nd issue I had was with Multiplayer Games. I haven't been able to post any successfully online to play with friends.

Forget it.","review":"Okay I have had this computer on several different computers. I have enjoyed playing it. It's a very fun game to play. There is one issue I got rid of my older computers, and decided to buy this game again to put on my new computers. Well it will not run on Windows 7. Even with all the compatibility options set to older versions of Windows the game will still not run. I wasted my money on this game. The messed up thing is that the old Baldur's Gate I & II, and Icewind Dale I&II run perfectly fine on the same computers. You can't get any tech support from Atari or Bioware either."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as I remember","review":"I love this game. I recently purchased it and my main problem was downloading it to a spot and getting it to open properly. Im not sure if there is the same problem with installing via disk but i would think there was. I ended up installing it 3 times before i found out i had to open the folder itself and couldnt go through the main menu to start the game as per usual. Additionally if i wanted it to work i couldnt install it in a programs file either. Other than that i still love the game which is why it got 4 stars. Installing was awful but the game istelf is still amazing =) I might be a little biased. Magic was difficult for me to get used to but the combat itself is easy to understand. It is worth the money, I find the storyline to be very intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"save sanity buy bullett","review":"dont do it!!!! IF you buy, get it only from AMAZON, not from someone who sells on their site. That way when you get hosed you can return it.

I got this game for hubby, didnt ready reviews (my bad) cause it was not for me but a gift he wanted. There are 3 games on the cd in the pack and dumb atari only published 1 key code. no web sites are helpful, people just complain. .... atari returns NO calls and NO emails.Someone needs to get the 3 codes and post them on the web or torrent.

Really seems like they went backwards in this game. NPC characters and voice acting are good. The combat is really bland and boring. Multiplayer is ok but other games like wow or diablo 2 just do it way better. If you want to play a worthwhile rpg start with bg1/2 iwd1/2 they just make this game obsolete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get into this","review":"After loving Oblivion, Morrowind, Baulders Gate I/II, Icewind Dale I/II I could not get into this game it does not have the same fun, or interest factor to keep me playing.

Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Send it to the landfill!!!!","review":"Would not play in windows 7. Dwnloaded several updates hoping that would help, no luck. If you are still running XP give it a shot, if windows 7 don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, still fun in 2010, but no longer supported.","review":"This is one of the games that put Bioware on the map for a reason. It stands up well to time. It uses many of the mechanics that DnD-type games do, though, which can be difficult to understand for players who aren't familiar with them. The graphics are still pretty good, despite how old it is, but don't expect anything super glossy of course. The only problem is that Bioware no longer updates the game, so as new operating systems come out, this game may stop working without some tinkering. A digital license may be the way to go depending on your feelings about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for the money","review":"With all the free online play (some of it very good) and the standalone campaigns as well as the module design software Neverwinter is an outstanding value and Diamond is the most inclusive."},{"rating":"2","title":"1/04/2008: still duplicate CD-Key issue","review":"I just wanted to chime in, despite the previous review reporting differently I ordered NWN from Amazon on January 4th, 2008 - and I received the game with all 3 CD-keys being the same.While it may be fixed for some, not the case for me. I'm currently waiting for a response from Atari support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diamond Edition - Bad CD Keys","review":"While the game itself stands the test of time, the distribution of the Diamond edition is riddled with problems. See the Atari tech support for more information.The problem I had is with the CD keys. Each game needs a unique key, but the manual supplies the same key for all the games. When you try to play it, it won't authenticate.You have to go through Atari tech support via e-mail (no phone), and it takes them 7-10 days to respond. Some buyers are reporting that they have to send proof of the manual misprint before keys are released to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its old, but its a great game","review":"What can I say the games a classic, its fun & it does D&D justice, well with the exception of some of the character class exploits, won't go into detail there.

The worlds are beautifully rendered, character creation is nice and easy, and the character models are well done. Even the voice-sets are terrific! (My favorite is the manaical mage.) I was always a paper D&D fan, but wasn't that crazy about having to roll the dice and do all that math. That's the great thing about NWN...everything is done for you, so all you have to worry about is playing. And once you've completed the single-player stories, an entirely new world opens up when you go online with it! In a word, it's awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO CD KEY- can't play game.","review":"The game as the other comments idenicate has 3 duplicate CD keys so you can't play the game.Atari doesn't seem to want to help in a reasonable amount of time and they want you to jump through hoops.The product should be RECALLED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patching Fun","review":"What a great game. Even better because it will run nicely on older systems! Detailed, involved, and if you are a D&D; freak, a good one to have in between gaming sessions. Highly recommended.One thing to bear in mind with this product, however, is that even though the box says \\"includes all patches\\", it doesn't. New patches have come out since Diamond was released. You will have to go to the BioWare website and download the v1.69HotU patch and run it after you install if you want to run it on Windows 7. I ordered 2 copies, one for me and one for my hubby (I'm running XP, he runs 7) and we had quite a bit of \\"fun\\" trying to get his to work so we could LAN. The 1.69 patch fixed that problem quite nicely.All in all, good product, great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best game ever made","review":"I don't have to write this here to prove that this is a great game, but I feel I owe it to the people that made it and made my past 2 years a lot more fun. If you never played NWN, i suggest buying this Diamond edition. It'll give you more than 150 hours of gameplay, and you'll enjoy all the time spent with it. For me, it's the best game ever made, followed close by Diablo 1&2 on second and third place. I'm lookin' forward to NWN 2 in 2006"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game - BAD DISTRIBUTION!","review":"This is a great game for RPG fans.

The installation was not difficult, and I found myself immersed in the new stories in no time. It's a lot cheaper than buying them separately from MacSoft, and there are plenty of places on the net with instructions on how to install.The game is dated (certainly by now) but it's still a lot of fun, and definitely a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE!","review":"THE GAME WILL NOT RUN ON YOUR COMPUTER.The Diamond edition that I bought here had a known error -- NO CD KEYS.

The disc wont even read, and if it did theres no CD key to even get it started.If you really have to go through all this: \\"email tech support, send in photos, and wait several days to get your keys\\", Bioware and Atari don't deserve your money.With such a huge market for this stuff, why are all the D&D; PC games coming out with so many bugs and problems.

Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. There is something wrong with the way the water comes out of the spout.

It could have something to do with the spout being so low on the pot.

It has a strange, low pitched whistle that sounds like an alien ship landing rather than a pleasant high whistle. It's so low, that I don't even know when it's whistling, except that I hear this annoying \\"wee-oo wee-oo wee-oo\\" sound that makes me get up to stop that crazy sound.2. When you open the spout, a spurt of hot water comes shooting out, which has burned me twice now.Anyway, the one good thing is that it heats water to a very hot temperature and it looks nice sitting on the stove (the roosters are tasteful).

I have talked first hand with people from the Blackfoot Nation and they talked about what happened to their parents in boarding schools. It was not the \\"sugar coating\\" that Ms. Rinaldi speaks of at all. Many of the problems that First Nation people have may be traced back to forcing children to attend boarding school, such as poor parenting skills, by not having any examples of parents to follow while growing up.The White people treated the First Nation people with disrespect toward their culture, language, religion, and music. You could say history repeated itself with how the Whites treated all others different than themselves.When you read this book, make sure that you take this into account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made Up","review":"I'm a four-teen year old who really disliked this book because alot of things are just made up.

Then another thing when Belle Rain Water gave Nannie a prayer stick, A hopi child wouldn't give a Lakota child a prayer stick! Sacred objects like these were/are not things children have or share.

It shows she did very little research on the indian schools, especilly when Carlisle was such a big target. To make things worse, I am Native American and I am Sioux. My great grandmother was in an Indian \\"school\\" growing up and i think this school sounded just \\"peachy\\" compared to what she wen through. Otherwise, the book was good and Little Rose was a great character. The book would have been better if not perfect if Mrs. Rinaldi would have put more effort into accuracy and research! And I would also like to add, that all of you who thought this book was great in every way have much to learn about the indian ways. Do not give this to someone as a gift if they are strong in Native American history and facts, although you would be trying to be nice, it would only hurt more"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty","review":"When Ann Rinaldi decided to write a book about such a delicate subject you would think that she would take the time to speak with Native Americans who attended boarding schools against their will in the 50's and 60's. Even if this was a different time period, the isolation and mistreatment still existed. The fact that she found the names for her characters in a nearby cemetary should have been a clue as to the conditions these children lived in. Using their names to represent children who saw the school as a nurturing place to live is a travesty. If you want to really understand the plight of Native Americans forced to live in government boarding schools this is not the book to choose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero! This book is a travesty!!!","review":"With all of the facts that are coming out now about what -really- happened in the much-romanticized \\"wild west\\" and \\"frontier\\" days, I was shocked and dismayed to see this badly researched, Anglocentric travesty being foisted on children (or anyone else). The book design and ambiguously worded intro could lead readers to believe this was a transcription of an actual diary. Nothing could be further from the truth. I don't believe in banning books, but think this should be held up as an example of the worst. The author has the audacity to suggest that maybe the spirits of those who died at Carlisle and other places would \\"smile\\" to see her creation. If you want to give your kid a good book about Indians, start them out with books by Indian authors, or at least something by Mari Sandoz."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I cannot believe this bastardization of a historical event is still on the market. This is horribly inaccurate, using the actual names of Native American children that died, probably because of abuse,malnutrition,ect while they stayed at this horrible boarding school. The author obviously knows NOTHING about this particular tribe's customs and generalizes everything. I would not want any child to read this novel and get the wrong idea about what happened in the past. This does not deserve to be titled a historical fiction, rather it is a book written by an ignorant woman who has NO respect for the deceased, or Native Americans. What was scholastic thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Racism much worse than simple ignorance.","review":"It's unbelievable that this book could get written, and published, much less be praised as it has been in some circles.

Avoid this book, except to speak out against it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely without merit","review":"I gave it a star because i think you have to list it with atleast one star. Beyond the historical inacuracies, the sterotypes in the book are horrible. PLEASE, don't get this for your children or even for yourself; it will be a horrible mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A living book","review":"I call this book a living book because it has chunks of life in it. It is not like many other Dear America diaries. It does not end happily ever after. Although Nannie forgives Belle rain water in words I think she still feels bitter in her heart. I do not know if the information is historicaly accurate. Another reviewer brought to my attention that it is not. I do like the theme of the book and how Nannie is constantly torn between two traditions and customs that often oppose. At then end I think she settles on a compromise favoring her Native American ways. I also don't blame her. She has spent most of her life practicing Native American customs and all of a sudden is whisked away to a new lifestyle. it's simply not possible for her to favor new traditions some of which she has not even learned yet. Altogether the book has a good story line and a good undecided ending because in life there rarely is a perfect compromise and this book demonstrated that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first, but got bad.

It is different from all of the historical fiction books I've read, and it stands out in my mind. It follows Little Rose (a Sioux Indian) as she gets educated at Carlisle Indian School in the 1880's.

The chemistry between Karen Allen and Thierry Lhermitte is palpable and although there's a moral problem inherent in the relationship, it is portrayed with sensuality, tenderness, and humor.

Very few of his explanations, solutions or recommendations are anything more than common sense observations. There is a lot of tricks out there -from the XIX Century spiritualists on, not to delve any further- of which Mr. Huston brings no references; his research seems quite insatisfactory. I read it on the expectation of finding ways to expose frauds. If the book was intended as a collection of advises on how to better scam people, it would also be morally indefensible.

That is because they were all, very likely, students of Steele at CAl State LA.I wonder if their individual reviews of this book helped them get a better grade in his poetry course?While Steele is a good poet (see his poetry books), he has made a name for himself in academia by self-righteously asserting that poetry must be written a certain way to be truly poetic. He does not merely frown on free verse; he rejects it.Steele likens free verse to playing tennis without a net. HIs point seems to be that once the rules of a game are broken, something has been lost in the joy of playing or watching it. However, tennis without a net is called paddle ball, and unless you're a New English prig straight out of the pages of Yankee magazine, it's a heck of a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant book on the art of poetry","review":"Have you ever wondered how poetry works?

'Waking Ned' is a phenomenon that stays in your heart long after you have seen it, and maybe even stays for ever. It thoroughly explores the gamut of human emotion from stunting greed to to incredible soaring generosity and of course the ancient wonderful joys of human love and friendship.'Waking Ned' is set in rural Ireland, but filmed on the Isle of Man, and the breath taking Manx scenery is used to wonderful effect.

The other one had a very large dent in it due to some obvious rough handling somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesson Learned","review":"I have to believe that Cornwell is teaching us a lesson (her rabid fans)and telling us to get a life, instead of scrambling to the bookstore the DAY it's released, only to plunk down $21.95 for a thin, larger type font book. Well, it IS Cornwell, so no problem, it will be worth it, right? WRONG. The book is boring, lame and a flat out disappointment. At the end, I wouldn't have flinched if every character was blown up in a fiery crash. They just did not warrant caring. Lesson learned, I will get a life and wait to buy it cheap, on Ebay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At Risk","review":"I generally dont write reviews as everyone has a different point of view. But i felt I had to. I LOVE Patricia Cornwall's books, but his one has let me down greatly. The new characters do not sinc well. Seems like the book was written with no plot thought, it just rambles on and in the end you're not sure what the story started out at. Honestly one of her worst books. I know she wants to start getting away from Kay Scarpetta, but maybe not in such a hurry next time. Very, very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Ms. Cornwell, I am so disappointed, after reading \\"At Risk\\" today. Firstly, the book is so small, and barely 200 pages. Secondly, nothing was mentioned on your website, nor on the book cover flap that all of the regular characters [Scarpetta, et al] were being replaced.I really tried to just focus on this book alone, thinking that perhaps I would enjoy this \\"Geronimo\\" character; but, the strength that he showed at the beginning of the book, was nowhere to be seen by the book's ending.I feel robbed of $13.00 and betrayed that you weren't up front with the public about starting a new series of characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"This book was so far left of what this author has done in the past that I am in doubt that I will ever read her again! It has gotten so that even her Scarpetta novels are second rate. Lucy is a lost cause, Benton and Kay will never have a good relationship ever again and I seriously doubt that Marino will stay around for long. Cornwell must be going through the \\"change\\" to put out such horrible pieces of literature ( I am using this term very loosely). Thank God I got this book out of the library and didn't have to pay out a red cent for it, because it certainly would have been a waste of good money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At Risk - of falling asleep!!","review":"Wow! Patty has lost her edge. I read the book in about 2 hours and felt completely unfulfilled by the end. At best this book was a contractual obligation - please, next time spare me the bother. I've tolerated some poor performance by Ms. Cornwell, but this is insulting.I have been a dedicated fan since the beginning; grew up in Williamsburg, VA with the \\"Parkway Murders\\". Even my loyalty is wavering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!","review":"This story was not worthy of a hardback release. I finished this book with a feeling that something was missing. I gave this book two stars because I do feel that the character of Winston is solid and worthy of more attention. A disappointing Cornwell work. It just goes to show that even the most talented authors sometimes throw duds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed fan","review":"I bought this book as soon as it came out. I have been a fan of Cornwell for years. This book was nothing close to her past works. many times throughout, i considered just stopping because it was that bad. it seems as if it was someone else writing, someone with no literary talent. not only was it choppy, but the plot line wasnt interesting at all. If you are a fan of Patricia Cornwell, dont buy this book because it may just change your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Career At Risk","review":"And so I ask myself, why would a writer as talented and absolutely great as Ms. Cornwell release a book like At Risk? I stand second to none in my love of Scarpetta, Lucy, and Marino, but the characters in At Risk are comic book flimsy and of no interest whatever. At the very least I hope that this failed, experimental project convinces Ms. Cornwell to write in past tense, not present tense, which leaves one thinking he's still reading the jacket notes. And most people still do speak in complete sentences. This writer seems to abhor the words 'and' and 'it.' For giving us Scarpetta and Marino and Lucy I thank Ms. Cornwell. She's in the top two or three of my favorite writers. She's a genius, a master, and I loved her Jack The Ripper book, but I'm still baffled why At Risk would ever see the light of day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you for new characters!!!","review":"I am so glad that Cornwell decided to give Kay a rest I just can't give this book a low review. It is so refreshing to read about someone new!I actually enjoyed this book. No, it doesn't even come close to touching her early Scarpetta novels but it opened up a new door.Win and Sykes have a ton of potential. Please, give us a full-length novel featuring them after they graduate from the National Forensic Academy. There are so many possiblilites with these two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Very disappointed in this book. I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's earlier novels and truly enjoyed her work but she's definitely lost it lately. In my opinion her last few books have not been up to the standards I'd grown to expect from her earlier work. This one unfortunately reads like a \\"formula paperback\\". Undeveloped characters, predictable events, weak plot & weak ending. If she's run out of good ideas or energy, maybe she should just take a break rather than keep publishing these low quality reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia, I hardly know ye","review":"I read this book. Then I had to go back and re-read because I lost the thread of the story, and when I got to the end the first time I wasn't really sure what happened. Not vintage Cornwell; not a good mystery book. Give the readers a break with teeny tiny books and large print with accompanying large prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry I read this one","review":"How far Patricia Cornwell has fallen.Read Postmortem, then read (if you can) At Risk. You will feel offended this was written, and you gave it the opportunity of being read.Win, the handsome investigator, and his psychic grandmother are the only redeeming characters in this flop, and then you tend to compare their relationship with Alex Cross and Nanamama, and they lose in that comparison.You keep reading that there will be something in there, but nobody's home - more than that, nobody cares!One more Scarpetta book and if it's haphazard like At Risk, no more hardbacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I have the previous favorable reviews and they are longer than the book.I, like others, have a full collection of Patrica Cornwell books and couldn't wait until this title came out. Now I am dissappointed.The book is a novelette. Ms Cornwell needs more time with her style of writing to develop her new characters. The only characters I cared about were Nana and Miss Dog and they were side characters. Every one else just annoyed me. I didn't get enough information to have any feelings about them. Its pretty bad when a character gets raped and you don't care. The characters are more complex and the time should have been spent rounding them out.This is the last Cornwell book I will read until she can get her act together. What happened? Did her publisher press her to get one out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to you Ms. Cornwell?","review":"This one started off interesting enough with a detective being pulled and pushed by a female DA who has aspirations for a higher political positions. A 20 year old murder comes into the mix with missing files and a new DNA database: Any Crime, Any Time!Too many characters, undeveloped I might add, are intorduced and I found myself thinking, \\"what is this book about and why am I reading it?\\" I finished it only out of respect for the great writer Patricia Cornwell used to be. It was confusing and boring and I am still a bit unsure why PC's people allowed this one to be published!Even if you love Ms. Cornwell, take a pass on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the real Patricia Cornwell?","review":"I stopped buying Cornwell's books several back. It seems that a new writer has taken over her name. Where are the great thrillers she wrote in the beginning? First, she ruined the Scarpetta series with all that personal balderdash with boring crime stories on the side. Now, she seems to have thrown this \\"short story\\" out in order to reap enough income to pay a bill. Her style is different; her characters have no depth. What are her editors thinking? Does the publishing world need her this badly? Thank goodness, I checked this out at the library. Do not waste two hours reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy AT RISK","review":"Terrible! Disappointing! Convoluted plot. Little character development. It just plods along....WILL THE REAL PATRICIA CORNWELL PLEASE STAND UP??? Because she could not have written this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bore...","review":"I was so waiting for the next Patricia Cornwell novel...I'm still waiting. This book was horrible, and such a waste of time that I already forgot what it was about. I can't wait for the next book, I'm pretending that this one never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"I can't believe I'm taking the time to write a review, but this book was so disappointing that I don't want anyone else to waste their money or time on it.It was superficial, disjointed, and not in the least bit entertaining or suspenseful. Characters are so superficial, that they are barely there. This seems like a D- assignment attempt from a freshman in college who has no talent. This book was so poorly execute that Cornwell, in the end, has to rely on an unlikely conversation between two of the characters to even explain what actually happened in the story. Apparently, there was a whole storyline that the reader could not pick up on because it was not alluded to until the last 4 pages of the book.Abysmal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing !!","review":"I'm a big Patricia Cornwall fan, but I was very disappointed in this book. Besides the fact that it is very short (the first thing you notice is the double-spacing), there was very little plot or character development, and it was mostly just very dull. Don't waste your money or what little time it takes to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not enjoy this book at all","review":"The story was terrible. She used to write great book but this one and a few others show a big change. Her books have gone downhill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing Cornwell book","review":"Like many others have already said, this book was a huge disappointment. I usually love Patricia Cornwell's books, likePostmortem, but \\"At Risk\\" doesn't even come close to her other novels. The characters weren't fully developed, the plot made little or no sense, and the ending was just kind of \\"there\\". If you're new to reading Patricia Cornwell read one of her other books instead. If you're a regular Cornwell reader, do yourself a favor, skip this one and save yourself the disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell's books so I decided to buy this one during a long layover in the airport. It was terrible! The plot was completely underdeveloped. Chapters would end with a little bit of suspense and the next Chapter would begin with the two detectives talking about how they solved the case. The characters were also poorly developed. I never write reviews but I really felt I have to here. I am still looking forward to her next book...hopefully it lives up to her usual talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring/awful","review":"I have never read a book by this author and after this book I won't read another of her books.

A real dissapointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I have listened to every Patricia Cornwell book in audio version on the market. Hearing the reader's familiar voice (Kate Redding), I settled back to enjoy another Patricia Cornwell intrigue. What a letdown this book is. The characters are dull and ridiculous, the plot is fluff - no substance - a real yawner!Very disappointing! Bring back Kay Scarpetta!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"This was a sad disappointment - don't waste your money buying it. I have always been a big fan but will think at least twice if at all about buying another book by Patricia Cromwell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At Risk is shallow","review":"From someone who loves Kay Scarpetta and the depth Patricia Cornwell puts into those novels, At Risk was a huge disappointment. I think the characters have depth potential that is never explored, but you feel as though you've been dropped in the middle of the story with little to no background or meaning behind what the characters do, feel or say. You feel as though you're dangling; you feel as though it was rushed. Not a typical Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Risk is the worst book Cornwell has ever written!","review":"Gosh, it used to be that I could not wait to read the latest Cornwell book because she USED to be a good writer. Now she seems to be cruising on her past performances and has become ultra lazy.I read this book in about 30 minutes because it was so poorly written. Larger then normal font told me I shouldn't have bothered to begin with and it was short in overall length. The characters were not well rounded and there was no real story to even sink your teeth into.Unless Kay Scarpetta re-appears very soon, I will never purchase another one of Cornwell's books. If you want a juicy, sink-your-teeth in and hold on for a wild ride, buy the latest Kathy Reichs books. SHE continues to write incredibly deep and delicious coroner who-done-it novels that are just so satisfying to read.Shame on Patricia Cornwell for becoming such a poor and lazy writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Risk","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and this is the worse yet. It was not written well and the story line was not interesting. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"It's hard to believe that Patricia Cornwell wrote this book. Everything about it is bad - the style of writing, the unlikeable characters, and the choppiness of the story line. It may be unrealistic to expect an author to crank out a great book everytime, but if the story is bad, please don't publish it. By wasting money on this book, it will make me reluctant to purchase the next Patricia Cornwell book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad...","review":"Patricia Cornwell's early work was top-notch, but most everything she's written lately has been sloppy, disjointed and feels like something she did while she was busy thinking about something else. I was hoping this one would be different since it was written as a series of magazine serials. But, this one was even worse.This book has so many plot holes and barely introduced characters that flit in and flit out again that it feels like the work of an amateur rather than the work of an author of more than 20 books. The main characters are just sketches, rather than being fleshed out. Is she such a commodity that her editors can't edit her any more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price!","review":"With the exception of \\"Preditor\\", I have read and enjoyed read Cornwell's books. This books was boring and uninteresting.I purchased the paperback and paid a normal price. However, the print was larger then a normal book and contained more blank pages. If, the print was small like other books and didn't have the blank pages, instead of 289 pages, it would be about 189 pages.I'm just glad I didn't pay for a hardcover version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the book?","review":"This reads more like an outline or sketch for a book. The characters are cardboard, the plot is barely sketched in, there are no real relationships amongst the characters (except perhaps Win & his nana), there are tons of possible developments that aren't even looked at (eg the relationship between Monique & Huber), etc., etc.Miss Cornwell: would you like to take this away & work on it for a year or so & give us a _real_ book?? What's happened? The early Scarpetta novels were terrific: real characters, real plots, real forensics. You _don't_ need to coast on your past work. That shows what you _can_ do. Now keep it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I am glad to know it wasn't just me. I was really disappointed by this book. I have tried to read everyone of Cornwell's books and picked this one up based on past experience. It does not even come close to her usual skills. It may be that it was written for serialization in a magazine. It should not have been allowed out as a book. Her publishers did not do her a favor by letting this go out to the public. It is possible that Win and Sykes could become interesting characters in a well developed book; they were interesting in this book and I liked the setting in Cambridge, but it wasn't enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Risk","review":"I didn't think this book was up to Patricia Cornwell's standard. Iwas very disappointed in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't sure Patricia Cornwell even wrote this!","review":"Wow! I was amazed at how bad this book turned out to be. I kept reading thinking that the twist would come and I'd find out what the \\"surprise\\" was. The surprise was that there was no suspense, no tying together of odd facts that popped up. When I got close to the end I actually read the covers and blurbs again to make sure that Patricia Cornwell really wrote this book. When I finished I really wondered why I bothered to keep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you think Cornwell actually wrote this awful book?","review":"I don't remember over the past few years being more let-down by a book. Like many of you, I purhcased this book as soon as it hit the shelves because Patricia Cornwell had written it. Actually, after I read it, I can not really fathom that she wrote this drivel. The characters are shallow, the plot is trivial, and I really am amazed that it made the New York Times Best Seller's list! Their reviewer must be sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I started this book, but before I got too far I decided to put it away for another day....or maybe another century. It was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the other 10 parts to the book","review":"Well, it states on the dustjacket that this is the result from a 15 part story that she wrote. After reading this I am starting to think it was supposed to be 25 parts and the other 10 got lost. This book lacks character depth and a stable story line. She jumps all over the place and makes incredible leaps of logic that would stump a member of Mensa. The first three quarters of the book are decent (though not up to her standard) but the last part of the book is at best a haphazard attempt at wrapping everything up in as few pages as possible.I am thoroughly disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"Buy At your own Risk\\"","review":"Shame on you Patricia Cornwell! That was the worst book I have ever read. I am a big fan of Patricia Cornwell books but I am so sorry that I wasted my money on this latest book of hers. In fact it was so bad, I threw it in the trash. No story what so ever. Once you finish the book (if you do) The first thing in your mind is \\"what was that all about?\\" My second thought was \\"did I miss 200 pages somewhere?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a real disappointment","review":"I love her books, however this one fell very, very short. I should have been tipped off by the thinness of it as well as the double spaced text. (A little bit made to look like alot?!) I kept reading, hoping something big would happen soon, but it never did. The ending came, but no climax nor rhyme or reason for the culprits who did it. Never did find out if Huber and Toby were involved for sure. It was such a waste of my time, that I finished reading it before going to bed and couldn't remember how it ended the next day!! She has done much, much better work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor reading","review":"Read the whole book waiting for the storyline to unfold, something good to come from a very skilled author, it just didn't happen for me. I still don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really Cornwell????","review":"I have been a big fan of her Scarpetta books and have enjoyed her other writings as well......but this book was almost unreadable. I guess everyone is entitled to a bad day (I'll bet she wrote this in one sitting). Glad that this wasn't the first Cornwell book I read, because I would have never read another after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whew! Borrowed, Not Bought, This Time!","review":"Once (okay, the last two or three times) bitten, twice shy, as they say. I only read this Cornwell offering because it was handed to me by a friend. Frankly, it was a bit better than some of Cornwell's recent dreck -- unless, of course, you expect a story to have a beginning and an ending. Add 50 pages introducing the characters and why the chief one is in Tennessee, then tack 50 more on the end to let us know how things all turn out for those characters, and you have a standard-length $25 novel, instead of 224 pages of serialized magazine rebound. And what's with the present tense story-telling (Oh, yeah, the magazine -- trying to make it immediate for the reader in the featurish style. Been there, done that!)? Please stop it! Bottom line: if I'd have paid for this book, it would have gotten a 1-rating. As it is, not as total a waste of time as it would be of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers At Risk Of Going Awol","review":"I have been an avid fan and collector for years of everything Cornwell. This new offering is disappointing because we have been treated to such good writing in all of her other books. When you have had the best anything less does not satisfy . The book was too short,too predictable,and did not seem like it was written by Patricia Cornwell . Although I consider myself a loyal fan I can not give this book a good review. Readers deserve better . Please ,bring back Scarpetta ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Wow...it seemed like Cornwell just needed to meet a deadline for a book. Not only was it a teeny tiny little book, it didn't seem like everything was fully explained by the end. She has a couple of good new characters but I hope she does more with them in her next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Patricia Cornwell is definitely in a slump. At Risk bears no resemblance to her earlier novels which were packed with non-stop action, intriguing plots and fabulous characters which drew us in on page one and kept us up most of the night. If only this exceptionally talented writer would return to these thrillers \\"Body Farm and Postmortem\\" being two good examples. Unfortunately in an assumed attempt at literary improvement, she's bound to lose loyal fans. Recently, I read Shadow of Death by Patricia Gussin, a newcomer to medical suspense and a physician with a medical student protagonist. I loved it and am switching my allegiance to Patricia Gussin until Patricia Cornwell gets her act together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this book - the normal twists and turns that you come to expect from Cornwell didn't seem to be there. The excitement of 'how does this connect' wasn't there either. I felt it was not worth the money and I'm sorry I ran to own it when it first came out. I understand artists want to stretch, but the formula that so many came to grow and love is not the plan for many of Cornwell's books anymore. I think this was an average work, and when I know that fabulous work is capable, feel that this was very ho-hum. Get it from your public library instead of supporting mediocre work."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW are you sure Patricia wrote this?","review":"OK I jump at the chance to read a Patricia Cornwell book. I am usually out looking for it the day it hits the shelf but this book would have been better served as a tree. It seems that either someone wrote this book and the publishing house stuck Patricia's name on it for ratings or Patricia has really had a serious lapse in judgement on what a good book is. I bet all the devoted readers of PC ran out and purchased this book only because she wrote it (I DID!!!). Maybe there is a leason in this. Don't judge a book by it's author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"I've never written an online review of a book before, but after finishing At Risk, I felt I had to warn others. This book read more like the preface of a possibly new series for Cornwell: the characters are thin, the plot line was vague, and the story jumped all over the place. I kept wondering if Cornwell needed money, so she slammed out this short story. Yes, short story -- don't let it fool you -- it's printed double-spaced with blank pages between chapters.

Thank goodness I didn't waste $7.99 on it. I didn't read the Amazon reviews before I read the book, but as I slugged through it, I kept thinking how bad it was. Wow. The reviewers are right. This book was bad. It was a fast read, sort of in the style of James Patterson writing, but the plot was ridiculously under-developed, jumping from scene to scene without much connection leaving the reader wondering why he or she is being dragged through this mess. Obviously Patricia Cornwell is a well established author, or no publisher would have put this in print. Her Scarpetta books are pretty good, but this one reads like she whipped it out over a long weekend.Please don't waste your time trying to make sense of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I picked up At Risk with excitement - it seemed a bit thin. I opened the first page - it was double spaced! Where was the meaty thriller I'd grown used to Patricia Cornwell delivering?

It read like a poorly written outline of a book.I have read Cornwall for years, enjoy Kay Scarpetta and crew, yet - even they have become parodies of themselves during the past few books. Apparently Patricia Cornwell has fallen prey to the same disease which many of our prolific writers have fallen prey to - the misbelief that they are so good they don't need an excellent editor.

I DO NOT recommend this book at all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sorry but stick with Scarpetta novels","review":"I've tried a few different novels by Patricia Cornwell and I really only enjoy the Scarpetta books. The rest are almost amature hour! Sorry while I count down to the next release I could and probably will not buy another non Scarpeta novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"well below average","review":"What a disappointment ! Very poorly written, gaping plotholes and very hard to believe story. Very thin, flimsy book that was very quick and easy to read. I felt cheated by the money and tims spent on it. It was obviously a book which had to be written quickly to make the publisher a quick buck. Rushed and poor. Very bad character development"},{"rating":"1","title":"disjointed and disappointing","review":"This was my first Patricia Cornwell read and quite a disappointing experience. I disliked the style of writing (first person, present tense), found the lack of personal pronouns irritating, and the short, choppy dialogue came across as unnatural. The scene changes were jarring and there was little to no suspense, contrary to the back cover blurb. With very little character development, I cared nothing for any of them. The story reads as though little effort went into creating it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't bother.","review":"While the characters of Win Gerano, his Nana, D.A. Monique Lamont, and Detective Sykes are very well drawn and interesting, the plot/mystery of this book is not. Just when I thought we were getting to the end of the 'exposition' portion of the book, we were having the whodunit explained to us...as well as the political machinations behind it. Also of annoyance: the fact that almost every character has a nickname, and Win has two!I was just confused the whole time I was reading this book, and for the kind of book one reads for escape purposes, one doesn't want to have to think so hard. Not a fan, won't be obtaining more of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Normally I love Patricia Cornwell but honestly this book really made me wonder what had happened. Maybe I have been spoiled by the Scarpetta series but this book didn't seem as well thought out and I never did connect with the characters. It seemed rushed and at all times I remembered I was reading instead of getting caught up in the action. I love to reread books but can honestly say that 'At Risk' will stayed archived in my Kindle and not be revisited."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Was A Hat Trick!","review":"This is the third book in a row I have read from Ms. Cornwell and I am utterly turned off. Enter Monique- a manipulative and power hungry district attorney and her favourite toss around pawn, detective Win Garano. The DA comes up with a self-serving scheme to accelerate her career (not sure what happened to that scheme in this book). The book description mentions a shocking violent act- someone rapes the DA- but this was not shocking at all, the woman was portrayed as being unashamedly selfish and greedy blood craving shark! The scenes in this book are mediocre and intrigue refused to enter the door. Horrid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring, shallow book","review":"I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and this one is by far the worst. I was disappointed that the character development was so poor. Usually she allows us to get to know the men and women in her books as if we were old friends...or enemies! Plus I never got that feeling of being there like I have with her other books. I'm particularly disappointed as I usually pass my Cornwell books along to my grown sons and this time I'd feel better just trashing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T TAKE THE RISK OF WASTING YOUR MONEY!","review":"I was a fan of Cornwell from \\"postmortem\\" on. Every one of her books had plenty of merit. After reading this book I had to ask myself if the writer really was Patricia Cornwell. It's very amaturish, sounding like a cheap romance novel written by an unknown. It is that bad ! From a male investigator who buys designer clothes in a thrift store, to a female DA who buys designer clothes, well, that's about the gist of the story. Boring, pointles and a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother with this one","review":"This was incredibly disappointing. The book was obviously thrown together with no effort to piece it together. It is dis-jointed and does not flow smoothly at all. It appears to be a college student's effort at a story and it should not have gotten a passing grade. Patricia Cornwell should be ashamed of letting this one get published. The Kaye Scarpetta series started out strong, but has fallen apart in the last few books. I have been disgusted with the last few books that I have bought by Patricia Cornwell and plan to wait to read the reviews before I bother to purchase another."},{"rating":"1","title":"By Far Not Her Best Work....","review":"This book falls in line with the \\"Southern Cross\\" series that Cornwell attempted several years back. Although, it was entertaining, it lacked her usual suspense and page turning qualities.

Not a \\"new book\\" purchase to rush right out and buy -- wait and buy this one used..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"I should have read the jacket cover more thoroughly becasue I did not know it was just a serialization. I am on a negative roll with books because this is the second disappointment in the last few weeks when reading some of my favorite authors.Anyway, this is useless trash - I agree with the reviewer who stated that this cannot be the same person who wrote all those execllent books early in her career. Pat, you don't need the money so why did you put this out. It is poorly written, hardly edited, makes no sense and leaves you scratching your head and looking at your empty wallet.Do yourself a favor and skip it. Let me be disappointed for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE, and then a little more horrible","review":"Disjointed, flat characters, no story.

But this book- I don't think I have read anything worse in my life. It looks like it took her all of five minutes to write it. I didn't finish it, I left in on the plane, and it will be a long, long time before I will ever read anything by Ms Cornwell again. If I could, I would like to get my money back, this book isn't even worth the paper it is written on.Suze, Holland."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Risk a waste of money and time","review":"I was SO excited to see a new Patricia Cornwell book. As i started reading it, i couldn't get hold on the story line and started wondering if SHE really wrote this book or if someone else did and she unfortunately put her name on it. I have loved every book she has written but this book is junk. Information pops up that appears to have been brought up earlier, but it hasn't, and the characters never fully develop. Usually i donate my used books, but i got to the end and threw it in the trash. I will read reviews of her next book before i invest money in it - maybe she has lost her touch - or can't focus anymore. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!","review":"I have been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years and have read all of the Scarpetta series and loved them. This book \\"At Risk\\" is a HUGE disappointment! The characters are unlikable and shallow, the plot is superficial and very forgettable.

Sorry, but \\"At Risk\\" is a loser!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At Risk....Of Losing Loyal Readers!","review":"I read a few bad reviews for this book but thought-Bad story, by Patricia Cornwell, Never! So, I had to see for myself and..... This book is HORRIBLE! I have always been a huge fan of Patricia Cornwell's great characters and ability to keep you guessing where the plot will twist and turn. The characters were weak and the story line was random and disjointed. I hope her future works improve or I, for one will save my pennies for more captivating fare!! Don't waste your time reading this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed again","review":"This book is very disappointing. What's it about anyway?? Patricia Cornwell should stop mass-writing her books and get down to writing books that have a story line, entertain and keep the reader absorbed. Bring back Kay Scarpetta; at least that's a page turner! A 212 page book selling for $21.95 NEW IS OUTRAGEOUS! It not worth $10. used.

There is not one element of plot or character to latch onto here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"This is the first Patricia Cornwell book I've read and probably my last. I always heard good things about this author so was excited to buy this new book. I kept waiting and waiting for the plot to start but it just never does; the characters are weak, the storyline non-existent. I wouldn't recommend \\"At Risk\\" at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this latest Cornwell book. Usually her novels are filled with suspenseful information. With every turn of the page I hoped it would improve but it did not. At the end, I felt that I had wasted my time. This book has the depth of a 12 year old. Ms. Cornwell started out writing her books with a central character - Kay Scarpetta and they were great whodunits. But somewhere she got lost - adding in hi-tech gadgets and people you didn't want to know or care about. Please get Kay Scarpetta back to a Crossing Jordan type plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Cornwell, Please Treat Your Fans Better!","review":"Like almost everyone else, I was disappointed by AT RISK. This book features almost no character development, a silly plot, and a downer of an ending. Many of the characters and situations in this book are just plain unpleasant.AT RISK started as a serialized short story in The New York Times Magazine. The book is a little over 200 pages and the print is very large. This book therefore reads quickly: I finished it in under two hours. Despite this fact, it is being sold as a full-fledged novel at a $21.95 price tag. Ms. Cornwell, you need to treat your fans better than this! We expect more book for our money.It's a shame this book hit #1 on the bestseller list when there are so many better crime novels out there. My only solace was that I checked this book out from the library, and didn't waste my hard-earned money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"I'm happy to see that Cornwell has again deviated from Scarpetta and Lucy and Benton (the once wonderful, but now stale group of paranoid narcisists). Winn is fresh and has the potential to be an interesting and enduring character. Too bad that once she strays outside the world of autopsy and forensic medicine, Cornwell loses her knack for criminal motivation. The bottom line motivation of one of the characters isn't right...[PSEUDO SPOILER ALERT]...There's no way that the hot prosecutor could have been guilty of insider trading. And I find it surprising that Cornwell would ever intentionally let her genius characters believe that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I have been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years, and have read all of her books. I was somewhat disappointed with Blowfly, I thought she could have done a better job with that. But with At Risk, I was so disappointed with this one, I don't know that I'll read Cornwell any more. The book to me was such an absolute waste of my time but I felt obligated to finish in hopes that it might get better somewhere before the end. No such luck. It goes to show, that the New York Times doesn't always know what they're talking about. Don't waste your money or your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"At Risk\\" is a disappointment","review":"I agree with most of the reviews, this is not Ms Cornwell's quality work.

I am sorry that I had paid as much as I did for this book. It was NOT up to Cornwell's usual par! If this was an attempt to feel out an audience for a new storyline with new characters, then magazine publication would have been better; many readers will hesitate to buy her new books in the future if they feel that they are being used as guinea pigs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"It appears to me that Patricia Cornwell is getting tired of her genre, and is simply spitting the books out now to fulfill a contract. At least, that is how it seems to me after reading this last book. The murderer was introduced mid-way through the slim volume-and it was so obvious! The main characters were implausible. When I opened the first page and saw how big the print was, I realized that I had just been taken for $7.99. It took me less than an afternoon to read this disappointing novel. Patricia, your last good book was Jack the Ripper-Case Closed. Maybe you should start writing non-fiction; I would be willing to read some of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I waited for this book to come out all spring.

It's above from Amazon or the other reviewers. I want to say I really do love most of Patricia Cornwell's books. This one just wasn't one of her best and it wasn't even good enough for me to let her slide. This book had holes in the plot. It felt like it was thrown together. The characters weren't developed and the book wrapped up so fast. You can tell this was just a book that she did for money or for the publishers to just get out of her contract quicker. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone because it is not part of a series like Scarpetta so you can do without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck......","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell's books. I buy them all in hardcover to read them as soon as they're published. I was looking forward to a new character other than Scarpetta.This has got to be the worst junk.

While she's not my favorite author (Tess Gerritsen gets that nod for mysteries), she is certainly far better than this book would lead one to believe. It's a good thing this isn't the first work I've read by her, or I would never have read another one. While I agree that the Scarpetta novels are getting old, especially since Lucy become a main character, this certainly wasn't the way to go to introduce us to a new cast. Very few of the characters were particularly likable, and the run-on sentences got very old very quickly. Come on, Patricia. You can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG Disappointment for Cornwell Fans","review":"Not so sure Cornwell even wrote this one. VERY disappointing. Not the usual character development or suspense. AND, the book is smaller, fewer pages, bigger margins, more spacious typesetting, big chapter gaps. Maybe Patricia didn't have much to say this time. If you're a Cornwell afficionado, either bypass this one or pretend a lesser writer produced this. Patricia, what were you thinking?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It had possibilities","review":"but half way through the plot just sputters and dies. I thought that Cornwell was spinning another of her early conspiracy-type plots that made Scarpetta great (before she became a pale imitation of herself) but she did not develop the plot or characters at all. With more emphasis on the plot and character development this book could have been pretty decent. I get the impression that P. Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta has gone the way of Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake. They both have become characters that you can't bring yourself to care about any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like most everyone else under contract?","review":"Yet another author falling under the pressure to release a book?

The reader can not emotionally connect with the characters. It is similar to drinking nonalcoholic beer, flat and disappointing.Many of my favorite authors are writing in a similar manner.

I heartily agree. Perhaps \\"At Risk\\" was merely a draft which was inadvertently published.

I, too, have not liked the most recent Scarpetta books - unbelievably twisted. I shall, in future, check Amazon reviews before buying any book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy, boring, undeveloped","review":"I typically enjoy Patricia Cornwell, but this book was a real disapointment. The plot is undeveloped, the characters boring and there was no sense of closure. Half the book appeared to be written in fragmented/incomplete sentences, which made it very difficult to get into. Overall, a very frustrating and pointless read. Don't waste your time. Or at least buy a used version if you intend on torturing yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The trouble with a successful author's work being treated like a publisher's 'product'","review":"This should have stayed a short serial, thin on plot, not tried to be blown up into a book with a hefty pricetag. Winn stars out fantastic, love his gran, though it is pretty silly to have her 'solve' the crime in some sense. But then Winn goes on the wild goose chase, and the whole book goes to hell in a handbasket. Every detail she gave to provide characterisation is thrown away as they all go to the liveliness of cardboard. Once again, the author is thin on motive, and the whole thing smacks of \\"Phew, glad I got that out of the way!\\"All of her most recent books have felt like that--I know her topics are seldom cheerful, but where is the fun, the wisecracks, of the early Kay, Marino and so forth? It is a shame she has descended into te dark realms of despair with her most recent books, but not surprising if she is expected to churn and grind out her next book like a hack writer meeting a deadline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"Cornwell's writing started out as great reading. Plot, characterization and style all contributed to books we looked forward to collecting. In the last couple of Scarpetta books, it seemed she stopped liking her characters and came up with implausible twists.In 'At Risk' - she denigrates all the characters as they're introduced and the writing style itself is choppy. It's going back to the library unread. Not surprising the wait list is long but the wait isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwall's books and find them mostly engrossing.

And afterwards, you'll ask yourself \\"why?\\"\\"At Risk\\" is unrelated to the Scarpetta series, which in the last few books has losing substance as well.Cornwell has been one of my favorite authors for years and I am so disappointed in her recent novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Risk put my attention at risk","review":"For years,I have been a faithful Patricia Cornwell reader, but her last two books have been far less interesting than her earlier ones. In fact I didn't even finish At Risk.

I certainly could not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time to read this","review":"This book was so poorly written, too sketchy at times.

It took me 2 hours to read...if I could get that 2 hours and my quarter back I would be a happy person! This is one of the worst books I have ever read! The characters suck and are very unlikeable. There's one character (a friend of Win's who's helping on the case and is in love with him)who is apparently only in the story so she can do the research for Win. The plot was ridiculous and so full of holes that it was almost impossible to follow. I hated this book so much that I had to write a review.

I kept wanting to slap myself every time I turned the page, irritated at how bad the story was, but even more irritating was that I kept hoping it would get better! This was just not book material and not up to Cornwell's regular standards. This won't keep me from buying another one of her books, but I'll definitely check out reviews first and not buy blindly.

I was excited to see that there were new characters and I did enjoy them - as much as there was to know about them. However the whole story did not develop very well, and it left me feeling like I missed a whole bunch of the 'potential' story.

I actually threw it in the trash rather than \\"recycling\\" it at my local used book store. I would never inflict it on another unsuspecting reader.

There were a couple of memorable sentences but it lacked her usual sparkle.

Loved the Grandmom, and after having move to Boston a few years ago it's fun to say. Oh the red line to Harvard Square. I've been there. That part of the book was nice as was the playing with Win's social awkwardness in acquisition of the finer things in life as a second hand rose. I relate to that, and I see it as a unique understanding of the New England outsider's path. I'm sure that there was a conclusion Just can't remember it. I was too focused at the end on finishing the darn thing and passing it off to one of my friends, just to get it out of my library. Give Win and Skyes a second chance.

The ending is great, I mean the climax. The post-climax, is ... too much blah-blah and explanations. But, all other is just great.

I enjoyed the first one and the second one, though I did not consider them to be great. The second one showed some real weakness towards the end. A few chapters into this one, the story came totally unglued. To say I hated it would be too mild. Too much is never explained or happens without reason. Simkin is the prime example of this. Who was he and what was motivating him? And why does he always do something other than what he says until the last part? I re-read most books at least once, but this one will never get picked up again by me. Thank goodness Weis and Hickman rebounded with the much better \\"Rose of the Prophet\\".

If one does not care for Jack and Suzy and the lifestyle they have, then please don't waste your money. But if you want to learn to win, then this is the book for you. I have read both of Jack's books and I am a better person, leader, and winner for it. In fact, I can't wait to reread it and use it again and again.

The critics in this space don't seem to be able to separate the principles from the person. Last I read, Mr. and Mrs. Welch are not forming a religion and looking to recruit followers. Instead, they have distilled the fundamentals of winning into an engaging and entertaing learning experience.

His only slightly veiled attempts to make it appear that he cared what others in the company had to say are ridiculous. He admits that anyone who used his style made it and those who did not were out. He made (more?)money by sacrificing jobs of loyal employees in profitable divisions, families (including 2 of his own), and the Hudson River (among other things). His last gasps included a company conviction on environmental issues, a failed merger, and adultery/divorce. This book makes one grateful that these types of CEOs are going the way of the dinosaur.

The book starts off with several good scenes that set up an interesting situation but the author isn't able to sustain his momentum and ultimately devolves into a disappointing us vs. them fight that nobody wins.Perhaps the author is stating that fighting a war is a lose-lose proposition. This is a generally true statement given the amazing destructive power of modern warfare. But he gets too caught up in the increasingly self-destructive motivations of his protagonists and the story becomes nothing but a chronology of the horror of war.I really can't express my disappointment at how the book went from the intriguing high-level scope of the game to watching a couple of factions beat each other to death. I finished the book but it was a constant struggle between boredom and disgust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for kids and adults!","review":"I purchased this for my 8 yr old. I love it so much that she hasn't had a chance to use it yet because I can't put it down. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't think that the instructions were hard to understand. The wheels make 4 different bracelet patterns but the procedure is the same for all 4 patterns. All that differs is where you put the colors on the wheel to start. The bracelets are made by repeating just a couple of simple steps over and over again. The hardest part is that you move two strings, turn the wheel, move two strings, etc and if you look away from the wheel and then look back it can be hard to tell where you left off. My daughter may have trouble with it because it does take some concentration and you have to remember to mark where you left off before you take a break. The wheels are made of durable foam so they are very lightweight. I would recommend this for ages 8 and above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute!","review":"I actually bought this for a little girl that asked for an art set off an angel tree at Chrismas.

Any Chicago fan (and I am a big one, all the way back to the beginning), would be familiar with much of the information within, most of which can be found on the numerous Chicago web sites. Very little background about the tours, song constructions and band members anecdotes are to be found. You never really get to find out what makes this band tick, what are their likes and dislikes. Using the albums to take us through Chicago's career is a good idea, but too much space has been wasted on telling us the band members and tracks plus a few lines of song lyrics for each album. This book is very much like that of the band themselves over the past twenty years with a few exceptions........not bad, but could try harder. It's the fans that pay the wages, please give them what they want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weaker Every Read!","review":"A neat little book that could have been so much better.Joseph is licking Chicago's boots and glosses over some interesting facts that are known to anyone with minor interest in this great band -like the fact that guitarist Dawayne Bailey was sleeping with Walt Parazaider's daughter and that Robert Lamm can be difficult to work with. This book had no depth at all, no character and poor quality photos. There were also spelling mistakes, including unforgiveable spellings of well-known people (Phil Ramon - who he?)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a ripoff.....","review":"I was looking forward to this book with great anticipation and was severely disappointed when it came out. There is little or no new material here that any good Chicago fan wouldn't already know and there are quite a few glaring factual omissions. The book totally ignores the 8 years of contributions made by guitarist Dawayne Bailey while spouting pages of info about Kiki Ebsen, a backup keyboard player on one tour. Most of the information in here seems to have been gleaned from the squeaky-clean view of the band that can be found on their web site. I was hoping for a book with a little more meat to it, not something that looks like it was published in someone's back room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This book is a great Chicago companion with lots of great, rare pictures, and indepth commentary on each Chicago album, that allow brief glimpses at the songwriting processes and little known facts.

This book is not quite what it could, and perhaps should have been. Concentrating predominantly on the vast recording output of the esteemed horn-orientated band this unfortunately glosses over the true 'inside' story and sticks to the basic facts that many fans already knew. A short summary of this sparce tome could perhaps be simplified as \\"they got together, they recorded an album, they numbered an album, they toured, someone left, someone joined ...\\" and that is it. A great, missed opportunity to satisfy the thousands of admirers who still avidly follow and collect this American institution, and yet ... when all is said done, this appears to be all there is available so, ironically, this still makes it an essential purchase. Hmmm ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicago:A book written from album covers","review":"Being a huge Chicago fan, the first record(yes it was vinyl) I purchased was CTA, I was disappointed by Ben Josephs' book. Hardly anything new was learned from the book, that could not have been discovered from reading the album covers. As the members of the band are roughly my age, I want to know how they handled success, who did they marry, how did they invest their millions, what are their hobbies, how many children do they have... I want to know more than a list of albums and their ranking on Billboard. The book could have been so much more if it would have let us meet the individuals who are Chicago. I met Terry's widow on Behind The Music, but Ben's book didn't give me any new information about who these people are. The marketing gimick to create a band image worked well to make the producers of Chicago rich, but now is the time to show us the people of Chicago. Ben, give it another shot---tell us things we don't know..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Crud","review":"This book is an absolute joke. There are so many misspellings and grammar errors - the photos are completely low budget and cheezy black & white xeroxes - the band did not contribute any info or interviews - the majority of info came from road technicians - which isn't such a bad thing because I respect and love both Kiki Ebsen and Bobby Ludwig - it just seems odd that instead of interviewing the band Chicago and their current and past band members, the \\"author\\" interviews their crew. I also wonder what is Ben Joseph's real name because I don't take this guy's credentials very seriously. This book proves ANYONE can put out a book, sell it and sit back and call yourself an author.

An enjoyable read","review":"Ben Joseph's \\"Chicago:Feelin' Stronger Every Day\\" is an enjoyable read, and not without merit. It's been many years since I bought my first Chicago album, and I still love their music (mostly the early stuff CTA - Chicago VII). This book fills in a lot of holes in my memory, and has inspired me to go back to the albums and give another listen to some of the material not on my home-made minidisc compilations. I enjoyed the brief glimpses into what was going on behind the scenes of the group's early days; the book disappoints, however, in the one area that is most important to me: it fails to provide much discussion of the music itself. Chicago's sound is distinctive. The arrangements cannot be confused with any other horn band. A discussion, even non-technical, of how this sound was achieved and how they integrated all of the disparate elements was what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smith 3 stone sharpening system","review":"While the stones themselves are worth owning the holder for them is about as cheaply made as, well you could not imagine it being more lame.

When I emailed Strollerbabies they told me that I would be refunded but less a restocking fee and less the $8 something it cost them to ship it because they couldn't sell it as new. Well, I'd hope they didn't resell this at all. I wrote them a note saying that this was unfair because I didn't send it back because I didn't want it I sent it back because it's defective. Well, none of that has mattered so far anyway because as of 2/10/09 I still have not received a refund. I emailed them asking them to get it taken care of, providing the tracking information.

Now 5 months later she just is starting to eat solid foods, so I used it for the first time. First off I agree with the other reviewer, the lid gets stuck easily. Very annoying! Second, the motor turns on as soon as it is plugged in and the only control you have is to 'turbo' speed. 'Turbo' is a nice feature as it helps get all of the food pureed, but I wish the motor didn't turn on until I pressed the button.

I even asked for the Baby Breeza, which is pricey thinking I would use it and like it a lot more. WRONG! I find myself gravitating towards this food mill for each meal and even when I prepare food for the week. It is sooo easy to use, easy to clean (though I use it so often I would love to have a second container and blade so I don't have to wash so often), and it purees really well!

Here's some reasons why I love it:* It's small enough I keep it right on my countertop to blend up any fruits, veggies, or meals we're having.* The two cup bowl, blades and lid are all dishwasher safe!* It is so easy to use! Just place the lid on, lock it in place, put the motor on top and press down. You can pulse the food or keep pressing down to the desired consistency you'd like.* The price is pretty hard to beat, particularly since other more expensive baby mills don't seem to do as great a job.I really love this baby mill and am so glad I purchased it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love it!

It doesn't make any food thin enough for him to eat. Everything that I tried to puree including carrots, peas, bananas etc, came chunky. Not only that but it also took forever for everything to process. There is no automatic button like a blender has either. So if you want to make something really really thin, you have to stand there and hold the button for like 5 minutes. On top of that the motor is in the top of the machine where the button is so if you have it running for like 5 minutes it gets really hot. Hot to the point where you cannot even hold onto it.

It's easy to use and clean, doesn't take up a ton of space in the dishwasher, and is very handy for making smaller batches of food.

I haven't even read the whole thing yet because the authors tone in some parts just puts me off. This book from what I have read so far seems more to be about women's politics and thinly veiled male bashing rather then really having the ability to connect a reader to the Goddess in any tangible way. (This part is not ment to offend), but what is up with all the references to lesbianism? How does that fit into Wicca as a religious practice? And why does it even need to be mentioned at all in this book? = Aka the Dianic Great Rite? I'm no prude about anyones sexual preferences, to each there own, but in this book it just seems to throw you away from the ultimate purpose of becoming closer to the feminine divine.

I learned facets of his life I did not know of. I beleive he put his own spin on alternative rock and his life is interesting for that reason. That is quite an accomplishment. The dynamics with his father and his father's music are covered. In covering so much ground they generalize a little too much from time to time.

This man tries to use his past association with Goldwater for legitimacy, but he sounds no different from the liberal kooks like those you encounter in the liberal blogosphere.

I just wish someone would have written a similar expose' of the Democratic Party during the early sixties.Castro has been in power over forty years because of the ambivalence and cowardice of a Democratic president and his government, and we are in Irak today because of the greed of corporate America. I wonder if Cuba's fate would have been different during the Bay of Pigs invasion if at the time, America would have had a republican president instead. The truth is that politics, regardless of affiliation is nothing but war without bloodshed.

We can all see how well that turned out.The authoritarian instinct is strong in both U.S. parties, for opposite reasons. Fortunately, it is waning, and the traditional liberal instinct (liberty, limited government, etc.), is greatly on the increase in those who call themselves conservatives.Dean's book is a portrait of a time and a group of people who are fortunately NOT the strength of the conservative movement, but were the majority of who he is with.If you genuinely want to understand modern conservatism, I strongly recommendLiberty and Tyranny: A Conservative Manifesto.

Although, if you are a bit flexible you can work your way to being able to do certain poses."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I am just a beginner at yoga and I love this book because the instructions to the different asans (poses) are clear and understandable, AND the more complicated poses are explained through drawings and photos, not just text. You don't need to keep track of all the steps in your head as you move into the pose, it's all there in a series of drawings. So if you are a very visual person, I recommend this book. This book takes you through the most basic of asans to the most complicated. It has all kinds of drawings and photos, as well as chart-like things at the end of each section with a simple outline of the pose and a picture so you can put together your own yoga session. This book also has background on Yoga and things like diet and breathing. Some of the models are so lithe they are gross looking, and some of the poses will make you say \\"Holy Hell!\\" to yourself, but secretly you will want to learn to do them too. A great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to YOGA for anybody","review":"I've wanted to take up yoga for a couple of years now, and this was the book that finally helped me to get started. It is very comprehensive in its exposition of the fundamentals of yoga, and the numerous illistrations really help you feel sure that what you're doing is right, which could be a concern if you are practicing by yourself. However, I would have liked to see a longer section on yoga diet. Nevertheless, I recommend the book to anybody that is even remotely interested in yoga. The pieces of yoga history, proverbs, and inspirational thought will give you insight into that teaching, which has survived ancient times and has reached our modernity as relevant as ever. And even as you become more knowledgeable and proficient in yoga, and buy other readings, this one is bound to remain a good companion of yours for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIVANANDA YOGA","review":"This is an excellent book on yoga. For years I've tried to get started with yoga but didn't know exactly how to do it. This book gives a step by step approach which serves as a guide as to how to get started. Not only are the physical positions described very well but also diet, meditation, and the spiritual aspects are treated admirably. I've read the book several times and am making good progress. I was so impressed with the book I bought a copy for my son, my daughter, and one for a friend. If this isn't the best book ever written on yoga, I'll be surprised. It is truly an inspirational book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the beginner or the advanced!","review":"This book covers everything from simple to complex asanas, with everything you need to know about breathing, diet, meditation techniques, and even has a section on pregnancy, childhood, and old age.

However, there's an astonishing error on page 117, where Hopkirk discusses the Lama's stay \\"at a temple belonging to the Thirthankars, or Jains. Founded by Buddha's own son, the faith of the Jains...\\" The Buddha's son, Rahul, did no such thing. Jainism has no founder, but a series of 24 preceptors stretching back into time well befor the Buddha's own day. The last, Mahavira, was a contemporary of the Buddha's. It's distressing to see such an elementary error being made by an author as distinguished as Peter Hopkirk. He might as well have claimed that Judaism was founded by the son of the Christ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Flawed Masterpiece.","review":"The title sounds strange and vague but that is what I feel about this novel. It is a slow but an interesting novel if an individual might just have the patience to let the story/plot build up. Its considered to be Kipling's masterpiece and I will vouch for the same opinion. The range of emotions, the characterisation, the development of plot are all technically perfect, but the novel wants genuine feeling. True, that Kipling presents a very correct picture of 'colonial' India, but the picture is presented through a glass tainted with colonialism. Though Kim's love for India is very real and genuine, its imperialistic under tones are difficult to ignore.All and all I would say it is a masterpiece albeit flawed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unlike previous reviewer I got a purple one, but the enameling was bad quality and the black outline on the star was missing in places, and there was still scrap from the casting around the edges.

It's well written and pretty easy to follow. So if you are new to programming for the Mac, this is definitely one to check out. It helps if you have a basic understanding of Objective-C - if you know the Objective-C syntax the examples in the book are a lot easier to comprehend. Plus the projects are interesting enough to keep your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book out there on a confusing topic","review":"Cocoa can seem like a brave new world to those accustomed to pure programming, since Cocoa is a combination of programming in Objective-C and stringing together and customizing prefabricated visual components. So it was comforting to read this in chapter one: \\"Before going any further, assure yourself that you are up to the challenge and that some things are just hard.\\" You should already know Objective-C before you read this book. If you don't, \\"Programming In Objective-C\\" by Kochan is a good book on the subject. Just be prepared for the difficulty level going through the book to be more like hills and valleys than one long ascension. This is not to say that the book is not a good one, it's just that since Cocoa is actually an umbrella for a number of technologies that it is really hard to start from the beginning since there really isn't one. There are plenty of examples though, and the author makes the subject as clear as is humanly possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I am a begining Mac programmer and was recommended this book by a senior software engineer. It is a very good start if you want to learn the nuts and bolts of Cocoa programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is one of the best written programming books I have ever seen. Aaron does a great job of presenting a robust set of material that is targeted at proficient programmers that are new to Objective-C and Interface Builder as well as those with significant experience. There are many examples of Objective-C approaches with comparisons to their Java or C equivalents. Being a Java programmer this has been very helpful. I highly recommend this book to new Cocoa Programmers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought recordings like this were non-existent...","review":"If you are looking for an overblown, melodramatic version of the Messiah look elsewhere! This recording is understated and thoroughly enjoyable. The balance between choir and orchestra is great, the diction clear (I listened to this while getting a tooth drilled and I could still understand every word), and the trebles (sopranos) don't go sharp or overpower everyone else. The soloists are simply telling a music story and don't seem to insist on overdoing their parts to show off their prowess. I had never bothered to look for a recording of the Messiah as I thought they were all hopelessly overwrought. I am happy to say this recording proved me wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent Performances, Superb Sound","review":"This version of Handel's great work, the Messiah, is captivating. The recording, from 1980, is a rare combination of absolutely sterling performances with a crisp clear sound that cannot be topped. Hogwood chooses just the right tempo for each piece and they flow together spectacularly. A real highlight is tenor Paul Elliot. His amazingly clear tenor coupled with the boys choir make for a heavenly combination. In fact, the entire cast is superb. I have found recordings I have enjoyed in the past but every so often you get one that is way above everything else. This is in that league and I cannot recommend it more highly. IMHO, it has become a definitive version of this sparkling work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's on video","review":"I can't add anything to the comments below; I can only agree with them. I have essentially the same performance on videotape that I bought in 1986 by Hogwood and the same soloists. It was made in Westminster Abbey with its choir. I love watching the boy singers has they concentrate on the performance. It was last available from Kultur, but I don't think they have it anymore. I'm hoping that it will be reissued on tape and DVD soon. If enough people express interest perhaps it will."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Messiah, Hogwood et al.

There should be 23 tracks on disk 1. The movements are not there -- the tracks are missing, not combined.I ordered the first set in mid-September 2009. This review will become irrelevant when, or if, new complete sets are supplied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Messiah","review":"This performance of Messiah is my favorite because it is understated, performed on authentic instruments i.e. the instruments as Handel knew them, and supported by excellent program notes including some snippets of the score when needed to clarify a point.Is anything else needed to enjoy this classic (other than the perennial argument as to whether it should be considered a Christmas or an Easter piece)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glenn's Chevy tune up and repair book","review":"Great Book, i have Glenn's Ford book that i've used for years.. would highly recommend.

Ninja and Yaoi- Awesome, huh? I have to admit the artwork is very beautiful.I was a bit confused about the characters because they shifted suddenly, there is one chapter about one pair of ninjas, then a whole bunch with another, and then another random story.I have to say that I liked the third story the best. But maybe because I feel that was the prettiest one. Miyuki is so beautiful. Otherall, I feel that this is a fluffy, smutty novel. I wouldn't recommend this for people who like the basic shonen-ai, this novel gets hot. ^^:So, my review is if you like pretty things you'll like this book. If you are looking for plot, maybe you should look for another book. It's so hard to find though, good yaoi and good plot with good artwork style. It makes you appreciate it when it comes around.4 stars for pictures,2 1/2 for plot ^^:"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"The idea itself may sound interesting but in my opinion, the author squandered it. While Shinobu Kokoro is supposedly about a group of ninjas, don't let that fool you. There's about as much here about ninjas as there is about tea-- both are mentioned in passing.There may be slightly more plot to this book than to Level-C manga, but don't bet on becoming excited over any actual sneaking-and-spying adventures. This book is all about the sex between the supposed ninjas."},{"rating":"2","title":"my new fav author!","review":"Wow, is this writer so wonderful or not?

Bravo, Julian Rothenstein! Every year brings another mind-expanding and eye-popping selection of illustrations in a format that is not only fun to use on a daily basis, but becomes impossible to throw away at the end of the year. The Redstone is in a class by itself, a classic that gets envious looks when I flip mine open on a conference table.

Desert Sand comes off as a stong dingy yellow, but overtime will fade into a more sand color (Same with most desert Shemaghs). One thing I perfer on this one over other Tactical Shemaghs, the frills are tided strips of cloth as opposed to extra threading tied off, harder for my dogs to tear it up if they get ahold of it (They love tearing up things with stringy frills), and less snags when walking through desert bush.Pros:WarmAfordable (can get a couple for the same price as single others)DurableLess snags and thread dragscons:More like cotton cloth then knitNot as thick as some others (not that big of an issue for a desert Shemagh)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money.","review":"Impressed with the scarf, color is good, and larger than expected.

It doesn't overheat your face and keeps the sun off your neck when its hot out...and yet it keeps your face from freezing when it's cool out. I plan on bringing this backpacking this summer for those reasons and because it looks great as an everyday scarf.I made my order through ArmyUniverse and they were extremely helpful in helping me with my order. There is (or used to be) a bug where ordering \\"Olive/Drab\\" would get you a \\"Foliage\\" colored shemagh. I contacted ArmyUniverse about this and they corrected my order right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shemagh bit not a great one","review":"Having been to the Middle East and purchased shemaghs on the streets for $1 this one is overpriced. I wouldn't pay more than $5 for it in the states. It is difficult to find them state side but that doesn't mean you should sell an inferior product. It's relatively thin and the weave isn't very tight.My shemagh was yellow not close to the tan color I was expecting. The quality of the product was okay and it was shipped expeditiously but I was really disappointed in the color. In case you couldn't tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're bored and like tying tiny knots...","review":"...then this is the shemagh for you. When I got this thing, there were already a few places that were unraveling. One was extremely bad, and took quite awhile to fix without further damaging the shemagh. Basically I tied a tiny knot to stop the unraveling in each spot, which was slightly time-consuming. After tying off all of the unraveled spots, I removed the tag and washed it. After being washed and dried, the fabric turned out to be noticeably thicker and softer than when it came in the mail, though not nearly as thick and soft as my shemagh from Best Glide ASE. If not for the unraveling, this would have gotten four stars from me, but just barely. It can be used, but why not pay a couple of bucks more for one that you don't have to spend half an hour mending?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Olive Drab Shemagh Amazing!!!!","review":"The OD shemagh is amazing!!

Upon trying to return it, the seller Private Island didn't offer to pay any shipping for an exchange, so I just kept the thing.

Used it while making minor repairs on my 18 wheeler, and it proved an awesome wardrobe addition. I moistened it, and stayed cool in 107 degree heat. While I would love a 46\\"x46\\" size, due to me having a larger neck, and head. It will definitely be included in my clothing bag. After the first wash, It did not have any extensive color wash off. And the color stayed the same shade. I ordered purple, and will be definitely ordering a variety of colors. Giving 4 out of 5 stars. It would have been 5, but the 42\\"X42\\" size is going to prove to be an issue when I go for a complete head cover. Otherwise.

But, that's just me being too picky probably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tactical Shemagh","review":"I was interested in this for scenario paintball and it's use by special forces.

She did not realize is was a series. The book is based in 1999 and it was written in 1983.The story is about the future from a 1983 point a view. As we all know its 2009 and the future did not turn out about way Mr.Johnstone wrote about,so you should take it with a grain of salt.The main characters keep youre intrested.

The book is well written however I found the reliance on flashbacks to the plot of Out of the Ashes being repeated throughout the book verbatim lended itself to me skipping through the flashback sections. While not desiring to be President of the US, Ben Raines attempts to once again rebuild his Rebels and what remains of the Tri-States incorporating the same political and moral ideologies he presented within his initial body of work. While the book could be read by itself, I would highly recommend following the series in order to avoid confusion and understand the plot and background in more detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ashes are Hot","review":"William W. Johnstone's second Ashes novel strongly continues the saga began in Out of the Ashes. This time around, the Rebels, defeated but not crushed by the fall of the Tri-States, are secretly rebuilding their forces under the watchful eyes of a socialist dictatorship.Hundreds of federal police forces are carrying out brutal raids against innocent people, and a mercenary army is helping to keep the peace. Meanwhile, a third enemy is lurking in the shadows.The story and action are strong and believable. I also see the strong need for an armed population, and the elements and warnings against socialism are as strong today as they were when this book was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible with Lion","review":"\\"The product is NOT compatible with Lion OS.

I emailed the company, which is in England, and they wrote back saying that they've noticed this is sometimes a problem. . . . ?????? They said I'd be contacted within the month by someone who would try to work it out with me, but I was never contacted.

Somehow back then, the Irish and Italian mafias were just a part of life in the city. Now, after reading Kevin's narrative I am shocked and appalled by the deaths that they were responsible for. The thought that these killing were so calculated and bloody and that after committing these awful acts, they just went home and had dinner with their families or visited their girlfriends, makes me realize these men definitely were psychopaths. The book is very well written and Kevin's honestly makes it a very good portrayal of Jimmy Bulger, Stevie Flemmi and others. I am writing a book myself about that time and this book has been very helpful in my research. These men were brutal. The title fits the book well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly, BRUTAL.","review":"Brutal, is a prefect name for this book. Its a first hand account, of the still most wanted Whitey Bulger, and his clan of South Boston murderous thugs. It reads as many \\"snitch\\" mob books do, but the difference is these guys are Irish. And they do it in a much more reckless and brutal way. If you like mob stories, and don't mind the bravado by the author, who happens to be what would be considered the lowest of the low, (a rat), then this book will captivate you. It's short, but to the point. Not as bad in the braggard depatment as Sammy The Bull's similar style account. A Bargain at Amazon, and that makes it definetly worth checking out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn---","review":"Well,I finally got around to reading Weeks' book.

Maybe,we'll soon be getting a Kevin Weeks action figure.Out of all of them,'Black Mass' by Lehr and O'Neil, and 'Rat Bastards' by Red Shea are probably the best. Shea probably summed it up when he gives Kevin the nickname \\"Two Weeks\\"; because that's how long it took Kev to flip. I'm surprised it took that long.But that's to be expected these days. It used to be \\"do the crime-do the time\\". Not any more. Now it's \\"get busted-rat out all your friends-get your book deal\\".

Whitey Bulger is still loose and people like Kevin Weeks probably know where he is. I don't have much sympathy for Weeks. He hates Howie Carr probably because he reports the truth as he knows it to be. Anyway I read Howie's book which I recommend. I thought New Jersey had too many criminals mingled in politics. I was wrong because Massachusetts had the Bulger Brothers. Regardless of how different they are, both brothers abused their power for themselves. One, Whitey, far more than his brother in politics who also got away with crimes but I don't think murder.

They were always preying on girls without fathers, or girls from the projects or from crazy families, it was never girls from \\"good\\" Southie families.It sickens me to see people shaking his hand at book signings and laughing it up with him.

I never liked the author at all throughout the book. Throughout the book he discusses how he grew into the life of crime, and almost wishes to gather sympathy from the reader. No sympathy here.

I put very expensive lithium batteries in the safe expecting they would last at least a year. I have recently discovered the batteries already need replacement. Batteries were dated good till 2012 and were un-used when installed. Not big problem until you go to use the safe in an emergency and find the batteries are to low to properly open the safe. Again, great product and I plan to order the power cord \\"now\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality issues?","review":"I am sorely disappointed. The first safe I purchased did not work with brand new batteries. I returned the safe to the store where I purchased it to get an exchange (one hour drive each way). The second safe powered up with the new batteries but the keys that were provided did not work - they were the correct keys but the lock was broken and would not open the safe.

Had the thrill of my life last week seeing Angie at a film noir fest in San Fran. being interviewed. They screened 'The Killers and Point Blank' with Marvin and Casavetes. At 80, Angie has class, style, clear headed humor directed towards herself and descreetly towards others intermixed with a humble descency. This classy actress has not let her accomplishments go to her head. I remembered why I worshiped her like the Goddess she is.

Will not stay attached, suction cups are cheap and too small for the weight of this toy. The idea is good but the result was very poor. You have to pump and pump and pump many many times before the water comes out the shower head and it is very hard to push not suitable for a child because they don't have enough strength and that's if they don't lose interest while you sit and pump away trying to get it to start. Then once the water is in the toy and you can pump it out the shower head it doesn't hold it so if you stop pumping you have to start all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"Received this shower thinking it would be a nice way to have the kids having running water. However the ball that's supposed to suck up the water floats, so you have to hold that down under the water.

In addition to the end that is supposed to stay in the water but floats instead, the 2 suction cups meant to hold the toy to the bath tub or wall are too small to hold it steady, so it slips easily out of place. It is not that easy for small hands to pump and to get water coming out of the shower head you have to pump it at least 20 times to prime it before the shower starts to flow. Needless to say, by that time, the toddler is pretty much bored with pumping."},{"rating":"2","title":"welder/owner/operator","review":"Excellent for ventilating anything from your home to fumes from job site.

She runs out of anything useful to say after a couple of chapters and sets off to tell the life-story of her flower-growing acquaintances without paying much notice to the technical and scientific detail of their various ventures.

Space Age Playboys were formed in Los Angeles but this live concert was performed on Christmas Day, 1998, in London, England. The ten tracks are done well & Clarke's between-song banter is vintage Kory Clarke. The songs are high-energy. The delivery is high-energy. And the crowd's response is high-energy. But this band just wasn't able to capture that something special that catapults rock bands to the next level.

This book discusses Community Policing in a small Neighbourbood town and discusses the differences between Community Policing Officers (known as Neighbourhood Policing Officers) and Patrol Officers, specifically the gender differences. The author investigates if a particular gender is more suited to one of the two types of policing. The study is qualitative, which I prefer over quantitative. This gives the readers a strong understanding of the experiences of male and female Neighbourhood Policing Officers and Patrol Officers and the gender issues they face.

This novella about two men who, during the second World War, were imprisoned for their participation in an attack on a German controlled power installation in France. The son of one of the captured men tells the story. The father is a schoolteacher who moonlights as a clown. His son is embarrassed by the clown persona. As the story unfolds, the son learns of the importance of the clown in his father's life and eventually wear's the mask himself albeit for different reasons. There is nothing special or highly creative about this text. The book contains the French version and the English translation of the story. As with any story translated from its original language, its difficult to tell if some of the meaning was lost in the translation. Perhaps that is the case with \\"In Our Strange Gardens\\". The best thing about this story is the length. Can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that helpful","review":"I was hoping this book would have more to offer.

I LOVE that they added It's Deductible into the total package. Their price was very affordable for that (for those that like the TurboTax and Quicken programs). [...] The instructions are clearer than ever, the online chat help was actually pretty quick, even when I logged on during peak activity time. GREAT product. The detraction of 1 star was due to the fact that they didn't offer rebates this year for any filing fees. The price of the product was GREAT, don't get me wrong (Fed, State and It's Deductible),[...]. And yes, I know there are free filing tax softwares out there, so maybe I'll look into them. But if you don't mind spending the little bit of money (it is deductible, too) for all of the features, it's well worth it for the ease and security."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turbo Tax Deluxe","review":"I found this software to be very good. First, one updates the software online, then by answering the basic questions relating to your status, income and expenses the software completes the various forms that make up your tax return. After auto error checking your return, the software gives you the option of electronic or manual filing.I did find some items, such as Royalty Depreciation, that were not covered by the questions; however, the software is written so that one can manually input these items and all forms are adjusted accordingly.I would definetly recommend the delux version of this software since it includes your state return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in recent years","review":"I found this year's Turbotax product to be the best of them over the past few years. It is organized much better for skipping around (if you don't have all of your information handy,) and has better help information. I had a relatively simple return (joint, bank interest, student loan interest, mortgage interest, and some education expenses), and the product worked nicely for both MA state and federal returns. Note that it will cost you an additional fee to actually file the returns (I beleive it was around $10 each.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No more TurboTax","review":"After using TurboTax for 8 years, this year I will be hand filing.

It asks questions - you answer them. The problem is, the software misses some things and if the user doesn't realize it they may get a much smaller refund. There were 3 incidences on my tax forms where I had to find the forms to enter the information because I knew it was missing (TurboTax missed it though). The biggest problem would have cost me $. The Intuit support people could not figure out how to fix that one so I ended up returning the software.

You have to enter each section of the forms (the 1099-int, then the 1099-div) one at a time. So I'm sitting here with three statements and instead of entering one form at a time, I have to enter section one of form 1,2 and 3. Then section 2 of form 1,2,3. Awful.I found the product generally hard to navigate unless you're doing basic things and throughout the interview process I'm asked abotu upgrading to other products which is annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a scam, shame on Intuit","review":"I purchased this tax software under the false presumption that e-filing would be included in the price, just like IT USED TO BE! The actual data entry process was \\"ok\\", a bit buggy as I had some K-1 income which TurboTax handles quite poorly. Of course that works fine if you buy the more expensive software, but if they claim it works, yeah, it does, barely.But then the ultimate blow... after all of the effort that took me weeks to prepare, it was time to file the return. What's this? I have to pay another $30 to e-file? And here I thought the IRS was ENCOURAGING people to e-file! Hey, I am in California where one MUST earn more than $50 to make a decent living, so who qualifies for the so-called \\" e-file for FREE \\" here? They gotchya!So it looks like I will have to send my tax return in by good old US mail, I'll wait the 3 or 4 weeks for the refund. Thanks for nothing, TurboTax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I have been using Turbo Tax for years, but this will be my last year. Why? Because the \\"one-click update\\" feature doesn't work. It crashes with a Windows general protection fault, and fails to update the Turbo Tax program with the latest tax forms.

What a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intuit Let Me Down","review":"I have used TurboTax for Mac for the past several years with no problem. This year I wasted my money.

So long Intuit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother unless your taxes are dirt-simple!","review":"I used TurboTax last year and liked it. This year however I needed to see how the taxes worked out in alternative scenarios, e.g. filing jointly vs. filing separately vs. head of household. The program has no provision for doing this! You have to start a new return and enter everything from scratch, plus it messed up on some simple deductions. And to get help by phone you incur a charge. Bah. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to pay taxes!","review":"My husband and I used an account the last couple years to figure out our somewhat complicated finances. This year though I was determined to do it myself and was able to with the help of Turbo Tax. It helped answer all my questions and walked me through the sections I wasn't quite sure of. Before submission, I doubled check this year's return against last year's and it matched pretty well. Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Turbo Tax---DON'T DO IT!!","review":"After wrestling with updates for the better part of two days, I finally started my taxes.

The program works great. The review section is a pain as it starts from the very beginning if you change some data.My main complaint is I had to purchase a new computer as I was using system 9.2 on the mac and it would only work on 10.2.8 or later. Intuit has done this before where they require updated computers that still work with all other programs. It's great to have a new computer but I didn't spend $35 from amazon for the program-I spent $1235 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Forewarned","review":"The software works fine and is easy to use. But be careful. The product is very misleading. It gives the impression that you can e-file your taxes for free. This is completely false. You must pay $ to e-file your taxes. Next year I will use Tax Act instead. It is actually free to file your taxes using that software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware--No E-File Rebate with TurboTax!!","review":"I was dismayed to find that this year's Turbo Tax does NOT offer a rebate for one free Federal e-file. As others have pointed out, this effectively raises the price of the TurboTax by $ plus tax for a product that was already more expensive than TaxCut and other similiar products.Intuit quietly changed their \\"policy\\" without a lot of fanfare hoping nobody would notice. I like many others purchased the product fully expecting the reabte to be there as it has been every year since the feature was first introduced.The good news is, this finally motivated me to try H&R; Block's TaxCut Deluxe product for the first time this year. Not only was it cheaper than TurboTax, but it works just as well as TurboTax and it includes the free Federal E-File rebate that Intuit no longer offers. After 6+ years of using TurboTax, now I'm wondering what took me so long to switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"E-Filing Ridiculously priced","review":"I have used Turbo Tax for years and stick with it because you can import all of the previous year's info. This year may be my last because of the exorbitant price they are charging to e-file. $ for fed & state plus another $ service charge. Fine I will mail in the paperwork. Why should I pay $ to make their jobs easier? It probably saves the government a ton of money when folks file electronically and the \\"service charge\\" from turbo tax should be included in the price of the product. I wonder how many customers will be lost over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st time user - very disappointed so far, but can't even finish taxes on it :(","review":"I received this product last week, but as of 1/24/06, Turbo Tax still claimed that the education deduction/credit page is unavailable. It oversimplifies deductions while not offering useful information (like not being able to make certain deductions unless they reach 2% of your AGI). I don't feel confident in this program and plan to do my taxes by hand the old fashioned way to make sure they're right. Makes it mighty hard to finish my taxes and as for making you pay again to file, I'm of one mind - printing and mailing my return to the IRS myself b/c I don't want to give this company any more of my money.

It's been a long, drawn-out bait and switch. Intuit's loyal TurboTax customers are likely going to remain locked in to using TurboTax since the time, labor, cost and frustration of switching products will be higher than the increased price of TurboTax and online return submittals.

I ended up doing my taxes myself, and when i was done, i double checked my figures because i thought i made an error. I didn't. The turbotax software is supposed to double check your file to make sure you get back as much as possible. Thankfully i didn't use it, because i would have got $900 less if i had used turbotax.

It claims a 9 meter lift which should have tipped me off since that is the theoretical max for a suction pump. I tested it at ground level (no lift) and it worked so the pump is not broken just does not have the ability to lift water. If you need to lift water more then a few feet this pump is not for you.

I don't care what the metronome markings are; to me it is WAY too fast. The last movement is just a race to the finish; an unsatisfying, lightweight, superficial sounding one at that.Although removing all the vegetable shortening, corn syrup, artificial colors and artificial flavors that has been placed on top of Bach's music is a good thing, Beethoven's music is more like wine in that all those changes in smell and flavor that build up over time enhances it. The authenticity movement in this case removes all this and we are only left with grape juice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than stellar","review":"I was interested in this cd because I have heard the Academy of Ancient Music play Mozart and Haydn and have been very impressed. I wasn't so impressed by this performance. While I see the general value of using an \\"authentic\\" approach to Beethoven, there are often contradicting messages written on the scores of the symphonies concerning tempo. Beethoven might have written a very fast metronome marking for a piece, but also might have written \\"Allegro ma non troppo\\". The two messages contradict, and there are several examples of this in the Ninth. I believe Hogwood follows the metronome indications to the letter, but is this really what Beethoven wanted? At least for me Hogwood takes just about the whole symphony way too fast and what results, in my opinion, is a loss of feeling. The grandeur I associate with this piece is almost non-existent here. Incidentally the singing is quite good, but overall I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast","review":"Okay, I admit this is a matter of taste. This symphony is simply played too fast, and I don't care how \\"authentic\\" or \\"original\\" it claims to be the drama of the work just doesn't hold together at these speeds. What is more the Academy strings sound thin. While it may be true this is how the symphony may have sounded in Beethoven's day, don't you think Beethoven would have approved of the advancements made in the sound of modern instruments? The singing is fine, but again I get the feeling the soloists feel rushed. It is exciting in moments, but as a whole it is disappointing.

Mohandas K. Gandhi (the Mahatma) was born in India, educated in England, and struggled against apartheid in South Africa before returning to India to begin his Satygraha movement. He was jailed in South Africa for various civil disobedient acts. Gandhi was a Hindu: not a Jain, not a Buddhist.

I really liked it a lot since it was based on Peg's life and how she was partially paralyzed. She had to deal with a lot of trouble that was going on and the destruction of the earthquake. I liked how this book made it quite adventurous and exciting. It took me a few days to read it but not as long as some other books took me since this one I really liked. The girl had her brother to help her at some points but then her brother accidently was away from her and she had to deal with a lot of things being partially paralyzed.

I am a singer myself, although an amateur with experience in serious choirs such as the Academic Choir Tone Tomsic from Slovenia (won the European Grand Prix 2002 at the 14th choral competition in Arezzo, Italy) and have a preference for a clear voice with a very careful and controlled use of vibrato. This recording was the only one I could find that would fulfill my requirements. Besides, Bowman's performance is really outstanding, and you can really feel the tension (in a good sense) on those high notes. I believe that the use of countertenor brings a very special warm feeling to high notes that I was not able to find in the recordings with an alto (low female voice). It has a certain intimate touch that I certainly prefer. This recording is without a doubt a must for a serious music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous photos and funny recipes","review":"Rappers' Delight is a great cookbook for novice chefs--especially kids. The rappers represented are mostly old school, but the photos are timeless. There's a great deal of humour in this book, in the photographs, the commentary, and the recipes themselves.

This book makes a wonderful gift for anyone interested in either rap or quick and easy American cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Be Hesitant to Buy This Phono PreAmp","review":"I needed a pre amp, I shopped Amazon and found several in varying price ranges. I decided on this one based on mostly positive reviews, and simplicity. The price was right, not cheap, but not over $50. It was simple. It arived in 2 days, took me all of 5 mins to hook up, and it provides perfect sound. No hum. I did not need to ground the unit.I might add, I have two TV's a VCR, a DVD player and of course the Receiver, Phono and PreAmp all within 4 feet of each other. I was concerned that I might get feedback. None. I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to records","review":"Much higher quality sound than expected. You will not be disappointed. Did alot of research before purchase real happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"When a record is pressed on vinyl, the engineer cuts the bass and increases the treble. The bass is cut so that the large, low-frequency grooves won't bump into each other, or make the playback needle jump. The narrower groove that results also allows much more music to fit. If you were to play the record straight into your audio system or computer without any correction, it would sound very bright, with no bass. Tinny, basically.The job of a phono preamp is to boost the bass, so that is back where it should be, and to cut the treble, so that it's back where it should be. In the process of cutting the previously over-boosted treble, it also happens to cut a lot of the surface noise of the vinyl. This process is what made vinyl recordings workable.The \\"RIAA Curve\\" is the standard amount of cutting and boosting, so that all records will sound right.This phono preamp does the job very, very well. My records sound full and lively, clear and detailed.I'm very happy I got this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and effective!","review":"This is a great preamp all around. Setting it up is a piece of cake and the amplification from the low ends - all the way to the highs is extremely nice. But, if there was one thing that I'd have to nitpick about though, it would have to be the noise reduction level. While I could've just gotten a slightly defective product, there is still a good amount of static coming from the left-hand channel. I record vinyls onto the computer and listen to them through headphones, therefore oddities like this are easily destinguishable. Other than that, it's a great product to run through a nice soundsystem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phono Preamp","review":"This preamp works beautifully.

In hind-sight, I maybe should have bought a pre with some type of EQ due the setup of the room/speakers I am using, but that's no fault to this pre because I knew it didn't have an EQ when I bought it. For a straight-up pre, I'd say go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"TCC TC-750 Audiophile Preamp","review":"Great little preamp and very reasonably priced.

Everywhere he goes, people just cooperate... amazing!

But Sandford wrote it, so I read it. I'm glad that I did. While the subject matter wasn't something I'd typically go for, the writing was first rate.This book is about Jake Winter, a 'researcher' for the White House. Jake is asked to look into the disappearance of a former senator, which starts the journey - which is interesting, if a bit confusing at times.BTW, the next Prey book - Invisible Prey - is due out in May of 2007."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Plot","review":"Very predictable ending, tedious plot and paper thin characters in this novel. Any other author, I probably would have given him/her 3 stars but I like to hold Sandford to a different standard because his \\"Prey\\" series novels are very well written with realistic action scenes and great dialogue.

During the best of the \\"Prey\\" years, I always looked forward eagerly to reading the new installments in the series. Recently even the Prey novels have been inconsistent, never matching up to the best, \\"Chosen Prey\\" and \\"Certain Prey\\", and reaching an all time low with \\"Easy Prey\\". However \\"Dead Watch\\" is the most boring John Sandford book I have ever read. After the first few chapters I lost interest--the entire story was wrapped up in the first half of the book. The rest of the book was just an exercise in drawing the story out to fit into the minimum required pages. I hope that with his next books, Mr. Sandford is back on track with interesting characters, dialogue and pacing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read!!!","review":"Although I was disapppointed Sandford didn't come out with another Davenport book, I still looked forward to reading Dead Watch and I'm glad I did. I loved it! It was just as good as his prey books. I'd even look forward to another one in the series. It's funny how you get so used to Davenport and look forward to more. Then when you read a new novel by the same author you still hear the Lucas in the Sandford writing. Well, Lucas is a fictional character, yes, that's true. But it's hard not to fall in love with him. And then in Dead Watch you get the distinct feeling that he's somehow there even thought the main character is not Lucas. I guess that's the way it is when you have such a great author such as Sandford.

I also was a little nervous that I was going to read a Kidd type story.Dead Watch had the pace of the usual Sanford fare and it was a pretty good page turner. The main theme though was a bit of suspended belief. More than with the Davenport series, which generally rings fairly true.Still I liked the book and the locale change and there were parts that read really well. The plot moved along at a nice clip with enough twists and turns to keep me guessing right up to the end. Jake got a bit of depth going in the character and the love interest created an interesting although slightly shallow side story.All and all a pretty good read and while not exactly as engaging as the Davenport series, way better than the Kidd series and a nice change from the north woods of Minnesota"},{"rating":"1","title":"I started, I stopped, I started, I stopped!","review":"Boy was I ever dissapointed in this book.

I always await each new release of both of these authors with great eagerness. That will end now for Sandford, unless he goes back to the Prey series. Those books were great - you cared about the characters, couldn't wait to see what happened next; the books were intriguing, interesting, thrilling, hard-to-put-down. Not so for Dead Watch; it is simply dead. I couldn't make myself care one iota for any of the characters in this book - not a wit. It was tedious to read; I found myself skimming, going \\"ho-hum\\" and waiting for the real action to begin. It never did. I never cared; I was never interested; I never found out who the killer was because I finally gave up with just a few chapters to go.

I found it too politically biased. ( I understand it is in DC and is about politics) It had too many introductions to characters and I found myself wondering who people were when mentioned later. I've read all the Virgil Flowers and Lucas Davenport books so far and hundreds of others- didn't have this problem. The story line was interesting but I felt something was missing. I felt it was really sort abrupt sort of skipping around. Just my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The slippery world of politics","review":"I am new to the John Sandford books and the Prey series. I liked this story as it is quite blunt about the callousness of the political world. After the mysterious death of a politician.

Before I started studying, it was hard to find a video - any video - on the subject.

Alas, I am sadly disappointed. Surely there are better dancers in Spain than those presented here. The photography is fussy, pretentious, and intrudes on the dancing. Perhaps an entire film devoted to the Sevillian style is bound to lack the tension and excitement we associate with flamenco. I found it boring, and regret having bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ride the ambulance with a hero!","review":"Frankie Rella is a hero for his actions on 9/11. His TV interview with Dan Rather gave millions of Americans an idea of what our police, firemen and medics were going through on that tragic morning in 2001. Those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, should be remembered for their bravery.This book pays homage to those who served \\"in the trenches\\" on that morning. It is well-written and puts you right in the middle of the action in lower Manhattan, New York.This is one of my favorite books on my book shelf. Partly because all of the proceeds from the book's sales go to the widows of 9/11. Rella is a Saint.~=Gregory M.

I was not yet a resident of Manhattan, but like the rest of the country was deeply affected by what I was seeing on TV and around me as my friends and I cried, prayed, phoned, gave blood, and wondered what else could we do. Francis Rella describes his own helpless feelings through a protagonist who brings a smile to your face and tears to your eyes all at the same time. After all the hype and media over 9/11, it's nice to read a real story written by a real guy. With a real heart. With vivid imagery and thoughtful characterization, Rella recreates the paramedics' fall of 2001 for those of us in civilian clothes.

Having read many books that I loved that included dialect as well as foreign language, (Cormack McCarthy's Cities of the Plains and Ferrol Sams' Run with the Hores being among my favorites), I found Payne's use of NC English more than mildly irritating.

That's the source of suspense in the film, and it's not bad...but eventually, especially before the end credits, you might want to have that cleared up for us.But I don't think it does.

Not worth the price even on sale.After.Life"},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie that toys with it's reality","review":"Clearly the people making this movie thought that displaying Christina Ricci's naked body (I hope that a warmer was placed in the porcelain mortuary table) and confusing the viewers about whether she was alive or not was sufficient to make a movie. A note to the director: cadavers do not breathe, and cannot fog a mirror. This, however, is one of the ways in which the director attempts to trick the viewer into thinking that the Ricci's character may be alive and the prisoner of a psychotic undertaker, not one who can communicate with the dead. Creating this ambiguity is the \\"shtick\\" of this movie. Confusing the viewer by creating ambiguity about is real and what isn't in the context of the story a gimmick that been used before, and it's one I detest. It's is equally unsettling - a sad ending for the Mac person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just terrible.","review":"Want something to do worth taking up 1 hour and 44 minutes of your time? It's not watching this movie! This was terrible. I could not even stay interested in this movie. I will watch just about anything and I found myself starting to play games on my phone half-way through. No \\"thriller\\" aspect whatsoever.Casting? Christina Ricci is perfect for the creepy, pale, dead girl role and she did a good job. Liam Neeson, not so much. If you want to see a good Liam Neeson movie, check out one of his action flicks (Taken, Unknown) - he is much better in that role.Then there is the ending. I still do not understand what happened. I was able to follow \\"Inception\\" (for those of you that saw it, this makes sense) but I can't follow \\"After.Life\\"? Who knows.

Life' is a decent film with an interesting premise and a good cast. I love Neeson and Ricci(...and Long in comedies), but the film seems to not know what it wants to be. Is it about after life? or a murdering funeral director?, or a drama about someone mistakenly taken for dead after an accident? I know this was probably done on purpose(to throw us off the trail), but in the end it just makes for a confusing mess that leaves you less than satisfied.Is the film worth seeing? I think so, at least for me. I thought the actors did a decent job and I certainly didn't mind looking at Ricci naked for the majority of the film, but instead of leaving me thinking about an intriguing subject, it made me feel like I had been had!"},{"rating":"2","title":"book review","review":"hi my name is ---- this book i read it i was not good and do not read it ok other way you will be fail from your class i don't like to review books but i have to do some of them to pass the class so whats up too you guy in this book they readd it how was the boy if you read it you will have a lot of fun i don't know if you have becsue i didn't read it so that why i don't know ok take care bye and try to read that book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A clever and fascinating story!","review":"Ms. Kellam's look at the life of Princess Diana and the turmoil surrounding her death is both unique and insightful, and the multiple levels of the book make it enjoyable from beginning to end.

While some of his points do make since, most are not sufficiently explained, and are therefore unbelieveable. Killinger makes a lot of glaring mistakes; for example, he doesn't seem to understand the concept of a dementor other than the fact that it can (can being the main word) suck out one's soul. He also gives quite a few incorrect discriptions of exact events in the books. (An example: He said that Hagrid had turned Vernon Dursley to a pig in Sorcerer's Stone, but he actually gave DUDLEY Dursley a pig's TAIL.) The one crucial point that I think he has actually brought across is the role of good vs. evil in the series.Overall, if you are a person who is looking to see if the series is appropriote for you or your children, buy this book. Otherwise, if you are a fan looking for a good defence of the books, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed...","review":"The subtitle of the book is \\"A Christian Minister's Defense....\\" So how can a man with a doctorate in theology have such a poor understanding of Scripture?If you're a conservative, Bible-believing Christian looking for a conservative biblical approach to the Harry Potter/Christianity issue, this book will surely disappoint you. The author takes a very dim view of Scripture.I found John Granger's book to be much better written and far more informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Harry Potter companion!","review":"Book arrived in a timely fashion and in perfect condition.

I would like to point out that there is a mistake on page 103. It says that voldemorts wand is oak when in fact it is yew. The yew tree is symbolic of death itself.

Only you can decide if you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and waste of shelf space","review":"Now I didn't read most of the book. I'll admit that right off the bat. I picked it up because I wanted to see how long it would take to reach the most ridiculous of comparisons and how far off track they would go. Well at one point I couldn't stand it so I shut the book. But seriously, from what I did read and know is that by the end of the book you will realize that it should have been found in the fantasy fiction section more so than the Harry Potter books themselves. Harry Potter is in the genre of fantasy and it's called FANTASY for a reason people. It's not supposed to always make sense and fit into whatever over zealous, over analytical, overreaching for conspiracy box you feel it should be in. I know this guy is supposed to be defending the series against the people who have nothing better to do than question every original thought that comes from someone's mind, but he was quite counter-productive so to conclude: waste of time, waste of shelf space."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can I say?","review":"Dr. Killinger makes a lot of sense.

This video shows vintage film/musical clips or scenes with Captain and baby animals. Mr Moose and Bunny Rabbit are also on hand, and they have an especially nice surprise for the Captain (in addition to Moose's ping pong balls). Fun for preschool kids. My kids like it, and pop it in themselves. Nostalgic for the \\"inner child\\" that misses the Captain Kangaroo show s/he grew up with.

Damian decides to put his considerable charms to test to see if he can manipulate Vanessa into being his mistress rather than him killing her brother. Loyal sister that she is, she agrees, and is slowly drawn deeper into Damian's seduction. What unfolds is one of the steamiest, best written books I've read in a while. Do yourself a favor and read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vigorous and Real Love Story","review":"I liked this book despite myself, and will look forward toreading more of Ms. Jordan's books. The premise of this book mightturn away some readers but unless you are morally offended by love scenes, do read it. Nicole Jordan draws characters with whom a reader can sympathize and care about. One may not like some of the behavior, but one reads on hoping, wishing, knowing that matters will turn out satisfactorily. Ms. Jordan shows us a bit of the underside of aristocratic life with visits to a brothel and a Hellsfire club. The book reads like a love story of real people with the prospect of a happy ending not always certain."},{"rating":"2","title":"This writer is my \\"guilty pleasure\\"!","review":"I really enjoy her books although my mind is always telling me I \\"shouldn't\\". Frankly, the woman writes great sex scenes and always has heroes who fall wonderfully and passionately in love with the heroine. I've read every single one of her books in a single gulp. I'd put this one behind \\"The Savage\\", \\"The Lover\\" and \\"The Outlaw\\" but it still delivered awfully well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente libro!","review":"Me parece que es un libro increiblemente bien escrito, digno de un genio y que definitivamente vale la pena leer, probablemente las personas que no vivimos la primera y segunda guerra mundial no podamos comprender algunos acontecimientos, pero las impresiones del autor acerca de los hechos son puramente impresionistas, y tomando en cuenta la epoca en que fue escrito es una obra de arte!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was affended","review":"I was quite affended when I got this book. I whiped it out and started looking at it and was upset to see that most of the models are not wearing clothes. There was a few pages with magazine covers on them, one of which was a playboy magazine cover. If any of these things affend you also I would advise you NOT to get the book. The hairstyles weren't anything I was interested in either. I didn't read very much of the text but it didn't appear to have many directions on how the styles were made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"This is a great book. It is like an owners manual for your hair. It tells you everything about; brushes, combs, tools, hairtype, and the how to for all the styles and cuts.

There was one small picture of a playboy cover, but that girl was completed covered too. I don't see how that's offensive at all. About the hairstyles, they were mostly practical and sofisticated, just what I was looking for! I have Charles Worthington's complete book of hairstyling and found that most of those hairstyles were wild and no normal person would ever wear their hair that way. That is not the case of this book. I highly recommend it.

Written in language easily accessible even to the most novice of New Testament students, this book will prove a valuable aid to any open-minded, honest and inquisitive biblical scholar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seductive Rescue Fantasy","review":"Trendy, the title of this book is quite apt. \\"The Changing Faces of Jesus,\\" meaning that Jesus is fair game for reinterpretation according to the swirling currents of fashion in scholarship, as well as perceived changes in social mores and codes. Yet here is just another contemporary scholar that seeks to revise the scriptural Jesus, strip him of all of his supernatural claims and \\"transcendent\\" attributes, and put him into a far less problematic social, historical, and cultural context in our postmodernist-informed now. Too many of the pronouncements made in this book are simply too personal and are directed at those guided by their faith, not just scholars of another or same school of thought. This is a book that's especially useful to those who have no stake in the Jesus of the New Testament as the center of their faith, and who enjoy a good speculative argument that goes as far as it can on what little evidence there exists to support it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convert","review":"Geza Vermes is a renowned scholar who seems to have focused on researching from his own psychological backgrounds. A former Catholic priest who converted to his parents Judaic roots, he seems to continue his efforts to process this experience through his scholarship.

I absolutely loved the authors ability to draw the reader into the story and not let them go until the very end. A definate page turner and left me with my mouth hanging open. (unconciously of course) I also loved the talk of New Orleans and the issues surrounding race, color, Creole vs. Cajun and all of the concpets indigenous to Louisiana. I was so impressed with the novel that about 1/2 way through this book, I immediately ordered her other 2 books. I truly hope the same depth and richness are present. Very, very good book and a must read for anyone who enjoys suspense, drama and wonderfully descriptive novels ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Too Slow","review":"The beginning of this book started off too slow. Although the author did a good job developing the characters, it was over-kill. My interest picked up once Alain was murdered, but the adventures through Louisiana were not only unrealistic, but at some points stereotypical (spoken from a Louisiana native). It was obvious the writer hadn't spend a lot of time in the heart of the land she wrote about. I won't give away the ending, but let's just say Carol Ann may now be able to join the ranks of Wonder Woman and the other Super Friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed","review":"This book started off extremely slow and never did pick up to the pace that I was expecting.

It is done with style and class, and for that I applaud the author!(by Sandra Manigault, author of Fragments of a Woman's Life)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This self-published book is riddled with typos, grammatical errors, and childish writing. The illustrations are so amateurish as to be nearly useless in showing a young child either actions or emotions.

If anyone knows of a better-quality book on this topic that is aimed at young children, I would like to hear about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read","review":"I found this book a very easy read, which is important in trying to explain epilepsy to children. To educate children of the disorder is something that might seem like an difficult task, something thats pushed off to the side for a later date.

They come with new special features, behind the scenes featurettes, commentaries and more.

I felt as if the author didn't like dolphins, and didn't really respect them. I hate to be saying this about a book that seemed at first glance so wonderful, but I didn't feel as if the book protrayed positive feelings. I just feel as if the author doesn't like dolphins, and I think that a book that is written in a way that might seem emotional, but doesn't portray true feelings or a love for the creatures that are said to be loved. If the tone is to be set in one way, the words used should reflect that tone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Ever since I was a little girl, I've always been fascinated by dolphins. My career goal is to work with dolphins, in any shape or form, but particularly in the research aspect. I picked up this book while browsing the library one day and fell completly in love with it. It definitely reconfirmed my dream of working with these wonderful creatures, but I also learned a lot about their behaviors and personalities. It also shows that dolphins are not all the same--they actually have unique personality traits. I was so awed by this book that I gave in and decided to buy it--I should receive it in a couple days so I'm looking forward to reading it until it is worn out!!

Having lost my original copy of this book years ago, I was elated to see it in print again. Upon its arrival, however, I was extremely disappointed to find this edition significantly altered from its earlier counterpart. I've been a performing folk musician for more than half my life now, and I no longer find sheet music necessary. In fact, it was not for the sheet music that I purchased this folio, but for the gorgeous color production stills appearing in the old version. Much to my chagrin, this wonderful material had been omitted from the new collection, the blurb's claim of \\"great color photos\\" notwithstanding. Furthermore, those of you who were interested in this book for its musical content should be aware that these are not authentic transcriptions, nor is the entire body of selections from the former collection included.

The spray bottle allows for better manageability of the product. I used this in conjunction with the Dry and Itchy Shampoo, which in my opinion is a much better product between the two.

Hopefully those who have other conditions than asthma will make use of the exercises to transcend some of their limiting beliefs and in the process heal themselves.

It is a story set during WWII in Hungary where a young German couple is serving a wealthy Jewish man on his estate in the countryside. The premise of the story is that child-free wealthy man and his wife are using all of their assets to buy freedom for their extended family.It is a story about value of family, strength of Jewish spirit, one German soldier's word and our innate power for survival. But story feels unreal and unauthentic.

As a period piece, it misses nuances and details. It is \\"well made\\", but you never believe to be transported into the 1940ies. As for character development, there is none. You find all the necessary types needed for a good guys- bad guys movie, accented with romance. \\"The Couple\\" is very cliché ridden, to the point of being embarrassingly simplistic and predictable. It felt like a 5th grader's attempt of writing a script about bad Nazis and heroic resistance. I am very surprised that other reviewers see this movie as such a gem.

He can deliver sexy tunes with dark wicked bass all at once. Vendetta by Total Science is a must hear and Nightvision too! I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I got this for my daughter (2 years, 9 MO.) Its not worth it. She open it, and only played with the sunglasses. Its not even a Purse! Not worth the $10.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!!","review":"I didn't like this at all. It's someones opinion as to what happened. Just not what I thought it was going to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asks the right questions!","review":"Once again, we have somebody that is willing to \\"ask the question.\\" Who stood to gain? Who profits, why do they profit and where does this come from. If we ask the right questions, we chip away at the prison that those powers that be create for us. This video reminds me that we have the power and we have a voice. It's refreshing, it's exceptional. If we have the few willing to stand up and ask the questions, to put the pieces of the puzzle together, then we do justice to those who have fallen to the wrath of the power elite, those that run our government their way for their benefit.An extremely comprehensive, insightful and inspiring documentary that is sure to be noticed more and more over the next six months. I would reccomend this video to anyone that wants to know the truth and isn't afraid of it but enlightened by it. The creator is obviously an expert on the Kennedys and has opened up another chapter that all of us might be aware of. Keep it up and God speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good laugh for anyone into aviation...","review":"I was subjected to about an hour of this film. It apparently puts together a conspiracy out of \\"holes\\" in the crash, investigation, etc. and to be fair I think they did a great job considering it's quite obvious that they didn't consult anyone who was even remotely knowledgeable about aviation (as an aside, I'm a Commercial/Instrument Pilot and Flight Instructor with about 5,000 hours.)I'm still in awe over how badly they did on basic fact checking, and I don't mean the smokey grey bits they use to build a conspiracy. I'm talking about basic things about how an airplane flies and FAA regulations. These errors could have been caught by a student pilot whose strongpoint is the ability to recognize an airplane two out of three times.In conclusion, I don't think I could ever recommend anyone purchase this video unless maybe you need a gag gift for a pilot."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cure for the common politi-cold.","review":"Roy Nunn's political prose gets right to the heart of some of this country's biggest problems. It is quiet and unassuming while still plainly exposing the flawed logic in American society's current, chosen path. This should be required reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cecilia - the singer who saved this recording","review":"If not for Cecilia Bartoli, I doubt I would be able to listen to it till the end. Orchestra is more than boring - somehow dull. Other performers are more or less audible in some parts, only Cecilia manages to capture the character perfectly well, her recitatives are outstandingly brilliant - unlike those of other performes. The difference between all others and Cecilia's skillfulness is so huge that it is somehow disturbing to listen. Really, it's a pity for such a preformace to have inequal patnership, both vocal and instrumental.Still I rate the CD with 4 starts - Cecilia's work mustn't be underestimated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost worthless","review":"I am a person who normally can learn from a book. I did not find this one too helpful. I talked more about boats and gear than the actual moves. It is hard to tell how to do the moves from the book. A complex move might be shown in three static pictures. I just took a course with Karen Knight and this is the way to go! I cannot say enough good words about Karen. She did not have kind words for the book and recommends the book by Mark Molina and Becky Molina which is out of print presently, but might be found used or writing beckmark@aol.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't help but love Todd Agnew!","review":"Great CD. The item was shipped quickly and arrived in good shape. It was just as described from seller. Would deal with again! Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Reflection of Something\\" Review","review":"I find Todd to be somewhat 'different.' However the more I listen to favorite songs the more I like his deep and 'gravelly' voice. I find his messages are more intense than many as well as meaningful."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I really enjoy Christian artists. My only complaint has been that most of the Christian music out there does not challenge the listener. The lyrics are nice and positive but never speaks to any real issues that we face in our faith. What Todd Agnew has done here, at least for me, is not only provide an excellent rock album with the kind of thought provoking lyrics that get you really thinking about, not only our faith and the sacrifice that was made for us, but also how we've presented ourselves to the world. I saw some much of myself and my church in the song \\"My Jesus\\" that I wanted to cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"great windows & walls collection","review":"this book is a great help to my clientsthe visual is so important in the window treatment fieldthe photo are crisp and easy to see"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"Considering the other reviews, I was extremely disappointed in this book. The best design is the somewhat anemic looking lounge on the front cover. The book covers many over decorated rooms that just look ridiculous and old fashioned. I even checked the publishing information to check I hadn't ordered a 1980s copy in error. Save your money. Buy something that has some relevance to designs of 2010."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better material is available","review":"Kent Hovind is not a scientist, biologist, or archeologist. He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking","review":"As a Professional Career Coach for women, I can see that the author has obviously spent a great deal of time thinking and researching his work. This is not your usual 'corporate strategy' book -- rather it is a work in progress. Sherosky has brought into focus the main issues between corporate success and spiritual happiness. Does one have to lose one to gain the other -- not according to the author. I agree. You can have both. His chapter on \\"Tapping the Power of Gender Teamwork\\" is one of the reasons I recommend his book to my clients. I recommend any professional, seeking a better understanding of the corporate world to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyric expressiveness, shinning sumptuousness!","review":"Christopher Hogwood inscribed his name with golden letters at the moment to have decided to record the complete set of Symphonic works of the beloved son of Salzburg.These performances are hovered by a flaming vitality and radiant eloquence. Keeping into account the enormous historical registers of so many distinguished conductors before him, Hogwood bet and risked, achieving an inspired approach around every Kv.And although there definitive registers of the classic giants symphonies such as Jupiter, (Walter-New York, 1952) Praga and Haffner,(Walter- New York) the 40th (Vegh and Salzburg Camerata), the 25th (Szell-Cleveland), the 29th (Kleiber- Concertgebouw) this set must be included in your invaluable collection.Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I thought It was well written and well produced, the sort of thing we dont get enough of now in this day and age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Shadows Fan","review":"We have all of the Dark Shadows DVD collections and the attempted remake featuring Jean Simmons.
