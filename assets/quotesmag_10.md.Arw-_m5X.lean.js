They told me they would answer my message within a few days. It has been over three weeks and there have been no reply - despite follow-up inquiries.This is the worst experience I have ever had with any product or company. At least in the reviews, the thermometer had worked for a few days before malfunctioning and the company made some attempt to solve the problem.If you have any doubts about ordering this product, I strongly recommend that you decide not to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not give correct temperature or correct units","review":"When the thermometer arrived it was only in Celsius. I contacted customer service for help to get the thermometer into Fahrenheit, and they could not accomplish this. They said I could pay to ship it to them and they would replace it but I did not think that was fair. In the meantime I saw that the unit was consistently well above the actual temperature, so my husband attempted contact with customer service. They told him that we just have bad windows. We have fairly new Anderson Renewal windows so... I can appreciate that individual units can have defects, but I would not buy this brand ever because they simply do not stand behind their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for only 30 days","review":"This item only worked for 30 days, don't bother with it.

It is a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Max-Min feature is flawed","review":"I bought a couple of these to use indoors to monitor temperature differences around the house. They work fairly well for that but I can't speak to how well they would work stuck to the outside of a window as intended.Regardless of use, the max-min function is a joke. The memory automatically resets every 24 hours, which is OK, but the max and min reset 12 hours apart [really!] so it is impossible to have a record of the high and low over the course of a day.The unit also displays higher precision than it should. The display reads in tenths of degrees but the accuracy is rated at 1.8F. Thus the display could read 67.2 while the actual temperature could be anywhere from 65.4 up to 69. With no greater accuracy than this, the display should show only whole degrees as tenths are meaningless.Finally, the low-temp limit is -13F so it won't work very well in winter unless you are in a mild climate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked well for years but LCD segments eventually gave out","review":"I enjoyed the WS-1025 for a few years, but eventually the humidity has caused LCD segments to fail, starting at the bottom (\\"min\\") and moving up.

Even if the window is insulated, as ours are, there's going to be residual heat affecting it from inside. Sure enough this thermometer is consistently 7 to 10 degrees off. We have several outside thermometers at different places on our property and their readings are identical with this one being the exception. Designed to be attached to the outside of the window, this thermometer is by design inaccurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful product","review":"this item barely worked for a week, until all the numbers faded so as to not be able to read the temperature.

Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Window thermometers: a flawed concept","review":"My comparisons with other high precision digital and analog thermometers showed that this thermometer is pretty accurate. However, I learned something that is obvious in retrospect: the temperature just outside your window is much different than the true outside temperature! In order to make an accurate measurement, any thermometer MUST be located at least a couple of feet away from your house. I bought two identical units and mounted one on a window and one on a white porch beam 5 feet away from the house. The difference in readings was dramatic, and switching the units showed the same effect. So I removed the window unit, kept the other, and have been happy for many years now (although it's not so easy to read). Bottom line: give up on the idea of a window thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"Hung this on the window near front door and it simply doesn't read the correct temp...it was 21degrees yesterday and the thermometer read 32.

It became clear pretty quickly that the indoor temperature had a strong effect on the readings, especially since the place where we really wanted the thermometer was an old-fashioned, single pane window. I suspect it would work better on a newer double-paned window, but we were starting to figure out the differential and to make it work. However, the final kicker came this morning when we discovered that a moderate rainstorm with a few wind gusts has blown the thermometer off the window entirely. The adhesive definitely doesn't stand up to the weather. We're in the process of looking for a new and more protected location that is actually visible to us from inside the house, but I'm not happy about that, since the original location seemed just perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacrosse window thermometer","review":"[[ASIN:B0007N2I8M La Crosse Technology WS-1025 Digital Window Thermometer] the stickies that hold it to the window have already come unstickey and the thermometer fell down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thermometer you can see from a distance","review":"This thermometer is my second one.

It was very easy to put it on the window. I like that it uses basic double sided tape for adhesion -- if it gets worn out, should be easy to replace. I got tired of those suck-cups that wear out."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Crosse products are as cheap as the come","review":"This is a cool looking product, but from my experience with this particular tempature sensor as well as numerous others that I have owned, La Crosse products, although simple electronics, are probably the most unreliable I have ever used! Out of 5 weather stations, all had LCD problems or just stopped working within a year. My second one of these just stopped working after 3 months. They really make the cheapest stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outdoor thermometer","review":"Another gadget I had to have. For the price, this is a really neat outdoor thermometer that shows the high and low temperature of the day. One important note is the location of installation. I live in S.Fla and mounted it on the north facing window. You must locate it in a spot where direct or even somewhat direct sunlight does not affect it as this will most likely give false readings. If you have a glass door or window that leads to a screen enclosure, this would also allow for a fairly correct temperature reading, although this could also cause improper readings in the heat of the day as the metal pan roof can reflect heat to the inside of the screen enclosure.All in all, I love mine and reccomend it. I bought 10 of them at Christmas and gave them out as gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice when it worked, but that wasn't for long","review":"I really liked this thermometer, it was neat the way it gives the temperature range for the day and the display was easy to read. Unfortunately it had some major problems. It is very sensitive to the sun shining on it at all, more than most thermometers I have used and would read at least 10 degrees higher than the actual temperature. More problematic though is that it first wouldn't stay attached any longer, and then just quit working all together. For the price, I expect it to work longer than just 4-5 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digits fade away, terrible customer support","review":"After a few months, the LCD digits faded out and became unreadable.It was not a battery problem: I put a new one but there was no change.The thermometer is on a North-facing window, so it NEVER receives direct sunlight.It's just a bad engineered product.I live in Europe and bought it in Ebay US. I contacted customer support in the US and they told me to contact LaCrosse headquarters in France (not my country). Headquarters in France told me to settle the matter with the seller in Ebay US. This is a joke, right?I contacted LaCrosse support in the US again. They didn't even bother to reply. I guess they know the warantee period will expire soon and they will just ignore me until they become free of responsibilities.This is a terrible company, and my advice to you is to not have anything to do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate!","review":"I bought one of these and before I mounted it, I compared it with 3 other thermometers, one mercury, one on my thermostat, and another digital thermometer.

Very disappointed.Also, if you want to have a practical outdoor temperature reading, do not stick it on the window plane (even if it is accurate), because the reading is greatly influenced by the indoor temperature. You have to install it at least 6 inches away from the window to get the real outdoor temp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product!","review":"This thermometer worked for about a week and then after one rain storm, all of the digits disappeared.

The volumes contain nice photographs but are ineffective as textbooks. For example, as material is introduced a sudden segue to a new subject leaves the reader cold. I would not recommend any of this series to those who need detail. These books support a teaching methodology that relies upon mundane memorization of incidental information rather than comprehensive study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Excited to Be let down.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.

It it great to be able to come in with an NASB word and find the other references and a meaning. But the pronunciation key and the root word references and numbers, as well as related meanings, ARE MISSING! These two features are a must have for me as a preacher as well as simply a student of the scriptures. If I can find something more complete for NASB, I'll be returning this."},{"rating":"2","title":"NASB Concordance","review":"This is a great concordance.

I thought this would be it, but was severely disappointed when I received it. I was hoping it would be a single hard copy source for not only locating the different locations a word is used, but also a complete definition or use of the word. I should have read all of the reviews on it, because I still have to go online to do a thorough study. A one stop place that I have found online to accomplish what I want is at bible.org. Their NeXtBible learning environment provides all that is needed for one source study. I am still searching for that perfect hardcopy, however! If anyone could suggest one, that would be awesome! By the way, thanks to Amazon's awesome return policy, I will get my money back! Thanks Amazon, you have been a real blessing to me in my studies. I have purchased many books from Amazon, and they always deliver!

However, even though I study in the NASB, I still like to look up words in the original Strong's (KJV version) concordance from the KJV.

That said, I hate any hybrid of the formentioned musical genres. Specifically, Techno and Gothic are like Yin and Yang--one is light, the other dark. Combined, they make for chaos.While \\"Cassandra\\" and \\"Winter Born\\" rock despite the rest of the album, Ethernaut sounds like typical Apoptygma Byzerk / VNV Nation redux (and if I wanted to listen to these groups, I'd buy their albums). Please, please, Rogue, go back to the genius behind \\"Telemetry of a Fallen Angel\\". It was a uniquely innovative, brilliant album with its own sound. I long for another \\"The Mystery of a Whisper\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synthpop/EBM","review":"Electronic Bowel MovementFine, listen to it if that's what you want to hear/dance to, but PLEASE STOP CALLING IT GOTH!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECTION!!!!","review":"EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS GOOD. My favorite is trak 1, Into the Ether. Wow. Stunning vocal presentations. Very ethereal. The musicianship is excellent. The band has a tight sound. Production value is very good. This is a cd you can pop into your cd player and listen to straight through over and over again. Techno elektronix mixed with tribal beats and Rogues straight on vocal delivery is mesmerizing. After All (trak 12) is another great song. Buy this CD. You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethernaut","review":"I own every single Cruxshadows album and EP that is available, and they never cease to amaze! Every one has a life of it's own, evolving with band leader Rogue's creativity and talent. Ethernaut is a spectacular work of art, and it has evolved with the Cruxshadow's expanding resources. The sound is awesome on this album, when you play it on a decent audio system, it devours you! Everyone should own this CD, it is amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetion of Too Many Songs from the Past!","review":"Although I own only one Cruxshadow's CD, Fortress in Flames (which I like very much), I am perturbed by the number of times the same songs seem to reappear on subsequent discs.

I will wait for new material thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very flat...","review":"Though Ethernaut isn't \\"bad,\\" it isn't \\"good\\" either. Everything the band tries to do on this album has been done better by someone else. This is EBM Lite, barely industrial at all, and even then it never really breaches the watermark of mediocrity. If, like me, you're testing the proverbial waters of the Cruxshadows catalog for the first time, do not start with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Disco","review":"The last two outings by the Cruxshadows are the goth equivalent of Gloria Gaynor and/or The Village People.Why do they even have a guitarist? Can't hear it most of the time.The drum beats are the same through most of the album.Having lived in their home town and attended college with Rogue and have run in the same circles with him I can say that he is egomaniacal and a control freak. The real reason he lost the only good guitarist in the band (Kevin) is because Kevin liked to have a beer after gigs (Rogue doesn't drink alcohol or caffeine). Just a beer. Rogue would freak.I WILL give Rogue credit for being a very driven individual. He built that band up from nothing and pretty much runs the business side as well as the creative side. But make no mistake, the other band members are hired guns. Cruxshadows is Rogue and only Rogue.If you are a fan of this music I would recommend The Last Dance.They actually have guys that play instruments and not tons of programming with synths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much techno","review":"It seems the Cruxshadows are gradually shifting closer and closer to techno pop and neo disco and leaving Goth behind. What is with this generation? Why has Gothic Rock become such a rarity? I love electronic music such as industrial/post industial and electro goth rock, but I despise Techo/Dance/Disco/EBM/Cyber Pop and I hate how it's spreading through the Goth scene like a cancer. (For those that aren't aware, there IS a HUGE difference between Industrial and synth pop) I'll stick to Deathrock thank you, and my OLD Cruxshadows cds... you know, back when they still played Rock & Roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Chapter in the evolution of Goth and Dark Wave","review":"It is easy to say that electronically based music is a sell out....that is until you hear the Cruxshadows. This latest addition to their growing catalog is nothing less than amazing. In an environment of increasing decline in musical standards, this band stands among the few that truly love and believe in what they do. Their lyrical content is creative, intelligent, and emotional. Their musical and technical skill blend beautifully. The melodic use of violin in their compositions is both engaging and exciting. Unlike other bands who feel that being goth means to sound as scary or as sad as you can, the Cruxshadows are not afraid to appeal to a broader audience. This album is danceable and truly enjoyable. I recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to be pigeonholed into what the mainstream thinks \\"goth\\" should mean and would like to represent \\"goth\\" for what it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":".....","review":"the cruxshadows just keep getting better and better, improving their sound and technique, even if you don't like the sound of this new album, you'll atleast beable to appreciate the artistic and poetic lyrics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Angels Never Die\\" - A View From A Non-Goth","review":"I know very little about Goth music, my listening experience of the genre has been limited to 'Dead Can Dance' and 'This Mortal Coil.' However I do know what I like and 'Ethernaut' turned out to be a complete surprise! This is good stuff!!Cruxshadows darkwave, synthpop sound reminds me of several popular new wave groups from the '80's. The Thompson Twins, The Smiths and Pet Shop Boys immediately came to mind while playing this CD. However they most remind me of Depeche Mode. Being Goth in intent the lyrics are obviously much darker and foreboding, I guess that's where the name darkwave comes into play. All and all a highly entertaining listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruxshadows getting better and better","review":"The cruxshadows just keep getting progressively better and better with every cd. I can't wait until they come out with more stuff. This is a good follow up of wishfire. It is a mixture of various sounds, but all flow well together. I definatly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somethin' New","review":"Ethernaut is the newest lp by the almost legendary band.. the Cruxshadows. And it's a pretty good album. Unlike their previous disc, wishfire.. ethernaut has a more polished sound. They took their ebm influences and basically cleaned it up here and there. It's not as powerful as wishfire tho but it's still a good follow up. Fans of earlier work will appreciate tracks like 'Cassandra' and 'the Sentiment Inside' as well as that bonus track I mentioned. Newer fans who are more likely to be familiar with wishfire will enjoy 'Winter born' and 'Flame'. There is a lil something for everyone here. Purists who haven't been fond of anything since Mystery of a whisper probably won't be fond of ethernaut but they should still check it out just to make sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but bad movie","review":"After reading the book by Nora Roberts, I was so excited to get to watch the movie. I couldnt put the book down, and was so surprised by the end. The movie, however, did not have the same charm. I really like Heather Locklear, but I do believe that she was too old for this role, and the acting WAS NOT GOOD. So, if you havent read the book ~ read the book, but as far as the movie, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan, but this movie literally made me sick. The casting was all wrong. Heather Locklear should not have played the title role. She is too old and had far too much plastic surgery. She just bother the holy crap out of me.The acting left much to be desired as well. It was almost as if every actor on the screen mentally told themselves: \\"Hey! This is for Lifetime, let's do a half a** job. We still get paid whether the movie is crap or not.\\"Also, I think that the editing was entirely shoddy. If you haven't read the book you might be okay with the flow of the movie, but if you have there might be places were you have to stop and go: \\"Uh?\\"I don't know how much creative input Nora Roberts has with these movies, but she seriously needs to put her foot down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the input, You really SHOULD read the book!","review":"Thanks to all of you who saved me the time and money that I would have wasted buying the movie and watching it. I did read the book before I was even aware that there was a movie made from it. I have to say that I loved the book, and had actually thought that there should be a movie made from it. I was thinking that someone along the lines of Jennifer Love Hewitt as Reece, and Josh Holloway (\\"Sawyer\\" on LOST) as Brody. Again, Really-read the book-it sounds like it is, at the very least, ten thousand times better than the movie. I, for one, am not wasting one penny or one second on the movie-thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay TV movie of the week","review":"It's a predictable story with mediocre actors in a lovely setting.

But what a disappointment that turned out to be. For the most part it followed the book with just a few changes, but the acting was horrible. Heather Locklear is a decent actress, but I don't know what she was doing here - it definitely was not acting. The scene where she heard the car backfire was comical. She was supposed to look like she was ducking for cover, in fear for her life. Instead it looked like she was doing an initial rehearsal of the the scene, going \\"ok, this is where I hear the car, think it's gunfire, and I go like this...\\"For those of you who have seen the movie but not read the book, please do yourselves a favor and read the book. You'll be pleasantly surprised, and hopefully the book will wash the foul taste of this movie out of your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heather Handles Serious Role","review":"Nora Roberts novel offers more depth to the characters than the movie.

The mountainous Western setting is beautiful and the story line kept my interest. Locklear's peculiar facial cosmetic semi-disfigurement is distracting, but the leading man had no such problems, was pretty good, engaging, and so very easy on the eyes. Sadly, the last half degenerated into a laughable made for TV movie. The best was when she was running through a birch tree forest, hysterical with fear, out in the middle of nowheresville on the side of a mountain and was miraculously found by both the boyfriend AND the sherrif simultaneously. WTH? Was she running with a tracking device? The very last scene was kind of like the director yelled \\"That's a wrap!\\" before anyone was ready or prepared. Very odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"distracted by plastic surgery","review":"I never read the book nor did I know there was one. I actually checked this movie out from the library. The movie was actually boring and I was continually distracted by Heather Locklear's appearance.

Instead, the movie shows Simeon being beaten with no objection from Joseph. As far as Joseph's moral character is concerned, the movie shows him in bed with Potiphar's wife before he gets a clue to flee from her; and I've seen pets show more affection for their masters than Joseph shows for his father whom he hasn't seen for more than 10 years. The director might have been awarded an Oscar had he presented the facts of this story as they have been preserved in the Book of Genesis. As it is, no one could PAY ME to watch this movie again. Please save your money and read the beautiful Bible's account of Joseph and his brethren. This is a movie serious Bible students must avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality.","review":"The biblical accounts are not represented with a great deal of accuracy.Much creative license is used in the portrayals.But the biggest drawback is poor sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to scripture","review":"First, if you want a DVD about Joseph, buy the DVD \\"Jacob and Joseph.\\" It is well-worth it. Don't waste your money on this DVD.This DVD \\"Joseph and his Brethren\\" is not faithful to scripture. The worst example is that it portrays Joseph as an angry, rebellious young man, not the upright, industrious man in scripture.There are other instances which run even more in direct contradiction to scripture. I bought this DVD several months ago, and watched it only once. I forget exactly what these were, but if you watch the video, and you know Genesis, you will see the contradictions.

My manuscript titled The Empty Lot Next Door is now making its rounds at the publishers so only time will tell if it is successful. However, Mr. Frey's inspiration and instruction made me finally stop thinking about writing and finally start writing. Thank you Mr. Frey!Arthur M Mills JrAuthor: The Empty Lot Next Door"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advice","review":"I'm glad I bought this book. There is definitely good content here and I will continue to work with it. I just wish I were more impressed with Frey's own writing. It gets the job done in a heavy handed sort of way, but isn't something I'd want to emulate or enjoy reading for hundreds of pages. This isn't a big slam, just a little case of being fussy. Hence the 4 instead of 5 star rating. It's still a valuable reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"A great comprehensive guide. Reader friendly. Treatment approaches are comprehensive backed up by the latest evidence.They even discussed the length of treatment recommended something that has been somewhat neglected in other sources.If it had Q&A; I would have given it a 5 otherwise it should be 4.5 but there were no half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Trash","review":"[Reviewer's edit: Prior to a necessary renaming of the product, this meretricious tool used to be called, \\"High Quality Watch Band Pliers.\\"]Despite the misleading product name, this tool is anything but \\"high quality.\\" The very first time I used mine, I irreparably bent the thing beyond recognition.It's frightening to imagine how any reviewer could confuse this laughable junk with a quality tool. It is made from cheap, soft base-metal, made in China, suitable for sale in a dollar store, at best. And that's the good news.The bad news is that the design itself is so flawed, illogical, and flat-out wrong, I'm just thankful that it's not an airplane part."},{"rating":"1","title":"very difficult to use","review":"the master that made the work for me did the pin removal and she end up scratching my watch.

Product looked cool, so picked one up.Tried using it on a dive watch with 22mm bracelet. Bracelet link started to come out, but as it hit a tougher spot, the actual tool bent, so now it's useless.Didn't even work successfully once. Made of cheap parts and cheaper metal. Not worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have to practice a little to use it but a great tool","review":"There have been some concerns about no directions coming with this tool or the fact that it's hard to use. Well, having been in the jewlery business years back, you have to practice a little to know how to change out watch bands and take out links.This is a good tool, but it depends on the agility of the user.I've used it to adjust at least six watch bands so far, and it's been relatively easy to use. It's simple, and I think most people with a little patience could use it to adjust their own watch bands.Well worth the $15 price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Product EVER!!!","review":"First of all, the description said \\"4 Extra Pins Included\\", it only comes with one. Secondly, this tool does not do the job, it is very weak. The thing that suppose to hold the watch in place keeps sliding even I tried the hardest to tighten it up. It is a piece of crap tool probably made in China, I paid $20 for a piece of junk. I wish I never bought this. I wouldn't even pay $5 for this if I know this tool performs like this. One star is overrated!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"First time I used this tool both pusher tips broke off.

Very poor quality, worthless tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Link Remover that exceeded expectations","review":"Having tried 3 other variants of link remover, each with the same result (push pin snaps off), my expectations of this being any better were not high. However to my surprise and delight this tool did everything it was supposed to. The only downside to this was the locking screw that holds the adjustable slide bar in place required so much force to hold it in place that it snapped off, leaving me with a non adjustable band width, which as it turns out is not too much of an issue. Forget all the thumb screw type link removers, the steel pins used on those always end up snapping off. These pliers will work and are well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Company NEVER SHIPPED order and is NOWHERE to be found!","review":"I would love to have this item in my possession; I paid for it almost two weeks ago!The item never came. I contacted UPS to check on tracking which was reported as \\"in transit\\" by the seller.UPS said the shipping label was printed but the item had never actually been picked up by UPS.I contacted the seller via the avenue provided by Amazon and got no response.Perhaps the company will see this review, contact me as requested via telephone and make this right.I'll be sure to post the outcome for all to see as this is the crappiest most unprofessional customer service I've ever had online.If the company does make this right, it will, in my opinion, earn them 5 stars for mending a mistake that could happen anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"not fluffy","review":"The comforter is nice enough but htere is no way this is 750-fill power. I did some research before buying this and everywhere I read said that 700 fill power and above is superior and very fluffy, but after receiving the product and letting it air out and attempting to hand fluff it, it is no fluffier than my old down comforter that is only about 3 inches thick."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor technical support, difficult installation","review":"The product is misbilled as a 10-minute, one-wire installation. Rather, the alarm requires a difficult, \\"professional\\" type of installation with numerous relays, drilling, removal of dash and door panels, and such. Technical support at the manufacturer's website and 1-800 was non-existant as no technician responded to my inquiries and request for help after numerous attempts. Try another alarm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulldog 6002PRO Professional Car Alarm","review":"I purchased the 6002PRO, the alarm had problems from day one. The alarm had to be sent back to factory (at my expense) for an ajustment for sensitivitey. I was promised an additional transmiter for my inconvenience, when the alarm came back there was no extra transmiter. I could get no satisfaction from factory. I kept getting too many false alarms so finally disconected siren and use it strictly for remote door locks. My advice. DON'T BUY ANY BULLDOG PRODUCTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call Customer Support - BEFORE buying","review":"If you are thinking of buying from this company I would suggest you first call their toll free support number 800-878-8007, leave a message and wait for a return call.In the process of installing the alarm, I called their technical support group several times. Each time I reached a voice mail box asking for me to leave my name and number and they would call back. Most times this never happened and I had to call them back a second or third time.I purchased this alarm just before Christmas. When I opened the package and tested each of the buttons on the remotes, I discovered one of the remotes had a bad button. After several phone calls to \\"customer service\\" I was told I would need to send the remote back to them. At my expense of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lived Alarm System","review":"I Installed the 6002 Alarm and it worked for 3 months and then didnt work anymore. Sometimes it made the pre-alarm warning sounds at random.I had ordered the upgraded version of this alarm and received the older version."},{"rating":"1","title":"this alarm sucks","review":"this alarm don't due bulldog justice i have always took pride in the company stand behind its product but this alarm system makes me ashame to have the logo on my car it work good for a week or two now all its good for is unlocking the doors an sometimes it doesnt even do that it took a long time to hook up and the end result is you feel no safer than before you installed it. its better to leave your keys in your car with a sign thats says steal or protected by bull dog alarm what joke they even use the word protected. do not buy unless you just want and alarm that beeps not protect"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad Customer Service","review":"After buying a Bulldog alarm I lost my transmitter. I accessed their internet site and it was very plain and unfriendly. It had few options and no explanation of what to do. Their techical support telephone service is unreachable. I think Ill have to uninstall this system and buy a new one from a responsible dealer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this pack - just go for On Any Sunday alone - (still 5 stars)","review":"Lost my old copy of On Any Sunday (which I'd still give 6 stars out of 5) and got this pack as the replacement. In hind sight, I really could have got away with buying just a single copy of the movie rather than these 3. The other two discs got watched once and have sat on the shelf ever since.Unless you're a reall die hard fan (and willing to over look the lack of anything even close to as imapctful as the original) hunting for some cutting room floor clips, go for the original on its own. Sorry for being harsh and echoing other reviews, but has to be said."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, BORING, BORING","review":"Do yourself a favor and don't waste the few dollars it costs for this piece of crap. I am about as liberal as it comes to bad movies, as a matter of fact, I cherish bad movies as long as I'm not bored. Usually, the cheesier, the better. This one is boring, and doesn't have anything to do with any girl as far as I remember. It sucks, and the transfer is AWFUL!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOT GARBAGE","review":"I bought this to do some research on Pac, and it is really, I mean really, HOT GARBAGE. If you buy this video, you cannot say that you havent been warned. It has NOTHING to do with Tupac, or Tupac life. They interviewed a bunch of nobodies.....one guy was a security guard at Wendy's, another threw a party and just wanted to interview the women that came in about what Tupac meant to them. They shot this in club with no lighting, no nothing....all I can say is that you have been warned.....this get ZERO STARS if I Could...but I will give it the one star for the bootleg footage of Afeni and some of the Outlaws...and for $29....please......if you notice, there is no DVD version of this. Before I Wake and Thug Angel are much better titles"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I'm a huge fan of Zero Hour. I don't even know if they're still around, as they've been off the radar for a couple of years, but after finding this CD, I'll be able to hold off awhile until the next Zero Hour release comes out. Great riffs, spectacular drumming, and great vocals. Good job guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL BLADES!!!!","review":"Confirming the previous review of these jointer blades, they arrive so dull I did not even try them on the jointer.

They are worhtless so do not waste your time with this and just order the freud blades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"This is misleadingly-titled, poorly written revisionist drivel.The author, who writes like a retarded fifth-grader, completely misrepresents any association between Hitler and Hanussen. Only the last few pages are dedicated to their 'relationship', which according to even the most dubious sources was limited to one or two brief meetings and Hitler giving Hanussen a brief nod as he once walked into a restaurant.Riddled with poor grammar, factual inaccuracies and mind-numbingly inane speculation, I would not recommend this book to anyone over the age of six."},{"rating":"2","title":"the streamlight 75001 stinger light.","review":"nice flashlight very bright, like the rechageable feature at a very low price did recomend to my friends to check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"back in top form","review":"I was a little (just a little) disappointed with her last two releases, Dear John Coltrane and Plutonium Glow. But this latest is fantastic all and all. She sounds better than ever. The music is a nice mixture of Slow to Burn and Plutonium Glow with a touch of jazz fusioned with the Futuristic touch of Peter's. Make You Love remains one of the romantic songs I've ever heard. Juliette is simply sexy beyond words. She's (they've) done it again! Get the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets even better with each listen!","review":"Since Amazon tagged my \\"so you'd like to..\\" guide with the cover to her superb and sultry \\"Zipless\\" , I felt somewhat compelled to get more familiar with Vanessa's other work. I chose \\"Make You Love\\" as my next purchase and was extremely impressed. Her incredibly sexy breathy vocals aren't the only highlights of this album. The production of this entire piece of work is thoughtfully and painstakingly crafted... from each percusssive hit to the touches of reverb to the level of bass and where it sits in the mix. Her take on Jane's Addiction's \\"I Would for You\\" breathes interesting new life into a classic song. \\"A Little Bit Of Pain II\\"'s bassline is a groove delight entwined with luscious vocals. \\"You\\" is a perfect opener... pop-laced and upbeat. A phenomenal c.d.!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely delicious!","review":"I found this new CD from Vanessa in a big store in Paris, last february. It was a total surprise, and I bought it immediately to open it only at my return to my homeland, Chile. This album concentrates all that Vanessa is in music. Soft and inviting melodies, meditating and ethereal tunes and, above all, good music, that reaches the soul and the heart. You will devore this awesome album from the first 'til the last second of sound. Don't wait any longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"V: Enigma or Mystery?","review":"So Vanessa disappears for months and years, and her albums go out of print and fetch big bucks on ... well, rhymes with Lady Day. Searches for Mp3s or photos are in vain; they hide in the shadows of cyberspace, only peeking out from behind the screen occasionally just as a tease.Then, one day, her albums just materialize, digitally, on Amazon without a word from V or the universe in general. And she sticks the torch in for good with sweet and mad works like Lovechild or A Little Bit of Pain.But what do you expect? ... she was born on an island."},{"rating":"1","title":"jvc kd-sx980","review":"i found the face plate for this stereo in a case on the street (don't leave things on the roof of your car, especially expensive things).

I ordered mine mid 2001, so escaped the price rise - it helped ease the financial pain, but I'd buy it anyway. It's not what I expected - lots of glossy prints, though there are plenty - but the catalog was an eye-opener - I never realised just how broad his ouvre was, and am now chasing other goodies for the collection. The biographical info was very interesting too - it gives a good insight into very creative man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this company's products!","review":"I recently installed a Model RS92. The directions that came with this remote car starter are not only hard to follow, but if you follow a certain portion of the directions, as they are depicted, you will most likely damage your vehicle's wiring. Most autos will require additional hardware to properly install these remote starters, and the directions are very poorly written. Forget trying to get in touch with them. The phone is always busy and they don't reply to e-mail. My RS92 failed out of the box, and I can't get anyone to repair/replace it. I have an Associates degree in Electrical Technology, and I still had a hard time figuring these directions out. Do yourself a favor find another manufacturer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Consumer Relations","review":"I don't even know if my Remote Starter works because I received the installation instructions for an Alarm System 5002 Pro and haven't been able to contact anyone in the Tech Support department to clear up the mix up. I have been calling for 8 consecutive business days and the line is always busy. I have emailed without success and faxed without success. It appears they take the money and run. I guess I am on my own. Maybe the Better Business Borough would be interested in what I have to say if Bulldog is not. Their web site is blatent false advertisement. They state that you will talk to a \\"live person\\" (a highly skilled tech) but they neglect to mention you will be 10 years older by the time they get back to you! I believe this product is good but the company's customer care ethics !

I got the starter and stop features to work, but the \\"finder\\" and \\"panic\\" features dont...because i didnt hook it up to my horn and lights. It's pretty damn hard to install, esspecially if you are a rookie at car wiring. Tech support didn't help either, too slow and they never answer their phone. But over this item is dope, it works great but the only down side is the installation difficulty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulldog RS92 Remote Car Satrter","review":"After installing the RS92 in a 1999 cavalier I found that it will not work unless you order part #721 to bypass the anti-theft system.

The wires were not identified. The instructions for the parking light output were so incoherent as to be unusable. The manual is the worst I've ever seen. (I work as a maintenance technician in an automated facility). I have been calling the \\"support\\" # for 5 days. I have sent E-mail after E-mail requesting more info, No response at all. Now my dash is still unassembled with the unit halfway installed. One more day, and it goes back to them!

I all ready had an autostart system in my 1994 chevy silverado, so I just took that system out and replaced it with the Bulldog RS92. The range isn't great (Maybe 400 ft with an external antenna), but it does what it's supposed to do. As a cheap remote start system, it works great. One little tip: the manual suggests purchasing an additional relay for the parking lights, but this can be easily fixed by simply connecting the hot wire for the parking lights to the accessory power line. Reasonable remote start system, but if power lock control or security are desired, look for a different system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictional history","review":"Despite the stellar reviews, I must say that I did not care for \\"I, Mona Lisa\\". I do occasionally enjoy historical fiction, but this story was more of a fictional history. If you enjoy learning a new tidbit from historical fiction or getting a feel for a time period through vivid, detailed descriptions, this may not be the book you're seeking. As an alternative within the same genre I would recommend a Philippa Gregory novel. Ms. Gregory's characters are far more complex, her writing style more engaging and her historical descriptions far richer.However, if it's simply a good story you want, Jeanne Kalogridis does a fine job of weaving the many details of the plot into a coherent ending. In the interview with the author at the back of my copy, Ms. Kalogridis sheds some light on why she writes in the style she does. I just couldn't help but wish that she had incorporated more of her obvious knowledge and interesting observations of the Mona Lisa and Renaissance art into the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read but GLARING error in the plot!","review":"I would have given this book a higher rating but for the ending. I thought this was a well written book. It had enough suspense to keep my interest throughout. In fact, I had a hard time putting the book down. However, when she reveals her final plot twist and tries to explain it, I realized that none of her explanations for why one the other characters (Mona Lisa's father) acted a certain way make sense. I cannot believe the editors of this book did not pick up on such an obvious flaw. Without giving too much away, the father took certain action because his wife was pregnant. In an attempt to create a final twist, she reveals that the wife was not pregnant until AFTER the father took those actions. Then why the heck did the dad do everything he did? It makes no sense and it simply makes the entire book fall apart.She should have left the final twist out. If she had, it would have been a GREAT book. Too bad...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too far from true","review":"I was disappointed with the liberties taken to alter history in this book. With so much written about the Mona Lisa, Leonardo Davinci and the Medicis, the author takes too far a leap with the character's personal lives. I am a huge historical fiction fan, and although well written, this was frustrating to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond fiction","review":"I enjoyed reading the book until I realized that the author let her imagination be carried away beyond fiction. There is no documentation whatsoever that Lisa was married to a Medici. Granted it is historical fiction but the most deluded narration of who her real father was (let us not spoil the plot ) is beyond any stretch of the imagination. Very disappointing indeed. There is so much licence you can take in altering history. This is beyond fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't stop reading","review":"I like her style. There's enough detail & character development to feel like you get a sense of the time, but enough action to keep you turning the pages. I like how she portrays female historical figures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow.","review":"I am an avid reader of historical fiction and this was one book I just couldn't get into. The premise of the book sounded very interesting to me. I started it and the novel just dragged on and on. I remember starting it and putting it down for weeks at a time - not a normal occurrence for me! I suppose this novel just wasn't for me and maybe someday I'll give it another chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting take on Mona Lisa","review":"I picked this book based on other reviews and was not disappointed. I was torn between 4 and 5 rating. The author's story is rich in historical detail. If you've ever visited Florence or plan on it this is a must read. The romance was artfully woven between the intrigue so the book is hard to label with one set genre. All around wonderful book for a weekend read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Italian History Comes To Life","review":"I read this book just before taking a trip to Italy, and the characters and locations really came alive for me on the visit. The book is educational regarding the DeMedici family and what it was like to live in that time period as well as an engrossing fictionl account of the woman who sat for the famous portrait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misadventures w/ Alfalfa, Spanky, Buckwheat, etc...","review":"I love watching this classic kids-tv series w/ my 2 kids (ages 8 and 6) - they are so engrossed in watching this DVD and are truly entertained by the little rascals' antics.

Most importantly, although there is a maximum weight is listed for the product, there is no mention of a minimum weight - every time my 85 lb son got on it, it tipped over, causing him to fall head-first. The third (and last time) that he tried using it, he fell hitting the back of his neck on the hammock's horizontal bar.

Then there was one that was missing the pins to connect it together, where as another had the pins bent and twisted so it would not lock into place. So that was three connection points on the hammock that were, in my opinion, unsafe.Really got screwed on this one, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Out Of A Rut","review":"I was in a rut and The Essential Guide helped me out of it.

I hate buyer regret. I do very thorough research on any product/service in every effort to make an informed decision prior to pulling the trigger. Unfortunately, even the most diligent research is not a 100% GUARENTEE.Now, lets just cut to the chase -The good - easy to assemble and looked nice prior to use.The bad - terrible quality. After one use, one of the spot welds that holds the door hinges snapped off. All the poor quality mesh has warped under the heat. Finally, the so called powder coated finish did nothing and the entire unit is completely rusty after a few weeks outside. Oh, and it sucks to move it. The design makes it very hard to move with one person.Final thought - thumbs down, grade F, look elsewhere for your firepit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"We used this fireplace one time and are ready to send it back.

I have found its layout to be especially useful in very quickly targeting those \\"what does the rule book say?\\" situations one is most likely to encounter in a typical round--and it does so without endless cross references. Its compact size allows for it to be readily carried on the course for quick access.I was introduced to the Guide through its being awarded as a tee prize at the Transamerica Senior/ProAm at Silverado in Napa Valley, CA--and have since purchased several copies for friends and associates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interesting","review":"Some of the Tintin stories are great, IMHO, so I bought the entire collection recently (except, Congo because it doesn't seem to be available at a reasonable price). This is Herge's first toddling steps into storytelling. It may be of value to some, since it's the first Tintin story, but it has no value as art. The drawing is rudimentary, there's no actual story, the situations may have been innovative at the time but today they're extremely weak and an insult to the reader's intelligence. This is advertised as a graphic novel in which capacity it scores zero. It's also not a comic since it's not comical, just annoying. Neither is it an adventure, although there is misadventure, stupidity, and nastiness. Tintin comes across as unlikeable, unethical, abusive, and criminal on several occasions. Plus, it failed to get me to suspend my disbelief. This (and Congo) is not included in the Collectors' Gift Set, for reasons that are now clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved The Adventures of Tintin - In the Land of the Soviets","review":"My 10 year old son loved this book as he did the others in the series.

I used to read them as a kid and still have all them that were purchased nearly 30 years ago, and I'm looking forward to reading them to my son when he gets a little older. I accidentally discovered that this book was available, and bought it straight away.I'm disappointed because that everything that makes Tintin a great read is not here. No story, no characters, no adventure. Just a series of should-be fatal accidents and hardly any dialogue. Frankly I don't care so much that the drawings are not as refined as the rest of the books. What does bother me is that the content of this book is so dumbed-down. I was a tedious read - so much so that I could barely finish it.I gave it two stars instead of just one because it does have obvious collector value. If you're looking for an enjoyable read, in comparison to the other books, I would steer clear of this one. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worse TinTin title ever!","review":"I am always hungry to read more and more of Tin Tin stories. I am even so addicted that I read the story frequently. I started reading Tin Tin when I was 12 years old and I never stopped even if I am 33 years old now!Luckily Tin Tin in Soviet land was not the first of Tin Tin adventures that I read, otherwise I stopped! The worse of all adventures with so much of unneeded attack on communists that it reach racist level against Russians! As I finished reading it I had doubt, is it really Herge who wrote it?. Is it the same writer who wrote as I consider the best peace of art in the world of comics?So if you didn't read Tin Tin ever, I don't recommend that you start with this title!

I love hearing the history (and folly) of countries spending massive amount of money building battleships to the point of bankrupting their countries. All the while the battleships were not decisive in any major war.Learn how the battleships evolved from wooden vessels with cannons to massive steal behemoths with 18 inch guns, the battles they fought in the two world wars, and how air power rendered them virtually obsolete.The videos and narratives are great.

I was a massive fan of the first \\"Army Men\\" game that came out and that was definitely a very cool game. \\"Army Men: Air Attack\\" has arguably worse graphics than the first game and the gameplay is often problematic.It was cool to play a game with helicopters and army men, but the game is so short that you'll be done in less than a day if you play it non-stop. Look, the bottom line is that this game is just too short, too easy and is clearly based for younger kiddies, so I guess for a 16 or 18 year old this game is just a piece of piss.So get it for your kids if you like, but there are many newer, longer and more stimulating games out there, even for young ones. I guess that if I were a kid I'd give the game 7/10, but since I'm older I give it 3 stars.

The drawings are decent, but the amateur key used to limit your choices is too amateur. The distribution of covered species is strictly for the Northeastern U.S., except for the occasional wide-spread grasses. If your not in the Northeast, another guide would be more benefical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useable, but flawed","review":"As another review noted the range of this book is limited, from Minnesota to Kentucky and Maryland south, and north to Maine, although some of the grasses are more widespread. The copyright date is 1979 and while that does not disqualify it, it has not been updated. It suffers from 1) poor reproduction of the line drawings which are supposedly \\"as beautiful as they are exact\\" - they aren't either in this edition, being too small and with line details running together to show nothing but a black blob in many cases, and 2) no photographs, which I have come to expect of any decent field guide nowadays (especially in the absence of GOOD line drawings!). Also, the grasses are organized \\"by visual similarity, not always by taxonomic grouping.\\" I'd prefer the latter.On the plus side it has a useable key and often interesting information is presented for a species. I'll keep this book, but I would have bought something else had I known!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great grass identification book","review":"This is a very nice, simple identification book. I very much appreciate the drawings, every grass has at least one page with drawings sometimes of different stages of the life cycle, there is an identification guide in the beginning of the book,and a glossery of terms in the back.

The number of grass species covered is very disappointing. And the illustrations are poor, as others have mentioned/ The printing is often blocked up to the point that there is no fine detail visible, just a black ink blob. At least one is printed so weakly that there isn't much visible other than the stem of the grass. VERY disappointing. Looking at reviews from people who think highly of this book, I can't help but think that the printing quality varies greatly from copy to copy, because I don't see how anyone could find the illustrations very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grass book","review":"This book only covers grasses of a portion of the U.S., but it does a good job of listing many types."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good field book","review":"I got this book when I got sent out to OK to do a large delineation.

We were excited to receive it and set it up. It's very comfortable. However, we've used it for about one month, and yesterday my daughter noticed that a rope had snapped. At first I thought it had come undone, but then I looked more closely and realized that not only had it snapped, almost all of the ropes were chafing on the spreader bar and many had worn more than halfway through already. With only small children on it, another rope has had one of its three strands snap. So basically this is unusable after only one month. We never had anyone heavier than 150 pounds use it, and together with children, no more than 220 pounds total on it at one time.

We tried it at a varity of tensions, and the problem remained the same. I can't tell you how many people ended up in the garden unintentionally.

I don't know where the recording studio found these people but they do not seem to be professional performers. The music is somewhat unorthodox in terms of being revamped or remixed to what came out to be a totally boring arrangement with no rhyme or beat to it.This was a complete waste of money.

The humor really stereotypes stay at home moms. I read a couple of chapters and just couldn't take anymore of it. It was actually disturbing. To me, it wasn't worth the money.

However it is most certainly not worth the price in that it does not grate well at all. I mainly needed something to grate cheese with and all I get with this are crumbles. The box is difficult to attach and does NOT stay on securely. As other reviewers have noted, the little rubber edge at the bottom tends to collect crumbs and is difficult to clean. I had much better results with a cheap $2.00 grater from the grocery store. This thing is headed for the trash today and I am off to the grocery store to buy something that is at least useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"seems like the perfect grater, but delivered defective.","review":"my unit was delivered bent so it will go back. box was not damaged, so it was not shipping issue.tired of all the defective products delivered from amazon. is it just me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Red","review":"I like this product because it's red to match my kitchen.

IT works well enough to suit my purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive & well functioning grater with a couple drawbacks","review":"This grater looks great and works really well. I'm a big fan of the containter that fits in the bottom to collect whatever it is that you're grating!However, due to a couple of issues, I will most likey not be keeping it.The rubber piece at the base of the grater collects cheese/veggies, etc. I have to remove the piece entirely after every use to clean it and it can be somewhat tricky to get back on.I ran this through the dishwasher one time, when it came out, the handle was full of water, even though the item is supposed to be dishwasher safe. Most of the water drained out, but I don't like the idea of old water being left in the handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The major flaw is the curved design. The middle of the food grates down faster and the ends develop \\"points.\\" As the points form and break, food litters the work surface. I bought the grater for the large slicing blade side, wide and high enough to slice a good sized piece of cheese. However, again, the shape causes oddly curved slices and lots of broken bits and ends. The gasket is a debri catcher. It isn't easy to fit the storage box onto the grater, though it can be done. However, the messiness caused by the curved design defeats the purpose of the container. All in all, a big and unexpected disappointment from KitchenAid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone Rusty!","review":"I bought this grater as I wanted a stainless steel one which wouldn't corrode and it came in red. However I have noticed after only a couple of months use that underneath the rubber anti slip bottom, my grater has gone rusty.How can this be? I thought. It's stainless.Then I re-read the description, 18/8 Stainless - gotta say I've never heard of it - just good old true to form 18/10 - so obviously this makes a huge difference.I am SUPER DISAPPOINTED with KitchenAid as I thought their products were the creme de la creme when it comes to kitchen ware.I will think again before buying anymore of their products - or check that it is REAL stainless steel - not the fake stuff!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big, bottom rubber comes off","review":"The bottom rubber comes off but is difficult to put it back on. And it is too big to handle. I wish I never bought it but I hate the red tape of returning, and some places make it so difficult to return items, I just kept it. Don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and hard to handle","review":"I thought this would be great to have around the kitchen but I was really disappointed from the first time we used it.Trying to grate cheese for pasta, even with the built-in container attached, I ended up having to put the whole contraption on a plate to avoid covering my entire work space in cheese. My boyfriend and I both found this grater to be clumsy (there's no way to grate on a slant, so half of the food ends up inside the grater as desired, but the rest ends up either on the counter or elsewhere) and lacking any benefit to justify the storage space it takes up. We're returning it and will be on the lookout for something more manageable."},{"rating":"2","title":"great shredder for low price","review":"I use this shredder about once a week. This shredder is great. The sides are sharp so it makes shredding easy. I was afraid that it was going to rust but I've had it almost a year and no rust! And, it's still as sharp as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use and Hard to clean","review":"I bought this because of the good reviews it has on here. But when I receive the product, first of all, it is huge. Because it is so big that it's really hard to hold it when you are trying to grade cheese into your dish. The only surface i use is the tiniest one. The other surfaces produce way too thin strips or pieces. For example, you can use it to cut potatoes into thin round pieces nor thin strips. Overal, I am kinda disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grater","review":"After 5 years of regular use, our grater is still going strong. It slices neat, even slices for sandwiches. It has large grating planes for the most shredding with each pass, and the hole sizes are just the right size. I don't use the zesting side, as I prefer a microplane.My favorite part is the container to catch the shredded cheese. No more cheese all over the counters!I do have to take off the bottom seal to clean it, which is annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good grater","review":"My roommate in college had this grater and when I moved into my own house, I ordered the exact same one. I love the storage container that comes with it and the size of this grater is ideal. I wash it in the dishwasher with no issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasent thrilled","review":"It is well made but a pain to use. All of the sides are rounded which in my opinion makes it hard to use and impossible to get flat slices. Also I usually tip my grater back a little for grating to get a better angle for speed, since the sides are all rounded it makes it hard to balance. And the plastic around the top makes it very hard to use I am constantly hitting the plastic first and destroying what ever it is I am grating esp cheese. I dont plan to keep this I keep trying to like it but just hate using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although the premise is great, the application is not. When I bought this several years ago, I thought it was the perfect grater: didn't rust, nice handle, sturdy, sharp and -- best of all -- came with a compact container stored inside into which most of the gratings would land. It's been used almost exclusively for occasional sharp cheese grating and storage -- I use a food processor for cabbage, carrots, etc. Yesterday I looked around the inside of the white plastic seal along the bottom edge (that helps stabilize the grater on the counter or when it is on top of the container and also retains the container stored inside), and it was black with mold. I pulled it off with the hope of cleaning it well with bleach. When I used it today, I noticed a large crack in the plastic handle where it attaches to the grater.This grater has never been in the dishwasher. It's always been gently hand washed and properly stored. I expected this to last a lifetime, but I guess I've outlived it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected based on the reviews","review":"I bought this based on the reviews on Amazon and found it underwhelming. First, the cheese flies everywhere - it does not stay contained within the grater. It is big and somewhat clunky and not that easy to use. After spending twice what I saw other graters for this thing basically sits in our cabinet not being used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great at grating but...","review":"I have been using this for two years, and the grater is wonderful.But the first trip the the dishwasher (top rack) it was nearly impossible to get the box to fit on the bottom. The bottom part warped, making the box useless.I still love it, using it over a plate/cutting board. But the box was junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value, Great Functionality","review":"I wanted a box grater that would not be an absolute pain to use, and this one is amazing. I love the fact that you can easily measure and store whatever you are grating with the attachable measuring cup. It is sturdy and easy to clean, basically everything you can ask for in a grater. I haven't found any problems with it yet, and I absolutely adore it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use...Cleaning in Dishwasher is easiest method","review":"Mine came with a container on the bottom to catch the grated food. It sounded and looked like a great idea, until it quickly cracked and broke. I can and do still use the grater though. I mostly use my KitchedAid food processor though to do a lot of my grating. I pull this out when I already have my processor in use and/or dirty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Item, Good Price","review":"I have not personally used the item, I purchased it as a Mother's Day gift. I was however very pleased with the overall quality of the item when it arrived (in a very timely manner).

I do not fault this as most are historical personages and they are included to give some idea of the chaotic doings of the time. Making deals, immediately breaking deals and general comings & goings across Northern Europe & England. I enjoyed the read but as one reviewer as noted you have to back up & reread from time to time. This is one of the only books I have found with the whole complement of personages. Gives a good impression of general chaos prevailing in that time and gets better the further into it you get. A good coverage of the battle and the lead up to it and the author attains that special something that we all look for in a good book. In my opinion money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tubular II is better than III","review":"I really enjoyed tubular II since I have had the CD for years.

This product claimed to be 18/10, but apparently cheaped out on the knife blades, which have spotted dreadfully. The rest of the pieces wash nicely, but the knives look so dreadful I would be ashamed to let anyone see them. I am going to look into returning them, which is a shame because the set is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great every day set","review":"We received this set as a gift, and we love it. The pieces are balanced nicely, not to heavy or too light, which can be annoying. We don't have a dishwasher, so I cannot comment about how they wash that way.

This was an incorrect assumption - neither of those movies is available on DVD.This set consists of two short documentaries. The Dam Busters Raid is actually fairly interesting, and covers the Ruhr dam raids, and the development of the bombs that were used. It's a pretty good look at the subject.The Battle of Britain is mostly about the Spitfire, and its development, rather than the actual battle. A lot of the running time is taken up with footage of the air show commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Nifty if you want to watch footage of 50 years of RAF planes zooming around to music with little commentary, but otherwise just filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay - that's all, just okay","review":"Eurocentric, of course. Titilating, sure. Accurate, not so much. Needed a fact-checker (editor should have cought some more obvious errors) and it seems to me that the author puts a 21st century filter on what she reports.For instance, she talks of 'mounds of flesh' on plump women as though it were repulsive in a time when we can see from the protraits done of women celebrated for their beauty that beauty often came in soft packages.Not really done from the feminist perspective and not as accurate as i'd like, but it passed the time on public transportation and for that I'm grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lord -- A Compelling Tale of Wild Goings On","review":"Ms. Herman captures the tone of this book perfectly -- whimsically recounting the intrigues, romances, love and horror stories over 900 years of Royal contretemps, across the imperial courts of Spain, Europe, England and Russia.I found this book to be thoroughly enjoyable -- a quick, engaging, and carefully researched look at the sometimes incredible lives of the royals. The queens had their work cut out for them, what with various impediments, sexual and otherwise, placed in their way to a fulfilling love life. These kings were a bunch of losers, for the most part, though the queens weren't always so hot either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched","review":"While entertaining at times, this book is obviously not done by a serious historian. Most of her material is taken from secondary sources. In one chapter, the material is actual a book report, because the author only uses 1-2 sources, and constantly quotes from one. I finally sold it to a used book store, because as a history buff, I was ashamed to have it in my collection. More People Magazine than history I'm afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book.","review":"I have really enjoyed this book. After reading it you feel like you actually knew these people at one time. The only thing I didn't like about the book was how much it does seem to jump around. The only thing about that though is you really get to see how much of the royal families were related and the level of inbreding that was going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining version of history","review":"Sex with the Queen was an entertaining journey through some of the most famous royal bedrooms in history. Covering women from Anne Boleyn to Catherine the Great to Diana Princess of Wales, Eleanor Herman brings to life the scandalous lives of royal women throughout history. Some were abused, unloved wives who just wanted to find some semblance of happiness in a world where royal females were cattle to be sold to the highest bidder. Some were not so sympathetic and at least one was completely innocent of the accusations that killed her.I enjoyed this book throughly. It was an intelligent look at the underlaying reasons for such \\"scandalous\\" behavior. It once again brings to light how deploringly women have been treated throughout history. It certainly has all the ingredients to make a good soap opera: sex, love, betrayal, and money. It definitely helps to make history more interesting and that is always a positive thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be a Queen? No, thanks.","review":"A survey of European queens and princesses who found love and sometimes disaster in marriage and extra-marital affairs. Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard are here, and thankfully the author testifies to Anne's innocence in her charges; Catherine the Great of Russia enjoyed lover after lover, well into her dotage; Marie Antoinette's king Louis was not very satisfying, and her nobleman lover's devotion went so far as to try and save her from the guillotine. Many of the kings in these mostly arranged marriages left much to be desired; often they were drunks, or not interested in the arranged queen, or not interested in women at all. Hanoverian Princess Sophia Dorothea (17th c.) was hounded by her mother-in-law and husband until her lover was murdered in her hall, and she spent the rest of her life in a forest castle, cursing her husband with her dying breath - the curse apparently worked, as he died within the year. Intrigue and passion on every page of this breezy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean and Clear","review":"The writing style is clean, clear and linear. It makes for a great weekend read. The stories are an appropriate blend of funny and tragic, and I like the non-fiction weaving of info about Wyoming, the West, tats, etc.I would have liked to see a little more introspection, for example, what went through her head and heart when Rick died? Also, I like a little more of a unique and personal writing style.

The notes are totally backwards from an actual saxophone or any other woodwind which I found annoying, and the fingering action is backwards too. Instead of pushing several buttons to form the correct note, the fingering is done like a piano, one note at a time, or many to form chords.

The toy however is hard to hold and hard to play. The kids got tired of it very quickly and went back to playing other instruments. The design of the mouthpiece appears to be too big for smaller kids to effectively use this toy. Even my older kid who plays the flute often had a hard time.

I took my r505 to work and placed it in a line with all the other notebooks at work, blind folded my boss and told him to pick out mine.

Instead, I found twin sisters who are totally unbelievable. In addition, Ms. Michaels asks us to suspend belief when the non-police type starts posing as an officer. Not only would this be illegal, it would be highly impractical to assume an untrained sibling could step into the shoes of a trained police officer. The lawbreaking continues when the imposter visits a suspects house, and because she has gotten wet, uses the suspect's dryer to dry her clothes.

The band had great stage presence, connected with the audience, and put on a great show. It is not the norm for me to like an opener to the point that I buy their CD the next day after a show. This one really stood out. One of the things that sets it apart from all the other stuff out there, is the brass mixed in with the guitar. Very good blending.

Not so much because of the plot - though I found that absorbing -- but because I felt I was being spoken to by a real person, and that every character that Reinhardt described was also a real person. I kept waiting in dread for a false note, but none ever occurred. The author is an acute observer of people, with no sentimentality, no pretense, but somehow with enormous warmth and sympathy.

I bought the book because the author is a cellist and attended Yale (so he might be a good writer), but I was wrong. He has no idea what he's talking about in most of the pieces for cello and some don't even make sense. It drags A LOT. I just wanted to stop halfway when it's in the trial part becuase it was so boring. I mean, who cares about whether if a monk killed so and so?

This is only partly true, Jerry Cantrell wrote most of the lyrics during the band's all too brief history, adding the dark tones so characteristic of AIC. Boggy Depot was a very unsatisfying solo debut for Jerry, only partially hinting at his talent. But with Degradation Trip, Cantrell seems to have finally realized that he has what it takes to be a front man. Degradation Trip can be seen as a sequel to Dirt, but that comparison may take away from the excellence of this album. The same edge, darkness, grinding guitar, minor chords, tongue in cheek lyrics, and complex harmonies that made up Alice in Chains is amplified here. If Layne was the heart of AIC, Jerry was the soul. He brings his artistry to it's culmination in Degradation trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely & awesomely amazing","review":"I've been following Jerry since the beginning.

It would've been nice to have the narration give directions for people who choose to follow along without the accessories.The overall program devotes a lot of time to holding certain positions and the narration talks through each interval of a position which could be annoying at times.

Palomar. It is very lengthy, well documented and from what I can tell, exceptionally accurate.It details the political, financial, engineering and manufacturing challenges that were encountered by a fascinating cast of characters, virtually all of whom have now left us, and how they met them in oprder to provide the world with what is arguably the single most productive scientific instrument ever created.It is not easy reading however and should be approached at a slow pace in order to fully comprehend all that is put forth. The persons depicted are treated not only as scientists and engineers, but also as people with families and interests outside of astronomy.I really enjoyed this book and I consider it among my most treasured literary possessions.Francis J.

I read the book over the next week, almost unable to put it down. The book covers much about Hale, the man behind the telescope and several earlier \\"largest telescope in the world\\" projects. He battled many private demons to get his dreams built. The book covers the processes in construction and use in a lot of detail, with a lot of drama (there were many points when all could have been lost very easily). Anyone with an interest in astronomy, the history of technology, or the history of science would enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the history of the telescope","review":"I had hoped for a better discussion of the engineering behind the telescope. It's clear that the building of this telescope was a tedious process and so was the reading of this book.

The condition was about the same, but the pictures were much more vivid and definitely enhanced the effect of the claytoons. Of course, the claytoons had always made the book come alive for me as a child. I would definitely recommend going for the older copyright if it's available.

Of all the other translations of Han-Shan I have read, I still think Watson's is the best from a literary point of view. Watson has a clean and direct style of translation which compliments the simplicity of Han-Shan's verse wonderfully. The poems chosen for this collection touch on such subjects as the impermanence of life, the quest for enlightenment, and the simple enjoyment of living alone in the midst of Nature. Although Han-Shan was well read in Chinese and Buddhist literature, his poems are not dogmatic or inexcessible to the Western reader in any way. In fact, they have a freshness and immediacy that seems very modern."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Try coming to Cold Mountain sometime!\\"","review":"I don't know Chinese. I know a little about Chinese Buddhism. But Han-shan and Watson have made these poem's familar: it's our condition.Each poem is a neat little eight line chunk. Nothing elaborate here, just simple poetry for our simpler side. Given all the bloated religious teachers and poets I've read, this is a refreshing change. Try to imagine how long it might take you to come up with a similar brief wise poem. Then consider Watson only translated 100 of Han-Shan's roughly 300 poems. How cold was that mountain?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly translated Chinese Literature","review":"A brilliant book. Beautifully translated by Burton Watson, but the real focus lies not with him, but naturally on the poems of Han-Shan, a Chinese poet and philosopher.

So we tried it, and it worked...but the second attempt landed it on the pump handle, which broke off! So now it can't be pumped!Also, the top pieces would sit on top and are supposed to snap in, and then pop off when it jumps or flips, but these wouldn't snap in properly, and were constantly falling off. You're supposed to stand it on it's nose when you pump it, so sometimes the wheels will pop out as you're pumping, meaning you just lost all the pressure you pumped into it!

It caused such a drop in performance, not just while using the program, but while using other programs as well. Blue screen errors and random lockups that even with Windows XP SP2 I had to do a hard shutdown to escape. I ended up having to do a complete hard drive recovery to finally fix the problems. I am positive that Studio is the problem because after recovering the first computer I tried to install the program onto a second computer and the blue screen errors and drop in performance started on that computer.

Version 10 is completely unusable and locks up 90% of the time. Another note is that if you open a project created in version 9 it converts it into a project that can only be used in 10.

That installation is for Studio Plus 10 only. The MediaSuite portion is contained on the 4th cd. After starting this installation, it refused to recognise the previous Studio Plus 10 installation (a requirement) and exits. A problem that Pinnacle is currently working on. The program is barely out on the shelf and we're up to three patches so far.

She NEVER does that when The Wiggles are on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo Wiggles, You Did It Again!","review":"Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I think this movie is awesome! My daughter watched it four times the first day we got it. Some of the other people say it is hodge podge and has western, Aussie, Hispanic and Italian all mixed in. SO WHAT! It's funny and has fun catchy songs! We have all the Wiggles movies and I don't like or dislike this one any different than the others, I am not one who thinks their earlier work is better. I like to see Greg, Anthony, Murray and Jeff evolve and change and KEEP GETTING BETTER! Go buy your copy today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wiggles - Cold Spaghetti Western","review":"Poor script with a few good songs - slow pace with to much narration for my 19 month old. Try Top of the Tots, Wiggly Gremlins, and Yummy Yummy - he loves them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice Cold...","review":"Being DIE HARD WIGGLES fans, we purchased Cold Spaghetti Western because it was the WIGGLES... Don't waste your money.It's pretty bad and usually they are right on! My three kids (2,3,4 yrs) left the room!?! Usually, they are GLUED to the Wiggles. Too much talking, not enough songs, and a inconsistent \\"plot.\\" Try Top of the Tots, Wiggle Bay, Hoop de Doo, or even Space Dancing before buying this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Wiggly","review":"My son is a huge Wiggle fan. We own every Wiggle DVD that is available in the USA, and I have to say that I easily tolerate watching them multiple times during the week. However, Cold Spaghetti is the ONLY Wiggle movie that is utterly painful to sit through. EVERYTHING about this movie is horrible. The story is dumb, the acting terrible, and sadly, the music is THE WORST!!! This is the only Wiggle movie that my son is not interested in. The few times I put it on, he watched it for a few minutes and then started to whine. I am sorry I wasted my money on this movie, as he is obviously not interested in seeing it. And I can't say I blame him. Parents, do yourself and your children a favor and buy any Wiggle movie but this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wiggles have hit an all time low with this movie.","review":"I am sad to say that the Wiggles have hit an all time low. This movie is an example of just milking their fame for all that it's worth. The music is terrible, the storyline boring, and the Wiggles themselves are just not \\"wiiggly\\". What ever happened to the cheerful and clever Wiggle World? What happened to the time when Captain Feathersword actually WAS a pirate!? Now he's reduced to a supporting character that is totally out of character! When was the last time we could call \\"Wake Up Jeff!\\" and watch Jeff jump up and down and do silly things? Wiggle World seems to have faded into a memory and with it so has the Wiggles ability to produce high quality, entertaining videos. The production values, music, story, sets... just about everything is terrible. The Wiggles just aren't the wiggles any longer. I highly advise that people stay away from this movie. It really is THAT bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"We are big Wiggles fans in our house, and were very excited to finally see this new one. It was very disappointing. My son kept leaving the room, which he never does when the Wiggles are on. I think the problem is that they have lots of other people singing the songs, and sometimes the Wiggles are singing in such elaborate costumes, my son didn't even realize it was them. A lot of the songs are either sung with heavy accents, or for some reason hard to understand. Also, with the whole thing shot as live action somewhere in Australia (I assume) it didn't have the same fun and colorful feel as their sets. The best part to me was the bonus \\"Asian Postcard\\" which I'm sure is for adults because they are just filming their travels on tour from place to place in Asia. It was a great way to see these talented people as they really are, and get a sense of what life on the road is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wiggles: Cold Spaghetti Western","review":"Being from Texas, my girls love to listen to \\"western\\" music. The Wiggles and Boot Skootin' all in the same place - A TRUE WINNER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Bad Than Good Here","review":"A few catchy songs (Master Pasta Maker being my favorite), a few songs that are just blah and a downright silly \\"plot.\\" The Wiggles love the town picnic and Alfonso's Great Western Cafe, and yet they have to ask for directions to get to town? What's that all about? Captain Feathersword pretty much remains in the background in this one, as do Dorothy, Wags and Henry. When my daughter indicates that she wants to watch this DVD, I put it in and fast forward to some of the better songs. The Wiggly Postcard from Asia is great, though. We all really enjoy that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tortuous for Parents Manic Wiggles drive me crazy","review":"This is the first Wiggles video that we got for our 2+ daughter. She likes the video a lot, but I have to say I find it impossible to watch. Based solely on this video alone, it is impossible for me to see what talent these four guys have at all. They are incredible annoying and MANIC (and I have no problem sitting through multiple Barney episodes). I also have a problem with the dumb stereotypes that they perpetuate. A siesta contest in which people compete at sleeping with Mexican characters looking on, and a Wiggle imitating a Chinese Chef with a Fu Man Chu mustache; not cool. I wish I could give it negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a cold shower","review":"My 2-year old really enjoys the Wiggles so I assumed this one would be a hit, too. Boy was I wrong! There are a few cute moments but the mariachi band (specifically the boy singer) were so awful and talentless I could barely stand to watch. The choreographer was pretty lame, too. Unlike most other Wiggly movies, this one had no catchy tunes. My son watched for a few minutes then was completely disinterested; he wanted to watch his \\"other Wiggles\\" instead. Skip this one and go with a classic, ie. Toot, Toot. We still love the Wiggles but this particular movie was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son shows no interest at all!","review":"I bought this for my 18 month old son along with Wiggles Bay and he is CAPTIVATED by Wiggles Bay - yet when I put in the Cold Spaghetti Western - he leaves the room to play with his toys! The video is possibly intended for older children - yet honestly - I was bored with this video too. There is too much going on with all the different cultures! Not the typical Wiggles Movie and I was so disappointed I'm sending it back for an exchange with the makers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We love the Wiggles, but we're disappointed with this video","review":"First, let me say that we're major Wiggles fans in our house: our copies of the videos \\"Wiggle Bay,\\" \\"Hoop-Dee-Doo\\" and \\"Yummy Yummy\\" get played over and over. That said, however, \\"Cold Spaghetti Western\\" was a disappointment to us (just like the other recent Wiggles video \\"Tops of the Tots\\"). These recent videos have an assembly-line quality about them -- the songs aren't memorable, the personalities of the Wiggles don't come through like they do in the older videos, and the adult professional dance troupe the Wiggles work with now is quite annoying (it was much nicer when they were doing the dancing themselves and having amateur children as dancers). Our advice is to check out the older videos -- the production values aren't as high but they have a lot more charm, originality and Wiggly joie de vivre than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wiggly review","review":"Getting a new Wiggles DVD is always like a great journey. They always excel in the quality of catchy tunes. This one is a short story about Alfonso, the Fair and the secret ingredient for his master pasta.The storyline is good and the tunes are great! We also enjoyed 'Postcard from Asia' with backstage footage of their trip through Asia,Japan and the Great Wall of China. Unlike Space Dancing,this video is to watch almost everyday"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD.","review":"Would've been nice to see this show if the DVD sent to me wasn't defective and sold to me as \\"new\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were the Wiggles thinking?","review":"Our family enjoys the Top of the Tots DVD, unlike some of the other reviewers.

Lots of bogus romanticization which would be thoroughly unecessasary if they had simply shut up and let the music speak for itself (like i give a crap what KEB MO has to say about any of the great bluesmen!!). The treatment of most of the musical forms is hoplessley brief and slapdash - particularily the cajun and Zydeco segments. Unfortunately, a lot of people will claim to like this simply because they feel like they SHOULD, but this was a concept that had a lot of potential that was ultimately squandered. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic","review":"Im only too the middle of part two of this four part series? just fantastic, i thought i knew alot about music but this series put me in my place real damn fast.I love music with my whole heart and if anybody out there just loves music, this DVD will put an ear to ear smile on your face watching this. God why cant this get an Oscar? This deserves every award ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, Confusing, Disappointing","review":"Its hard to believe someone budgeted a 4-part series that says so little about such a fascinating and important subject. This is truly one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen and in four volumes! The first episode makes no sense, its just bits and pieces of sound clips, film and photos supposedly representing the development of roots music but there's no story that ties it together. For example, gospel music is one of the foundations of roots music. The documentary spends a fair amount of time on the topic but gives no real explanation of what it is or why its so important. You have to already be familiar with the history of american roots music to put together the confusing pieces. Kris Kristoffersen narrates and sounds like he's about to fall asleep.

I have suffered from depression almost my whole life. Perhaps had my parents just read a book, I wouldn't have gotten this CHEMICAL IMBALANCE IN THE BRAIN! How do you use tactics and social interaction to prevent a physical illness? If you know how to do that, you should be the richest person in the world. That's like writing a book on how to prevent getting diabetes. You can't.

The book claims to have \\"real/hard data\\", but when it is compared to a non-soft science field, its claims don't hold water.One my larger issue is if their program taught children to be optimistic, or just taught them to answer questions (their tests) optimistically.

I'm not really sure which of my kids fit in the \\"spirited\\" category but I don't think it really matters, because the information is really interesting and applicable to all family relationships. And, I like how the author talks about not trying to change your kids and how they are, but how to help them learn coping skills to adapt how they are to how the world is and the situations they will encounter (e.g. daughter freaking out in every new situation). The author's tone is so collaborative and \\"we can do it\\" as opposed to many parenting books that feel very preachy and \\"you need to do X and Y\\".I'm about 1/3 of the way through it and have dog-eared about 40 pages. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for every caring parent's library","review":"'Want to give your children a gift that will be precious to them for a lifetime? Give the gift of optimism.Although I first read the book two years ago, it has left an impression on my parenting and I sometimes refer back to it. Seligman's research-based approach to instilling optimism and confidence is both inspiring and relatively easy to implement. While the book focuses on older children who are already proficient in dealing with abstract concepts, I found the book useful as a parent of very young children: some concepts could be applied to my parenting surprisingly early, and all could be applied to my personal outlook to enhance my own optimism and mental health (and to help me model optimism for my children).

He gives real stories and real strategies that can be applied to yourself and your children for lifelong success. I particually found the charts and tests useful and facinating and discovered things about my 12 year old that I did not know. His approach drills down to the real issues and removes the fog that clutters our judgment. This book is a must read for every parent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong, well researched book.","review":"I respect the opinion of the previous reviewer, but disagree. Seligman's research appears sound and is presented in detail for the reader's own evaluation.

We bought this stroller in a bit of a hurry because our original stroller, a travel system stroller by Graco that we loved, got broken by the airlines. I wanted a stroller that had reclining positions, a large canopy, and high handle bars. This stoller had all of my wishes, but sadly the adjustable seat is very hard to work (actually doesn't even work most of the time), it is flimsy and rickety feeling when you push it, the wheels get stuck (even on paved, flat surfaces), and the handle bar hurts my hands (it folds and the plastic isn't smoothed together and can really rub a blister on long walks.)

I'd of never read it. I'm so glad that I had the chance.I barely started this book yesterday and finished it today if that says anything. The characters are very involving, the plot is well done and it seemed that I was laughing at every other page despite the serious atmosphere. If I wanted to think back and analyze the book I could prolly find faults. However, based on my pure enjoyment of it, it doesn't deserve that disrespect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasing change of pace","review":"My reading habits seem to go in cycles, and my most current cycle is military s/f - space opera. Therefore, I was very pleased to find that one of my favorite authors had broken new ground. While I most heartily wish that Ms Huff would continue with her vampire tales (I really don't think that the relationship between Vicky and Henry has been played out), a series of novels set in this world would be very welcome indeed.What I found very enjoyable about the novel was that the author placed far more emphasis on plot and character development than on detailing the weapons and military ranks (which seems to be a failing far more common in male authors than female).The battle scenes were realistic and well described, and the characters, both major and minor were fully drawn (not cartoonish, as an earlier reviewer noted).I highly recommend - and I hope Ms. Huff keeps true to her pattern of writing several books around a set of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"a new sci-fi reader's take...","review":"I thought this book was really well done. Granted I don't know a lot about sci-fi, but it made a believer out of me. I'll be reading more and more books like this one in the future because of this book. It has an intelligent plot, interesting and real characters that draw you in and get personal without wandering away from the heart of the story, and it was just a good book. I wasn't interested in doing anything else once I started to find out how Torin was fairing against the Silsviss. The only thing I might have changed is the romantic relationship that started to take place but never seemed to go anywhere.

I looked and looked and come across this one and it was the best purchase I have made in a long time.

However, as I continued to read, I simply learned more about his thoughts, family, and interests...I truly did not learn much from this experiment. The book almost seemed to be an autobiography on Mr. Esau. I did, in fact, find him to be a funny writer, a funny man (we share the same type of humor); however, I purchased the book in order to read about God's surprises in someone else's life besides my own, but all I rec'd was basically information on his daily routine in life.

Compare Isaiah's reaction to statements in this book such as references to the Sovereign Creator God as \\"Mr. Anti-Easy,\\" (pg 16) and the attitude reflected in the words \\"he'd better get used to [my saying] 'God, surprise me.'\\" (pg 17)Something tells me Isaiah would not have been quite so bold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great angy music","review":"Ive been listening to these guys for the last couple of years and going to their shows around my hometown, of Spokane.

They play hard from the beginning and never let loose, and they rapping is powered by shrieks and screams that had to the \\"metal\\" part of Rap Metal. So if I were you, than I'd buy ASAP.

Frankly, one is given to wonder if there are those among the previous reviewers who might, perhaps, not exist at all in real life.True; not a nice thing to say. However the afore-mentioned ego of Mr. Frey does come though in his writings. And, in his work practices. I have also had the great displeasure of trying to deal with this individual on a business level and can assure you - a good businessman he is not.For my two cents, short and spiral bound about sums them up.

Joshua Gates and his crew travel the world seeking to find evidence of different creatures and spirits from all sorts of different civilizations and cultures, including the Chupacabra, Yeti, Bigfoot, Gnomes, Aliens, and even an Island of Haunted Dolls. Some episodes reveal little to no evidence, while others reveal exciting experiences (the randomness makes it more interesting.) The show maintains a scientific methodology by heavily researching their cases (even rendering 3D models on the computer to make the creatures more lifelike!) If you're a fan of legends, mythology, and sci-fi, then this show will surely interest you.

Our kids are 2,7 and 14, and they all love the show. The humor of Josh makes it work for all of us. Don't get me wrong, this is NOT a kids show. Sometimes the younger ones have to hide their eyes. It can get a bit creepy for them.Josh leads a team of investigators searching for the truth about rumored legends around the world. They travel the globe, which is great for the kids to see. My kids love to see the world maps, the locations and the indiginous people. In a strange way it's actually educational. It can be frightening at times with creatures in the woods in the middle of nowhere, but Josh keeps it light and funny in the face of fear, which for me, is another good lesson for our younger generation.It's fun and interesting, even if they never actually prove or disprove anything. Watch for Josh.

I will continue to support this show and look forward to additional DVD releases. Now to push SyFy for more than six or seven episodes a season - that's just budget BS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something is out there. Maybe...","review":"I know, I know. The show hardly shows any real proof of the existence of the paranormal or beastly creatures, but for some reason I find the show entertaining. Josh Gates adds his travel experience and comedy relief as the adventurers circle the globe trying to find proof for the show. Sure it gets frustrating when they act like something is there and nothing shows when they come back to the cliffhanger. I'm still giving the show a chance.Down the road the show will run out of ideas or monsters, but until then try and enjoy the series.

Big, roomy, comfortable to carry (no matter how much you stuff inside) and a very well thought-out design."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this bag!","review":"I was really excited when I first got this bag, but since have grown to hate it. I have a Dell laptop, relatively light weight and I carry my computer in this bag at all times. But it has terrible weight distribution! In fact, my shoulder was hurting so much after one flight that I checked my laptop in my luggage to avoid using this bag. Poorly designed! Do not buy this bag if you plan to carry your laptop. It just was not designed properly for it! I now have the latest Eddie Bauer bag and am very pleased. Anyone want a slightly used Amazon bag? (ha ha)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Bag","review":"This bag is a great bargain (though I got it as a gift). There aretons of great little pockets here and there...even one to put my cell phone in. As for putting a laptop in there, I had problems putting my big Dell Inspiron in there...though it does fit but it's tight. Another work laptop I have--also a Dell but a bit smaller and probably more the size of the average laptop fits in there perfectly. It's fairly comfortable and fits a lot. It's a kind of heavy bag to begin with...so if you use it as makeshift gym bag or beach bag, a simple towel and some CDs makes it heavier than you'd probably want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional, comfortable, attractive","review":"The bag is very comfortable and easy to tote (I'm a bus, rather than bicycyle, traveller), and the convenience of the pockets and divisions is excellent. I use it to carry books, files, and other teaching materials, and its construction relieves the pressure on my less-than-perfect back.

I echo all her sentiments and would like to add two additional comments. First, the writing in the instructional manual for this device was atrocious; it was full of errors as well as confusing due to poor construction. Second, the tech support line for this product is nothing more than an employee fielding complaint calls. There was no effort made to help me solve the technical problems I was experiencing; the way the call was handled led me to believe that the whole operation was a sham. The only help they would give was to offer to, \\"look at the device if I sent it to them and they would replace it IF they could re-create the problem I described\\". At that point, we saw no reason to mess with the company and simply sent the devices back to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Support","review":"I don't know who wrote the English directions for this product but they suck-there is hardly any info at all- my product did not come with any info as to how to get in touch with the company if there were problems on the pc.

The second day I carried it in my pocket (with nothing but my cell phone knocking against it), the glass screen cracked and broke apart. In my pocket. Guess what happened when I reached my hand into my pocket which now had bits of broken glass into it?The third day I was using the Machspeed Trio was when it died. I put some documents onto the drive and went to Kinkos to get them printed. When I gave the clerk the drive, he was unable to get information off it. He couldn't even get it to register in the computer. He tried it in four different computers, and none of them worked. He gave it back to me, and I couldn't even get it to turn on. I changed the batteries - no good. It just died.Thanks, Machspeed Trio. I really enjoyed your product for about 18 hours.

I was thinking I might be lucky without suffering what people complained. Indeed, I am lucky. Mine works fine including browsing folders, etc. The voice recorder is not that great. I think that is due to the mic+ADC sensitivity. The manual is indeed not clear but the principle of operations is pretty much the same as other mp3 players especially on the short press vs. press-and-hold. So, I end up figuring out most of the operations myself. The manual has some strange grammar in the text. It was probably written by a foreigner. It would be nice if this unit also comes with an FM radio.

I was about to give up, assuming the play button was defective but then I realized it just needed a very quick tap. I was pushing the button down too hard and I'm guessing that's why the mp3 player appears to be defective to others when it just requires a lot lighter touch and a bit of wait time until it loads. So while this player gives you what it advertised, I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a lot of patience (the instructions do suck). You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bargain...","review":"For a mp3 player / recorder / thumb drive this price and for 1GB, this is a good bargain, but there's always room for improvement:1) ear buds: without cushions, it will always fall from your ears;2) the headphones cable sports a \\"heart\\".

Only drawback is the way it burns up battery life.","review":"I like the item and all the features on the mp3 player. The only drawback about this product is I don't know about everyone else who purchased this mp3 player, but mine personally burns up a lot of battery life. This is a bummer b/c I like to work out quite a bit. I still like to use it though despite I'm looking for a battery that can handle my long workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this.","review":"I decided to purchase this product on the fact that it was a 1 gigabyte mp3 player, that cost only around $30. It worked perfectly two for the first two days of use, however on the third day, the buttons started malfunctioning. I used this for two months, the volume does not increase, rarely does it happen, you either have to press really hard or hold the button for a long time. Besides that the power button that is used to turn the player on/off, and to play and pause songs, completely collapsed, and does not function anymore, leaving this mp3 useless. All this after only two months of use....the best thing to do is buy an ipod or a Creative mp3 player,,,something that many people have....that has a proven quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective MP-3 Player","review":"Not only wouldn't my product work, but it discharged the battery so fast the player was almost too hot to hold.

I also should be able to give this no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks big time","review":"I give this product a one star rating because there's no option for zero. Got one for myself and my husband and as soon as it arrived I immediately put it to use. it was working great, i even fell asleep listening to it, up till the following morning when i changed the battery and then the damn thing wouldn't play. It got stuck at menu and non of the buttons were working worst of all it wouldn't turn on at all after an hour no matter how many batteries i replaced it with. This product is not worth $39.99, a dollar or even this web page that it's on. will never try an off brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction","review":"I purchased this mp3 player due to the price....and as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.Overall I find the player poorly made. Somehow, dust has gotten on the underside of the plastic shielding which covers the LCD. This has made it very difficult to read. Additionally, the button to select items in the menu has gotten extremely touchy and normally registers two \\"button presses\\" when I press once.There are many better mp3 players out there with more capacity and features for the same or less cost. I have relegated this one to a thumb drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointing","review":"This book was purchased with the belief that in this book was something extra or to be read in addition to their online documentation.

Reagan is pitted against bad - guy hit man Lee Marvin in a classic caper movie. Angie Dickenson smolders up the screen in this 60's adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway story.

I am an advertising and media buyer working exclusively with interactive appliances and I found this book immensely informative. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introductory book","review":"This book gives a complete overview of possibilities for online advertising. Although lots of the information sounds very familiar, it's nice to have one book that says it all. I especially liked the extensive use of statistics and other research results of external parties. Naturally the sources of this information is specified each time, which gives you a nice idea where to get more information. The extensive Resource Directory (about 60 pages) is also very useful in telling you were to find more information, both online and offline.The book also convinced me that it's nearly impossible to build a profitable online presence by advertising income alone. Numerous examples and figures show that you need extremely high traffic, before the advertising revenue is sufficient to cover the high costs of running a content-driven website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed with knowledge, up to date. An essential guide.","review":"This book from start to finish explains clearly what the web is about for an advertisers point of view. It tells you everything about banner ads you never knew before, and explains what is beyond the banner. I have read many books on this subject, and I must say this has not left anything out. If you are going to advertise on the web you will be foolish not to look at this first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor grammar","review":"This book is full of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. For example: roll playing, instead of role-playing; technic, instead of technique. It also makes extremely poor usage of pronouns and direct and indirect articles throughout the entire book. I can only assume it was not reviewed by a competent editor prior to being published. I have no formal English language training beyond the high school level, yet I found it frustrating to read the book. Fortunately, it is a quick read. It took me all of thirty minutes to read the book from cover to cover. Most of the information contained in the book is common sense, but there were a few things my wife and I might not have thought of on our own. If you can get past the poor grammar, it is a worthwhile read. Is it worth buying? No, I would recommend getting it from the library or buying it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for single fathers.","review":"As a father I always try to find ways to protect my chiuldren.

So, if you are working with seven-year-olds, you simply go to the section labeled \\"Sevens\\" and you can read about their cognitive abilities as well as physical attributes an average child of this age has. I am a pre-service teacher and recieved only a short blurb copy of this book and knew I HAD to have the entire book. It has been a wonderful help in my teaching and I plan on utilizing it for my entire career. Get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"This book was recommended in the ASCD SmartBrief newsletter. It's a succinct description of physical, social, language, and cognitive characteristics at each age level, 4 - 14.

It is that attitude that lets evil spread. Using the past as illustrations, Mr. Guiness confronts our attitudes about evil. Correcting them is the key to dealing with evil in the best possible way. By asking seven incisive questions, he takes readers on a journey that will lead them to an apprehension of this enemy and, hopefully, to make a difference in their own hearts.**** Yes, the book is slanted towards a Christian world view, but he does present other views as fairly as it is possible for a committed Christian to do. Though the answers are staunchly Christian, they are presented logically enough that it is hard to imagine that a non Christian reading this would be offended. Reading a book won't cure the evils of life, but it might help you face them better. ****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unspeakable","review":"Facing evil, defining that word as a person and culture, why is it so difficult? Os Guiness does a great job in defining how Americans in particular are morally illiterate and intellectual cowards when faced with horrific events and agreeing on \\"evil,\\" and all of us alive today know some of the worst natural disasters and inhuman treatment the world has ever seen. We must have a shared, strong, non-controversial, focused response to evil and suffering. Otherwise \\"the consequences of our uncertainty damage us all on all sorts of levels.

These characters were so real to me that it struck me as bizarre that they weren't actually living in Las Vegas, working at the Dunes.I read this almost straight through.

In other words, what we consider fact today sure ain't what it used to be. And in her genealogy, Poovey suggests that today's fact is just as arbitrary as ancient ones.So, five stars for the subject matter and her Foucauldian historiography focusing on noticability and evolving styles of reasoning rather than the typical history's hunt for actors and origins.

This is ok for some forms of academic writing, but to the casual reader it is a bit infuriating to be assumed so dull witted that you do not understand the words in front of you.

But these texts are not at the same level as, for instance, the brilliant 'Penguin Guide to Compact Discs'. I am also a big fan of Mahler.

You can't use this for freshly dripped pops, only completely finished products.

The shows are fun to watch, but you better use a small screen TV. The image is no better than a second generation VHS tape at EP recording speed. It's DVD quality like this that makes one cautious about what labels to purchase from. It is too bad that Brentwood didn't get the original film kinescopes to master this classic material from.

Tragic.","review":"The story of Coreen Thomas, a young native woman from the Stoney Creek reserve in the heart of British Columbia, Canada, is a tragic one.On the centennial anniversary of the community of Vanderhoof, BC, Thomas, who was nine months pregnant, was struck by a pickup truck driven by Richard Redekop, a white male in his mid-20's who had a rather ominous history with the natives of Stoney Creek. Redekop was arrested, tried and found innocent of the death of Ms. Thomas. His claim was Thomas purposely jumped in front of his truck.The book by Bridget Moran is a hard hitting and thoroughly engrossing read. It gives a vivid account of the incident and the preceding trial, which wrongfully exonerated Redekop of the murder of Coreen Thomas and her unborn child.Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharply Honest","review":"I was a civilian working for USO in Vietnam during the same time that Dan Dane was there as a JAG officer.

So I tried to restart my computer and it wouldn't restart. I had to take it in to get it fixed, costing me $100 for the technician to tell me it was the SD card. Also, the camera I used it in, a Nikon D80 that I just bought 5 months ago, is now being shipped back to the manufacturer for repair - after using this card, the display monitor wouldn't turn on and the camera wouldn't record any pictures on any of my other SD cards.

I'm criticizing whatever amateur did the recording, mixing, and editing of this entire project. Well...I wasn't at all taken by this CD. It's not even a little good. No wonder it is out-of-print now. The arrangements are sparse and uninventive. The vocals by Clay are just aweful. I mean, it seriously sounds as if he went into the studio after just waking up one morning and did one take of his vocal. I can't tell you how many times he sounds uninterested himself...even flat at times. For a \\"professional\\" vocalist to do this is unexcusable. I get the impression that this was an independent recording and not one released by his former record label. Time and money was probably a huge factor in the making of this CD. Too bad it didn't turn out to be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLUE CHRISTMAS","review":"I haven't figured out why so many artists (particularly contemporary Christian ones) want to do Christmas songs as relics from the big band era.

First, Russ Taff, Kathy Troccoli, and now Clay Crosse. It's not that they are bad, but if you already have a good collection of holiday cd's, this one offers nothing new.

Following the vein of an earlier review, these are not as loud or punchy. I definitely lost base going from a much larger speaker to these. My Sub is more than able to make up the difference. So I turned my system up a little and turned the surrounds down, no big deal. But- I also got a much cleaner sound. I can play Iron Man at much higher levels and still retain clarity in the sound. We also picked up the ws-60 center and man does it sound great. I would never go back to stock speakers. The upgrade was more than worth it.

If you're looking for a homosexual-themed story, then you'll also be disappointed. Basically this film has the level of story and acting that one expects in a porn film without the explicit sex.

The two styles are VERY different. I challenge anyone who rated this CD with one star to see Matt in concert and NOT be amazed by his talent. Few artists can play a 12 string like Matt, few can put the amount of soul into their music, few can write lyrics like him, and few can mock themselves and \\"rock\\" in general while doing it. Matt is a true performer - he is NOT a studio wannabe and as one reviewer pointed out - he's been making music for years. This just happens to be his first studio release, but those of us with taste for the underground and non-streamlined studio music have been enjoying his last four CDs for years. Any reference to Britney-esque turnouts is ignorant and inept. Is Matt cutting edge and shocking? Maybe not.

Why is it that we still have these \\"soulful\\" folk/rockers complaining about life, love and such? Didn't we get tired of this ten years ago....when it was popular? Not to mention that this guy is just riding on the coattails of John Mayer--without the guitar talent. What really makes this different from Britney Spears? Poorly written pop songs pulling on the heartstrings of thirteen year old girls. It is just the same old subject matters treated in the same way they have always been treated. These dime store poetics may impress the pre-puberty crowed, but us adults need something more than old-fashioned love songs.

This resulted in us not having the camera for taking pictures during a birthday party (we're still waiting to hear from Nikon about our camera!). The aggravation and hassle of dealing with amazon.com and Nikon, plus the cost of sending the camera prepaid for service, plus not having the use of the camera during an important event are definitely not worth the savings in price.

The Dookie covers are, but far, the worst. 'When I Come Around' is just downright embarrassing. If this was intended as a tribute it falls far short and ends up being closer to mockery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shade of Brown-Green","review":"This one really disappointed me. I brought this album because I am a huge Green Day fan, and I was interested in how other bands, including Weezer, imitated them.

They use a lot of strange and underused instruments here - violens mostly but some other instruments that I don't even know the name of. Every song here is good, though there are definitely standouts like \\"Black Cat\\" and \\"Brass Digger\\". The singer is decent, but he's not great - he verges on being unlikable but manages to keep it together. The lyrics are somewhat interesting, but not in a lot of the songs - you probably will just listen to the music and not what he's saying. The production is pretty good here, too - you can hear everything pretty clearly. If you like indie/pop rock or the band, then chances are that you'll this. Recommended!Highlights include:the entire album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, but it'll have to do.","review":"On the first listen, my anticipation for this album hardly seemed appropriate by the middle of the fourth track. By the end of the disc, nothing but disappointment. I have given it countless listens since then and I honestly only like three of the songs. On \\"Built On Squares\\", the Mints completely abandon the baroque-pop sound that worked so well on the near-perfect \\"Dream That Stuff Was Made Of\\". To me, this album sounds like a completely different band, going for a sound that has been done, done again and worn out by so many others (I know it's a stretch, but think Thrill Kill Kult's \\"Hit and Run Holiday\\"). I gave \\"Squares\\" two stars because the Mints at their not-so-best are still better than a lot of other bands' best."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the happy quirkster!","review":"i'm so happy i discovered the starlight mints. i bought their cd on a whim and it's been in my stereo ever since. from the shuffling swing-crunch beat of 'black cat'to the funkily weird 'irene' and the harmonica catchy-Brass Digger, it's got something for everyone. zillion eyes is a pretty song, too.only disappointments are 'san diego' & 'buena vista.' for some reason i can't get into them.i like how they incorporate strange melodies, lots of cellos, violins and weird keyboard effects as well as an odd blend of funk, pop, rock, electronica, swing and jazz music. it's odd but it works. i think i will now go and buy their other album as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor design...","review":"This water cooler has given us nothing but trouble and is very poorly crafted.

If you don't snap the levers back into place perfectly they drip (they also fill extremely cheap and flimsy). Twice I have come downstairs in the morning to have found the reservoir overfilled and our floor flooded, so I have to check it EVERY night to make sure that it is not dripping. Also, the spouts are positioned so close the the back that you can't use it to fill ice trays or sippy cups with a wide rim, the water just flows down the back.On top of everything, they sent us the wrong model, but we kept it only because it is SO expensive to return, and you have to eat that cost.

It folds into a size barely bigger than the Jornada itself, yet it features luxurious full size keys that will make any H/PC user green with envy. It includes a small passthrough port on the back to connect the Jornada's AC adaptor, as well. And since the compact flash slot isn't used or blocked by the keyboard, a modem can be used simultaneously for the ultimate portable internet experience. The only downfall of the keyboard is that it's difficult at best to use on an uneven surface, such as a lap. On a flat surface, it's as good as - if not better than - any laptop keyboard. In fact, I rarely carry my laptop with me now. And for those who are curious, yes the keyboard works very well in games that support low level key scan codes, including Doom, several NES emulators, and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A marvel","review":"I didn't expect to be impressed by this little gizmo but I was blown away when I took it out of the box. It's about the size of the Journada when folded and then unfolds to a very useable keyboard. The position of some of the keys - like the backspace key - need getting used to and one cannot use the control keys for the same sort of funtions as with a regular keyboard (as for bold and underlining) but it is fantastic when one has a great deal of data to type in and a laptop isn't available for typing and then synching. I sure as heck didn't really need one but, now that I have one, I use my pocket pc at work more since I can keep it set up to make notes to myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"This keyboard is perfect for the traveler.

Wrong! Instead you get an ageing, stiff woman who is obviously uncomfortable giving instruction and doing the exercises at the same time. In fact she doesn't. She narrates the lessons as she does them off pace of the narration. The exercises themselves are too simple to have any real effect on your physique or stamina. It would have have also helped if Ms. Rhoades would have told viewers the items needed BEFORE starting the exercises instead of during them. I had to pause the lesson and go look for pillows and belts during the routines. Overall, I am very disappointed in the false advertising and geriatric pace of these DVDs.

The title track starts things off at a high mark, and all stuff that follows fails to live up to it. \\"You Don't Mess Around With Jim\\" comes close; an interesting cover selection, very well-matched to Turner's voice.

I first heard \\"Long Black Train\\" a few days ago, when I saw the music video on television. The next day I bought the CD. And I was not disappointed. While many of the other songs don't sound as traditional as \\"Long Black Train\\", the sound does remind me of the better days of Joe Diffie, Dwight Yoakam, and Alan Jackson's first songs.

Covers of classic songs are rarely good, but Josh does a nice job with it even though his voice probably isn't right for it. I also like \\"What it Ain't\\" and \\"Good Woman Bad\\". A few of the slower songs can get a bit treacly, but their still good melodic songs. His deep, rich voice is what will get your attention first and the CD also contains good playing and song writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A VOICE!","review":"I do love the low, sultry twang of Josh Turner.

I have a feeling that this song will go down in history as an all time great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Newcomer CD!","review":"This CD is pure country with a lot of heart and a lot of fun! Josh's style is a lot like Randy Travis - with a heaping helping of Johnny Cash and a dash of George Strait and a hint of George Jones. Long Black Train, of course is the single that's out right now, but I'll bet these songs will also make it to radio as singles: What it Aint, Unburn All Our Bridges, You Don't Mess Around with Jim, and The Difference Between a Woman and a Man.

I actually prefer this living room over the newer Deluxe Living room that interacts w/ the house. That one has a big TV that you can change the picture on once or twice. I've decided that's not what I want my daughter pretending....that the family sits and watches TV.

They do it a lot and often. Then his wife finds out, and it ends in despair, with some very silly symbolism thrown in about sinking boats while on their boat. I can't say that I got much of anything out of this book, but as far as it went it wasn't too bad. What she is trying to do is portray her affair as a good rather than a dishonorable or bad thing. The execution of it is just mediocre.

The book breaks down each exercise routine into east to follow steps and gives plenty of great info about diet. I would also like to point out a rather suspicious review from Publishers Weekly. This review slams this book and I really don't know why. The complaint seems to be too much information for advanced runners. Well if you're an advanced runner any book for beginners to advanced will have info in it that's covering what you already know. I believe this is just another establishment crony looking to take a shot at a leader in the alternative medicine and holistic health field.

I was a little cheesed then, to discover that so many of the stories had appeared elsewhere. I wanted NEW stuff. Granted, the majority of the stories were new, but a significant amount were not. The Terazin stories, except one, all appeared in Stealing Magic, and I'd read Death Rites already as well (it was in Assassin Fantastic, and stars Vree and Bannon from the Quarters books). Okay, so I guess that's not that many to have been repeats, but I was really hoping for more Magdalene or Kelly Chase stories.Anyway, the stories which are new are well written and interesting (although the Count Dracula one was a bit ho-hum - Henry Fitzroy is a much more interesting main character).

In my opinion this video is for people who have no idea about makeup whatsoever, as it provides very limited and basic information on techniques and products.

The real surpise of the movie was past \\"Big Brother\\" winner Eddie McGee, who can actually act (!) and was hilariously funny as the slightly unusual sidekick. I love that the fact that he has only one leg was hardly mentioned because it just wasn't important to the role.

Although the re-make is nice, the original is better. I guess that's maybe why she almost pulled off winning San Remo back in the mid-90s with the song, competing with megastars like Andrea Bocelli and Giorgia. The other problem I have with it, although minor, is Gilberto Gil. I hope he was half-asleep while singing his duet with Laura. That would at least give him an excuse for that sorry performance!

I had so hoped to see examples of items worn or used by the Queen. Thank heavens I requested this from the library! Plus for being black and white, and lacking real items of the Queen, it's as heavy as a phone book!I will say though it does give many great examples of Renaissance costume, and it's most worth a peruse for history and costume enthusiasts, but my little Rennie heart wasn't fully satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"The recipient loved it","review":"I bought this as a gift for a friend who helped a great deal with my wedding, advising me of dress styles, hair styles, fashion from this era, dances, music, food, and everything in between, as well as arranging all the flowers for the wedding!

Mostly, it is a naive and self-indulgent autobiographical narration of the author's experiences with non-ordinary reality. As such it is a take it or leave it affair and, in the absence of practical information about chi practice, I am inclined to take the book as a yet another fairy tale. Danaos thus missed a chance to make his name as a Nei Kung teacher. Internal martial arts and energy work in general are amazing things and we need good books... however, this is not one for a serious practitioner. To people interested in learning more about Nei Kung I'd recommend any of the books written by Frantzis Kumar, a master with impeccable credentials and someone who does not play hide and seek with his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and rudimentary","review":"After spending so much effort in his first book, talking about how important it was for the world to know the Mo Pai tradition and that was why he was entrusted with it...this book yields none of it. Apparently its SO important to give to the world, but perhaps only at his school.This book's misleading title (yes, I read the review of WHY it was mis-named and NOT the author's fault...but this does not detract from the empty title) has nothing to do with Nei Gung. You get a couple of Chi Gung meditation forms in the back that ANY book has. The rest of the book is pure speculation that talks about how the Greeks and western world were aware of chi (there exists far more evidence than what Kosta came up with, if you do the right research...his stuff is tenuous at best).All in all, I'm disappointed at the time I spent WISHING for this book (eager to see a touch of what the Mo Pai tradition was), and the money I wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a dvd instead","review":"This book by no means measures up to its predecessor. It seems as if the author has nothing more to write about, but tried writing anyway. Don't get me wrong, I don't doubt John Chang or his abilities. However, this book doesn't seem to promote him or his traditions. Instead, it seems designed to promote the author and his new organization. As opposed to giving testament to skill as in the Magus of Java, the author only offers inferences to his ability. If this book is an attempt to promote himself, he should take a marketing class or two so that he can play, not only to his established audience, but also to those new to the martial traditions.He attempts to draw parallels between Greek/Roman mythology and Nei Gung. There might be points in common, but that's not why I bought the book. I bought it for more information on the Mo Pai tradition. Not secrets, just more information. The author failed to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"No secrets","review":"I have a lot to thank Kosta for. I was able to find his master after reading his first book.

Do some - 1) sitting meditation (preferably in the full lotus), 2) standing meditation (horse stance). Start at 10 minutes each and work up.Well, that's it!

More esoteric Taoism, some interesting, but impractical unusable concepts about Chi Energy. Danaos is now on the spot. Will we get the continuing saga of this mysterious but unavailable Qigong Master? Who could make a fast million bucks taking the Randi Challenge.

Let me tell to all the layman out there, chi kung does offer all psychic power just like nei kung.i think mr. danaos is being selfish not sharing the method practice or at least level 1 nei kung. instead he give mumble jumble excuse about how this nei kung teaching might be use for bad. ah funny, how come that is not the case in Chi kung then?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from a student of the author.","review":"2,400 years ago, the Chinese sage Mo Tzu taught that there were three kinds of spirits in the world - the spirits of heaven, the ghosts of men and the spirits of mountains and rivers. In this sequel to 'The Magus of Java', Kosta describes his encounter with the spirits of a mountain. The reader is also provided with a history of nei kung (inner power) practices that existed in various cultures around the world, as well as entertaining stories from the authors' teacher and other Mo-Pai students. This book is not an instruction manual on the levels of Mo-Pai training, as tradition does not permit this. However, the author has shown a set of safe meditational exercises that will benefit anyone wishing to start nei kung training."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Golden Smog","review":"WOW, too bad, I've liked all their other stuff.

That might explain why there is so little effort on this release. So why do it except to extract a little more money from their gullible audience?I love their music, but these guys have little regard for their fans.

Their antics brought smiles and belly splitting laughter to a more innocent age.Todays animated series are edgier, darker and in the case of American Dad, more politically astute. One has to have a basic foundation in politics, history and pop culture of the last 40 years to really appreciate the jokes. Yet it can still be humorous when viewed through the prism of todays red state blue state stereotypes.Stan, the ultimute Republican, has obiously drunk the conservative punchbowl dry. To counterbalance his larger than life persona, are characters Haley and Roger, his \\"hippie\\" daughter and effeminante alien who represent the ideals Stan hates.All in all \\"American Dad\\" is a smart, edgy comedy that makes Seth McFarlene one of today's reigning kings of animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, Yes....","review":"I watched this DVD while in bed.

This album just gets better with age.This is a great album. Not at any point in time have I been blown away by Machine Head, album wise. Even Burn My Eyes was a pretty good album at best. My main gripe with that album was its production and too many Biohazard-isms. It was their live shows that always did me in. Probably the most brutal show I have been to. Check them out live.As far as TTAOE. There are some absolute gems on this album. This is their best album. Good production, good riffage, and the best solos Machine Head has ever done. The standout tracks are Imperium, Elegy, Vim, Season Wither and All Falls Down. I feel privileged for once to be in America to be able to get an excellent extra track, such as Seasons Wither. Usually every other continent gets this benefit, but damn its good. There are some weakpoints, but nothing too big. Overall, it has DEFINITELY made me rethink Machine Head. BUY THIS ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"All the previous reviews have been dead on, this is probably the best Machine Head CD yet. Imperium starts off what becomes a full-on assualt on your ears. It's definitely worth it to buy the import, don't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"work of art","review":"Im 24 years old,so Burn my Eyes for me is their best album,maybe because it was kind of a influence to me...but TAOE its quite something,Machine Head at its best,long time after what is already proclamed one of the best albuns in the metal history.so get ready, because this one is going to make history too ,because its... todays Machine Head at their best! I saw them once,for about 6 months and they did a great show in Oporto (Portugal), the largest moshpit MH had the pleasure to have!(they wrote it on their page.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"They thought it was all over!","review":"Like Metallica, Machine Head's roots lie in fantastic, crushing Thrash Metal. Like Metallica, Machine Head decided to change the direction of their music, which turned out to be a disaster.However, unlike Metallica, Machine Head have fallen and risen again. Whereas Metallica's 2003 effort was a their worst yet, with awful sound quality and definite Nu-Metal leaning, Machine Head's latest is by far their joint best album, along with their debut Burn My Eyes.THey have returned to their original sound but with added clean vocals, and it's the return of Machine Head solos, chugging, heavy riffs and brilliant tempo changes mid song. Machine Head are once again my favourite band."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO. Not the old Machine Head. At all.","review":"With the exeption of a very few moments on this cd, there is absolutely no resemblence of any good Machine Head here. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because compared to The Burning Red and Supercharger, it is definately an improvement (Not sure if it was possible to get worse.)Rob Flynn again absolutely butchers any thoughts of decent vocals, and the lyrics are absolutely ridiculous. The bass work is good, but the drumming is again nothing new, and ultimately sub-par. It might have worked 5 years ago, but not now.Their old guitarist gone (*whew*), Phil Demmel steps up with a vengeance. The guitar work on the cd is good, and even though Rob has no business singing, him and Phil mesh very, very nicely with some well composed playing.Bottom line: Dont buy it if you think it's going to be like Burn My Eyes, or even The More Things Change. You'll be as upset as me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Comeback Album","review":"This is definitely the best MH album since Burn My Eyes. This is just as good, if not better. I hope anyone reading this got the chance to catch the States Turn Blue to Gray Tour with Devildriver (I didn't go because there wasn't a stop nearby, oh well). Every song on this album is perfect, I wouldn't change a thing. Some of the songs are driven by anger and agression, others by emotions beyond the usual metal scope. I never gave this album a listen after hearing The Burning Red, because I figured no one could come back from that. Machine Head has definitely proven me wrong.Devildriver's new album The Fury Of Our Maker's Hand hits stores June 28th, I already have all the songs, and believe me when I say this is going to be Album of the Year."},{"rating":"2","title":"This destroys!","review":"Machine Head have created a monster! I was so disgusted with \\"Supercharger\\" that I thought they could never recover. However, for many bands I believe this to be the age of re-emergence, and Machine Head have re-emerged in a big way.\\"Through the Ashes of Empires\\" is brilliant. It's heavy, overwhelmingly catchy, extremely aggressive, very well structured, and excellently titled.\\"Imperium\\" will hopefully remind people just how catchy Machine Head can be, and realise just how the band was at the front of the metal scene back in '94. \\"Elegy\\" is probably my favourite song on this album. It's deep, well vocalled approach is something new and refreshing.There isn't a bad song on here, and Phil Demmel is an excellent replacement because Luster was about the worst guitarist I've ever heard. \\"Descend the shades of night\\" leaves the album on an amazing high, or low, depending on your outlook.Machine Head returns, I'm very thankful. What a band."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don't like/love this album, you don't know true metal!!","review":"Machine Head is a true to the heart heavy metal band, no questions asked. This is definitely their best album they've made to date. I heard this not long after it came out. \\"Imperium\\" being the first song of theirs I ever heard, I heard it on the \\"Headbangers Ball\\" compilation to be completely honest lol. I have been a huge fan ever since. This albums defines who they are musically, even though I do love their direction in \\"Unto The Locust\\".

This is Machine Head's finest master piece to date. I've been an MH fan since Burn My Eyes, I've bought every album, seen MH live 14 times now. Why this album has been held up by Roadrunner USA is beyond me. Good job Roadrunner UK for picking this album up!Through The Ashes Of Empires is worth buying right now! Don't wait till it gets to the United States. Buy the import! Worth every penny! You will not be disappointed! Absolutely MH's best album to date.

This lens is really great for shooting 360s for virtual tours (take multiple photos and stitch together), but produces a lot of interesting shots on its own.

Great fights were rumored to be on the card before it was actually announced but those fights didn't materialize. As far as the fights go, the Soko fight vs Arona is good and the Thompson v Frye fight is entertaining but that's about it. If it was priced at $9.99, I would say buy it(if you are a Pride fanatic and collect them all)But, if you are an mma fan looking for a dvd of great fights, don't waste your money on this one.

I am a huge fan of Dave Matthews, and Jack Johnson's lyrics, and his sound in general, remind me of something that you would hear on a DMB album - that's a big reason why he's become my favorite new artist. He has a really mellow sound to his songs, and although his lyrics may seem kind of \\"out there\\" at first, once you really listen to what he's trying to say, you come to appreciate his music on a whole different level entirely. My favorite songs on this album would have to be Times Like These, The Horizon Has Been Defeated, Taylor, Gone, and Dreams be Dreams, among others.

I enjoyed the 1st two tracks and was looking forward to the rest, but then it just seemed to me that it all sounded VERY SIMILIAR.

This is a great CD for a sunny Sunday morning music or 3-hours long drive music. For those of you who have owned \\"Brushfire Fairytales\\", don't expect this CD would be the same in terms of in-depth music creativity, but Jack Johnson's unique style is still there.

Jack Johnson is predictable at best, downright boring at worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"The horizon has been defecated","review":"Jack Johnson music is custom designed for music fans uninterested in anything unusual, creative, agressive, or interesting. The Horizon Has Been Defeated reminds me of a Sublime song that Bradley got halfway through and said screw it and took a nap instead. The rest is all horribly similar, like everyone's sorta just mindlessly at a practice session in the recording studio. Jack Johnson lacks anything that makes me wanna be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well he is not Neil Young, let alone the second coming","review":"This guy is way overhyped, songwriting is whiny and lacks any facts or knowledge. Guitar playing is really childish skittishes that do not really portray any talent past knowing 3 chords. Tries to act like he is some voice that represents youth but fails miserably. I added this CD to my list of things I wipe with. If you really want to hear an acoustical session that proves this guy sux, there are some others out there. Marketing is the key in todays music world instead of talent and that is why this guy sells records. The lyrics suk, he is just crying and whining from visuals he gets from NPR or something, and that alone is enough to put someone to sleep. Boring, bad and will not be heard of in twenty years. I wish the next Hendrix or Neil Young would please stand up because the posers in here right now annoy me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly recommended by a robot","review":"This is my first hearing of Jack Johnson, whose album I finally bought after Amazon.com's fine recommendations robot kept telling me to go buy this or \\"Brushfire Fairytales\\".This album certainly sets a mellow groove. I plan to see if listening to this and Norah Jones back-to-back will cure my insomnia.The lyrics are excellent examples of what pass for thoughtful these days, particularly, I suspect, if accompanied by the lady Mary Jane, who brings out the cleverness in everyone, or something.I heartily recommend this disc to sophomores and juniors in small liberal arts colleges, people of like mind, and Barry Zito."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"how many times can a person's voice squeak on an album, play the same chord over and over, and well make a decent attempt of making music....this is one of the worst albums ive heard this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"On and on and on and on....","review":"Ideal for the days when you want to end it all.

His sophomore album does nothing less than sparkle, and keeps close to his roots following his debut, Brushfire Fairytales.\\"Rodeo Clowns\\" and the \\"Horizion Has Been Defeated\\" gives in to that playful side, but he generally keeps the mood relaxed. Although some songs are a bit serious (Traffic in the Sky) and some are downright depressing (Cocoon), he keeps the heavier subjects light with his mellow voice and soft guitar. But what I TRULY love about this album is that in almost every track you can kick back and feel an ocean breeze and a beach feel that only he creates."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent second album!","review":"I just got this album a few days ago and I've been listening to it over and over again. If you liked his first album, you are certainly will like his second one because he didn't change his style a bit...and that's what I think is very cool. Again, his mellow acoustic mixed in with a few more poppy songs (a.k.a Bubble Toes off of BF) keep the record going all the way for 16 tracks.My personal favorites on the album are \\"Horizons Have Been Defeated\\", with it's reggaeish feel, \\"Taylor\\" and \\"Wasting Time\\". This CD puts you in the summer mood to just go cruising around with the top down or kicking it at the beach in your flipflops. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Follow Up, even better!","review":"I listened to Jack's first CD continuously for the first 6 months I had it without even changing it. That is great! This CD is even better. With even more soul than the first, Johnson vocals and lyrics are excellent. The CD is great for everything, dinner, a date, driving to go surf, its all perfect. Every song portrays a different feeling. This CD is well rounded, yet each song flows into the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite cd in the world","review":"This cd is amazing! It is too awesome to put into words. It is not only relaxing a calm, but the lyrics are so ingenious and so meaningful, that I just can't get enough of it. You will want to listen to it over and over again! You absolutely need to buy this cd! You will not regret it. You can listen to is anytime: when you're sad, happy, moody, depressed, or even on a romantic date. Happy listening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's okay","review":"Lots of old reworked songs here. Standouts are Taylor, Gone, Tomorrow Morning, Holes to Heaven. There are a few songs I found difficult to listen to...I think he could of made a more cohesive album by removing 4 or 5 of the 16 tracks. He's still one very talented guy, but I'm not blown away by this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good/fresh as Brushfire","review":"I eagerly anticipated the second installment of J.Johnson, but was unfortunately let down. His fiorst album had a vibe and sound all it's own, although several of the songs were similar in style, they were different enough to make them unique and enjoyable. On and On does just that, goes on and on sounding the same almost all the way through, very redundant and almost too similar to Brushfire without the freshness. I wouldn't recommend it, but go ahead if you want to hear his new stuff"},{"rating":"2","title":"On and On","review":"Jack Johnson is the greatest lyricist of this generation. His music defines \\"feel good\\" music. You can't help but hum along. No matter what your mood or musical tastes, listening to On and On will make you feel better about your day. I bought this copy for a client and he can't thank me enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your are right it did go On And On","review":"How did this man sell a million records? Was there some kind of beach party where his albums went on sale and you got something free with it? Granted his voice is quite pleasent but the songs in general all sound as if they came off a copying machine. I have figured out the plan you sneaky Island Records. Johnson's two albums were orginally one but you cut them up into two so that he could have 20 minutes in the sun instead of his alloted 15. Note to Johnson: you have real talent mate, ditch the beach blanket bullocks and start putting out something you can be proud of."},{"rating":"2","title":"getting better...","review":"good tunes. better than the first. i think jack has found his sound. i can see the sunset in my head when i listen to this cd. for those that liked his first record, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Received","review":"I never received this item, I put the wrong address for delivery and the sender said they never got this back.

The darker stuff from the first album is mostly missing, and several new styles come out on this CD. Only complaint is that some of the songs are a bit short and cut off right when the song starts peaking -- \\"Symbol in My Driveway\\" especially, it should go on a couple more minutes. Those who've whined that Jack's first album sounds all the same may lodge the same complaint with On and On, but it's hard to complain about too much of a good thing. Can't wait to see Jack in concert since he's one of the few musicians who truly sound better in person than in studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summertime back porch beer-in-hand music","review":"On and On was made for lazy summer days by the pool or on a sun drenched deck with a pitcher of Bud Light. \\"Holes to Heaven\\" is the best song on this album - it's just so damn groovy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow Mood -","review":"This a great album. I thought Brushfire was good...it just gets better. You need to look beyond the catchy tunes. His political/enviromental views are right on. If you sing along with JJ sing it like you mean it.Jack Johnson for President.Now we just need a live album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" Infectiously happy mellow groove\\"","review":"I just heard of Jack Johnson this week when I received \\"On And On\\" as a gift.What a fantastic CD, from beginning to end.The CDreflects the amazing talent of Johnson as a singer, composer and guitarist. He can really write, sing and play. What I like most is the eclectic mix of pop, folk, jazzy fun groove that Johnson carves out with these slick, crafty little tunes. I use the word \\"little\\" only to imply they are too short. I wish each song was much longer. Nevertheless, the disc is so superb, I don't care. My favorite tracks are \\"Rodeo Clowns\\", Traffic In The Sky\\",\\"Mediocre Bad Guys\\", \\"The Horizon Has Been Defeated\\" and \\"Taylor\\". Johnson reminds me of Jon Mayer, Dave Matthews, Michael Franks and the overall product comes out in such a well done package. I can't wait to get his other discs. In the space of a few days, I just keep playing \\"ON AND ON\\". BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short tracks pack a smooth punch","review":"'On and On' took about a month of play to really grow on me. A tremendous fan of Jack's previous release, 'Brushfire Fairytales,' I was a little skeptical when I first listened to this album. Mostly, I thought that several of the songs could've been lengthened, even if it was just another verse and a chorus. But after playing it, the songs started to differentiate from one another and stand out. I no longer doubt this album because the CD just seems to build momentum as the songs progress. And the CD is rather enjoyable for Jack's social commentary. Ranging from our cultural materialism to air pollution, 'On and On' serves as both a lament an exhortation for personal responsibility (see 'Cookie Jar'). Overall, the album is a great disc to just slide in the player and let it go. I say go get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack's Best Work","review":"I own all of Jack Johnson's albums and I enjoy every one of them. His first album was very different than his others in that he wasn't expirienced compared to this next album, where I believe he really found what he enjoys playing and starts to get comfortable with it.This album is very relaxed, but with great melodies and calm, yet complex riffs. The style throughout the album remains the same, which is great to sit back and drift off after a long day. Pop this in your car on the way home and the stresses of work won't be present after just a few minutes.Definitely worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent album from JJ","review":"This album isn't the masterpiece that Jack's first was, but its still worth owning. His lyrics are smooth and his rhythm guitar is as good as ever. This one might even sound better on first listen, but Brushfire Fairytales is still my fav."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brushfire Fairytales part II!","review":"Jack Johnson does it again! On and On is just as good as Brushfire Fairytales. Although its more mellow, its still a solid album. Fans of Brushfire Fairytales will love On and On. It might sound kind of dull at first, but just give it a few listens and you'll be convinced that this is an awesome album. If you are new to Jack, get Brushfire Fairytales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the fine PRINT!","review":"This product is NOT a valid passport. You can imagine my disappointment when I arrived to the airport only be denied boarding. Next time I will be going to a real passport agency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad Simple Songs","review":"I am admittedly biased in writing reviews of Jonathan Richman recordings since he is my absolute favorite artist in the history of rock and roll. I love him even when he is obviously failing, however I don't beleive that he is doing that on this release.Of course I miss the childlike naivete and reckless abandon absurdity of some of Jonathan's early recordings but I do have to admit I think he is one of the few artists who has aged gracefully and managed to make quality records. (This is probably a result of his ability to be truthful and not phony. Can we say \\"Aerosmith\\" anybody?).This is kind of a relaxing, subtle record and yes it could of been better but it is undoubtedly one of Jonathan's prettier and by default more human of his releases.These really are simple, sad love songs for the timeless vaults.The instrumentals could have been more fleshed out but I really think the pop songs are just like Jonathan has always been, innocent and completly devoid of pretension."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so confused","review":"As a long time lover of modern man Jonathan Richman, I don't know what to think of this new album. I'm sure I like I'm So Confused better, but I'm not sure why. Has Jojo become too formulaic or is there something missing from his step on this one? Has he stopped dancing in lesbian bars or has he just lost the direction? For Jojo worshippers you will find enough to feed your jones, but for others future would be worshippers it is hard to say that this is the place to start. But if you just want a comfortable cd with some 50's sounding surf tunes then go ahead, become addicted to some fun with Jonathan."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine return to form from \\"I'm So Confused\\"","review":"Not sure what Diskojames up there was listening to, but \\"I'm So Confused\\" was a great album? Based on what?? It was a great song but a lousy album on the whole. Apart from \\"19 in Naples,\\" I can't even recall another song there without looking, whereas \\"Her Mystery...\\" has instantly recognizable, unmistakably Jojo-esque tunes like \\"Springtime in New York\\" and \\"Me and Her Got a Good Thing Goin' Baby.\\" The overall sound finds him somewhere between, say, the eponymous album or \\"I, Jonathan\\" and \\"Surrender to Jonathan\\" but without the \\"big band\\" sound there (which I liked anyway (think \\"The Little Sleeper Car\\")). My only beef with this album is that it follows the now-standard formula of a bunch of good new tunes, a cover from the \\"Jonathan Sings!\\"/\\"Rockin' & Romance\\" era and then some Spanish songs. It's a bit tiresome now, though this \\"Give Paris One More Chance\\" is a fun stomper."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Mystery Gone","review":"Now, please don't hate me, but it has to be said, this album is simply neither particularly good nor memorable.Sadly, at the age of 50, Jonathan has finally grown up, and in doing so, has lost his childlike, kidult appeal. Maturity has been creeping up on him since the mid-nineties, and has finally hit, much to the dismay of many.That being said, he does some great instrumentals and \\"Springtime in New York\\" is...decent. I like the spanish feel, and his god-awful accent on the last tracks, but it just seems like a rehash from earlier days.If you're a massive Jonathan fan like myself, you may as well buy it, but I would suggest if you're new to his work, go for some earlier stuff or a compilation (23 Great Recordings is good, as is Action Packed).The whole album really begs the question, what on earth has he been doing for the past three years? (Clearly not using his biggest asset, his heart)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is the Law And Order SVU you know, almost.In the first season, 1999-2000, of what some say is the most intense of the Law And Order franchise, the characters are just being established. Those include Benson, Stabler, and Cragen. This is also before Ice-T, and Mechelle Heard plays detective Jefferies, while Cassidy is played by Dean Winters, who is now doing car insurance adds.This is in general the same show, but the sets are lit more brightly, and there is more explanation of what is now subtext in the show. You also see the characters outside of work more, to give background.There is also not a lot of terrorism as subject matter here, as this SVU ran two seasons in pre-September 11th New York"},{"rating":"2","title":"SVU The First Year","review":"I had been wanting to get the first season of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit for quite awhile now. It was hard to try and get everything for a reasonable price since I had a budget but this purchase worked great! All of the discs were in great shape and worked. The box had little dents but that was nothing of concern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a pass","review":"I found the Benson and Stabler characters to be wooden caricatures.I also disliked the bouncing of lines between the the four detectives. To me, it sounded as though the script had been written by someone who was told that when all four appeared in a scene they should be given equal time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I agree with the earlier reviewer that the two main characters, Detectives Stabler & Benson, are difficult to like. Unlike the original Law & Order, this show is more contrived, slower moving, and terribly preachy. The two detectives are a little too \\"perfect\\" for my taste, and I find myself irritated when they tell absolutely everyone how to live, how to act at a crime scene, how to choose their friends, how to raise their children, etc...and that's just in the first four episodes!With all the quality shows on DVD such as Homicide: Life on the Street, CSI, NYPD Blue, and The Shield, I'm really sorry I wasted my time and money on this load of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!!!","review":"Okay, okay, im biased rating this five stars because I've been a loyal watcher of it for awhile now; but I think anybody can appreciate the high quality acting, and DVD extras that this treat comes with. You get all 22 episodes in an awesome case, complete with 2 extras that provides you Actor's Commentary and behind-the-scenes action. No one can dispute the electricity that Meloni and Hargitay have working together. At some times thrilling, other times wittythe stories always touch a chord with me.

I will view the entire DVD set regardless, but the poor picture most definitely detracts from the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show - poor DVD quality","review":"The show is great, but the dvd is vcd quality, and the commercials at the beginning are to long, and you are forced to watch them. I would not buy any of the other Law and Order dvds based on the quality of this dvd... USA could have done a better job. I'm very disappointed with what they did to such a great show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Law and Order-the Comedy Episodes","review":"SVU is a pretty sweet show. Why? Two words: comdeic genius. Sex crimes are funny. Dick Wolf knows this. And thus, SVU was born. It should have been called Law and Order: Pure Comedy Gold. If you like your humor black as night with some corniness sprinkled in, this show is probably for you. The first season rules because it plays up the comedy more than the later ones thus far, with both amusing plots and dialogue. What a great series. However, I cannot give the DVD five stars as it really skimps on the extras(You know, the ones that make a DVD really worth buying?). Then again, at less than fifty bucks for a season of an hourlong show, it's not too shabby. Seventeen and a half hours worth of entertainment is a decent value. So in conclusion, if you are one warped little monkey, this show is probably for you. Or if you think that because they're sex crimes they're \\"hard hitting and shocking\\"...whatever. Maybe I'm missing the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Law and Order Fans this one is for you.","review":"This was a Christmas gift and since I am a DIE HARD L & O fan I couldn't wait to get started on this.

I had to check to see if a final chapter had been left off my book. The plot was loose at best and nothing was fully developed. Her characters weren't believable and their reactions were unrealistic. I don't see any woman deciding that it was unfair to punish the woman that was marrying her own secretly wed husband by refusing to make her wedding dress for her. It just doesn't hold up.

An in depth history of all anime productions and their creators from the very beginning up through about Y2K.

Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anime no Subete","review":"If, like me, you are intrigued by an industry that can soar to the sublime heights of Miyazaki, and simultaneously plumb the abysmal depths of Violence Jack, the answers are all here, along with the most erudite and and entertaining criticism I have read since the demise of the great Pauline Kael. The authors include personal anecdotes about goings-on behind the scenes, and catalog many tales of heroism and incompetence on the part of anime companies. And when Clements and McCarthy are able to quote *producers* saying how bad they think their own shows are, I find it laughable that some critics deride the authors for suggesting that some anime might not be all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Encyclopedia? Yeah, right!","review":"This has to be one of the most frustrating books in the world. It's not an encyclopedia, it's a book of reviews! I suppose it's not a total waste of money, as long as you don't mind the way they give their opinions on almost every anime. The real problem for me is that they put down so many anime shows that a lot of anime fans [including me] enjoy. I have to wonder why the authors wrote a book on anime at all, since they seem to think that almost all are trash. I really wish they had kept their opinions to themselves and just given reliable information. Some people may enjoy this, but I definitely don't and I know a lot of other anime fans out there won't either. My advice to anyone who is thinking about buying this is that you should definitely look at it first to make sure that the reviews and spoilers don't bother you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Encylopedias are supposed to be impartial in their information. This book is just full of the author's oppinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great anime reference tool.","review":"A great job in information on anime shows, but it does give the author's opinions on the shows (like when a movie critic gives their opinion on a movie, they are not always to a person's liking). Which helps sometimes, but when you have already seen the show, it may conflict with your own thoughts. Also with it being from 2001, times have changed and some of the information is not up to date. It does help to know what happened to some of the shows you liked, but did not get finished. The small pictures included on some shows are also a nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shot in the dark","review":"This book was filled with misinformation, and elitist viewpoints.I picked it up at a friends house, and was curious to their information within. I knew nothing of the authors, and now wished I knew less. The authors seemed to hold anime to the same critical highpoints Hollywood movies are, and don't seem to understand that; one, this is a different culture, and two, a lot of these were made for enjoyment, rather than Oscar-winning aspirations. In addition, production dates and biographies of makers are horribly inacurate.This really isn't the kind of book to hand to anyone that hasn't watched anime before. It would steer them from some highly watchable series before they had all the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice information, deeply flawed descriptions","review":"When I heard that Helen McCarthy was working on an \`\`Anime Encyclopedia'' I was very excited. Her book on Hayao Miyazaki was excellent. When I finally got to see the finished product, I was very disappointed.I flipped through it looking at a few recent anime series (Crest of the Stars, Noir, NieA_7, even Serial Experiments Lain) with which I am familiar. Almost without exception, I found the descriptions to be appallingly inaccurate and mis-leading, such that I don't feel I could trust this book as much help in guiding a search for new series or new anime.That said, one very nice feature of this book is the inclusion of detailed staff information for series, which allows one to find other anime by the makers of series one likes. This feature alone makes this a useful book.My advice is: ignore the descriptions, and use the staff lists to explore the work of writers and directors that you like in greater depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome way to do bar Tiki Bar Drink Recipes","review":"I love this!

The California State University campus that I attend requires the rushees to sign a form stating that no hazing, drinking, or drugs will be involved with the recruitment process. I wasn't completely sure anyway, but they were right. At all of the houses we attended involved with the Panhellenic Council, (that forbids hazing, drinking, and drugs with recruitment), the other rushees and I were only greeted with smiles and friendly faces, waiting to be invited into the house of our choice. This is not saying that I do not believe hazing goes on anywhere, just that while looking into being a pledge, research what the process is all about, before you label sororities and fraternities as hazing, drinking, and drug parties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaded lenses","review":"If the challenge is to Greeks to read about the horrors of hazing, I think it should from a different source. I am quite tired of non-Greeks painting fraternities and sororities as these black-hearted, behind-closed-doors operations. National Fraternities (to my experience, since I am male) generally have anti-hazing speeches before pledging and have the pledges sign vows that they will report hazing. This text focuses on the ugliness and mistakes of a few and generalizes it to the whole population. I think that the hazing described here is from our parents' past and not what goes on now. I am sick of groups of men and women who rally behind a few Greek letters getting more criticism than any similar group (eg. athletics teams) who don't have such letters.

It removed the vinyl but it burned the gelcoat! It doesn't matter the speed, pressure or duration, the results were the same.

I was able to take off the pinstripe on my car and it looked great besides the front fender(it left some residue behind which was strange since it did not leave any residue on my doors or rear panel. I went back over the front residue and this time, it took my paint straight off down to the primer. I'm not sure why it burned through my paint this time but I will never use this on any car. I now have a patch of primer on my Lexus and have to figure out a way to remedy it (although it may never look as good as the original)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Product, Well Worth It","review":"Purchased a set of these for my new car to try to avoid all the scratches and dings from street parking.

Much better than any I've seen so far.They are rubbery, energy absorbent, and so far seem to be totally scratch-proof.

These were easy to install and and looked great initially. However, 3 months later one of the protector just came off and the other was loosely dangling. And this is with my car being parked in indoors in a garage and sparingly driven. I was quite disappointed as it was obvious that the 3M glue on the protector pad was of cheap and not durable quality. I contacted the customer service with the issue and was informed that the product might not have been installed properly and the 30-day return time limit has past. I wondered if I had not installed the product properly, how did it stay installed for 3-months! Anyway, I've decided not to order any other product from this company as they can't stand behind their product.

I purchased this book because I am familiar with the high quality of instructions Vogue provides. While browsing for knitting books on Amazon, this book kept popping up as relevant to my search so I ordered it. I have to say that I was very disappointed when I received it however, because of the horribly dated patterns. There are a couple of patterns that one might be able to make relevant and current with a wise choice of yarn and a couple of modifications, but for the most part you are going to look like you stepped off the set of Dallas if you wear anything made from a pattern out of this book.For simple and current sweaters (for future Amazonians, please note the date of this review so you know which \\"current\\" I am talking about) I like The Yarn Girls Guide to Simple Knits and Quick Knits, Cool Projects.

Last year I bought some cheap acrylic yarn that I liked. I didn't know what to knit. I got this book and I made one cardigan, very easy. It turned out fine. But I had to adapt to the instructions for the medium size. Then I tried with another cardigan. The sleeves were for a gorilla. Really, if I had follow the instructions it would've been a disaster. So, although I think the patterns are all easy, it may not so easy to adapt for yourself if you're a beginner. Something that I noticed is that in most of the pictures the girls, very slender, are using bigger sizes. Thus, you really don't know how the sweater is supposed to fit. In general all the patterns are for very loose items that may make you look heavier. There are two or three that are really unwearable. The is a huge tunic designed by Marc Jacobs that requires four pounds of yarn. The model has a face that is shouting \\"please take this stuff from me\\".

They will also know of the excellence of Gunther Wand's skills in conducting Bruckner's compositions. Added to this, on the evidence of this live recording of the Eighth in the Philharmonie, is the greatness of the playing of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. And another thing.... the sound as captured by the engineers is warm, clear and detailed; if you have a quality sound system you will be thrilled.Wand's pacing of this symphony is unerring. There is the required repose when called for, as well as energetic projection of the more dramatic sections. He brings off the famous adagio perfectly. This performance is superior to his DVD live concert reading with the NDR Symphony. It deserves to join Karajan/Berlin/DG as preferred version on CD. It's cheap too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters, dragged on a bit","review":"I loved these characters, however it was one of those books where it isn't until the very last pages (SPOILER ALERT) that they truly get together.

An engagement ensues, and the couple is inevitably drawn together through a series of mini-plots. What made this lackluster was, the execution....it just didn't flow. The pace of building suspense just wasn't there for me. There were too many implausible mini-plots. The book could have been edited to keep it simple and flowing between scenes and characters. Not a bad read for a rainy day. Pleasant, but not gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book","review":"fantastic! I read it in one night, I love the combined issues of sexually and the teenage struggle against conformity. The angst is layed on so thick you can almost taste it.

It also would make an excellent book for a decison makeing type class for those who are entering high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, good company.","review":"I had two of the externally braced version of these installed on my roof in the early '80s. The shiny bare aluminum weathered to a nice dull light gray over the years and they spun quietly through about 30 years of Gulf Coast storms and hurricanes until the bearings failed recently. I called Lomanco with the code numbers on them and they had replacements delivered to my door free of charge. I was slightly disappointed that the new ones are smaller than the old ones. They are about the same diameter, but noticeably shorter, so I think they will be slightly more restrictive to airflow.

It's introspective and dark, with a lot of characters who just seem lost and wandering through existence. It's a little bleak, but not overly depressing, there's some humor in the way the characters make mistakes, sometimes they just get embarrassed, run off, and the story ends. There are a handful of sad moments as well, so this isn't like some drama or comedy book, it's more like a capsule of life from the time in Japan, in ways that are universal to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps I didn't \\"get\\" it?","review":"The book had nice artwork, clean lines that were very good. Nicely detailed.The stories themselves I didn't find that great. One of them was a bit odd, kind of wondering what happened with the story... most really weren't worth much.

The people and situations seem entirely familiar in spite of the unfamiliar Tokyo surroundings and desperate, often obsessively fetishistic relationships. Tatsumi's art seems limited at first glance (many characters share the same \\"inexpressive\\" face), but he brings out an amazing array of emotions and keen observations. More than once I was reminded of Poe -- self-absorbed people caught in their own private hells. Not for the easily offended, but if you like David Lynch or Chuck Palahnuik, you'll feel uncomfortably at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"super smart and down to earth- all the nitty gritty that most people don't see or choose to ignore as part of their actual lives, all here in hnest simplistic poetic beauty. a timeless classic for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A darker grittier sadder view of modern Japan - the one without giant robots, sexy cyborgs, ninjas, or magical creatures","review":"This is a collection of manga stories by Yoshihiro Tatsumi. If you have only experience with Astroboy or the more recent Pokemon/Naruto/mecha manga this will be a surprise and perhaps not to your taste. There are no magical creatures, cyborg computer hackers, fantastic robots, ninjas or samurai. Tatsumi shows a realistic gritty dirty often sordid Japan. The people are often frustrated, disappointed and have lives lacking meaning and satisfaction. Taken together, they offer an interesting look into the oily, dirty underbelly of the normally glossy techno efficient face presented by postwar Japan. If you like more serious comics (Chris Ware, Harvey Pekar, Art Spegelman, etc.) you'll probably appreciate Tatsumi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a champ","review":"I can't express how happy i have been with the SoundOff mutes.

Why? I would prefer the camera men to stay on Keith during his solos, same goes for Woody. It is a shame that they never give us much of Charlie Watts, Keith Richards or Ron Wood for that matter. I know Jagger is the front man, but real Stone fans know that Keith and Charlie are just as important to this band's legacy!

Performing seldom-played classics such as Hand of Fate, No Expectations, and Dance (Pt. 1) is a bold and dramatic move by the band. However, there is one underlying flaw with this DVD package which has a significant impact on its potential to entertain. The audio production by Don Was renders the guitars to be almost inaudible at certain points. It's a downright shame that such a well conceived and well presented package has been so seriously marred by an inadequate audio mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"See For Yourself: The Greatest Rock n Roll Band in the World","review":"Most all the classic Stones songs are here, played at 3 different venues. Many of these songs never played live before. This is a real treat!!! The sound and picture quality are second to none. I put this in after watching other concert DVD's and notice a real difference, this blows them away. I absolutely have no clue as to what a previous reviewer is talking about when he downgrades the sound. He must be listening through his T.V., because I can here Keith and Ronnie's guitars very distinctly. It is amazing how their styles intertwine with one anothers, and you can hear it clear as a bell. The 5.1 surround truly makes it seem like you are actually in the audience when you watch these shows. You can't beat the price for all this music. It is a simply must have for all people who appreciate fine DVD concerts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technologically challenged.","review":"I received this as a gift and love the Stone's music having many of their albums as well as CD's. The video aspect is excellent on \\"FOUR FLICKS\\", but it sounds like someone set up a cheap hand-held recorder in the middle of the audience instead of the singers.

The setup takes a long long time ..... close to about 45 minutes and the payoff isn't really that good. I understand that this was a low budget movie but come on. Not one decent shot of the creature(s). Not even a photograph. It's just too vague. There were about 2 decent scares (what I call \\"Holy Shit\\" moments) in the movie but beyond that it wasn't creepy enough for this horror fan.My wife watched it with me and she scares easily, but she didn't flinch once during the whole movie (except for the aforementioned scares). There were points in the movie where you would literally hope that the director got a clue and injected something scary but he/she actually doesn't. A very play-it-safe non-scary found footage style movie.I thought it was a waste of money. NOT RECOMMENDED for horror fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"If I could have rated it no stars I would have.

The remainder of the film has them exploring, then searching for a missing friend, then running from the mystery creature,...once they realize there is a creature, which you of course never see clearly. What you do see looks like a tall lanky kid with a mask on, with sort of iluminated eyes. Its the Blair Witch meets C.H.U.D. meets how to make a horror flik for under $500.

What a delightful film. It is based on a true story, and is beautifully written. The husband & wife team of Michael & Janeen Damian, did a superb job of writing, producing and directing this magical film. The cast is excellent from darling young actress Kay Panabaker, to veteran TV actors Don Johnson, James Best, & Lori Loughlin. It is a very heartwarming story (I cried 3 times), but is also filled with beautiful cinematography. In my opinion this film should have had a nationwide theatre release. Don't miss adding this excellent family film to your library. It is for all ages from children to senior citizens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why five stars?","review":"I realize that most serious film buffs who watch this film will recoil from my five star rating, believing that five stars should be reserved for a small percent of outstanding, unique films--the classics. But this film, Moondance Alexander, is also outstanding in it's own way, as a family film aimed at families that include at least one member (probably a young girl) who loves horses. For that audience, this is a great movie. It is a real thrill when the lovely, but socially shunned young teenager, Moondance, encounters her equine friend \\"Checkers\\" for the first time. The horse is striking and unusual--a Pinto, (actually American Paint) who, like Moondance, is something special, but not always immediately appreciated. The mother-daughter relationship is touching and refreshing., and the movie miraculously succeeds in representing credible teenagers while earning a \\"G\\" rating. Note, that's \\"G\\" not \\"PG\\"! Big difference nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE","review":"I had actually watched this movie as a rental & liked it so much that I purchased it & sent it to my 2 granddaughters.

Though the bizarre fantasies were curtailed, Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon encountered challenging adventures such as \\"The Night of the Bubbling Death,\\" \\"The Night of the Jack O'Diamonds\\" and \\"The Night of the Falcon\\" (featuring Robert Duvall as a guest villain). Michael Dunn's return in \\"The Night Dr. Loveless Died\\" was a definite highlight and the last memorable Loveless episode. Season Three had its share of clunkers - \\"The Night of the Firebrand\\" and \\"The Night of the Arrow\\" come to mind - yet the unique chemistry between Robert Conrad and Ross Martin always made the series worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild, Wild West by Rosser","review":"This is a great product.

Robert Conrad is mesmerizing as Agent James West, while Ross Martin is magical and witty as Agent Artemus Gordon. What can I add to all the other 5-star reviews at this juncture? Only this: they are correct. Get this asap (and the other seasons, too). While all FOUR seasons are terrific in their own way, this may be perhaps the best of them all for consistency and entertainment value. Many of my favorite episodes come from this season.

Same exact problem with Eve and Charlotte; they don't play at all, although the supplemental disc for Eve does. Now, my dvd player is almost seven years old, but it plays everything, including new releases just fine. I'm at a loss.

Track 9 made me so happy that I ordered the album from Amazon within nanoseconds of being exposed to it.The one flaw, and it's a big one, is Track 10. Thirty-six minutes of repetative, monotonal noise. If it was five minutes of noise, or even six, that would have been acceptable. At thirty-six minutes, it seems almost arrogant. At least it'll be a great tune to put on if I need to clear out a room after a party. I still love the album, but I would have given it five of five if it weren't for the final assault on my ears.

Tripping Daisy had character and the polyphonic spree just make me thing of a cult complete with white robes and plastic smiles. They are getting alot of press in England, but remember the brits love sensationalism. That is not to say the group doesn't have talent, they just need to drop like fifteen members and write some good songs.

Here, almost all the instrumentation and music is played in unison with one dominant melodic tone controlling the orchestration.

Let's just say this music doesn't spree, it lilts.Actually, the band should call itself Homophonic Lilt.

The sound is uplifting and blissful. I definetly think they have huge potential, but they could have utilized their immense numbers better (how about some harmony?). Also, the songs all kind of sound the same after a while, but I will let it slide this time. This is most definetly a band to keep an eye on.As for track 10, well, I think you already know.BUT GOD DAMN IT THEY ARE GOOD. See them live as much as you can!!!

Hmmm. I guess a lot is lost in the translation. The music isn't bad so much as disappointing. With all the vocalists and instrumentalists you would have figured they would do more. The songs are OK but nothing is gained by the 20+ band member treatment. Try a little 4 part harmony. I'm not sure how this beats the Langley School Project.Apparently the live show is the real thing...but you don't need a to buy a cd for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for a friend who is suffering with nightmares and has been for quite some time.

He makes the reader aware of the philosophical strands which pervade the various doctrines related to God, and lends credit and criticism where they are needed. He suggests that the classical formulations of theology should be carefully examined and drained of some of the abstractions of philosophy, and that the aberrations of neo-orthodoxy be seen with the implications laid bare. Though Dr. Bloesch is not averse to the presence of reason and logic in the doing of theology, he emphasizes rightly that the God who occupies our thought must also transcend our comprehension. He opposes the reductionistic and rationalistic tendencies that are extant in modern theology. As a result of reading this book my understanding of theology proper has been calcified, and my awareness of differing views on the subject matter has been significantly increased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it so far...","review":"Have only read about half of this book as I write this review, but it has met my expectations so far!

This book has A LOT of nonsense in it. It takes ~3 hours to read a chapter (30 pages on average), and most of the knowledge gained is jibberish. Also, the assumptions (as with most Economics book) are a load of bull. Here's an example:Most economists assume more is better. Well, let's say I give Bob 1,000 apples. Economists would say he gets utility from everyone single one.In reality, Bob has to store the apples in his apartment, where they rot before he can eat them all.

Lau. Since Lau's translation was first published, a number of advances have been made in the field of Warring States Period scholarship which render a fair amount of the supporting material obsolete (see \\"The Original Analects\\" by Brooks and Brooks for the latest). As for the translation itself, it's rife with awkward and mystifying word choices -- for instance, in a passage in chapter 11 in which the disciple Zilu (Tzu-lu, in Wade-Giles romanization, which Lau uses) gets the better of Confucius in an argument, Waley translates the Master's retort, \\"It is remarks of that kind that make me hate glib people,\\" and the Brookses and Huang Chichung make similar choices; but Lau renders it, \\"It is for this reason that I dislike men who are plausible.\\" Similar mishandlings of connotation appear throughout the book. For an old-fashioned translation, Waley's is a hundred times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing read","review":"I found this to be a fascinating book because it presents a perspective on social morality and the obligations constructed around having a family and a duty to the society you live in. I'm not sure if the translation is as accurate as it could be and there were times where the subtlety of the subject matter escaped me, likely because I'm not from china nor do I really have an accurate understanding of the culture in Confucius's time, let alone present time. Still, I found this book fascinating because it presents a different perspective on social responsibility and morality toward the people we interact with.

No good action, forgettable characters and no sense of mystery or dread. The ONLY reason I am giving it 2/5 is that is stays true to the Alien lore and doesn't make up its own history like Dark Horse's Predator: Forever Midnight, which seems like Charles Dickens in comparison to this tripe.Do not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thank You","review":"MJ Friedman attempts to continue the ALIENS franchise where the last movie RESURRECTION left off. Well, maybe that wasn't such a good idea. The author tries to give more back story to the Space Jockey race from the original film ALIEN but really creates more questions than substance. I'm glad to see that this Vol. 1 was never expounded upon and feel this was because the writer fumbled the chance to garner interest in his weak plot frame. Not a fan of this one and it really isn't worth the time as it is merely a prolonged epilogue to ALIEN RESURRECTION."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Mushroomhead Yet!!!","review":"I can not stop listening to this cd!!

The first paragraph even claimed that Slipknot's Corey Taylor was promoting the band, after which I shook my head and turned the page.Last week I saw 'Sun Doesn't Rise' on television and couldn't believe it was this same crazy band I'd dismissed years earlier. After risking my hard earned cash on the 'XIII' album I have to say it's really refreshing to hear a metal album so surprisingly original and packed with so many great songs. I don't think I've skipped a track since.The advice I'd give to metal fans is that you should force yourself past the daft masks and gimmicky name, because Mushroomhead's 'XIII' is a great album full of songs with a depth and originality that you will definately not have expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought their first CD XX and i was BLOWN AWAY by the Metal soundsthat the band produced.

Some of their songs are not as hard as they are on XX but nevertheless XII is still a DAMN good CD with GREAT lyrics and gutiar and drums in the songs. I am also a HUGE Slipknot fan as well even though Mushroomhead has been around longer than Slipknot and Slipknot probably learned a few things from Mushroomhead I DON'T CARE!!!!!!!

Mushroomhead provides an amazing blend of sounds and vocal varieties.The album features many fast paced and brutal tracks that will tear you up. The slower songs on the cd dont break the groove of the album, Mushroomhead has a great way of presenting slower tracks in a loveable way.Many people have been turned away by the first cd, XX. Here is some information about that cd and why it has such a variety of production and musical styles. XX is actually not Mushroomhead's first cd. It is a compilation of songs from 4 other cds that were only available for sale at the concerts. In other words, Mushroomhead is not a new band, they are just newly popular.That being said it is true that many heavy bands get soft over time. Now that it is understood that Mushroomhead is not a new band we can all give a golf-clap for remaing heavy and hardcore all this time.OWN THIS!!

It seemed that there was a slight change between this and XX but I feel there new one is A LITTLE bit more mellow, a lot more piano type stuff.

This cd opened up the \\"doors of metal and good music\\" to me. These guys don't get the full credit they deserve for their music. If I asked someone if they knew who Shroom was, most likely they wouldn't know, but thats their loss. But if I asked someone who Slipknot was, more likely than not, they could identify them.

I have never heard a metal band that was so horrid in my life. All Mushroom Head does is whine through every song with some easy power chords to go along with it. These guys are nothing that you havent heard a million times before, and they are just plain bad. How anyone can like this is beyond me, even if you love Nu Metal, there are so many bands from that genere that blow these guys out of the water.

The two screws at the base hold the cord into place and are cheap - easy to wallow out as only the plastic hold them in place. I substituted two longer screws with nuts to hold in place.

The cord was long enough, and in perfect condition, so I purchased the Camco plug for a few dollars more than just a standard black plug because I thought the hand grip might be a good feature, which it definitely is. The plug was reasonably easy to install. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is that I thought the installation would have worked better with stranded wire if the manufacturer had included washers to go under the screw heads to cover the wire strands more completely and securely. Otherwise, the instructions were good, and I feel I've made a definite upgrade to my power cord instead of just a repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid construction at a great price.","review":"Camco just makes great stuff! This replacement arrived with easy instructions. Initially I was concerned with the strain relief until I installed it but I'm not worried anymore. The only shortcoming, and it's a small one, is that there's a slight gap between the strain relief and the cover. This gap is about 1/8\\" and I think it's possible for water to enter the wiring area in a heavy rainstorm. The solution is, once the cover and strain relief are fully screwed in, just inject some latex, or silicon should work too, into the gap until it's full. This seems to make it totally waterproof. The price sure beats buying an entire 50-amp power cord and the handle makes for an easier disconnect too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camco 55343 RV 30 Amp Male Replacement Receptacle","review":"After looking at the available 30 amp RV male and female plugs at Lowe's and Home Depot, these are undoubtedly the best you will find. For active use in an an RV where you are plugging in and out, the handle on these receptacles makes sure you don't place any strain on the cable itself. I recently replaced the male plug on my RV which had been showing signs of wear. The instructions that came with the receptacle included the lengths to cut and strip each wire --black, white, and green. Following these instructions made sure that only enough of each wire was stripped and was the proper length. Once the receptacle was re-assembled, it looked like I had purchased and custom plug for the RV. I'd recommend you have a wire stripper that can strip 10 gauge (30 amp) wire and a good size wire cutter to cut the 30 amp cable.

Criminal Intent is brilliantly crafted and acted. Goren is the most interesting character to come along in a long while, and Vincent D'Onofrio is hypnotic. Kathryn Urbe's Eames is a perfect foil. Criminal Intent is the best of the L&O stable. Don't miss this first season!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show on TV!!","review":"This was actually the second DVD I'd purchased of the same show, same year. That's because my son and daughter-in-law, also addicted to the program, had borrowed my copy and were reluctant to give it back. This 1st year DVD collection is especially fine because it features lots of extras --interviews with all the principal actors and the director and the writer. Trust me --you can't go wrong if you are a serious \\"Bobby and Alex\\" fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERE IS SEASON 2???","review":"This is the best show ever. Incredible actors, amazing writing, and top quality directing. This is the best of everything. The DVD set gives insight about the show, which helps the viewer understand the ideas behind the choices and the backstage of the show a bit better. I highly recommend Criminal Intent, both season 1 and 3. And I ask the obvious question, where is season 2, not to mention all other seasons so far???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good condition","review":"The item arrived as stated.

I am a jewelry designer and maker, and really needed a small, powerful, moveable full-spectum lamp to do my work, especially at night. This lamp met every requirement I had, and even has an adjustable gooseneck and a very long 4-light bulb that illuminates a larger work area than most desk lamps.The replacement bulb is expensive ($13-15), but is supposed to last several times longer and use less electricity than regular light bulbs, which hopefully will offset this higher up-front bulb cost.Thanks to this lamp, I am making jewelry without squinting and eye strain for the first time in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading advertisement","review":"This is not the product which was advertised. The lamp is a 13 watt PL bulb-which at best is equivalent to a 50 watt incandescent lamp. there is no instant start feature-the lamp has a built in starter which flickers and flashes for a few seconds. Any one who is looking for at least 100 Watt output should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sleek and Functional Unit","review":"This lamp is a nice decorative fluorescent unit, suitable for a student desk or other such purpose.

First we had the pre-Microsoft hype, then we had the Microsoft hype, then we had the hype from all the fanboys who loved this game.

Lets start with the story-line, I will give you one word bad. Graphics, are better for PC if your computer has a very expensive video & sound card. The only new thing added to the PC version is a flying vehicle. The Single-player has a few missions which are long and boring, and the ,Multi-player is ok, if ur computer has good upgrades.

Good music, even better weapons, and the vehicles are really cool. But, there was an issue with my video card, a 64MB ATI 9000. It said that the game was known to have serious issues with the drivers on the card, even though I have the most recent ones. It gave me the option to play in \\"safe\\" mode, so I did. However, this made the maps look really funny, as these blocks of red stripes kept appearing everywhere. I then tried normal mode, but my machine, a 1 Ghz AMD Athlon, just kept freezing up. Those of you with older video cards, beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF","review":"Jesus, thank you very much MS for ruining HALO. For those who don't know, Halo was originally a game being developed for PC until Microsoft needed a trophy game to launch it's XBox console. So instead of being original (God forbid) they do what they do best. They bought out a company developing a much anticipated game called HALO (the company's name was Bungie). Well, the fruits of their labor have finally paid off to the PC market close to 3 years LATER. The graphics are very tell-tale that it is a console port, the sound is like listening to an old walkman, even with high machine specs it runs slow and choppy. Thanks MS, you've done it again. I'm taking my copy back to GameStop."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is terrible","review":"This is the worste game performance I have ssen. It slows down so much you can't help but to just turn it off. Your money would be better off used to start a beach party bon fire. This coming from Microsoft go figure? I will never buy a Microsoft Title again. It Overwhelms your system so much, all the ram and graphics power you throw at it wont help. Please pass it up. Mine is going up for sale for what ever i can get for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer Clear","review":"To put it plain and simple, Halo is about the worse fps I've played. Normally I love first person shooters but this one didn't even deserve 10 minutes of play time. I started the single player mode and I ended with the single player mode about 30 minutes later. To start out with, the graphics really are lame. Even with all the settings maxed the graphics reminded me of the 1999 Deus Ex wich had bad graphics for it's time. Next, the AI (or lack there of) is really pitiful. It consisted of sometimes running away. That's about it. The person with the bigger and faster gun wins. That happens to always be you. The story leaves something to be desired also. I'm glad I didn't pay money for this pitiful excuse of a game. Get UT 2004 instead for online play and wait for HL 2 for single and multiplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"pah","review":"Alright, I understand companies need to make money, but they should not have put halo on PC. Should have stayed on xbox where it belongs. After two years of the game being out, any one who really wanted it would have bought an xbox and played it there. The graphics are not \\"souped up for pc\\". They are shakey and choppy because A) the game was ported, and sloppily. Plays infinetly smoother on xbox B) meant to be played with a controller, not a mouse, so it jerks all over the place if you move to quickly.HALO 2 will be on xbox first, and then the same thing will happen: they will put it on PC to earn some quick cash.

I run Doom 3 at pretty decent levels as well as Call of Duty and other fairly new games. So there just isn't any excuse for the ridiculously slow graphic performance I got.

If the last first person shooter you played is the original Doom, then Halo will seem like a big improvement. All I can say is save your money and download the Unreal Tournament 2003 demo instead. In my opinion, every aspect of UT2003 is better than Halo (graphics, excitement, sound etc.). In addition, I am running this game on a fairly maxed out system with an AMD 2500+ overclocked to 3200+ stats and a Radeon 9700 Pro graphics card and the game chugs when there is too much action on the screen. This should not be the case on a game that is pretty much 2 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on it.","review":"They have you on a go-cart track.

In contrast, Unreal Tournament 2004 with its flashy graphics and sound runs fine on my computer.The level design isn't great, but the enemy AI is worse.

The only reason i say the xbox version is good is because xbox graphics, games, and reputation is 100% absolute CRAP when compared with the gaming P.C., and the best game xbox has is the halo series. But for the P.C. gamer... its not that good. Its extremely linear, the weapons are pretty boring, and the graphics suck(when compared with todays P.C. games). The only reason I played this game is because its the only game on my shelf with a semi-solid plot.

I wondered why the price fell so quickly from 50.00 a year ago to 17.99. Now I see why. This game is garbage. It can't even run on highend computers and yet i can run half-Life 2 with the highest graphic details. I thought this game was suppose to be revolutionary? It reminds me of playing 1993's doom. The monsters are a joke. I agree that this game is linear and almost for little kids. PLus their little help tips is just as annoying as that cute lil microsoft paperclip in office. Why all the hype? Are people this gullable or is Microsoft hiring people to make this piece of garbage look good? I played this a few times and I gave online a chance and that was a joke too.

And even if I turn all of the bells & whistles on and set everything up to max and it become a 12 frames per hour slideshow, the graphics STILL don't even come close to the quality of the Xbox version.

I even lowered anisotropic filtering on my card settings, it made some difference.This game should NOT be more GPU and CPU intensive as a game like Morrowind. I'm sorry whatever argument you can come up with won't justify the terrible optimization that went along with this game.It's the new standard in videogame production these days. Concern yourself with graphics and the rest comes later. Let's gouge the people by making games super graphic intensive that they have to go out and buy $500(Can) or $200(US) worth of a videocard.This computer age is just barbaric, it's really good what we can do, but it's nothing more than strong-arm tactics.Xbox owners feel proud, your $500(Can), $200(US) system lets you play games that are optimized properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot Better than Halo 2.","review":"I think this game is cool because this game won over like 48 Game of the Year awards since 2001 when it was first launched on the X-Box and then Rereleased on the PC. The reason why I said this is alot better than Halo 2 because I think the first one is alot better because it's alot longer and Halo 2 is kind of short and a friend of mine said Halo 2 wasn't all that good and I think he's right because Halo: Combat Evolved is alot better than Halo 2 so if you guys are wanting to buy a Halo game buy the 1st one and plus they are making a Halo 3 for the X-Box 360 so it may take awhile but do not Buy Halo 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who inspired halo?","review":"So, you liked Halo.

It's not the top of the line but it is a P4 2.8Ghz, 1 gig of ram, and GeForce 5200, and with all current drivers. I spent several hours to get the game to run faster but nothing worked. If games like Call of Duty and Half-Life 2 run just fine on my PC, there is definitely a problem with the PC format of Halo.

If you have a desktop then its definitly worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a short undetailed review of Halo PC","review":"Halo is now one of those games that somebody 10 years from now will probably remeber. The pc version is no different,it has great gameplay and a smooth interface and frankly, when compared with many other good shooters such as the Call of Duty, halo does fine. BUT as people before me have mentioned the level design is probably the worst i have ever seen in a shooter. the multiplayer is being fixed by multiple patches so there is no problem with the multiplayer."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Halo, just Horns for the PC","review":"I just can't get excited about this game. Outdated, unintertesting and a lag in the mouse that I just couldn't seem to get rid of.

Skip this one, get something without the dated graphics and boring play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great graphics, boring though.","review":"This game is boring.I don't know what the big fuss about it is...the multiplayer is BORING...it's not even exciting.Graphics are amazing...boring, stupid plot though.Try Call of Duty for a good FPS this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun, not overrated","review":"Note: actual grade: 4.5 starsHalo is a lot of fun even if you don't have a top of the line computer. It runs just fine on my 2 gig Celeron with an ATI radeon 8500 64 MB graphics card. It doesn't run perfectly, and it only works on medium detail level, but it is still one of the best first person shooters on the PC. Multiplayer is exceptional, the weapons are exceptional, and the graphics, while not exceptional, are not outdated (not yet, anyway.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game but.....","review":"It is a great game, but it still could improve.The specs are wierd and my video card cant play Halo very well.For u people who have video problems i have an answer.Right mouse click the Halo icon and select properties, Where the target is press space and type useff.

My computer is not even one year old, and its graphics card is good. However, I can't enjoy the simple pleasures of seeing my gun flare when I shoot, because it makes the video jump and lag like crazy. Not only this but the graphics look like an N64 game. The multiplayer stinks because its full of morons and unoriginal gameplay which can be found in about a million other games... even free ones.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sluggish, Slow and un-responsive","review":"I have yet to return a single game, but this will be the one. Halo: Combat Evolved, has breathtaking visuals, a better-than-average storyline and great weapons. But the PC version is hampered by horridly sluggish game play. I have a 2.8 GHz Pentium 4 and a GeForce FX 5600 Ultra (128 MB), Serial ATA Hard Drive and 1 GB of DDR 400 system RAM. The game is still sluggish to the point of being unplayable if there are more than 6 characters on the screen.It's an exercise in frustration trying to aim with the effective frame rate of 8 frames/second or worse. This performance (or lack thereof) is simply unacceptable. If the game can run on a 733 MHz Xbox without dropping below 30 frames per second why can't it do the same on my PC?This game hasn't yet \\"evolved\\" for the PC, despite it's availability on store shelves"},{"rating":"1","title":"Halo is for XBox not PC","review":"If this had been the X-Box version, then this would be given 5 stars easily. Yet, the PC version has much to be desired. I find it hard to believe that Halo was originally a PC game that was rushed out for the X-Box by Microsoft. The contrast between the two games on the two systems is quite frankly scary.I own a top of the line system. AMD Athlon 2600, with a 128 MB video card and 512 MB RAM. And I had major problems running the game. On the first level, it lagged like molasses in January. I liked the multiplayer levels, yet I prefer not to pay to play games online, and system linking the computers is as much of a waste of time as the whole PC version itself.If you want to know what Halo is all about, please go get the X-Box version. It is much more enjoyable, and a lot less nerve racking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for your next LAN party","review":"If you are looking for a computer game that is at the bleeding-edge of video game software technology -- this is probably not the game for you.On the other hand, if you are looking for a fun multiplayer-centric game with tons of cool weapons and vehicles, but do not have a computer that requires customized super-cooling aparatus in order to prevent it from bursting into flames -- then give Halo: Combat Evolved a serious look.For a game with modest system-requirements, as it has, its graphics are quite nice and it is an absolute blast when played over a LAN in a multi-player situation. Unfortunately, the game is set up so that you will need a seperate copy for each PC in the network, but at $20 a pop, such is not likely to break the bank.The game offers a lot of multi-player configuration capabilities - although it will take some time to get adjusted to the menu system and how it all works."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"this is a great game but it gets old pretty fast.

The incident was turned into the famous novel, 'An American Tragedy\\" and later into a movie. This book is excellent because it gives all the details of Chester's life, his trial, and love letters written between him and his girlfriend whom he later murdered. For people reading the novel, which I am doing now, it is also helpful because there is a chart telling who each of the characters was actually based on in real life. This book is out of print nationwide, but you can still find it here in upstate New york in giftshops or bookstores. I got my copy at the Herkimer Jail where Gillette was kept in 1907.

The new unit seemed good until its hard drive crashed in February. I returned it to the retail store where I bought it. They shipped it around the country, finally returning it to me 2 months later, unfixed, saying \\"too costly to repair.\\" I was directed by Panasonic to a different shop and three whole months after it first broke, under warranty, my hard drive was replaced. Six months later, it has happened again. It seems to work until you start trying to edit commercials out of programs, preparing to copy onto a disc.

I bought the product March 13,2007 and Dvd drive failed this past February. The HDD and recording features worked great in the beginning. Once I learned the editing tools, I loved the copying features. A huge negative for me was the fact that the TV guide is incompatible with the Dish network and I could never get the Clock set. After buying the extended warranty in January and the product still under manufacturer's warranty, I sent the product in for repairs. After 2 months, they're still waiting on parts being shipped from Japan. This kind of service is pathetic.

This complicates setting up for recording TV shows. Spent hours (probably 6-8 hours) with Panasonic trying to resolve this problem. Disappointed since they advertise that it is compatible with Direct TV. Otherwise recorder works fine but failure to be able to use the TV Guide feature is a major disappointment.

I was playing with a few of the features and was happy with the ones that I got a chance to use, a little bit with the DVR feature recording shows to the HD using the TV Guide.The main reason I purchased the DMR-EH75VS was to transfer my large collection of home movies on VCR tapes to DVD. I was really happy with the ease of transferring them. Allot easer than using my PC. Anyway I got through 19 VCR tapes and then the DMR-EH75VS would not record anymore DVDs. It stop playing DVDs even commercially purchased DVD. The drive just makes noises and never recognizes the DVD. I'm in the process of returning the DMR-EH75VS and have not decided if I will get a replacement of the same type or decide on something else.

When it finally broke, I naturally went for another Igloo. What a mistake! All of the qualities that made my older Igloo cooler wonderful had turned into problems in this version: the lid could not be screwed on easily and never sealed properly so it leaked all the time; the spout let out a little trickle rather than a nice stream of liquid; the spout also fell out often, creating spills; the handle came off easily whenever the cooler was full . . . an incredibly frustrating and horrible cooler! Bring back the wonderful old model! Until then, I'm off to Coleman or Rubbermaid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this thing","review":"I had an old Coleman jug for about 15 years, but it finally started leaking and so I thought I would replace it. I bought this jug at Dick's sporting goods for about 9.00. What a complete waste. This one leaks more than the old coleman jug, when it tips over, which as you can imagine happens a pretty good bit with a portable jug. Also the handle is a complete piece of crap, and won't stay on. This is rather annoying when you have just filled the jug but haven't put the lid on yet. Who wants to mop a 1/2 gallon of water off the floor? I just found a Coleman jug at Sports Authority for 5.00 and it appears to be far more durable. Dont buy this product you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable","review":"This is the fourth one I have had, because there aren't any other brands available in this size where I live. They get progressively less durable. The handles fell off and wouldn't stay on, and the outside slipped off the insulation, and they started leaking. I put mine in the dishwasher and it warped, so now it leaks even worse. The spout kept coming off when I would flip it up, and it leaks around the spout. The lid is hard to close tight enough to not leak, and then it is really hard to get back off. The ice inside melts quickly, even if the drink started out cold. I would not recommend this jug to anyone! I'm ordering a different brand off the internet this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"After one week of use this water jug leaks everywhere.

I thought it must be a flaw and returned it for a new one. It did the same thing. Lots of leaks...I mean, one sip during a time-out and his shirt was very wet down the front. If it accidentally tipped over in my car, there was a huge wet spot. I am highly disappointed that something I purchased from Igloo reminds me of a cooler from the dollar store. Do not purchase this. Get a Coleman instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the bad reviews at your peril","review":"Big Lots sells this same cooler, and I bought it there since I didn't know what it'd look like exactly, and wanted to be sure it had the features I wanted. As others have mentioned, this thing leaks. More importantly it leaks at any angle other than vertical. There is no gasket in the cooler, so it's plastic on badly-formed plastic that you're relying on to create a water-tight seal. Additionally, this thing is actually pretty bad at doing it's job at cooling. Put two handfuls of ice in the cooler and they'll be melted in an hour - in the FRIDGE. Avoid this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't do without it","review":"We use this for our dogs - we are involved in performance sports (Rally, Obedience & Agility) as well as conformation.

The reviewers who used it for their dogs, which was my purpose in purchasing it, spoke very highly about it. The cooler I received was taller and narrower which would make my dog's ability to drink from it more difficult. Additionally, I was put off by the odor inside after the cap was screwed off. Wound up returning it. The shipping was more than the cost of the cooler, so I wound up paying approximately $18.00 for shipping (both ways) for a $10.00+/- cooler. Oh, well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bucket....for fishing!","review":"Very practical for me. This is the size you want if you're looking for a minnow bucket for ice fishing. Many people here in MI use these in the dead of winter for ice fishing because...1) They don't leak; you can attach them to a sleigh, snowmobile or four wheeler and go. 2) The water doesn't freeze up. The water stays a constant temperature 3) Holds about 3-4 dozen walleye minnows...although 2 dozen is common for me.I know this is out of the ordinary, but it's practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy from BIC","review":"This company has extremely poor customer service.

I buy an album for its musical virtues, which are lacking in \\"Simple Things\\". I would agree with the posters who have called the album bland, boring, dull, etc. Amy's vocal range is extremely limited and that translates into most songs sounding very similar.

There is something so pretentious and fabricated about Amy Grant's image these days. It is sad because she once shone so bright in Christian music, and it would be great if she would return to her roots. I think her star would begin to shine brighter if she did. Not one song on this album moved, inspired, or touched me. I wish at least one had!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Loyal Fan of Amy","review":"I was very disappointed with this cd, in fact, I probably won't listen to it again. The songs are hard to get used to.

I can't honestly think of a single track that I would recommend to a friend. Amy's singing seems to have gotten more and more lethargic; her voice sounds a lot lazier and muddier than it did 10 years ago. The way she slides between words instead of articulating them more clearly is becoming increasingly annoying. And, \\"Beautiful\\" -- the duet with twanger Vince Gill-- after hearing it, I had to go scratch my fingernails over the chalkboard a few times just to regain my sanity!! I had hoped that in 6 years that Grant would have been able to put together a more refreshing sound than she has. Amy, honey, it's time to put together a new production team and start over!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couple Good Songs-Otherwise Bland","review":"While this CD contains a couple of enjoyable songs, it seems as if Amy Grant has lost her magic.

Her \\"A Christmas Album\\" is still easily one of the best Christmas albums ever recorded. (right up there with Bing Crosby's \\"Merry Christmas\\"). Maybe it's just a stage, but it seems as if Amy lost her zeal and passion.While I wouldn't call this album horrible, I would call it forgetable and it lacks the passion and creativity of her earlier songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Amy for reminding us Of Jesus Love","review":"AMY GRANT GILL'S IST CD IN 6 YEARS, SIMPLE THINGS,MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD FOR HER TO DO, ESPECIALLY WHILE GOING THROUGH ALL THE PERSONAL TERMOIL, PAIN & SUFFERING NOT JUST ON HER, BUT ON HER WHOLE FAMILY.

Amy's new pop album \\"Simple Things\\" is written in that same vein - lots of guitar for a rock/pop sound. For me, however, the songs just aren't that good. I've now listened to it several times and it just doesn't do anything for me. One minor criticism is that it seems to be overproduced on a couple of songs - with special effects that you'd expect to hear on a Brittney album. I love Amy's voice and have liked her songwriting in the past, but found this cd to be a major dissapointment for me. I'll continue to listen and if I change my mind, I'll re-post and give it a higher rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much arrangement, too little Amy","review":"After growing up with \\"My Father's Eyes\\" and onto the rockier \\"Ungarded\\", \\"Behind the Eyes\\" was my latest encounter with an older Amy and an older Me.I was so impressed with her depth and obvious poetic talents, especially with songs about burned out small towns like \\"Nobody Home\\" and the heart rending \\"Like I Love You\\". \\"Take a little Time\\" has become my recent personal anthem. She seemed to really come through her trial and offer the gold straight from her heart.As I listen to this new CD, I cant hear Amy, not the Amy I have known. She may be under the glossy arrangements, but her unique, and compelling raspy alto voice is overwhelmed by the neat instrumental tracks. I hope she finds the confidence demonstrated in efforts past, to sing what is in the moment of her life. No apologies for the past, no justifications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland things","review":"While Amy Grant is not the best singer in the industry, her musicianship and lyrical ideas usually make up for that weakness. However, on this latest album, even those two advantages cannot make up for the fact that she sounds worse than ever. Maybe she needed to clear her throat before hitting the studio, or has been ill-advised that the \\"hoarse and husky\\" sound is the latest vocal trend. Listening to earlier albums like \\"Straight Ahead\\" indicate that she really could sing at one time, but this newest release pales in comparison to the vibrancy of earlier recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable pop","review":"Amy Grant as a gospel singer was inspiring. The way that she crafted words and sets them to the most amazing music has made me a fan for well over 15 years.I missed the \\"old\\" Amy - as the previous reviewer wrote - What happened to 1974? With Simple Things, we get pure fluff. There are some efforts to be deep and meaningful - but they just lack sincerity. Maybe I am way too cynical.As a Christian in the public eye, she has certain responsibilities. Her liner notes in the CD speaks volume about the way that her music is used to justify and condone her actions.I cannot listen to her old CDs especially her previously penned love songs - knowing that they were written for Gary Chapman pledging everlasting love. This is indeed really sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much easy listening....","review":"Whatever happened to the Amy Grant who gave us Angels, El Shaddai and Thy Word? I thought that she had come back when I heard the songs on her Legacy album. The songs on this album are for the most part trite in comparison to the inspirational music that I'd come to love from her. There are many, many artists who are capable of nothing more than songs with no real meaning (I do own my share of easy listening), but Amy is capable of so much more as we know. Please come back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Essential Amy","review":"If anyone wanted to build an \\"essential Amy\\" collection, I would recommend only 3 albums: Age to Age, Lead Me On, and Heart in Motion. For the most part, her other albums, including this one, are just filler. She is becoming monotonous, with marginal creativity; all her songs are beginning to sound alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Amy Grant !!","review":"Everyone in the Nashville area loves Amy, she is a wonderful person. But, I really dislike this CD. Several reviewers have said that many of the songs sound alike, and I agree. The biggest problem I have with ST though, is Amy's voice. Don't know if she got some bad vocal coaching, or if its just a part of getting older, but I want to hear *Amy* singing, NOT Marlene Dietrich !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and Overproduced","review":"For those of you giving this a positive review, could you actually HEAR her voice? Because I could barely discern her vocals from the overproduction running rampant on this album. I was very very disappointed, and could only find one song (Eye to Eye) that was remotely listenable (thus 2 stars, instead of 1). Her album before this one, Behind the Eyes, was phenomenal...and having heard that type of brilliance, I was unprepared for the letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"music fan in Nashville","review":"This is in response to the idiot from Odessa who judged this CD on what they \\"percieve\\" to be the truth about something that they know NOTHING ABOUT. I was a bartender at the Wildhorse and cannot tell you the number of times I saw Amy's former husband in there hitting on women while still being very much married to her and way prior to the whole Vince/Amy \\"thing.\\" Grow up and stop judging other people. If you don't like the CD then say why, don't say it's due to her personal life choices.

Fantastic, great... we can find our Amy. It's an extraordinary album. Thank you for this pure Amy's album. \\"Looking for you\\" and \\" Innocence lost\\" are my favorite songs. Since \\"lead me on\\" album is my favorite album. Perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comparing Velveeta pasta and cheese mixes","review":"There are two Velveeta pasta and cheese dinners. This one, and Kraft Velveeta Original Shells & Cheese, 12 oz. They both use packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder.But sadly, this one's not that good. It's salty, and the tiny bits of broccoli are few and far between. And with all the sodium (1230 mg per serving compared to 940 mg for the regular Shells and Cheese), it's a long way from healthy.Shells and Cheese is better. It's pure, creamy comfort food that goes down smooth and leaves no aftertaste. The pasta's ridged-shell shape makes every bite taste good, as dribbles of cheese seep into each piece and stick to its sides. It's much better than the broccoli version... and way more yummy (if more expensive) than the regularKraft Macaroni & Cheese Supermac & Cheese Pasta and Sauce, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broccoli, really?","review":"Tastes good because, well, it's Velveeta.

The miter angle adjustments on the DeWalt were by far the easiest to adjust. I took a look at the new Porter Cable saw last week, and I still prefer the DeWalt. It is well designed, well built, and we haven't had any problems with it. There are good reasons you see this saw more than any other at construction sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I bought this saw at a the local Home Depot and haad no problems with it so far. I'm just a kid and i've already installed trim in my parent's basement after a flood and it looked perfect. The standard blade, 60 teeth, i've counted all of them, that comes on it is enough for trim work but the more teeth, the better. This saw gets plenty of use, and it still cuts a perfect 90 degree angle since I got it out of the box. I recommomend this to any one looking to buy a compound, not that small nor light, miter saw. I would have bought the sliding, but unfortunately, that is way too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware--Dewalt will not honor rebate","review":"This saw sounded pretty good, especially with a couple extra blades as a rebate. I sent in all the info to DeWalt and got a nice letter back that they ran out of blades (!?) and offering me a baseball cap and cooler instead. I couldn't believe it. Just say no to bait and switch--buy another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased!!","review":"I purchased this saw, along with some other Dewalt tools, for my husband and he was very pleased! Thanks to Dewalt and Amazon for quality and dependability!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent saw","review":"I have used one of these saws every day for the past two years at work. It is truly an excellent saw. Plenty of power and a gem to run. Tonight I was shopping for one for myself, but I could not find any information on what blade came with it. I will purchase one when I find out what all comes with it. Again it is a great saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid tool","review":"Two few things attracted me to this saw in the store right off. One, the finely machined base is very slick and makes changing angles a breeze and a joy. Nothing binds and all the controls are easy to reach and manipulate. Even the control to lay the saw over into a compound cut is easy to get to and easy to use. And two, the horiztonal D-handle was more comfortable and more sensible than the vertical handle on my old 10\\" Delta mitre saw. And there is a handle on top to carry the thing.I finally bought one here and got it home. I like the fit and finish, but the 90 and 45 degree settings were off. And the motor whines a little more than I would like, but otherwise I'm happy with it. Seems to be a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good saw, forget the blade though","review":"Just got my DW705S and I am overall very pleased. Solid fence, powerful motor, accurate cuts. But the blade is a freebie. Probably runout is .125 \\". Oh well, I guess you get what you pay for. Secomd Dewalt tool and I like their workmanship. Later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and well built","review":"I've had my Dewalt DW705 miter saw for about 2 years now and am still very pleased with it. The miter adjustment is smooth and extremely accurate (adjustable down to 1/4 of a degree right and left!) While the saw is very well built, the one item I have not been pleased with is the dust collection system. The tiny exit port does not pick up as much dust and debris as some other saws do. I have mine connected to a commercial style dust collection system which helps, but it still kicks out quite a bit of debris around the blade. Everything else about the saw says quality and durability. It spools up very fast (which makes it kick a little if you are trying to start the blade just above the cut) and the blade brake stops the big 12\\" blade within a turn or two. I would not hesitate to recommend this saw to either the hobbyist or the professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"If you are a framing carpenter this saw is fine. If you are a woodworker /finish carpenter this saw is junk. It can not produce a 45 degree miter since the table is not flat. The fence was bowed and I got a new one and that one was bowed. Its impossible to get the blade perpendicular to the table since it is not flat. I've checked other saws and they all have the same problem. My brother has this saw and we both hate it due to its lack of fine accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, and durable","review":"Bought one of these about 5 years ago, before I started doing this for a full-time living...still a workhorse for rough and finish construction. With a sharp blade it will make the fine edge cuts for trim or furniture. Mine travels in a trailer and is only moderately portable. If you don't need the capacity of this unit, but like the features, Black and Decker -Dewalt's parent company- makes a virtually identical 8\\" unit I am about to buy for small work. Consider the sliding version of this saw if you need extra capacity without moving to a radial arm saw!Miter cuts tend to wander, as with most saws, but a good stiff blade and the material clamp eliminate most of this.An outstanding saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chop box!","review":"I purchased this saw a few years ago, for a LOT more money (it's come down in price everywhere I see it). It's a wonderful saw; rugged, accurate, and the horizontal handle is easier to use than the pistol handles on other models. My use has mostly been for relatively rough cutting; decks, railings, etc... but I've also done some fine trim work with it. The miter seems to be very accurate and I have no complaints. Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One more point: Redesign?","review":"Also, note that DeWalt changed the design of this saw a few years ago. Some of the older reviews on this site obviously pertain to the older 13-amp model 705. The current model is a 15-amp saw. I have no experience with the previous design of the 13-amp saw, which may or may not have the same front-end-of-table-lifting-up issue that the current model has.I did not mention it in my main review, but this saw does not have a 1\\" diameter arbor shaft: DeWalt gives you a washer to use with all your 12\\" blades that have 1\\" diameter arbors (all of them?).Note also that Amazon's \\"Editorial Reviews\\" product description inaccurately states that the saw is a 13 amp model, which was the previous generation of DeWalt's 12\\" miter saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed design","review":"I concur with the reviewer that labeled this saw \\"junk\\". After mapping out the room for crown, I proceeded to make my cuts. then came installation. I've hung miles of this stuff, how could I be off so much? Oh well, just go and recut. What is this? When I tighten the table knob the front end rises? My ego felt sooo much better. I've checked many since, I even showed it to a product rep. on a brand new out of the box. She was dismayed and swore to tell the people up the line. Right. But what the hey, it's your money buy one, heck get a couple for the wife and kids. It gets worse the more you use it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw locking table","review":"This saw has been rated pretty well. Although myself as well as a couple of other people here seem to have noticed the same problem.When you lock the table anywhere, the table flexes up in the front. It just pushes right up. All of the Dewalts do and non of the competitors do. The knob applies pressure directly to one point and bows both pieces of the aluminum up and down. The wider the molding the more tapered the cut. So regardless of how excact your marks are the cuts will be off.I got the Porter Cable 12\\" laser. Dead on accurate, no flimsy table."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOME EDITED EPISODES = NO SALE !

Although this show went way down hill in the later years, at this time is was still fairly entertaining even if not nearly as good as the first two seasons. There are a few bright spots in this season, but the series was never the same after they went to a live audience and \\"The Fonz\\" became the focus of the show.

The episodes are as good as I remmember them even though music has obviously been changed, you get a lot of the same version of \\"Wake up little Susie\\" with some characters even dancing to what seems an altogether different song, anyway, no good complaining about something I had learned beforehand, what did bother me was the ultra-cheesy presentation which very much differs from the first season and earlier Paramount releases. I can't imagine how much money they can possibly be saving to feel like it's worth doing it.At any rate, season 3 of Happy Days is my favorite and even though I'm happy with my purchase the lack of a quality presentation will make it my first and only one of this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK YOU FOR THE MUSIC","review":"The Editing of some Scenes is sad, BUT I really love to see...or better: to hear...that the Music is there.

Angry parents, rebellious teens, stupid mainstream music industry people. Gary Busey is wonderful and fully deserved the Oscar nomination.That said, 90% of the movie is HOGWASH! About the only thing they got right was that there was a Buddy Holly who had a band called the Crickets from Lubbock Texas. The WORST is the \\"dark meat\\" comment to peg Jerry Allison as a racist. And the fact that Gary Busey got much of his information from Jerry makes the scene in the movie that much more shameful.

But no one watching this movie should kid themselves for a minute that they are learning ANYTHING about the real Buddy Holly. The apologists in the other reviews here should take the time to read one of several books about the man.

The package arrived within three days of ordering, and the coffee was sealed in a standard vacuum-sealed bag. I opened the bag and noticed that the coffee smelled stale. Normally fresh-roasted coffee has a certain \\"life\\" to the scent, but these beans smelled as if they had been on a shelf for a while. I brewed the coffee and the flavor was similarly uninspiring. The coffee was mellow, as expected, but the flavor was flat. I have had high quality Kona in the past, and this sample is clearly inferior to my previous experience.This is the first time I have troubled to review a product sold by Amazon. I have no previous experience with this coffee roaster, and since others found their coffee to be to their liking, it is possible that something went wrong with this particular batch. I am pleased to report that Amazon has refunded me for this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"14oz is not the same as 16 ! !","review":"I bought a 16 oz. bag in November, and now the description says 14 oz, yet the item number is the same (!).

They have reduced the weight of the bags from 16 to 14 ounces without adjusting the price accordingly. The worst thing is that the dark roast is a lot lighter now. The dark roast beans are much lighter so it takes more of them to make pound as the moisture content is much lower therefore I feel it would it to be more profitable to roast the as little as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kona coffee","review":"This coffee is wonderful!

Sometimes it works perfectly and properly presents the appropriate voltage, other times it just starts counting up or down, still other times it does nothing.Testing the household outlets was the last straw. Voltage fluctuated slightly, but some sockets, that are known to be good, showed no voltage at all, even after many attempts. That's inexcusable. When a meter is off checking AA batteries, it's not a big deal. A person could get killed if the meter doesn't function properly when testing 110VAC power wires and outlets.

For instance, her \\"Annette's Oatmeal Waffles\\" recipe has about 200mg of sodium per waffle. Too high for heart patients or those with hypertension. There are occassional assists concerning where to find certain foods and condiments, but that's as far as it goes.

The dialogue cannot be described and as others have mentioned the changes in the horses are well worth the rental fee. Watching a horse with 2 white rear stockings take off and land with just one front white stocking is amusing to say the least. One horse enters with a star, develops a blaze and then leaves with nothing. It's fabulous! I wish MST3000 would run this despite the lack of aliens. Poor Mickey Rooney - what was he thinking?

The title character is played by several horses that don't even look alike (it's especially fun to watch his tail change length from scene to scene). I also enjoyed the show ring scenes where the ring announcer gives a running commentary on the rider's performance and life history. The setting is someplace like Iowa or Nebraska and the lead actress has a french accent. I must have missed the part where this was explained, but it certainly adds something to the overall hokiness of the film. Poor Mickey Rooney.

Perhaps it's karma for taking something that isn't hers, because shortly after finding the critter Stephanie is diagnosed with a degenerative eye disease and has her pride and joy stolen from her by Barney's creditors.

This album is imminently listenable--musically varied, subtle, yet accessible. Anderson's music away from Jethro Tull has increasingly become more delicate, yet never trite. His flute playing has never been better. Anderson's vocal timbre is somewhat different than the '70s and '80s (for those of you who haven't heard the modern Ian Anderson), but it is no less interesting and idiosyncratic. This album ROCKS (even when it doesn't rock). Buy it. You'll like it....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bargains galore! New and improved!

Like Minstrel in the Gallery was (Baker St Muse especially).The song \\"Lost In Crowds\\" is amazing, gets 5 stars, and perhaps sounds more \\"Tull\\" than anything since Broadsword. Everything else is good too.I have the feeling this review will be like preaching to the choir - who's going to look into this album without a mind to buying it? but if you're one of those people, I recommend this album.oh yeah - forgot to mention all the wacky time signatures, hidden very well in most of the songs. i know this appeals to a lot of tull fans :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Follow-Up","review":"After only a few listenings to Ian Anderon's \\"Rupi's Dance\\", it can easily be said that this is an excellent album and follow up to \\"The Secret Language of Birds\\".Anderson covers a wide range of topics from coffee corner society to working with orchestras, the anonymity of crowds, holiday photo snaps, to the death of one's favorite pet.Of particular interest to me is Anderson's vocal performance, which by contrast to \\"Secret Language of Birds\\" and \\"Roots to Branches\\" is much stronger and more self assured. The album overall had an uplifting mood and feel.I would be surprised if \\"Rupi's Dance\\" didn't impress existing fans and attract newer fans too. If the added track (\\"Brithday Card at Christmas\\") from the forthcoming Tull album is any indication, it looks as if we're in for another equally excellent treat!Funny Old things...record reviews..."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece","review":"a gorgeous masterpiece of sound and songwriting that more than justifies its wait.

No, not what you're thinking. I knew he'd ruin her music. And I was right. Picture perfect was a big disappointment for me. You could hear his influence all over the place. If I wanted to listen to simon, I'd buy one of his records. Maybe I'm the only one but the rough sound of her early work and the lyrics were exactly what I liked about her. Ten years later and it's even worse. I don't hear any of the influences of her earlier work. Her trademark singing is gone. Who ever said she can't sing is dead wrong. She has a great voice. It's just not used at all on volcano. I liked the passion of her early work. Now I seem to hear exactly what you'd expect. A middle aged woman, married to someone who too heavily influenced her, singing about stuff I couldn't care less about and doing it without much passion.Oh well. Thanks Paul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great Great!!","review":"I am amazed that anyone would say she can't song...she is the best singer and I love this album!

I can't stop listening to it, its been almost 3 days. Like all of Edie's albums, there is a little of something for everyone. I would say her song formats are formulaic with a sampling of different styles, but unlike other bands for whom that would be a criticism, Edie's music doesn't sound like she's trying too hard. Her albums are seamless, having both continuity and variety; this is the most polished yet. Few instrumental musicians could cross stylistic boundaries with the conviction Edie does. Edie is unusually talented at creating moods and the arrangements are perfect; not too dense or too long + dynamic pacing throughout. Beautiful soundscapes, excellent recording quality and tasteful musicianship on all featured instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"I had no idea Edie had slipped Volcano out until I saw Stranger Things on Amazon being advertised. The last thing I heard from her was the live EP Montauk Sessions that was available on the band website. So I found 2 gems at once and am overjoyed! The Montauk session songs are even scattered about the 2 latest albums in studio form. I have to say that I like the live version of Spanish Style Guitar much better than the studio recording. I can really appreciate Edie Brickell alone and with the New Bohemians. I find her solo stuff perfect for mellow, feel-good/feel-sad times and the band stuff perfect for bringing out a more firey Edie. She is full of passion in both settings and her voice is superb. I hope they continue to produce fantastic work together and alone!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best for 2003.","review":"What a refreshing surprise!

I found that it played well over the FM frequency, the earphones made the music seem like it was a live performance, ease of use was great with the synchronizing software and their customer service was beyond excellent, they were superb -- in their human relation skills, but I'm not sure about their technical skills. I'm giving it two stars because it seemed like the Neuros team really wanted to help me but the end result was that I was able to use it for only a few weeks of the five months I've owned it. I had to send it back to Neuros twice and it wasn't repaired either time. I am, just today, sending it back to them with instructions that they are to send me a completely different device or don't send me anything at all.

With prizes to aim for, I am never short of a little motivation in my quest to get fit.My wife even got one as part of a monthly prize - now we compete with each other to see who does the most steps.

This simple product clips on to your belt or pants. It weighs about an ounce. You do not even know it is there. It measures your calories, steps, miles, speed, heart rate (With optional heart strap) and distance. You then at any time take the sportbrain and put it into the base station and it automatically loads the fitness data into a database. You can then graphically access this data through the web. You can see how your stats compare agienst other users in your age group. You can all sorts of charts on the fly. One of the best features of the site is that they offer contests where you win prizes for attaining certain goals.

We remarked how lovely it looked, with modern, clean lines, but that it was also practical and easy to hold in the hand, unlike some restaurant silverware. We were so impressed we noted the hallmarking and bought our own set - and have since added serving pieces and more table settings as well.

After searching and searching, I really loved the simplistic design of these. I washed them right out of the packaging and then noticed and (still do, whether hand washing or in the dish washer, these random brown spots show up). I've read this happens to stainless. So I guess I'll have to use STPP or (Sodium TriPolyPhosphate) to add to my detergent or buy something that does not contain this? Or wash them off after eating acidic things with them? I dunno, it's a shame because I didn't really think these were that \\"cheap\\". But I do love the design!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed - instant water spots and color isn't what I expected.","review":"I received the silverware set and, although I sort of like the shape, they are not what I expected. The very first time I washed them (hand washed right out of the box) and placed them upright in a drying rack they dried with a significant number of water spots. Maybe it's something I'm doing wrong washing them, but my older set doesn't dry with spots and I didn't do anything different. I even washed several of my old set in the same load and they're not spotted.Also, compared with other silverware sets on Amazon, this set is pictured as a darker color, but it's not. It has a mirror finish as described but in a standard silverware color, which is fine if that's what you want, but I was looking for something subtly different.Seriously not impressed with this set so far, not sure if I'll keep them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cutlery","review":"Lovely simple design.

Blanchard here goes deeper than just leading -- he speaks of being a leader and growing other leaders. Spirituality in this author's approach is vital -- it is not something that appears to be a mere overlay on a secular paradigm.I love reading titles on leadership, but have long felt there was something much more than just a Christianized version of secular theory.

It didn't need to be so long. It had dark, poor-quality lighting. It interviews many men, but I saw no men of color and no bears. Thus, it was whitetwink-centric.There's one thing I must give up to it: many say that gay porn mostly involves men being \\"gay for pay.\\" These men here seemed strongly gay-identified.

You could find these guys in many a club, tearroom, or bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Pointless","review":"This show equates to nothing more than the bonus features you get with a regular porn DVD that includes interviews with the models. I think the director was trying to be edgy by shooting the models from unflattering angles in poor lighting. All he suceeds in doing is making really hot guys look bad (not at all sure why this would be a goal anyone would have). Johnny Hazzard still managed to look good though (his footage probably amounts to less than 10 minutes).

You can hear bits and pieces of the foo fighters, rival schools, a tiny bit of sunny day real estate, embodyment, and a surprising inclusion of a bit of a much underated band once known as puller.

Not worth $35.00 for that information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and Annoying","review":"When I read all the positive reviews of this book last winter, I went right out and bought it along with the Sams 24 hour Flash book. I went through the Sams book - which is great at teaching flash basics - and then went to Curtis' book for more advanced learning. I found it ittirating how the book requires you to use other programs, such as Adobe Premier and Macromedia FreeHand to finish most projects. And none of the projects were even finished!The book is supposed to have been updated for Flash 5, but many of the instructions were geared toward Flash 4 requiring me to figure out the \\"Flash 5\\" way of doing a technique. You can learn much more by doing online tutorials than you can from this book.The one thing Curtis does well is emphasize concept development. But overall, this book was a waste of my money. Don't buy it unless you like quitting a project before it is done and unless you have access to the other programs he uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply wonderful","review":"I'm new to Flash, but have years as a designer and this book really spoke to me and helped me get up to speed with a not just new software, but a way of thinking about the medium the software was designed for. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book for beginners","review":"I waited on buying this book , but then took a look at my bro's copy and immediately got my own. The people writing some of the reviews are right, this isn't for advanced Flash artists, but all in all for a rookie like me it's been huge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillman Curtis is a freakin' genius","review":"Even though Flash 5 is long gone, this is still a really good book to have and look back on. Hillman Curtis is a visionary for how we look at film, the web and storytelling. Reading this book taught me a ton about telling good stories and less about Flash, but that's what separates this from a textbook. This is definitely worth having on your wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"overdesigned","review":"I wouldn't listen to these guys when it comes to design. It's actually hard to read and find information because of their 'style'. And it doesn't look cool either. A lot of hot air, little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick, but Not for Beginners.","review":"I bought this book hoping it will help me to learn Flash 5. From a beginner perspective this book is very lacking and the examples are missing some necessary steps. Its certainly a nicely designed book but gives you no sense in what to expect from it. I expected the examples to be written in such a way that anyone can do it as long as the instructions are followed... and that didn't happen. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of $","review":"I know there are people would love some of the tracks on this set but personally I think, they are lame selections. Just another way of making money on the old stuff... The 2003 version of this series - Decades has way better tracks. Maybe I just like the more exciting and up beat music... I am giving it a 2 stars for the 10% of its decent tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good songs yet too familiar","review":"This CD has some really great songs. I love particularly the one that was released as a single, \\"Another white dash\\" ever since I heard it on MTV's Advance warning. However, this singer offers few new things. Many of her songs sound like pre-sellout Liz Phair. If you like the genre of angry-chick music (ranging from Ani and Liz to Fiona and Tori), this is a fine representation of the genre (I actually love the genre and that is why I gave four stars). If not, probably you would be better off avoiding it, since there is not much else to listen in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Undiscovered Talent","review":"Butterfly Boucher will be sound to some people like a foreign language. The public probably isn't even aware someone called this exists! Butterfly is an amazing singer, her thought provoking lyrics and catchy hooks are something to savour. Her voice is totally unique and her style of writing is different as well. Flutterby provides excellent listening and is a true gem. I am so lucky I discovered this album. I highly recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flutterby Soars!","review":"Butterfly Boucher, a 25 year old Australian born wonder, crafted the most amazing album I have ever heard. EVER. Solid, gorgeous vocals, multilayered arrangements with driving guitar and percussion, a sweetness in the piano, and stunning lyrics make this album a sensual feast from beginning to end. And she plays EVERY instrument on the album except drums and cello, and she does all the vocals. Butterfly Boucher is possibly the most significant talent to emerge on the music scene in decades, with a polished sound and a sophistication missing in so many of today's artists. I simply cannot say enough about this woman's music. She defies comparison--vocals of the quality of Sarah MacLachlan, only deliciously edgier, and harmonies that melt me in my shoes. BUY THIS ALBUM. You will want to buy it for everyone on your Christmas list after you listen to it. And if you ever get the chance to see her in concert, run, don't walk. She is astonishing on every aesthetic level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Flutter by this one","review":"Have you ever had this CD that you kept going back to and listening to again and again, even though you didn't think you liked it that much? This CD fits that bill for me. I listened to it once all the way through and I liked a few of the tunes. I listened to it again and some of the songs I was so-so on before clicked into place. I keep going back to this CD because the songs keep calling to me. Her style is a bit edgier than Dido or Beth Orton so if you want ballads and slow pop this probably isn't your thang. It seems like all the tracks on this CD were handcrafted with exquisite precision. It's good stuff all over. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Floats like a Butterfly","review":"Flutterby, the first album by Butterfly Boucher, is a gem. Her voice is sent from above, and after listening to song after song, you just grow to love her style even more. I picked this album up after hearing \\"Another White Dash\\" on the radio, and I could not have been more pleased. I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"She opened for BNL","review":"I usually roll my eyes at many opening acts....but Butterfly blew me away and I had to get up and buy her CD at the concert. This CD is amazing. Great female rock sans the bitterness of so many. Butterfly rocks on the guitar and has a unique voice and great lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a first disk","review":"I had a friend who loved to play Boucher's last cd in her car, and she told me how she didn't like the last one a lot because of the whole \\"90s girl band\\" feel, so I was a little wary of purchasing this disk. But it ended up being pretty amazing, especially as it was Boucher's first attempt at the time. Totally recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catch This Butterfly","review":"Why Butterfly Boucher isn't getting more airplay on alternative stations is beyond me. Her voice resonates with a confidence and maturity well beyond her years in songs that are simple yet sophisticated observations of life and love. The music isn't overly produced or sweetened like what is considered mainstream pop so it has a raw sincerity that matches Butterfly's voice. My favorite tracks are I Can't Make Me, Another White Dash and Soul Back. These are songs I listen to over and over again and they never lose their emotional edge. I can't wait for her next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo good!!!","review":"I saw Butterfly Boucher in concert with Sarah M. and it was a great concert. Butterfly Boucher puts on an amazing live show. Soooo I decided to buy the CD off Amazon and to my surprise/delight the CD doesn't have a bad song on it and it is *almost* as good as the real thing!!! Great cd DEFINATELY worth the 8$ or whatever it is. BUY IT and support a great new band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only if you need a printed Java reference","review":"A brief but good reference of the JFCs. Again none of language features are covered in dept so don't expect this book to be a tutorial or an introduction to Java. Buy it together with another title that has more hands on examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grizzle Adams","review":"I was so excited to find that Amazon had the 2 seasons of Grizzle Adams, I wanted my grandkids to enjoy what I did as a child. Now Im not even going to waste my money because of all the negative feedback. Im glad I read before I purchased a 2 rate DVD. Amazon should not even let such low quality items on their site. Bad name!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality and fond memories","review":"This first season of the series is a real treat and an insight into how well childrens programmes were once made.A real feeling of love and hope comes across as each episode unfolds.The episodes have a way of drawing you into them and the bear is just outstanding. I reckon Dan Haggerty had a closebond with him.Quality wise... being shot on 16mm and with an optical soundtrack it looks and sounds like a series from the late 70's early 80'sThat is exactly the feel I want. No its not HD but when played through a Sony Dvd player and upscaled to 1080p it looks very impressive on a 40 inch screen. The soundtrack is also fine and the lovely soundtrack music creates a perfect retro feel. I am more than happy with the quality.I am from the Uk and can strongly reccomend the set to you if you have a region 1 or multi region dvd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing quality","review":"It's great to see this show finally released on DVD. It's fun to introduce my kids to some of these great old shows that I watched growing up. However, the video quality is a disappointment. This show deserved some remastering and cleanup. It looks like it was put out in a hurry just to make a few bucks. Thanks to Shout! for finally putting it out, but come on, you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nostalgic, fun program gets a poor quality DVD release","review":"Like so many others I waited years for this program to finally get a DVD release. Grizzly Adams is a fun series that reflects the tenor of its time. The 1960s and 1970s brought growing concerns about the environment and those concerns were often mirrored in popular culture. This hokey series was a reflection of that time. Unfortunately, CBS completely botched this DVD release. The quality is terrible. The episodes are usually washed out, with miserable sound mixes and hundreds of imperfections of every type moving across the image. I will not be buying season two because I do not wish to support this kind of lazy release. CBS should be ashamed. . .after so long fans of this program deserve some basic level of effort. I do not recommend the 2012 CBS DVD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob/trainfanatic53","review":"I've waited a long time for The Life and Times Of Grizzly Adams to come out on dvd,\\"Can't wait for it to be released.I enjoyed watching the series when it first aired.Very down to earth,\\"A real family show.It's ashame it only lasted two seasons.Do not take so long releasing season two.Thank You!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams Season One.","review":"I chose \\"The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams for my Niece Juli,she loves the fact that it is rated for all ages,that means that her children can watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT show...TERRIBLE quality!!!","review":"They finnaly released this terrific show on DVD but they should have cleaned it up a bit.

I only wish the discs had been numbered so I would know what order to watch the episodes in. Also, a digital remastering would be nice. Otherwise, I love it! Grizzly's a good man and the animal trainers must have been top-notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!","review":"This was a trip down memory lane! It reminds us of simpler times. It is a sweet way to show our kids (and ourselves) that people can be kind. Rather like Little House on the Prarie, but with adults and wildlife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!","review":"My Dad and I used to watch this all the time....we lived this show, it was our one thing so it was nice to get on dvd to watch again.....I admit, I cried when I saw the first episode, heck who am I kidding, I cried during the opening song....its a great trip down memory lane, can't wait to get Season 2 in February :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and inspiring","review":"I really enjoyed reading the first part of this book, and just wanted to recommend it to anyone who enjoys science, or is fascinated by science and the people who strove to study it.

We have been cooking with the same Cuisinarts pans for over 23 years! The Classique is built to almost the same standards as my original pans...stainless steel construction, with an aluminum core for even heat distribution and thoughtful ergonomic and aesthetic design. The copper underbelly adds to the visual delight...but is designed to add practical culinary value by facilitating even heat distribution. While the overall quality of the Cuisinarts line has declined in the past several years, this is still a great pan and a great investment. I anticipate that like its predecessors, my Classique will also serve us well for the next 23+ years...adding value and function to my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"ruin your hair","review":"It straightens and breaks your hair!

I can't imagine how bad this must be if you have curly or dense hair.The only way I can pull a decent style with this is if I use high end hair products (straightening cream and shine spray) and do it the night before.

Of course Amazon is only too willing to suggest thirty-six \\"if you bought.... try....\\" accesories.One of these was a GPS bike mount.Unfortunately I bought it.It looks like the pride of 1982 Soviet Design. Huge, kludgy, and ugly.It's more galling than that, though -- IT DOESN'T EVEN FIT THE MERIDIAN GPS.

I like the way you can set the temp. and a timer will let you know when it has reached that temp - just like a real oven! Another reviewer said he didn't like the way it only browns on the top but I have heard that is intentional and preferable (though I can't remember the reasoning).

Have not used all the features; it is not complicated but multi-featured, so naturally it takes a while to get it all.The size is terrific; don't think there's much out there that can beat it but a real oven.Only gripe is the removal system for the crumb tray: removes from the rear (no doubt for a cleaner interface), but I have to pull it away from the wall to do so. Because I like to keep the power cord wrapped to its shortest reach, I then have to either unwrap the cord or unplug it. If I unplug it, I have to then reprogram the clock. Not a major impediment; just an area of suggested improvement for the next model is to have a front-loading tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usually a satisfied Amazon customer but not this time.","review":"Maybe it would have baked a chicken just fine but I never got that far because it wouldn't make toast ... the first thing I tried.

In reading the Amazon/Reed review above, I can only imagine the reviewer expected something geared towards a less mature readership, as this is truly an incisive and thoughtful book that held my interest throughout, and as good books do, it not only gave me something new to look at, but also gave me a new way of looking at things.Bravo, John Onians!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Enjoy","review":"We can only hope that the impending hardcover editions in the \\"Essential\\" series will be full size and in color.

The problem wit' Loon is that, he's not creating ideas,he just performing ideas of Puff daddy. Weak record."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars","review":"Loon is a wack album. The Bad Boy legacy is forever tainted with this album, Diddy should have invested more time in a second Black Rob or G. Dep album instead of making this weak attempt at a rapper sex symbol bull.

This book is a perfect quick read for getting yourself up and running on XML as well as being a good quick reference. I bought the book expecting it to only be useful when looking up a XML term while programming and was pleasantly surprised to find that it doubled as a (bare minimum) tutorial for XML.

Her drawings are poignant reminders of the love and humanity that can exist in the midst of madness. She is also not afraid to show the horror of the war and the tolls it takes on its victims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Inexpensive way of owning the genius that is Kathe Kollwitz","review":"The large format of this book makes looking at Kollwitz's prints a pleasure. The pages may not be glossy, but as real prints are not done on glossy paper, it kind of lends itself to her prints. It has a lot of her more recognizable prints as well as some lesser known ones.The only complaint I have is beyond petty; the book is taller than standard books and as a result does not fit in ANY of my bookcases properly and I have to put it in sideways.

Hart. Whereas he seems to have been able to incorporate his religious underpinnings into his life's work, I acted as if I rejected them. Not until reading this book have I understood the roots of my own political and social beliefs, which are very similar to his. This is a powerful and insightful book, despite it's pocket size. Please do yourself a favor and read it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A straw man","review":"Hart's representation of the religious right is a straw man. It must come from his legalistic Nazarene tradition and personal experience or his own prejudicial rendering of how he perceives the threat from those involved in American politics with more conservative religious and political points of view than his own. The liberal left has lost influence and political turf in recent years and this is his scare tactic approach to win some back. The book is a good attack against the Al Queda like efforts of an insignificant few in our culture to impose their views on society but is a futile effort to counter the larger movement of the right in their efforts to oppose the liberal socialist agenda. The book fails to convince or even cause serious reflection of another viewpoint. I was hoping for a compelling presentation to advance a mutual understanding of the issues. This book fails miserably."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Charming Portrayal","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I viewed it only because of my personal devotion to Ste. Thèrése--and after seeing it once, I know I will see it many more times. The dialoge was true to St. Thèrése's own words, and the sets and costumes were quite believable. Many \\"period\\" films (\\"Lion in Winter\\" comes to mind) are spoiled by modern hairstyles and/or makeup. Not so with this one. The paucity of background music and other effects give a first impression of a low-budget production. As the film progresses, however, its starkness allows the viewer to focus on the characters and story. Sadly, the film is far too brief to address in depth Ste. Thèrése's spritual trials, and it only barely touches upon her wit, insight, and profound maturity.This is a must-have for anyone who is a devotee of Thèrése's; it will be enjoyed by fans of foreign and/or religious films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"This book says you all about Firewall & Internet Securities.

Very, very, business oriented so don't go looking for inspiration as an artist, just as a businessman. I think most musicians are artist reluctantly donning the businessman's hat because we have to this day and age, this book drives that home thoroughly.

I will use it for future reference. I like the true stories and the comments of people in the business at the end of the book.

What I learned is that the \\"music business\\" mainly exists (on a corporate level) in LA and NYC, while Nashville is where the *country* music business exists in its own little bubble.

I was hoping for more, not that I'm complaining, but this was the same stuff I just read a few months ago!!! I must admit this book really disappointed me on that level, since I had seen these quotes before and, for that matter, more of them. I must admit I was more pleased with the other book, since this was pretty much a rehash, but I did like the fact that it split out demo and rep quotes, even if they were ones I knew before.

I agree with the ho-hum comment as this was quotes I'd seen before and not very interesting as they were old. I had thought and hoped with a new election there weould be something new, but it was all the old Quayle and Reagan and Dole and such. And that is so lame and old!!! I expected new quotes from Gore and Goerge W. Bush. This seemed very dated already, unfortunately. But then, I guess it's because it takes along time to publish a book, right?

The bad thing about these players is that they dont have a FM tuner. This function can be very handy if you work out or run.

Much of the information is \\"fluff,\\" and is not necessary to the teaching. You could cut out 2/3rds and have a useful guide.Printing problems (standard in Framemaker) are not even discussed.

Why is he so concerned about secretive lockpicking?

Barring the one story of a Russian father and son repating the past to the horror of a neighboring tenant, this book was downright boring and allot of times hard to follow. Comprised of many short stories I thought this would be a good one to keep near the bed for when I wanted a quick read, what I didn't realize was how outdated the stories were and how confusing some of the dialect would be.

That package alone is interesting enough, in this day and age of web-download-dominated musical experiences, but the music, in the way it reminds me of miles davis anno 1970 meets squarepusher meets vangelis anno 1973 (especially in the chordal sampling on the titletrack which may actually be a sample from \\"heaven and hell\\") just blows my mind.

I chose this over the 660, because it easily fits into a coat pocket. When I visit my friends out of state I take this with me so that we can travel around. They love it too and 7 of my friends have purchased based on my recommendation.I love the easy to use features. Nice to always be able to find the nearest Starbucks or gas station.The only reason that I can not give this 5 stars since the bluetooth is not consistent.

The best thing is it has shopping menu which contains all kinds of stores address. Basically as long as you know the name of the store, you can go there. Also it is the same for gas station. But I have to say it's not updated so well. Once I want to find the nearest shell station because I'm almost ran out of oil. But the addresses is wrong, TWICE. I'm very close to call someone towing my car that day. So if you want to go to some gas station, go online to confirm first.Other things are really good. Especially when you know the accurate address of the position you want to go. There are so many similar addresses with slight differences aroung. Like south, north, Dr, Blvd, or just different city.

As I was unwrapping the cable in the car to charge the battery, something fell off. I looked closer, the tip of the cable was broken! I was on a small street of SF, and I had no sense of direction. Boy, it took me long time to figure out how to get out of there without GPS as I could not turn on the thing. I was not happy about that.

There has been a lot of construction in North Florida lately and this GPS got us lost in 50% of the places we went to. Garmin should be very careful in promoting the new design with a old software.

I love that you can bypass construction and it recalculates your route automatically. The bluetooth is awesome for hands free mobile. The website is great for all of your questions like \\"how do you get the thing to say the street names instead of turn left in 100 ft\\". Just change the voice and it says the street names.

I do double check routes before we go on long trips because one time it didn't take us on interstates which was slightly longer but much more convenient and straight. Be sure and keep the unit plugged into the back, not the side. The side outlet will work with the adapter but it messes up the unit and causes it to go very slow and not calculate correctly. The bluetooth feature is nice although my son does not like the reception but no one else has complained. We love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drop even One time...Its gone for good!","review":"I bought this item for christmas last year in 2008. I purchased it for 169.00 Yes I said 169.00....what is with the new Hefty price for the same model???I used it occasionally on the dashboard mount. As i was placing it there last week, it fell onto a PADDED car floor. (I have thick all weather proof Mats).Mind you it was not thrown, and only fell about 2 feet. After picking it up I see that the LCD screen is no longer functioning. There are zig zag lines on the LCD screen.I do not beleive that a product of this nature which is built to be used in the car, should become useless after this.The warranty does not cover it.I will never buy from Garmin again.

The BlueTooth is not as useful when window mounted because it is hard to hear the other person on the phone. Do not use a lot of the extras.

It is light weight and thin, easily fitting into a briefcase. The map and points of reference are excellent as are the directions. Overall the performance to date has been nearly flawless.The Bluetooth feature works very well and connects easily, the only issue with the Bluetooth and the unit in general is that at highway speeds it can be difficult to hear the person you are speaking to due to not being able to adjust the volume loud enough. The person you are speaking with can hear you perfectly however.The cost is a bit high but the performance outweighs this, be prepared though to spend additional money to activate some of the other features such as traffic, language guide, travel guide and savers guide. I personally don't use these so it's a very small issue.Overall I am very satisfied with the unit and would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is a must buy","review":"This is the 2nd one we have bought within the last year.

Because it announces instruction to make turns so I do not have to look at it while driving.The electronic map inside is not 100% complete and never will be, so if you type in a street address and it returns different address you need to be very careful because that means there is no this address in their map and it may lead you to the street address they show on the screen which may be different from your destination.This GPS is a great tool to have.

Used the POIs to find a resturant and the search function worked great to find places based on name if you don't know the address.One thing i have noticed that is bad is the routing in rural areas. For some reason where i live it thinks there are like 5 connectors to the interstate on a 1 mile stretch near my house, and when visiting some family friends, it though their house was .5 miles from where it is.Overall, if you are in areas with well defined roads that aren't out in the middle BFE, it works great.

I am disappointed. My husband has a TomTom One(a much cheaper product) and his device has much more planning options- like navigate to recent destination, points of interest near current position, along route and near destination. It's also easier to put in a new address since it recognizes the street names much faster - it pulls a list only after you type 2 letters. On the display the TomTom (unlike Garmin) also shows how many more miles you have left to destination, current speed and time - these are nice features I don't want missing. Both Garmin and TomTom have estimated arrival time and distance to next turn. The only thing I like about the Garmin is the text to speech but that's pretty much it.

Callers complained that they couldn't hear me because of background noise. I tested it by having someone call my landline with the gps in bluetooth mode in a quiet room.

I think it has a very good combination of various features offered by Garmin. The most useful thing I find is street names. It is kind of easier to navigate with all these street names being spoken out of your gps, than only the directional instructions. This also makes you more familiar with the area and it becomes easier to recollect things (street names, restaurants etc.) when you visit similar places later on. I don't know if the photo feature is really useful in a gps, but I think bluetooth connectivity adds a good functionality to it. This model is so thin and light that you can easily carry it in your pocket. The time required to acquire satellites is pretty less. So overall it is an awesome product to have, especially when you are out of your home town and when you need offhand planning. Go Garmin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nuvi 360","review":"This is a great product. The voice commands with street names is extremely helpful. Would recommend updating the maps right away.

I am hoping I simply did not fully charge before that trip.The mounting system works fine, and I was skeptical about how well the suction cup would hold.

I had a Garmin device prior to this one that I loved.First, this device worked *once*, after which it would only simulate routes. I turned it off and on, reset the device, and still couldn't get it to navigate for me.Secondly, the text entry input is not qwerty, it's alphabetical, which makes it extremely difficult to type in Anything.Third, I'm used to being able to see the history of what I've searched for, which is very useful.Overall, I didn't use the device very much because I got too frustrated with it.

Shortest time is set by default.I like the bluetooth feature which allows hands free connection to my cell phone while driving.

I would often lose satellite reception driving through the streets of SF and end up dazed and confused trying to follow it's erratic directions. Not to say that having a GPS system isn't at times a life-saver, my Garmin was not something I would want to heavily depend on.On top of the poor reception and long route calculating time, the Garmin does not hold up to the test of time. I drove down to LA two weeks ago and it literally just \\"died\\" an hour into my trip. It shut down and no matter how I tried to resuscitate some life back into it, it refused to turn back on.

Price and features prompted me to proceed and I am very glad I did. The performance of the unit has been excellent and even exceeded my expectations. It paired flawlessly and easily with my BlackBerry. People I talk to frequently have noted the Bluetooth hands-free call quality is actually better than the handset. So far, I have had no complaints with caller voice quality or volume, which leads me to believe that is probably more a function of the service than the unit itself. The maps are great and have made getting around LA and Orange County a breeze -- I highly recommend this unit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent GPS Not so Great Bluetooth","review":"As a GPS unit this one is top notch. No issues what so ever getting around. Maps are as good as can be expected and the options you are given allow you to customize to find what is right for you.

Very intuitive to use and also extremely easy to 'update' using the Garmin Website.I almost bought the Nuvi 350 thinking that I would not have a use for the Bluetooth technology, but I am very happy that I got the 360. Matching my phone (a Sprint Treo 650) to the Nuvi was extremely easy and the ability to make phone calls using the device is extremely helpful.Also, when I was driving, I received a phone call and I was surprised that the Nuvi alerted me to an 'incoming' call. When I pressed the option to 'answer' on the Nuvi, it behaved like a 'speakerphone'. I was able to talk and hear the caller through the Nuvi. I never even reached into my pocket to get the cell phone !BJ"},{"rating":"1","title":"Antenna dies after two years","review":"Used a 360 for two years, was generally happy with it. Then, satellites started going away after it was on a minute or so.Found instructions on the internet on how to crack the case open yourself. Was able to do that, but couldn't see anything wrong. Might come in handy when the internal battery dies.Based on experiences others have posted, tried the cheap $11 external antenna. Worked great. Nice unit, small with a strong magnetic mount.Have a friend with a 350, he has the flakey power switch that others have reported. I've been a long-term Garmin fan, starting with a GPS 12, but really disappointed in how the quality has gone down as they try to compete in the cheap sat-nav market.At this point, no reason to be buying a 300 series, the 200 series are cheaper and maybe don't have these two issues.

It was very easy to set up and it is easy to use.The search feature to find local businesses is great! Probably the most useful tool on this GPS for me.

Acquires satellites in 2 minutes or less. Unlike some other Garmin models the 360 comes with all the accessories you need.Cons: I bought this unit primarily for its TTS feature and because I think taking your eyes off the road for even a few seconds is dangerous. The TTS works wonderfully and gives good directions with enough lead time. When you can hear it. And that's the problem with this unit. The volume (even on its highest setting) is too low to be heard above typical car noise levels. So, since TTS is my most desired feature, I'll be retuning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instead of 360, get the 660 instead for brighter screen and bluetooth.","review":"I initially got the 360 because I got 650 for my daughter earlier. However I found that 360 is not very bright compared to 650. So I returned and got 660 for my wife. My new LG Dare phone does not yet bluetooth with the GPS device, but once that is up and running the usefulness can be appreciated by dialling POI (point of interest) straight from the screen of 660. THE UNIT IS VERY RELIABLE AND DEPENDABLE. Thats my friend is the bottom line.

I bought mine for vacation travel as well, and it performed beautifully in Italy with the additional maps I purchased. We also used it to walk to the various sights in Rome, but be careful if you're on foot - Nuvi assumes you're in a car, so it avoids taking you down one-way streets. This can make for a longer route sometimes. I also bought the additional Language Pack but wasn't so thrilled with it's awkward and frustrating lack of words and phrases. We managed better with a phrase book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for traveling salesman.","review":"So far with three months use this GPS has done well by me.

Lauderdale, Florida, and, having never been there before, had no idea where anything was. So we used our navigator a lot. Easy to use, map is clear, good verbal directions and loud enough speakers to hear directions. Plugged in Mexican Food and it found several restaurants in the area and told how far each was from where we were, etc.Occasionally it was off a little -- e.g., to hotel it said turn left and hotel would be on left, but actually it was turn left and hotel was on right. Also, one place we wanted to go it showed us and directed us to it, but the place was no longer there. But, overall, it was accurate 98 percent of the time and was a huge help in a city we had no clue about. Good bargain for the price.We have just gotten bluetooth phones and have not had a chance to use them with this unit, so can't comment on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS","review":"We've had absolutely no problems with this unit, and as an added bonus, the Bluetooth connection is almost flawless--better than any bluetooth we've tried, and we've tried many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin is the future","review":"I am extremly happy with my Garmin.

I wanted the device to give me alternate route but it was adamant and did not give the alternate route though it would be a faster route.

I have been extremely pleased with this-I have yet to look at any directions or a manual. I was able to pull it out of the box, turn it on and go. The interface is extremely logical and easy to navigate (no pun intended). It has guided me throughout California and Chicago easily.The bluetooth works well, though for sound quality it can't compete with bluetooth routed through a cars' stereo. It works well in a pinch though, especially in rental cars.4 stars instead of 5 because the battery life is questionable. Keep the car charger handy. I haven't had it long enough to give an \\"average\\", but it's certainly going to be less than 5 hours. I'm also a little concerned that the maps need to be updated-but that's laziness on my part-I'm sure if I contacted Garmin I could get an update if one is available.There are a million nav choices out there-so far I think I made the right choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work well at all","review":"I don't know if I just got a faulty product, but it didn't work very well for me at all. It always would say \\"acquiring satelites\\" I did all the work arounds they reccomended and it kept doing it. It would work for a little while and then it would freeze and go to acquiring satelites, in the meantime I would have no idea where I was going. You can restart it and sometimes it will pick it up sometimes it won't. I was very disappointed, I sent it back. I may get the 350 everyone I know that has that one likes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This product is amazing. Haven't had any trouble using or mounting it. Sometimes the satellite signals are lost creating bit of an inconvenience. I have also seen cases where it didn't speak up at some turns where it was supposed to. I thought the signal is lost, but that wasn't the case. Sometimes the map seemed to contain wrong street address, not sure if it was due to not having the updated map."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Nuvi 360 review","review":"Few of my friends are using Garmin nuvi series product, i thought of buying the same brand for my use also and i was going through the option for bluetooth option and NUVI 360 is doing a good job in terms of handsfree calling and accessing my phone directory.Also some time i use MP3 player in NUVI which i generally connect to my Car audio-in jack so that my i can listen the mp3 through my car stereo, i am getting some background noise when i connect the Car charger to NUVI 360 otherwise the audio quality is good. This might be the filtering issue with the car charger but i am not sure how to resolve this issue.Overall i like this product still the pricing is high."},{"rating":"2","title":"expectatons","review":"I have to admit that I hesitated when it was time to click on the \\"purchase item\\" button, not being sure of the cost/benefit outcome........

The power button on these units is constructed poorly. It is set under a piece of plastic, and after repeated use, can get pushed down too far for it to turn on. I went in under the plastic tab to turn it on and it stopped working completely. The product overall is good except for this faulty hardware. Please be aware of this if you are thinking of purchasing this unit. I am buying a new one, and I am going with the Nuvi 265 (the power switch is a sliding switch on this model!) I hope garmin doesn't let me down a second time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Global Positioning System","review":"This global positioning system was easy to assemble and use. A pleasant woman's voice gave clear instructions through our first trip, giving excellent advice throughout, even as to which lanes to be in prior to turning off or changing highways. This was a considerable help as it took time to change lanes in the heavy traffic. It successfully guided us on major highways, small towns and even an isolated area with one-lane dirt roads. One feature we particularly liked was the restaurant information, which helped us find our way to nice restaurants in unknown towns and cities. We are very pleased with this unit. The only downside was the very long period of time to download the current map, which took about six hours. Once done, however,it won't need to be repeated for quite a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lons distance trip","review":"Great navigation tool- we flew to Minnesota to drive a vehicle back to Maine.

I only have good things to say about this little wonder. The only limitation I found was that the additional memory card for a different country (spain) lacks the database to perform as well as in the US, and perhaps that a screen which is 1 inch larger may make it easier to see the info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"I have owned the Garmin Nuvi 360 for about one month now and I am still amazed at the performance of this little gem. I am impressed with the amount of information that can be packed in such a small package. It has worked flawlessly. The speed in which it acquires the satalite signal is impressive. The map which is included in the software is more than adequate, however the price of additional maps if needed for other countries is excessive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lttle machine, but...","review":"Easy to use right out-of-the-box! Good battery life and great size. I've used it locally and long distances and it has always gotten me there, although sometimes it doesn't take the shortest route. If I was asked what needs to be improved on the 360 it would be to update the POI's...It has some places that are no longer open and doesn't have newer establishments. #2 - the bluetooth is not worth the extra $50.

We bought a printed map a year ago that had the new 202 on it. We've downloaded the most current maps available & are disappointed about the dated information we got.We LOVE listening to books on it as we drive. The directions come through,but sometimes are tricky to hear when there's a book on. We've learned to turn off the book while traveling through cities & towns to ensure that we get the details we need.We liked being able to identify nearby shopping, motels, or restaurants. (Although motels are not always where they're supposed to be; store locations were very good.)We really liked being able to enter our destination address & have Nuvi lead us there. It got us through convoluted streets in San Antonio with ease. It does quite well in cities; rural mapping seems weak.We broke it in on a 1300 mile trip from AZ to TX & return in December."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin nuvi 360 gps","review":"I was dissapointed in the 360.

We have a 350 and 360, both identical except the Bluetooth on this one which I haven't even used yet. Occasional glitches with directions, but I'm sure they all have that. I love the voice activation, wouldn't settle for not having it.

The only time that I had any hint of a problem was when we were in the mountains the unit in place and all we had to do is reboot the system. It has been extremely accurate. I can't say much for the stand that adheres it to the dash or the memory card that I purchased at the same time but the unit itself is amazing. I HEARTILY RECOMMEND THE 360 TO EVERYONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"GPS Garmin nuvi 360","review":"Très bon produit, carte les plus à jour que je connaisse.

So, about an hour later (totally tying up my PC) it's downloaded and ready to install the update. Now the install window is asking for my product code that comes with the \\"Install disk\\". I don't know what they mean by the \\"install disk\\", there was no such disk - there is a CD with the owner's manual - but it has no \\"product code\\" on it. What is the stupid \\"product code\\"? All I find in the plethora of paper that came with this unit is a serial number, a registration code, and an unlock code. None of these worked in the update install. This is very frustrating and I can't find a number for customer support.Anyway, hence the 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy travels","review":"I owned the nuvi 350 and enjoyed it very much. We used it when my son and family recently moved to Orlando, Fl. It guided us all the way from Maine to Florida without a hitch. My son liked it so much I left it with them to use in Orlando since they were new to the city.I replaced it with the the nuvi 360. I have found both to be very user friendly. My only frustration has been the limitation of entering only one via point per route.Our nuvi 350 and 360 have made our travels much more enjoyable and stress free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never works when needed","review":"My Garmin Nuvi was working fine for an year and stopped acquiring the satellites whenever I want to use it.

He actually read the instructions first - he then turned it on and chose language etc. The first thing you notice is that the manual is for the 310/360. The instructions did not match up with the accessories that were included in the box. O.K. so they did not update it so great, well it is made in Taiwan. But when he went to put it on again, it was deader than a door nail. We called tech support and were blown off. Nasty - Really third rate won't give out last names.We gave then ours. \\"Jack\\" couldn't be found when we called back. No email addresses for supervisor. Why do they hide?

This was my first navigation device and it was so easy to use! I was enjoying all the luxuries of easy navigation until I placed the unit in its carrying case and into my purse so it wouldn't get stolen out of my car. When I returned to my car and pulled out my Nuvi, the screen was shattered! This was within 14 days of receiving the unit, and Garmin would not cover this under warranty because they \\"don't know how the screen cracked.\\" I don't think the screen is durable enough if it can't withstand a ride inside a purse inside its case. Just a warning! The repair for the screen is $86."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"Maps are from April 06. It kept getting us lost in Orlando.

I find myself driving quite a bit (I live in Pennsylvania) and the navigation system is effective. Maps appear to be up to date and directions are generally clear. When typing in locations, the nuvi has (so far) found the location almost every time.My complaint is the small screen. Based on the configuration of my car, the device is far away from where I sit and I find it hard to see the maps. In addition, the small touch screen is hard to use and requires decent manual dexterity.I recommend the nuvi technology, but advise others to spring for the extra money for a larger screen. Even an extra inch would make a significant difference in usability."},{"rating":"1","title":"garmin360 review","review":"I bought this garmin because it was bluetooth ready; the state I live in is going hands free in June.

It informed me that the condo I was sitting accross the street from was a 7-11 store. Then it said \\"satellite signal weak\\" and quit working. A visit to the Garmin site showed a very relaxed attitude about whether I should even expect it to work at all, with outlandish suggestions like placing it outside my car to get it to work (and it didn't). I live in the heart of Chicago so there's absolutely no excuse for it not to work. I'm on the lakefront so its view of the sky was completely unobstructed.

My biggest problem is that the screen is polarized 90 degrees off axis. If you're using polarized glasses the screen is black. I've driven about 3500 miles this summer and had to use the thing at a goofy 45 degree angle and tip my head just so I could see the screen.

The bluetooth sync'd to the cell phone easily also. The map pictures and the voice directions are very clear and easy to follow. It was able to readjust the route quickly as we decided to go in a different direction. With the ability to use a SD card for other options such as photos, areas of interest and maps this will be one very handy device.

I love the fact that it takes a minute at most in the worst conditions to get a signal and a couple seconds in normal weather conditions. My Navagon was terible at that. My only complaint is the speaker is in the back so if you want to use the bluetooth feature it will be hard to hear the person on the other line when going 60 mph. You can plug into the 3.5m jack and make your car radio your speakers which resolves that issue if you have that capability. The bluetooth is great for around the house too. I had a litte trouble setting it up with my blackberry. It didn't detect the Garmin until I turned on another bluetooth headset I owned. I haven't tested the music features.

Two things about this, sometimes it takes ages to find the sattelite and load up (so switch it on when you pick up your keys BEFORE you get to the car!), and it does not have the postal code search which can make it much much easier if you don't have to type the long addresses with number and street details.

When making a white sauce and melting the butter first, you are required to stay with the pan and hold the handle until you can add enough ingredients to get it to stop teetering dangerously on the stove. Since the handle gets quite hot, you have to use a mitt.

She did the VOICE, LYRICS, AND BEAT RIGHT!. Her voice stands out much more and the lyrics will touch u. You will relate to what she singing about and the beats are great. My favorite are TURN DA LIGHTS OFF, ICEBERG ,YOU ,CAB RIDE ,THINGS I DONT MEAN ,SMALL CAHNGE & IM DONE. THIS C.D.

As a matter of fact, Southern Hummingbird was still in rotation in the ride until recently. While she isn't the strongest vocalist, I love her voice. Her CD's are perfect mood music. I'm really glad that she was able to evolve as an artist yet keep the formula that made her first joint so hot. The tracks are all different from one another while keeping the smooth, mellow sound that I love from Tweet. This is a really good CD and I look forward to more."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH better on sophmore effort!","review":"Second time *IS* a charm....at least it is for Tweet. I have her first CD as well (Southern Hummingbird) but it was one of those CD's that had a few good song's but that was it. This new CD shows a lot of growth and has a lot more variety to the lineup of songs. More of a balance between dance and slower song's. Tweet's voice is in fine form on this disc. I love the harmonies and the purity to her voice. The dance songs have a good bumpin' vibe to them and the slower songs have more of a verse/hook/chours to them which I think was lacking in a lot of the songs on her first CD.Standout tracks include: \\" Turn Da Lights Off\\" (Anything with Missy is GOLD), \\"You\\", \\"Cab Ride\\" (With a sample from the theme from the show Taxi), \\"Sports, Sex & Food\\", \\"Where Do We Go From Here\\" & \\"We Don't Need No Water\\"They are all good. Very pleased with this purchase and you will be too if you are an existing Tweet fan or if you are looking for a new R&B; artist to check out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its not Southern Hummingbird but.......","review":"In my opinion this album is not as good as her first. It isn't a total flop in my opinion either. I love Tweets voice and harmony. Maybe a little too much of it was on this album though. I do believe she needs to get as far away from Missy as possible!!! Tweet needs to stick to ballads. Some of her up tempo stuff is ok but just average at best. The highlights of this album for me are: \\"Iceberg\\", \\"Cab Ride\\", \\"I'm Done\\", \\"Could it be\\", and \\"Small change\\". These are the 5 songs that I will really listen to. There are about 4 other average songs. So it's not a total waste. She'll do better on the third album."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad to have her back.............","review":"i love tweet especially her first album, but she did that on her 2nd effort i love it especially the 1st single it's hella -koo i mean it just got that vibe 2 it u know , but the whole album is koo i love taxi cab and the song with rell and especially the with her daughter they sound alike and look alike also i hope she stays around and keep givin us that old style and new r&b she has really grown since southern humming bird she seems more happy on this album and that's good keep up the good work tweet will be looking forward to ur next single and other projects, albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad comeback a review from kevin f","review":"tweet has a good debut on her hand but this cd just kills the love that i had for her this has to be one of the worst cd of tweet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Southern Hummingbird","review":"First off i'd like to say that whoever spammed the reviews have too much time on their hands and need to get a life for real.This album was better than Southern Hummingbird, but thats not saying much especially since I didn't like nothing on Southern Hummingbird. The songs she did with Nisan Stewart (Cab Ride, Small Change, I'm Done) were the best songs on the album.

The author drives home the important point that those who have chronic weight problems are different physiologically than those who are naturally thin. This is definitely not a \\"diet\\" book. In order to take th weight off for good, you have to become a weight manager for the rest of your life. At first I resisted this notion, but as I read on I understood that it takes significant lifestyle changes to be successful. To date, I have lost 23 pounds in the space of two and a half months.

If you are considering migrating to Jaguar, or even if you are already using it but would like to use it more effectively, you should get your money's worth out of this manual.I consider myself a fairly expert Mac OS user, but still learned quite a lot from this book. Although I found myself skipping through several sections because it covered information that I already knew or that I knew I could easily figure out on my own, just by sitting down with the computer. For example, there is a section on iTunes that I did not feel I needed to read since I had been using iTunes already.

No didactic lecturing just a lot of easily digested learning.I 've been teaching a new introduction to OS X class at the local community college and use this as a text.

David Pogue's book is an excellent companion - in my opinion, it's a good thing that Apple doesn't ship a manual - nothing they could write would come close to this. What I like best about it is that it combines readability with heft. I usually hate to read manuals, but with this book I'm tempted to read it cover to cover both because it's easy to do and provides valuable information in each sentence.

His information on how to send email document attachments from the Mac to a PC is incorrect: you cannot utilize .doc--nor am I able to send anything created in an Appleworks 6 document to any PC. There are many missing topics, and I don't care what the OS 9 had! He doesn't even note that some major videocams with still camera mode will NOT connect to Image Capture!

Some users seem very happy about that; most don't know what I mean.I've used every type of computer and operating systems during my 30- year career, and I cannot see how the eMac ever became popular. But Mac users seem delighted with it, which hints of the nightmares they experienced using past versions of Mac OSs.Although I can only guess, it seems as though Mac users have never had system reference material before.

We have even cooked small chickens in the oven. The convection feature makes great breads, biscuits, etc. The only reason we are replacing it after five years is that we use it so much that the finish is showing its age from daily use and scrubbing.

The problem seems to be getting worse in general. Made in China is highly correlated with the problem also.This Cuisinart toaster oven is in a new league however. It is by far the stinkiest product I have bought recently. It stinks of solvents and industrial chemicals in the most foul way. I suspect the internal non-stick coating is the culprit, but can't be sure. Given the level of stink, I found it unusable and returned it. In my experience, it would take weeks to air out and would need repeated bake offs of the smell.Since this produst is involved in food preparation, I consider it irreponsible to sell a product in this toxic condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reliable appliance","review":"I'm very satisfied with this toaster oven.

Last weekend, my husband made toast it it, and when he opened the glass door, it shattered into a million pieces. It sounded like an explosion!! On the plus side, cuisinart customer service seems reasonable. They are sending me a new unit, but I have to pay shipping and handling to send the broken one back. Also, the warranty is only three years from date of manufacture, unless you can prove the exact date you bought it. Thank God that Amazon saves your orders so I did have proof of when I bought it.

This is a large toaster oven. Nice stainless and black style, escept for the big bulge from the convection fan on the right side which makes it even wider. Mostly intuitive digital controls. LOUD ANNOYING BUZZER. Often slow to heat up, perhaps because of its cavernous interior size. No interior light, just the glow from the elements. Crumb tray access through the rear is awkward. Convection fan is sometimes noisy. Multiple slices of toast are toasted adequately, a small tray of cookies bakes fine. Wish I could praise it more for the nearly $200 price, but its just a decent toaster oven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb toaster oven, intuitive, easy to use, and well-made!!","review":"This toaster oven, with intuitive keypads, is extremely easy to use, and to clean.

I use it as much as I use my microwave oven, keeping my bigger wall oven for when I cook for more than 4 people. I roast my potatoes and grill my veggies in it, bake my fish in it, and heat up my frozen banana bread in it, and use it at least twice daily. I am very happy about product and my decision to go with CR top rated toaster oven.FOLLOW-UP: I bought this toaster oven in 2007, and now in 2010, after 3 years of constant daily use, it is still performing well.

The beeper is so loud that it wakes up sleeping kids and adults all the way on the other side of the house behind closed doors. Furthermore, the oven beeps for all sorts of unneccessary things, like \\"up to temperature\\". And as if one beep is not enough, it has to beep 4 times! I tried to find out from them if there was a way to disable the speaker, but they were no help.The other thing I hate about this oven is that it does not remember the bake temperature setting. So every time you want to bake you have to cycle through all the temperature settings to get to the one you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toaster oven that can't toast","review":"So, after having a cheap Black and Decker toaster oven for years, we decided to be more grown up and get a new, fantastically expensive toaster oven. This was it. Problem is, no matter where we place the rack, we can't seem to toast the bread evenly. If the rack is at the bottom, it produces burnt toast on one side, and no toast on the top. In Position \\"B,\\" it toasts the top and not the bottom. We found, however, that this is great for cooking frozen foods (like fish sticks), but sucks as a toaster. We had to go out and buy one of the old school toasters by Oster to suit our bread toasting needs. What a shame. It looks so pretty and grown up on our countertop. If you like making complex meals in a toaster oven, this might be a great buy for you. If you secretly want a nice product that you'll just use for its toasting capabilites, save your money and get a $20 toaster or toaster oven. This one won't work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toaster Oven","review":"Have bought other toaster ovens, and they never seemed to bake and broil as well as I expected.

But if it won't toast, what good is it? Surely not worth the price. The last \\"customer service\\" dude at Cuisinart said maybe the manual was wrong and the tray that holds the bread for toasting should be down close to the bottom heating elements.

It toasts somewhat unevenly but basically ok. I usually toast it on about 3 and then turn over and toast on 2 for the other side (I like my toast pretty done on both sides). The baking seems to work fine. I really like the touchpad controls. It is pretty pricey for a toaster oven but it looks good and works pretty well. The crumb tray must be removed from the back but it is not difficult to do. All in all, a decent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A toast to this toaster...","review":"We bought this toaster oven approximately 6 months ago and it is fantastic. It is very stylish and goes well with our stainless steel appliances. The front touch control panel is flat and easily wipes clean. There is a crumb pan that cleans up easily by removing it from the back of the oven. It's controls are easy to use and make toasting or cooking anything very simple. It toasts and cooks evenly - which is quite amazing compared to most toaster ovens in the market today. The convection function works well and is quiet. There is plenty of room inside - we place 4 waffles in it at a time. My only complaint - I wish the display was lit. This is a nicely engineered and manufactured product - well worth the money when compared to those priced less. Cuisinart has made a great product in this toaster oven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"The Convection oven works as advertised. This is the best toaster oven I have ever had.

This is a serious safety consideration.2. This item keeps cooking after the beeps. Auto shutoff occurs after 4 hours. Microwave users beware. If you dont respond to the beeps your food is \\"TOAST\\". This could be a fire hazzard unless you are real carefull.3. Their is no light inside to help determine when your food is done.4.

We wanted a toaster oven to help keep the heat down in the kitchen during the summer. The package warns that the exterior gets hot, but it does not seem excessive, and much less heating than from a full-sized oven.I had no idea what a great invention the convection oven is: I have made cookies and hot wings with equal success. The oven seems to cook a little faster in the convection mode, so the cookies were done about 15% faster than the package suggested.

Why not save up for a better product eventually?"},{"rating":"1","title":"get a delonghi","review":"why i returned my cuisinart toaster oven and bought a delonghi digital airstream oven:the absolute deal breaker: the oven does not turn itself off when the timer runs out.PITA: cuisinart crumb tray comes out the BACK, and the cord is short so you will have to move the unit closer to the outlet in order to spin it around and get out the crumb tray- or unplug it and reset the clock everytime you clean it.PITA: pushing BAKE to begin using the oven defaults to 100 degrees, so everytime you have to use the oven you have to hit UP, UP, UP, UP like 7 times to get it to the temp you want before you hit start. the delonghi defaults to 350 when you hit bake, and normally that is about the temp you want anyway- so you just hit start. The same thing applies to the timer, so I bet those UP arrow buttons are the first to fail on that membrane switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not perfect - bad warranty","review":"I've owned this item for about 8 months.

They told me I could ship the oven to them at my expense and they would determine whether the item warranted a repair or replacement--or nothing at all! I would also be responsible for the cost of return shipping.I determined that it wasn't worth the hassel and expense.

I also would like it to auto-shutoff (or an option to shut off at the end of the entered time)...but it does not.

The convection fan is more quiet than I expected (it's not even as loud as my home's air conditioning), so I suspect that those who complain about the loud fan received one damaged in shipping. Also, the top of the oven does get hot, but as long as you are forewarned (and keep the oven away from small children), you should be ok.This oven is a great alternative to heating up the big oven and can perform the same jobs, albeit in smaller portions."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP-NOTCH TOASTER","review":"A VERSATILE AND SOPHISTICATED TOASTER/OVEN.

We decided to return the oven and the replacement produced the same results - unequal browning when toasting. My conversations with Cuisinart were not helpful and the representative I spoke with instructed me to return the oven again for a replacement, however Amazon has since informed me that they will not allow another replacement since there may be a wider spread issue. So, it looks like I will be returning this oven for a refund and looking for a replacement from another manufacturer.

Your tire sidewalls will shine better than new, and all you have to do is spray it on. No wiping or buffing required. However, the shine is relatively short lived compared to products that require some hand polishing, and the worst comes when driving on a dusty road, or even if the wind is blowing dust a bit---dust sticks to the silicone coating like a magnet. The result is a brown wall tire. I've taken to buffing it out with an old cloth to remove some of the silicone spray, and that helps a bit.

The book features brides throughout the ages, starting with Queen Victoria and moving on to Carolyn Bessette Kennedy. The author describes the overwhelming love felt by each of these brides at the time of their marriages and highlights the most romantic details of their weddings. In addition, she offers suggestions (under the heading \\"Something Borrowed\\") on how to adapt some of the wedding traditions used by these brides in order to incorporate them into a modern wedding.

What can I say? It is perfect! Though it is not a actionscript \\"bible\\" but it goes in depth about actionscripting and debugging. It teaches you to work with actionscript like C++ or PHP. Unlike most books gives you pretty pictures and not much of explanations on what's going on. If you are a programmer or designer who just want to know what's behind the Flash magic, check out this book! It is all you need, and you won't have to buy another one. What's even better is that once you learn the language of Actionscript you won't have to worry about actionscripting in the MX family, there aren't much differences! It is like once you learn how to ride the bike, you won't forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate reference book","review":"I bought this book with a vary basic understanding of ActionScript, and now I would feel comfortable doing just about anything in it. I've got my copy stuffed full of post-its for quick reference because I'm always coming back to this wonderful programming reference.Colin Moock starts you off easy with a gentle introduction of programming, but it quickly becomes a very steep learning curve after chapter one. The non-technically literate may want to try another book first. That said, it's brilliant and a must-have for anyone that's serious about learning ActionScripting.This book is highly technical, and after learning to code with it, I suggest you give Flash Math Creativity a look to see what cool tricks you can do with your newly aquired AS skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Book has all the essential information for a beginner in Actionscript to get up and running.

His detailed, thorough and methodical approach to ActionScript is much more than a collection of tidbits - it's an approach to thinking about scripting, to understand how Flash \\"thinks\\" and how the ActionScript language is constructed around that.

It has full-size oven features in a small package. Controls are well laid out and easy to understand. It's small enough to fit neatly under the cabinet and takes up little, precious counter space. I can easily toast four slices of bread in about six minutes. A good price on a great, little oven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"So far I love this toaster oven. It is better than any I have owned before. I love how it adjusts the time automatically for toasting when you put in more bread immediately after toasting other. It adjusts for the already hot oven and cooks less time. No burning! It also counts down the time it has left for the toast so I can cook other food and have it all finished at the same time. The oven is big enough to cook quite a lot yet it doesn't take up much room on the counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart TOB-165 Convection Toaster Oven/Broiler","review":"We purchased a Cuisinart TOB-165 Convection Toaster Oven/Broiler two years ago locally.

We use it for all our oven/broiler cooking that will fit into it (which is most \\"oven/broiler\\" cooking for a retired couple). This purchace is for friends that invite us to their cabin in Northern Arizona --- and have a \\"name brand\\" toaster in their cabin that smokes toast in a heatbeat!!! This will also replace their 30 year old \\"roaster\\" they use in place of an oven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Oven - Cooks Great!","review":"I am in the middle of a major kitchen renovation that will take 3 months to complete. We bought this toaster oven to hold us over. It has done that and more. We are very pleased with the speed at which it cooks. It does a perfect job on everything from toast to roast! We've broiled hamburgers, baked biscuits, frozen pizza, french fries, pigs-in-a-blanket, breaded chicken breast, and more. Everything turns out as good or better than when we use our regular oven. The cooking times are drastically reduced when you use the convection option. You can easily watch your food cook through the large, clear glass window. The design is clean and compact. There is only room for improvement in the user interface. Using the front panel to navigate between settings and features is awkward, and not intuitive. You should not have to read directions to operate a toaster oven, but with this model, it is almost necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love this toaster!","review":"I really enjoy this product. We were looking to replace a basic GE toaster oven we have had for years. The Cuisinart toaster/oven is large enough to do a casserole, and as I am typing this review have a 3# pork loin roast baking in it.(That is a real plus here where it is hot and we don't want to heat up the whole house by turning on the oven). The toaster/bagel feature is great and the claims made by the company regarding even cooking are true. We have not had an opportunity to use the convection feature, but when we do I am sure that it will work just as reliably. I also like the wipe clean front surface with no knobs to break or be difficult to clean around. While it is a bit more expensive than I was planning on spending, I feel that the extra cost is worth it.I highly recommend this model to anyone looking to purchase a new toaster oven combo or replace an old standby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Design, Easy Features, Cooks Great!","review":"Great design / style on this toaster over by Cuisinart. It works as a toaster / oven / broiler and even has a keep warm feature. We have cooked everything from cookies, chicken, to toast in ours. It has a few settings for light / dark toast, etc. Temperature control, and all the buttons are on a digitial display, which is clear and easy to use. Buttons have a slight rise to them, so you can easily feel them as well. The display is clean and easy to read; displays the time and has a built in timer with a loud beep that continues til you stop it. Clean up is a breeze with the pull out trays. Inner tray can move to 3 different levels as well.

It just simply will not toast the under side of the bread, although it does a great job on the top side. Even lowering the rack doesn't help. I talked to Cuisinart and they were no help at all; said they get a lot of complaints and that you should lower the rack to the bottom. Well, I did that, and still no browning. When I called back again, they told me to return it to the people I bought it from. Cuisinart was no help at all. So I'm out $30 in shipping costs, and still looking for a product that will produce good results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"We bought this oven to replace a Delonghi retro with a timer that would turn the machine back on after the time expired. I really like the Cuisinart for making tater tots, chicken nuggets and reheating pizza. It heats up quickly and gives me a beep when it's up to temp. The convection cooking is at least 30% faster as the manufacturer claims and for the items I mentioned, it seems to be almost twice as fast. The convection fan isn't too loud on mine but it does force some hot air into the kitchen, but not enough to make me want to part with the oven.The toast isn't perfectly even but it's closer than the Delonghi and I can flip it for the last 20 seconds if I need it just right. It could benefit from an interior light but the other features make up for this shortcoming.Overall, I am pleased with the product and would buy another if I needed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart convection toaster oven","review":"I quickly learned to ignore the rack positions recommended in the Cuisinart booklet. This oven does indeed make uneven toast - unless you adjust the rack to the lower position and turn it upside down [convex side up]. I have found the need to get creative with the rack for other baking uses also. Makes a great baked potato in 45 min., but muffins, convection baked according to a recipe in the booklet, were overbrowned in just a few minutes. Have been afraid to try other breads in such a small oven. I think some things can't handle close proximity to heating elements. A sweet little oven if you take some liberties with it. It CAN make great toast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart Convection Toaster Oven","review":"Our 4-slot toaster died recently and wanted a replacement and found exactly what I wanted.

It has no automatic shut off. That makes it, and almost every other toaster oven on the market, an extreme safety hazard. No automatic shut off makes this oven and the others, accidents waiting to happen. Millions of easily distracted latchkey children and millions of forgetful senior citizens are at risk.

The Cuisinart doesn't heat up as fast, but otherwise it is much more versatile. We particularly like the many different tray heights available (at least eight, counting all the permutations of tray height and broiler pan position).The one shortcoming of the Cuisinart and almost all other new toasters is, as others have pointed out, the lack of an interior light. We solved this problem neatly by attaching a clip-on booklight to the front door handle. Not only is the light thus out of the line of fire, so to speak, but one can focus it on the part of the food due to brown first, and, of course, turn the light off when it isn't needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"cuisinart toaster","review":"This is the best toaster/convection oven I have ever owned.

Their competitors make comparable products and actually service their customers so it makes no sense to buy Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had this for a year and it cracked!!!","review":"The Cuisinart Covection Oven in all white cracked after about a year from very little use. It seemed to start getting hairline cracks in it after three months. Now that I've used the broil function more often, the top of this oven is cracking.I loved it, until it cracked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, versatile convection oven.","review":"I've used this great product for the past two-three weeks now and have nothing but praise for it. So far, I've baked several meatloafs, baked potatoes, casseroles, pizza and Texas toast...all on the convection setting. My wife has used it several times as well and with great results. It's done a fantastic job so far. I mainly bought the Cuisinart for baking and it does a wonderful job especially in the convection bake mode. The Cuisinart heats up to your temperature setting very quickly. I really do prefer baking in my Cuisinart rather than my large oven. It's convenient...quick...takes less time...more energy efficient...etc. I will only use my large oven for things that do not fit in the Cuisinart. The convenience of the touchpad buttons makes using this oven a breeze. It looks great on our countertop as well. It's very, very easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic toasting and baking results","review":"I purchased this toaster oven because the full size oven where I live is 25-50 degrees too hot or cold, can't even cook a pizza in it. So, after researching 3 to 4 other brands & models decided on the Cuisinart TOB-165.Since I have owned it, I use my full-size oven as a cookware storage closet. The Cuisinart toasts everything perfectly and very evenly. I have made casseroles, biscuits, broiled meats and it is fantastic. The digital buttons are easy to use and the temperature is very consistent, no burnt sides or cold interiors. With the convection controls, it definitely cooks much quicker than a standard oven and wastes much less electricity and heat. Pre-heating time for 375-425 degrees is about 5-7 minutes.I'd definitely buy this again as a gift or for someone moving out on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware chipping paint/metal","review":"Have had oven for two years. Now the metal/paint over the door is chipping off. Can't find the flecks so I guess it's either on the food or wiped away with the crumbs.Will get a new toaster oven but not a Cuisinart, they didn't even answer my questions. Reported to CPSC"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like a bomb exploded inside","review":"We purchased this model around 2004 or so. It performs it's cooking and timing chores very well, BUT you can tell how hot the exterior gets by the fact that a third of the paint has chipped on the face (sides are still OK), making it very hard to keep looking clean. Basically, it looks as though a roast exploded on the inside and face of the unit. We can't get it clean - and even if we could, it still looks really bad with all the paint cracks and chips missing.The convection fan has always been noisy. Definitely would not recommend to anyone because of the cosmetic appearance (unless you want to keep it in your basement or garage)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I brought this about four months ago and love it. As a busy mom who has to cook dinner when I get in from work, it's perfect for chicken breasts or meatloaf on convection, also chicken breasts on broil. It also toasts perfectly for a [...]picky eater. Glass window wipes clean with a damp cloth, and the outside has stayed white and not gone a yellowy colour. I've had no problems with chrome or paint quality. Tray goes through the dishwasher and comes out perfectly clean. It is a little larger than the standard toaster oven, but well worth the counter space. The timer is a great reminder for me that the toast or whatever has finished cooking. Also, the convection oven heats up in a quarter of the time the regular oven does--a boon when you are trying to get dinner in the oven quickly. No complaints from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this oven!","review":"I've been looking for a toaster oven for a while now, and love this one. I purchased it mainly for the broiling feature, and so far it's been great! It heats up so quickly and is ready to use in a flash. It's much easier to control than the broiler on my oven, and doesn't heat up the kitchen as much. I can't wait to use it to make baked potatoes. I would highly recommend this oven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great oven","review":"This oven is used for baking, toasting, and some warming. It is much quicker than the conventional oven and does a nice job. We appreciate how it uses less energy and cools down quickly. The large oven rarely gets turned on anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"It is easy to clean & use. It evenly cooks food and heats up in no time! I love using for toddler size meals & leftover pizza."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little oven","review":"This oven works very well. I've used all the features and have no complaints. The only thing I wish the company would do is give a few more varied recipes in the instruction book so you can figure out at what level to place the rack when baking or cooking different things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart TOB-165 Convection Toaster Oven/Broiler, White","review":"Dandy item. It replaced one we gave to a neighbor when she was remodeling her kitchen and we found we could not be without a toaster oven. The given away model was a DeLonghi and we liked it. We read reviews and so many like the Cuisinart that we bought it. It was more expensive than others, but $20 cheaper in white than in the brushed steel. It works well and with ease. Only thing I don' like is that the crumb tray has to be removed from back rather than front. We use it everyday and like this model very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"We've had this appliance since early 2006, and a day doesn't go by that we don't use it. It heats evenly, and it's nice not to waste the energy of using our stove when we can just use the toaster oven. Our one critical remark would have to be that we wish that holding down the \\"minutes\\" button for a few seconds could cause the count to jump in 10s. Even if holding down the button would advance the number of minutes, that would be less annoying than pushing the button for each minute. This is only truly annoying when we need to bake a potato for a long time or something similar. . . but I suppose that is our laziness talking. :) This is still a stellar performer, and it was an excellent investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice oven","review":"I have been using this oven for a few years now. It works great and has never given me a problem. It heats up quick and cooks evenly and quickly. The only trouble is that it is hard to clean. As long as you dont mind an oven that has that lived in look it is a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all its \\"Cracked Up\\" to be","review":"We loved this product for over a year, and with the minor annoyance of the crumb tray being hard to access, it cooked well. The toasting could be crisper, but for cooking small ovens of food, we had been very happy. HOWEVER the paint began cracking above the door. This is not isolated, as my in-laws loved our oven and purchased one of their own. As they are older and only cook smaller meals, their use of the oven is even greater - theirs is really cracked, with paint curling up. I don't want the paint bits falling into my/my kids' food as it comes out the oven. It also looks terrible. We have relegated it to the basement, and are using a toaster only in the meantime. I have noticed superior toast since using a toaster. We hope another maker of toaster ovens comes out with a good convection toaster oven. I've been looking for a stainless one which will not burn my hand which also gets good reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Purchase I've made lately","review":"If you want a toaster oven that is the best one on the market, this is THE ONE! I use this everyday and often several times a day. It cooks evenly, toasts and broils like a charm. Every time I use it I wonder how I ever got along without it. Before purchasing this Cuisinart I had tried 3 others, they did not perform any where near this model. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy temp control","review":"I bought the toaster oven and found the actual oven temp to be 50-75 degrees lower than the setting. I sent it back for repair ($15) and now the real oven temp is 70-75 lower than the setting. I use two oven thermometers, which I calibrate check in the built-in kitchen oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This stuff was a huge waste of money. The other negative reviews are right. It's smelly, it burns, and it doesn't work very well. The smell I could forgive. I didn't have as bad a reaction as Mr. Rivera, but after the spray stung my legs, no way was I going to try the roll-on in more sensitive areas. Anyway, it did take some of the hair off, but not enough to warrant the pain. Save your money and try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad product, poor customer service","review":"This product did not work as it advertised. It did not remove even 1% of hair. When I contacted customer service to return product, because it did not work on me. They refuse to take it back and I am very upset on poor customer service. I would not recomend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the extra money","review":"I have been a loyal Cuisinart customer for some time now; this product is the first in which I have been disappointed. The pan has a great feel and has a solid, durable construction, but there are two problems. First, the pan is off balance - the heavy handle lifts the pan from being perfectly flush on my gas stove burner grate. Second, the handle gets very hot. One can not grab the handle with a bare hand; one must use a mit or pot holder. I am not saying it is a bad pan, only that it falls short of the quality that the price would indicate. I prefer the much cheaper Multi-clad Pro 10-inch skillet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a practical pan for daily cooking.","review":"The one Sunday morning I used this pan, it turned very ugly i.e. the copper all but disappeared and odd splotch marks appeared on the bottom. Only after much elbow grease and polish did the pan look nearly new again. The pan comes with a warning not to use over high heat. I would venture to say it likes low heat exclusively. I would not use this pan for meat or onions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I got these earrings as a Valentine's gift and love them. They are perfectly feminine and charming.

While attractive, this pot, like all the other Copper Classics, suffers from a poorly designed coating that refuses to come off.I've followed the \\"soak in hot water w/baking soda\\". I've tried scraping, first with a plastic knife, then with a chisel (out of desparation). NOthing. If you ignore removing this film, the pot stains UNDERNEATH the coating.

Merry also must figure out how she feels about Jon and Levi. I would definitely reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fine work","review":"Of all five volumes in this series Pelikan seems most at home in this one. This is probably the highest quality work in the series that sought to replace Adolph Von Harnack's \\"History of Dogma\\" and rightly won notable awards. Pelikan was a Lutheran at the time of writing, but one would never have known his confessional bias. In fact, he describes the seemingly novel doctrines of Lutheranism such as the ubiquity of Christ's physical body as well as Luther's particular understanding of Christ's presence in the eucharist (incorrectly termed \\"consubstantiation\\" by a later Reformed opponent) from a Roman Catholic and Reformed perspective. Overall a fair and balanced portrayal of the development of doctrine at a critical juncture in church history. Well worth reading, well written, well footnoted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"I bought this in hope that the CD will have the quality that is worth the name of O'Reilly. But I was wrong. The search engine is very poor. Even though it says to search the whole body, give it an 'is', you get no result. Also the master index has a lot of flaws in it. I cannot use the section \\"Symbol\\" and \\"C\\". All the links miss the book name. All in all, this definitely is a big dissappointment to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Dave E. speaks .. the smart will listen ... the rest ..","review":"The book is a compilation of just who Dave Engerbrettson is.

What I also found, unexpectedly, was a very well documented and written book, especially concerning the holocaust and all the brutality of the Nazis. I have always been distressed by what happened, but I never imagined it was as bad as it was, even though I knew it was horrible. The Jews were the principle sufferers, but not the only ones.

For that, you need to go to their website and spend thousands more.What a complete waste of time and money sifting through all the fluff in this book trying to find some concrete, practical tips on a subject that sorely needs to be covered well.

We needed something delivered by the holiday and this was the only one we found available. Receipt was quick, but the item was overpriced in our opinion. It's probably worth half the cost at most.

The music is good, but this isn't anywhere near a jazz recording. But when you listen to the words it's more in a sad, depressing pop song genre. I didn't catch any real emotion in any of the songs.If you take away the words to most of the songs, this recording has some merit. The band is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the real Diana Krall?","review":"First of all I am a huge Diana Krall fan. Her \\"Live in Paris\\" album is on my top ten list. But something has gone terribly wrong with her new album, \\"Girl in the other room\\". I read some of the negitive reviews and thought \\"it can't be that bad\\". Well sorry to say, it is. Many people suggest she is looking for a new path. Other people think she is getting bad advice from her new husband, Elvis Costello. Whatever has happened is not good. Diana is an incredible singer and an incredible musician. I hope she is in just in a \\"slump\\"...and we get the real Diana Krall back soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have several of Diana Kralls CD's and I was very disappointed in the style of this one. It's quite a departure from her previous ones - the music arrangements are not near as good - most of it sounds like cymbals and a piano. I love her voice, but I wonder if she's trying to do Norah Jones instead of who she is. They are both talented artists - but they need to stay with what has made them successful.

When you pay $16.99 for a CD, and you don't get what you paid for, you should be able to return it & receive a full refund. This is why the record industry is in trouble. I knew when I read that Elvis Costello (her husband- what's up with that??) helped produce this CD it was in BIG big TROUBLE. Yes it's cute when artists like to explore & try new ideas. But that's not what their fans pay for. Oops, i almost forgot, it's not about the fans who make these artists rich.

BUT... in my NOT so humble opinion, I feel that Diana would do better to make music with Joni Mitchell or the sort. Joni Mitchell good for Diana...Elvis Costello, well, we'll wait and see. I can only hope that this album is not a sign of what is in store for Diana and her music. I submit the following evidence- Listen to \\"A Case of You\\" from her album entitled \\"Live In Paris\\" Now listen to any of the 7 songs on this album that Elvis has credit to.- No Elvis, I DON\\"T THINK SO!

Songs by that immortal composer...Elvis Costello!!?? Gimme a break! Quick, folks, name a great song written by this guy. OK, then, name me ANY song written by this guy? She'd do better doing songs by the REAL Elvis. What happened to Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Duke Ellington? Can any of you imagine Sinatra, Ella, Sarah, Billie, Dinah, or Carmen McRae wanting to record any of this junk? I can't. I guess she figures that since she married the guy, she needs to boost his ego a bit. His songs stink, Diana!

If you are really interested in great jazz singing check out the amazing \\"Something To Believe In\\" by Carmen Lundy, and \\"Love's Holiday\\" by Dena DeRose These will both spin you around and show you what great singing is about. In concert Dena DeRose totally knocked me out. Her playing is as serious as it gets, and she sings beautifully. On occasion she gets into scatting unison lines with her right hand, or she'll sing different melodic textures against her chordal voicings. Very hip stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this disc- will not play in many players","review":"Don't buy this. While you might be thinking \\"Hey- this is neat!

The CD insert says: \\"The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore not all DVD and CD players will play the audio side of this disc\\". Save a few dollars and buy the real CD version and avoid these unusable fake CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The artist is free to choose her direction","review":"Diana's music in this CD is well-liked by many people. It's new and different and, as an artist, I'm sure she will continue to explore the many musical avenues open to her. To my ears, the Diana Krall of yesteryear is the Diana I thoroughly enjoy, with her peak performance being the \\"Live in Paris\\" offering. In the past, she has given us a fresh interpretation of the old standards. If you've been listening to music for sixty years, you'll most likely prefer the \\"old standards\\" -- it's a comfort thing. I hope she continues to do well -- she's a hard-working, talented lady. I also hope that she will consider recording some of the familiar music of earlier times."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"As a Diana Krall fan and an Elvis fan all I can say is what were they thinking? I could have written better songs than this. I bought it the morning it came out with huge anticipation, and I think I will find out if there is any way they can recycle cd's because it is just going to collect dust on my shelf otherwise. Too bad because I have never in my life been excited enough about an album to actually go out the day it is released and buy it. MAYBE I will find someone who will appreciate to give it to, but I doubt it. If this album does well, it is proof that a name can take you a LONG way. If this was a debut album for a new artist, it would be laughed right out of the business and off the charts. Diana does a great job once again of name dropping. What could Elton possibly have to do with this album? That's why I was so surprised to see Elvis being called Declan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please go back to how you were Diana","review":"I have all of Diana Krall's CD's, and you can see her evolution as an artist with each one. For me, the two brilliant CDs The Look Of Love and When I Look In Your Eyes were the pinnacle of her achievement. This one I don't like. I have tried hard to like it, have listened to it over and over hoping that there will be at least one song on it that \\"speaks\\" to me. Alas, there is none. Diana, please go back to your previous style! True loves make bad songwriting teams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down For Core Krall Fans","review":"This CD is a let down to core fans of Diana Krall. She has walked away from her listener base in favor of an exploratory concept in music. Too bad she has left her jazz standard abilities on the sidelines for music to satisy her intellectual curiosity. It's not like they ran out of standards for her to perform for the next 20 years. Bottom line, stick to your knitting, Diana, and dont walk away from the listeners that helped make you."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Time Only for the Girl in the Other Room","review":"Okay, this is what I get from this. It is not really bad stuff, but it's not great, either. It is sort of like a bit of Julie London and Peggy Lee with some Bill Evans style piano playing thrown in, then watered down to make it easier to digest for the pop audience. Not as terrible as some have said... but nothing I care to play more than one time. It's pretty bland for jazz in my book. The Costello-Krall songs are not well written and don't go anywhere, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krall sings Costello pretty much","review":"I have to admit I am not a Costello fan to say the least( listening to Mr. Costello sing Bacharach in his previous venture made me gag in horror) period.The single star I gave this album goes to the non-Costello influenced songs and Diana's talent for trying hard to make the quirky Costello song style work with her own.I have to say this is the BEST sounding ELVIS COSTELLO album I have heard ...thanking Diana for that and one of the worst DIANA KRALL albums ditto....thanking Mr. Costello for that....and I hope Ms. KRALL will keep her maiden name....You will not find me in the audience if DK goes on tour with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Congratulations Diana","review":"Congratulations, Diana, You have turned yourself into Norah Jones. That should sell some CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"why","review":"I just don't understand how Diana could put out an album like this. She has now become my poster child for LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY.I was especially upset that someone of her stature in the music world would title one of her cuts \\"Temptation\\". That title was already taken, many years ago. I imagine that this was the hook that got a lot of fans of her previous albums to spring for this one. Well this CD is now a coaster or maybe a frisby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble-Gum Pop, not worthy of Krall","review":"This material is meant for an artist liek Rod Stewart, and the funny thing is all teh standards he's been singing lately, belong to someone like Krall. There's been a major COSMIC SCREWING for this to happen. Too bad she didn't marry a more interesting songwriter like Alec Wilder, so at least she could plug some good songs. A genious move on her husbands part..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not hit a note with a hammer","review":"Don't waste your dime - unless you like singers with a vocal range of three always wrong notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Could Have Been Worse, I Guess.","review":"Every major artist goes through this phase. They sell a lot of product for the label and then they pretty much get to do whatever they want - at least one time. Springsteen had his Nebraska album. To this day when he plays that garbage in concert everybody takes it as a cue for a restroom break. The seats empty quickly and then they come back in when he returns to his good stuff. Diana Krall is essentially doing the same thing in the jazz context. She had to get this out of her system. Of course the added irritant of Costello didn't help.I'm sure that the very talented lady will eventually come to her senses and return to Gershwin, Porter, Kern and success.Up until now I purchased all her CDs. I'll pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's NOT Diana...","review":"I expected more,,a lot more. Boring songs..and lyrics..Live in Paris is one of the WORLD'S best recordings...The FEEL is what Diana is about.......Oh well...better luck next time..Thanks Al...You're great...Diana you are too,,not this time..Sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"On CDs, Diana Krall's greatest asset is her voice. Listening to several of her previous CDs and then to this one, I feel that asset has been severely compromised. Whereas in Live in Paris and earlier albums, the music supports the singing, here, the singing has to compete for attention. When her voice comes through clearly, the singing is as good as ever - but this is the case only in a few tracks. Overall, this CD is a tremendous letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"diana kralls best album cover","review":"I have been a huge fan of Diana Krall especially her live in paris dvd,She simply takes my breath away every time I see her perform. Anyway I bought this C.d and the great thing I can say about it is it has got a fantastic cover but fans dont be tempted to open it. These songs should have been left as test pieces in the studio. She has got enormous talent I just hope her next Album will blow me away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in the past, and hopefully again in the future","review":"Diana Krall should be credited by helping to end the obnoxious screaming and yelling that became popular with the \\"love anthems\\" of Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, and Michael Bolton in the 90s. Thank goodness that is going out of style and this new calming and romantic sound is coming into vogue.Unfortunately, this is probably a bit too watered down, introspective and muted to be exciting, passionate or particularly interesting for more than one listening. DIana's \\"Look of Love\\", \\"Love Scenes\\" and \\"Live in Paris\\" tower above this effort and I hope she gives us more of this type of brilliance again in the future.This CD is imaginative, but seems aimless and confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"flat&just kinda there","review":"Diana Krall is the kind of Artist that works best in her zone that best works to Her Playing style&Range.this album never gets going in any route that does Her Playing or voice any Justice.she is better tailored for the same route that Harry connick Jr&Norah Jones do which is fairly safe but you get at least something that has merit unlike this flat set."},{"rating":"1","title":"wont play on i touch","review":"Can only play on stereo or better players, not thru i tunes. Did not care for the musical selections even the she is my favorite female singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This collection of second rate songs is a real disappointment after the Live in Paris CD. I hope this isn't the beginning of the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to know The Girl ...","review":"With fully half the tracks being co-authored with hubby Elvis Costello, Ms. Krall steps beyond her rep as a crossover, pop-jazz cover queen. Costello's lyrics lope through the darker side of relationships, particularly on the title track. And Krall delivers with a mesmerizing melancholy, following the story lines deep into the evening shadows. As for the other six tracks, yes, the requisite torch standards are present - a sensual \\"Temptation,\\" a longing \\"Almost Blue\\" - but even the remaining covers suggest new directions for Krall. She's moving toward more contemporary writers, such as Joni Mitchell (a low, slow \\"Black Crow\\"), or Chris Smithers / Bonnie Raitt (a lusty \\"Love Me like a Man\\" that leaves no doubt as to Krall's intentions). Get to know The Girl in the Other Room; you'll wonder why you didn't do so sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krall Hits the Mark Again","review":"\\"The Girl In the Other Room\\" marks Diana Krall's first attempt at recording and performing her own music. She does not fall short in her efforts and creates a wonderful album of guaranteed new jazz classics.Krall's soothing voice fills her songs with an emotion and feeling that is indescribable except to the listener. The title track relaxes the listener while \\"Love Me Like A Man\\" and \\"I'm Coming Through\\" give a little more excitment and energy than most of the chill tracks. Highlight songs include \\"Departure Bay\\" and \\"Black Crow\\".This is a great CD and an essential one to any jazz collection. Perfect for sharing a bottle of wine with a couple of close friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl in the Other Room - Good but not great.","review":"I've been a fan of Diana Krall for about 10 years now and have all of her albums. She is a consummate jazz singer and pianist. My only real criticism of the album is that it is too subdued, almost depressing at times. I think she's at her best on lively, upbeat numbers where she can show off her jazz chops with her excellent combo mates Anthony Wilson and John Clayton. \\"Live in Paris\\" and All For You\\" are most representative of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's growing on me...","review":"Like many other fans of Diana I first felt somehow \\"disappointed\\" with this new album - the melodies are not as catchy or familiar as on her previous albums - but...many of the new songs are not only really beautiful, meaningful... they are slowly - and deeply - growing on me. Just listen to the voice and to the words and the melody will follow..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's wonderful","review":"This new CD is a masterpiece. Diana Krall at her best. My favourite song is Departure Bay. And saying she's turned into a Norah Jones \\"sing\\"alike, sorry, it's a nonsense. BUY THIS CD, you won't regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment to a Big Fan","review":"I am a loyal Diana Krall fan. I have every cd she has produced, and I play her music often. To this point, I have loved the music Diana has played. I enjoy her husky voice, and she is a first rate pianist. I love her Paris album and literally everything she has done to this point. This new cd, however, is beyond my comprehension. Maybe, as others have said, I am not a true jazz afficionado; however, I just don't get these songs. One or two seemed to have melodies, while the rest played like dirges. I was playing this cd while driving around town, and at some points I said out loud, \\"You've got to be kidding.\\" Sorry, if you are a Diana Krall fan, and I know they are legion, this cd is very different from what you are used to hearing from her. I remember something similar when Harry Connick decided to do something totally different from his old standards for which he had become famous. He, too, lost me. I'll wait for the next one and hope for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Want Some Seafood Mama!","review":"It was with great anticipation that I awaited the arrival of Diana's new CD. I'm sad to admit that I don't even feel like buying this compilation, based on the excerpts I've listened to thus far. I commend any artist who attempts to graduate from a successful genre, but in the case of Diana Krall, why she ever meandered from her jazz roots baffles me. Her piano playing is a formidable force, and her sultry voice gives her a leg up on most jazz vocalists. Perhaps her marketing team is trying to help her reach more of the masses by having her dabble in pop, but to me, its a dilution of one of the finest talents today. I'm hoping Diana, like Harry Connick Jr. will return to her jazz roots and let other pop singers satiate the bland palate of the masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"will not play on my PC or car CD player - buyer beware","review":"on this recording the folks at Verve Music Group have put some software on the CD so that when you put it into your CD-ROM the disc is identified as a data disc. You then need to run their software to be able to play it... that is fine until you have a player that also recognizes digital format discs (such as the Kenwood Z919 in my car). You put the disc in, and you get nothing as the player sees the executable file and none of the audio tracks.Thank you very much for a worthless CD... I refuse to go an buy an additional piece of hardware to be able to play this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inventory problem","review":"I ordered this CD and received one that only had an ad for the DK Club, which I gather must be the Diana Krall Club. When you click on the suggested icon you get a web site that is no longer accessible. There was no music on the CD.I returned this CD and got a replacement that was the same thing. It looks like the distributor has an inventory problem. This is not the fault of Diana Krall and I will probably order again after the faulty stock has been replaced.Amazon quickly replaced the first CD and then credited my account after I returned the second CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to listen to snappy jazz, not blues","review":"this album is a real dissapointment.

The lyrics, the music every thing about this Cd is bad. I think Diana's heart was not at all with this project, its just plain flat and hard on the ears. With Diana's previous efforts of her craft they were enjoyable because of her style of music. I hope she goes back to what works because this isn't the Diana Krall I like. This Cd was hard to listen to and I would not come back to this Cd again."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for each good song on this CD...","review":"Although I absolutely *loved* \\"Temptation\\" and \\"Narrow Daylight,\\" I found that these were the only two songs I could stomach on the entire CD. Of course, I'm no jazz fan to say the least, so this might explain my choices for best songs. I must say, though, that Diana Krall has a wonderful voice, much better suited to Blues, and it is my opinion that she shouldn't waste it on jazz (which has about as much appeal to me as rap). But that's just me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen, then listen again","review":"Unless you're a jazz vocal afficianado, which I am not, Diana Krall's music may have to grow on you. Every time I listen to this album, I like it more. And that's the way it was with the first DK album I bought. I can accept her interpretation of the jazz standards without question. With this album she's brought some of her own writing talent to the table and I happen to like it, too. Even 'Changed My Address' has become one of my favorites. Listen, then listen again. I think you'll ultimately like what you hear.WT"},{"rating":"1","title":"she dialed this one in","review":"I own all of Diana Krall's albums and have enjoyed watching her career soar. Usually the songs she sings show off her piano skills, her vocal phrasing, and her emotive abilities. This one, however, really does fall flat. The songs are forgettable - there's not one you'd find yourself humming later or belting out in the shower. Instead, they are slow and without any decisive melody. Listening to it the other night, I thought, \\"This sounds like a second-tier nightclub singer.\\" I think poor song selection is the real culprit. To this day, my favorite Diana Krall album remains \\"All for You\\", a collection of Nat King Cole tunes. Buy that one if you want to hear the real jazz that Diana Krall is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Diana","review":"Diana Krall's latest CD is, unfortunately, not in her usual exciting style. Ms Krall needs to go back to her roots--jazz and ballads--where she excels. This CD is a great disappointment to one who has all her collection and has attended a number of concerts. It is dull, it doesn't swing (as she is so capable of doing). The lyrics are not uplifting at all, and the music, although it has its moments, is not up to her past great offerings. Although I was tempted to rate this CD with one star, I gave it two, because this is Diana--still a great jazz pianist and singer. Let's hope she goes back to her 'original room.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the enhanced CD","review":"The enhanced CD will not play on a PC nor will it play on my car stero. If you want this CD, get the standard version."},{"rating":"2","title":"The start of a new era for Diana Krall?","review":"I think that this is Diana Krall's finest album to date.

The recording is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give a ZERO Star!","review":"Diana must be sleeping in the other room. This CD is weak and not pleasurable at all. Diana you should sing BOSSA NOVA. Bossa Nova fits better to your voice. Listen to Bebel Gilberto and you will see what music is about. So ZERO STAR and try to make it better next time. I have anything else to say!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Disappointed Fan","review":"I was a devoted fan of Diana's. I have all her earlier albums. But recently, I have become very disappointed with her current albums. I'am a jazz devotee. When I counted over 90 reviewers who share my disappontment with this latest album. I decided to look for an up and coming jazz vocalist who sings, plays, composes jazz and was lucky to find such a singer at the jazz festivals, I attended. Let me introduce you to Dena Derose, who I think is everything that Diana is not. \\"Love's Holiday\\" is an extremely satisfying, refreshing CD. Her signature sound is vocalizing her piano solos or scatting with her swinging piano solos. Her voice is crystalline in sound, with impeccable jazz phrasing where she can easily change keys or slide through the bars with horn-like pacing. She has an outstanding backup DeRose has arrived. I guarantee there won't be one disapointed jazz fan of Dena Derose. Win me back Diana.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a catastrophe but THIS IS NOT JAZZ","review":"Diana Krall is trying to market herself to both the NOrah Jones fans and the Alt Rock (Joni Mitchell, Elvis Costello) fans. Unfortunately this is NOT the material she should be singing. I wish she would go back to Jazz and not do Rock covers. PLEASE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The girl's got guts","review":"A departure, but a welcome one. It's brave of her not to give in to following a proven formula, and experiment with other formats, especially in a time where singing standards seems to be the surefire way to make it (could list several of the fresh crop of artists here). Rather than simply filling an album with empty but catchy tracks, she has stressed harmonic and lyrical content, resulting in a record that keeps on giving - I find something new in it at each listen. Plus, her piano-playing is far better than the previous albums, almost (though not quite) coming close to seeing her live. I'm witholding one star for some of the Krall/ Costello compositions that sound somewhat awkward as performed by Diana, but I have high hopes for their future collaborations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing CD","review":"Diana Krall should stick to what she does best, i.e. singing jazz standards, and improve on that. The recent commercial success should not lead her astray to the muddy marshes of pop music.This will probably be a cry into the wind because I expect that the marketing plague of our time, will make sure that customers will be convinced that this is a most personal and original CD and that the collaboration with Elvis Costello has resulted in an unique cross-over synergy.The bottom line is that I don't enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album I've Purchased IN YEARS!!","review":"The Girl in the Other Room is - in one word - FABULOUS. Diana Krall has always been a very talented vocalist and pianist and I have most of her other albums. And I really like them. But her latest record (Girl in the Other Room) is an entirely different thing.Krall has always, until now, pretty much been a \\"cover girl\\". Her songs have previously been covers of various jazz classics. Diana's not a \\"cover girl\\" now though. Her relationship with Elvis Costello (now her husband) has led to an unbelievably impressive musical collaboration between these two. With Diana writing the music, and Elvis doing the lyrics, Girl in the Other Room contains some of the very best songs I've heard in many years. Unbelievably intense, emotive, passionate, and downright fun-to-listen to music.Buy this album NOW..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costello is not a lyricist","review":"While Diana Krall is an amazing pianist and singer, even she needs decent material to work with. The songs on this CD were written by Elvis Costello and the lyrics remind me of children trying to make everything rhyme. Even though I am a Diana Krall fan, I had difficulty staying with this CD through the last song."},{"rating":"2","title":"new and fresh","review":"My appreciation for Diana Krall has grown over time, and I eagerly anticipated this new cd. I had a feeling it was going to be very different from her other recordings, so I wasn't surprised. As I have listened to each song, I hear more of her in them. I am a lover of the standards she normally records, but I feel as though I am getting more of a glimpse of her in these new songs. And I think it is always good when an artist shakes things up and tries new styles. To me that reveals a true artist and musician. As long as I hear her wonderful piano styles, I am happy. That's what you hear on this along with many other wonderfully talented people. If I could, I would give a standing ovation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kralling back","review":"After \\"The Look of Love,\\" it would have been easy to write Kralloff as another sellout. But she has integrity, and the proof is her new CD. Those who want her to stick with the tried-and-true are missing the point. Jazz is about two things: innovation and adventure. If you're interested in those things, check this out.If you're not, find something truly worthy of derision to complain about.

Seriously , Diana is a lucky woman.She's sings ok but her little piano playing is pitiful. She has about 3 licks that she uses over and over. Her compositions are mediocre, without any substance or form. They sound like tunes written by a bad musician in high school. Her piano was actually better when she just stayed within her tinky tinky limitations, but now, she seems to want to be a player.... too late Diana, you should have practiced when you were young. Why don't you hire a real piano player ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"Remember the scene in the Nicholas Cage movie \\"Bringing Out the Dead\\" where the old man is dying and they play him his favorite Sinatra to soothe him during his last moments?

It's not romantic at all; it doesn't flow from one song to the next; and the singing and lyrics are awful. There is one nice ballad, \\"Narrow Daylight,\\" but I'm way past buying a CD for just one song.

Stick with the old standards which you do so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak CD","review":"I'm a huge fan of Diana Krall. I own all of her other CDS and love them all. This CD is just a huge disappointment. After listening to it 4 times, I cannot find one song that I really enjoy. I'm not sure if this is because Elvis Costello, her husband, wrote/cowrote 7 of the 12 tracks. I'm not a Costello fan, so I cannot say if these songs are like his other music--but it certainly is lacking the enjoyability of hers. True fans will buy this CD, but if you are new to Diana Krall's music, I would steer clear of this CD and get one of her previous ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did hooking up with Elvis do this?....","review":"Has Diana's marriage to Elvis Costello caused this terrible songwriting to emerge from one of my favorite artists?

I had such an expectation from her. Through the years, I've noticed her decline in her jazz roots. I can't believe what kind of stunts she was pulling on this CD. How horrific! I liked ONE song...and even that one song (\\"Love Me Like a Man\\") doesn't compare to the standards she is so good at signing and reinterpreting.Don't buy this CD unless you want horrible songwriting or you want to set a depressing mood in your home with the song selections.DIANA, GO BACK TO JAZZ...forget this songwriting business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Different but not Very Good","review":"I really like Diana Krall's music and her intepretations of jazz classics. This album is supposed to be based on her life experiences, at least that was what she said in her interview about the album. It is the first album of hers that I regretted purchasing. It has one song that would be good as an instrumental but it is so unmemorable that I forgot the name. My musical tastes are very eclectic but this collage of music has no snap, none the pizazz of her previous albums, and it is frankly, just plain boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's back to her gutsy simplicity.","review":"I've been disappointed with her last few \\"albums.\\" They were too safe, too commercial, and too orchestral.

The Girl In The Other Room brings back the special sound of Diana Krall."},{"rating":"1","title":"an unpleasant surprise","review":"I should preface my review by saying that I'm a huge fan of Diana Krall. I appreciate her musicanship and the brilliance of her previous albums.That being said, *The Girl in the Other Room* just doesn't stack up to her other work. The musicans on the album are still great (as before), but so much is missing from this album. Diana Krall is just confusing her *brand* with this one. It sounds more like Costello, and less like Krall. Not to say that Costello is bad, but I purposely bought a Diana Krall CD, and I don't feel that I got what I paid for. Besides a couple nice tracks (like *Temptation* & *Love Me Like A Man*), it's really not jazz at all, and the lyrics are abstract not thought-provoking.It only gets two stars because for the first time ever, I have to skip tracks on a Diana Krall CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Diana?","review":"After Live in Paris I was so excited to get this album. What a waste of my money. Unfortunatley you can't get refunds on opened music. Elvis Costello..well..lets just say..if this is supposed to be great music, I'll never buy music again!

Go back to your own style Diana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very interesting.","review":"Regardless of genre, the music and lyrics of this album just aren't as interesting, fun, touching... as other songs she's performed in the past. She also tries some different vocal stylings, and I think they tend to sound forced -- and they clash with her otherwise smooth style. It's not that she shouldn't do originals at all, she just needs better originals to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Let-Down & Disbelief","review":"Please Come Back, Diana!!!We waited so long only to be completely disappointed. Stick to the real music of old standards which your sultry voice and over -the -top piano talent, turn into mesmerizing renditions that renew and maintain classic power.Please don't let yourself be changed by the influence of your husband's so-called music.\\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" is not you !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ATYPICAL KRALL","review":"THIS IS CLEARLY NOT THE KRALL I AM USED TO OR EXPECTED ON THIS CD.ON MOST TRACKS IT SEEMS AS IF SHE TOOK A PARAGRAPH FROM A MICKEY SPILANE NOVEL AND TRIED TO ADD MUSIC TO IT. IT DOESNT WORK. MELODIES ARE HARD TO FOLLOW, LYRICS (BY THE WAY, ARE WRITTEN BY HER NEW SPOUSE, ELVIS COSTELLO???)MAKE LITTLE SENSE.KRALL, LET'S GET BACK TO COVERING THE STANDARDS LIKE YOU DO SO WELL WITH YOUR BAND. UNTIL THEN, YOU ARE OFF OF MY BUY LIST.GORDON"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the music you come from?","review":"I can't find any reason to buy this record. Well, I admit that there could be some, but for each one there's a latent disappointment in \\"The Girl In The Other Room\\".You can buy it because you're a fan of Diana Krall.. But you won't find here the atmospheres of \\"The Look Of Love\\", or the fantastic swing of her \\"Live In Paris\\". Jazz is almost completely forgotten here, and that's bad because she's a good pianist (I don't like her voice) and what made her famous (added to her eyes..) is her abilities with jazz improvisation.But you could maybe be a fan of Elvis Costello (who co-wrote some of the original tracks) but I don't think that's enought to spend that sum to buy this record, honestly.I listened to it because I enjoyed her live disc. But this has been a great disappointement. I won't suggest you to not buy this, but.. listen to it before buying it. And compare it to the same kind of music made by artists who have experienced it in their whole career.M."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read the reviews -","review":"Real dissapointment. I loved her other CD's and bought this one without listening to it first or reading the other reviews. This one is very, very different. I don't even find it good background music. I just want to get away from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sultry Sounds of Diana Krall","review":"This was an exellent collection of songs that moves Diana Krall toward a more contemporary sound. Her jazz roots still remain, but she cuts it loose by crossing musical boundaries by sounding much like Joni Mitchell, Phoebe Snow, and Norah Jones. With her musical collaboration with Elvis Costello, there are inklings of her using a vocal style similar to Costello's, such as the song, Love Me Like a Man.Nevertheless, this album really jazzes-up Krall's music a bit more. There are quiet moments, but very atmospheric and may create a sort of imagery with the tracks, Black Crow and Departure Bay. This is a recommended disc for jazz lovers and those who want to sample contemporary jazz music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even great musicians ocassionally lay an eqq!","review":"I have all of her Verve recordings. They have all be excellent, until this one; The musicianship and production on this album are outstanding (typical Verve), but the material is weak. One would think with some of the best musicians in the buisiness one couldn't go wrong. Oh well, I hope she makes a strong come back on her next album and that she doesn't let Elvis drag her down."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE THE PICTURE OF CD , NO THE ALBUM.","review":"I LOVE DIANA KRALL, I HAVE MOST OF HER CDS THIS IS ONE OF HER NOT THAT GREAT WORK. nothing special keep listening the \\" Look of Love \\" album . the picture looks like a great album but is just boring ,she makes albums like every year too fast ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Declan please stop influencing her!","review":"Diana is a great piano player and he is a great writer. (the latter has never been proven to me) I don't LOVE her voice at the best of times, but on this album she sounds really bad. The lyrics are terrible too. If Declan is such a talented writer, he sure isn't instructing his amateur wife very well. Diana needs to get back to her roots, forget her over-inflated ego husbands desperate attempt at horning in on her career, and do what she does best, playing the piano and singing low bluesy songs. I love DK, but this album makes me wish I was a downloader. If only he was as great as they think he is. Maybe she should hire her 'best friend' Elton JOHN's friend Bernie Taupin and fire the guy she lives with. I really think she believes Declan is an assett to her if he involves himself in her music, I hope this makes her think twice about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl In the other room, lock the door and don't come out!!","review":"It's seems like her CD was majorly influenced by Elvis's style. Not like the old Diana at all. Very disappointed in this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrics Are Better, But Music Still Lacks Depth & Emotion","review":"Again, Krall has put together a compilation of songs about love and life, but again does not include the most important factor in music: emotion. Her voice is much the same as someone speaking the poems with an orchestra in the background. I know she must have the ability to express emotion with her voice (and it would sound great if she did), but I've yet to hear it. I have listened to this CD along with \\"The Look of Love\\" and it all is basically coffee shop background music- nothing more. I'm not impressed by this artist in the slightest and am starting to wish that Limewire was legal so I can avoid wasting my money in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like her, but she has no vocal range","review":"remember when Joe Piscipo imitated Sinatra & everything sounded the same ?he could do the same with her. She's attractive, great at the piano, should hire a vocalist. I've never heard her cover an octave. To be fair I did give up listening to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful and beautiful - her best yet!","review":"I was surprised that CD didn't get very high reviews. True, it is a different from her previous stuff, so if that is what you are looking for in this CD, you might be disappointed. However, I love all of Diana's previous music, and I thought this CD was her best yet. It's more jazzy than her previous \\"mainstream\\" type music. Most of the songs are slower, soulful and smooth, unlike some of her more upbeat songs in the past, but she does it well. Also, she wrote several of the tracks on this CD, including The Girl in the Other Room (title song) and Almost Blue, which are very \\"jazzy\\" and great songs. Departure Bay and Narrow Daylight are just beautiful songs, too. I love every single song on this CD, and I've listened to it almost exclusively since I got it. Do yourself a favor and give it try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pianist or Vocalist?","review":"Not one of my favorite Krall recordings. Her singing voice may be an acquired taste. In my opinion she's a far better pianist than vocalist. Better that she stick to piano with the occasional vocal thrown in. Barbara Carroll, who's singing voice is also an acquired taste (which I have to say I acquired years ago) has it about right. Diana Krall should steer away from this stype of recording. I've played my copy of this CD only once and that's more than enough for me. To each his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED AND UPSET","review":"After \\" LIVE IN PARIS \\",her best album in my opinion,how could Diana make this horrible album.Has Costello influenced her so much that she literally forgot her jazz?Her marvelous talent as a jazz player was totally abandoned in this CD.At least the band is always very good. Great musicians!Hope it gets much better for the next album!Go for it, Diana!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diana Costello is the attraction..","review":"This is the best Krall CD since her first. At last she is doing something different and interesting. Her last two studio CD's were really good at putting me to sleep because they were too smooth and over produced. This is an excellent production with very smart jazz/blues tunes. The only problem I have is that its like listening to an Elvis Costello CD.Dont get me wrong Elvis Costello is an excellent song writer and has produced some excellent music, but his voice really gets overpowering like a knife scratching on a dinner plate. Hearing Diana's voice taking his place is a breath of fresh air, but I cant give it five stars because of the Costello style being coppied. Anyway for music I give it 90% and sound it gets 92%."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Justify the Hype","review":"After hearing so many great things about her, I finally decided to purchase my first Diana Krall CD. Perhaps this offering wasn't a good place to start because I was unimpressed. I thought the production and lyrics were solid....the problem for me was Ms Krall's singing. I found Krall's vocal delivery emotionless, dry and weak. I did find two songs pleasant, but that was not enough to justify more than one star. While I applaud Ms Krall for being instrumental in revitialing the vocal jazz scene, I am sorry that I'm not a fan of her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"l love it! A great Krall-Costello creation....","review":"Jeesh, what is all the negativity about? i picked up a copy of diana's new cd at costco thinking it would make yummy post-wedding background music. a few songs were so sad and lamenting, i had to listen to them again. then when i thought of elvis costello's idiosyncratic style of songwriting, i listened to her songs in a different way. IF YOU CAN APPRECIATE ELVIS COSTELLO'S MUSIC THEN YOU CAN LOVE THIS ALBUM, AS WELL. my favorite song is 'Departure Bay' and 'Abandoned Masquarade'. Please DON'T honor the negative press until you just sit back and take it all in. it is so beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl in the other room","review":"A must, for any high end sound system.Great selections well put together album.Diana, the best always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off Ramp","review":"I have been a Diana Krall fan since before she was cool. I Have every one of her CDs., DVDs. I have several CDs sitting atop my CD Player for frequent play - most of Krall's other works, Ella Fitzgerald, Dave Brubeck, Miles, Norman Brown, Coltrane, Stacey Kent. But this one will go into the CD binder, and, unfortunately, probably won't come back out. There's not much here. No groove, no swing, no moving ballads. She left her chops at home on this one. Disappointed to be sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not stick to jazz?","review":"Diana has been consistent with each album until her latest. Don't understand why she has bothered to select these songs but I guess her knight in shining armor might have affected her judgment. No doubt this will be a phase and she will return to the likes of \\"Cry me a river\\", \\"Besame mucho\\" and many other good songs.Still, I will cherish her elegance and tastefulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing...","review":"... and, unfortunately, this thing swings about as much as Ben Stein on 'ludes. My advice to Diana: don't allow yourself to become influenced by Elvis Costello's vision of what direction you should take your music and get back to what people have come to expect from you - don't fall into the trap of becoming a self-indulgent artiste. Your fanbase really isn't interested in listening to Tom Waits, Joni Mitchell or, for that matter, Elvis Costello interpretations. My advice to you: don't waste your money - this disc is nothing more than a misguided attempt at becoming hip with the Elvis Costello crowd. Perfect for slingshot practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Girl in the other room is Dena Derose","review":"I'm sorry but this latest DK album is so boring The performer is meant to breathe life and joy and pain into these songs. Diana Krall is just the opposite of that. Her voice is lifeless, her phrasing, liltless and uninspired . I love jazz, but I guess the reason Diana Krall is so successful is because, she is becoming \\"jazz' for the masses. If you're a Diana Krall fan, you should probably pass on this one. I thought it was a bad choice of songs. S'boring. NOW IF YOU WANT snappyy, upbeat, Jazz Standards from the Great American Song Book, updated and sung like no one else, listen to DENA DEROSE \\"Love's Holiday\\" or any of her albums. \\"Love's Holiday,\\" is a delightful collection of standards and two originals that showcases her versatility, resourcefulness and genuine talent.? She's great on standards that have been masterfully arranged here, including \\"Close Your Eyes\\" (from which the album title is taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destined for the trade-in pile","review":"Some CDs you love instantly, others have to grow on you. After my first listen I thought this was one of the latter but after my third listen I'm beginning to doubt it. 'Girl in the Other Room' is largely a collection of ballads that are, as another reviewer put it, tedious. The voice is as sultry as ever and, as usual, Krall does nicely interpreting works of others like the opening track 'Stop this World.' But sorely missing are the straight ahead, uptempo numbers featuring Msrs. Clayton & Hamilton as well as Diana's solos, which I always felt were underappreciated. I've enjoyed her experimentation with different styles and arrangements in the past but this CD will not occupy a permanent place in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"sell out sell out sell out!!! I knew she would","review":"Just like Harry Connick Jr, Robert Gordon, Tony Bennett(Playin' with my friends, and KD lang duet cd), Brian Setzer, BB KIng(Eric Clapton duet cd) and even Jane Monheit, she SOL OUT!!! I knew when she married a rock star things would change, and Diana knows a gold mine wehn she see's one, too bad she coudl have been the next Ella Fitzgerald... she BLEW it big time. These sonsg are not timeless, but I know she is trying to do something like Norah Jones, but people are to used to her doing classy thinsg like Nat Cole tributes, each cd she releases seems to be gettign more and more commercial. However the cd Look of love was her last exellent one. OK Diana now to make up for this awful cd, you owe us a Fats Waller Songbook, tribute to Fats Waller, you can sing obscure Fats tunes like A Porter's Lovesong to A Chambermaid... skip this one, and cross your fingers... seems there wil lnever be a young jazz singer, who won't sell out... too bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope this is not a sign of things to come!!","review":"I know that musicians like to branch out, try different things. This is how they evolve and change. However this is certainly not Diana's best work. Let Elvis write his songs and sing his way and Diana you stick with what you are best at. I am glad this is not her first recording. The CD is not without its good points, but not what I really want when I buy a Dianna Krall CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't see this movie yet, but","review":"please at least get the date that it was made right.

The source material of all Oracle books is ultimately the documentation, but these guys seem to have done a very good job of extracting what we need from the docs and presenting it in a useful form. The title is \\"Reference\\", so of course it will duplicate some Oracle material. To me, it looks like the init.ora chapter is pretty close to the docs, but they did cut out some unecessary words, and I'm not sure I could write those (boring) descriptions any better than Oracle already did, so why take a chance on introducing new errors? I think the book deserves 5 stars and the reviews that rate it low don't understand its purpose or have unrealistic expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can not agree that a good admin book could be like this","review":"I can not believe that a good database administration book could give Oracle Enterprise Manager only two pages (page 173 to 174) plus three line on page 172."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corrections and recommendations needed.","review":"We r trying to upgrade from 8.0.5 to 8.1.5 and this book was not helpful. It contains hundreds of pages copied directly from the Oracle 8.0 documentation which we already had. Usually the copied text is changed very slightly like adding or removing commas. For some reason the recommendations Oracle gives are not always copied into the book so sometimes you r left with explanations from Oracle without the matching recommendation.Hopefully the authors will post corrections somewhere. They've managed to copy in some of Oracle's errors as well as adding in their own like calling CTXSYS a \\"demo account\\". They should try dropping it and seeing how their context applications start failing. Bottom line this isn't essential it's sometimes wrong and for r upgrade it wasn't even helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disapointing book from O'Reilly","review":"Beside the fact the book is made from Oracle documentation (thanks God for cut-and-paste), which is by the way available on their web site for free, this book may be suitable for very junior DBAs. There is almost nothing inside which can be used in real DBA's life - explanations are too shallow and few available scripts can't help much.

Vincent Cassel has managed to break from his usual renaissance/midieval character and plays the part of a cajun-frenchman quite well. Yes, it does lack in narrative skill, however it is quite pleasing to the eye. A cast consisting of actors whose parts tend to be those more out of the norm, it qualifies as a cultish-type flick.

The last time I watched it I fast forwarded through the slow parts, stopping at the key plot elements, and also stopping to savour the trippy parts.

As a mystic and philosopher, he summons up in Anam Cara (soul friend) ancient Celtic wisdom written in the bones of Western culture. A new voice has emerged to take its place beside that of Deepak Chopra. I recommend this book of essays to those who seek wisdom and inspiration in today's fast-paced world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book for my soul","review":"It's a book for the soul -- for my soul. When my friend recommended the book, I first got the sample e-version and began reading. Immediately I wanted to highlight passages that moved me but it wasn't possible for sample versions. I wanted more of the Anam Cara wisdom so I purchased the book. Before I knew it, I was quoting right and left and people that I would share the anam cara wisdom would end up buying the book. One reminiscent of Gibran's The Prophet -- the type that you keep going back to as it teaches you about how to go through life and love. It is a wise purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meditative resource","review":"This little book is a wonderful resource for someone who wishes to contemplate life, death, love, friendship, time...and what is meaningful to the individual. The suggestion of \\"stillness\\" is wise. O'Donohue makes his insights understandable and useable. You can pick this book up anywhere and feel uplifted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"Being an incurable celtophile, I bought this book in hopes that it would contain a good basic introduction to the Celtic concept of Anam Cara. However, what I found upon reading was that this book was in actuality little more than a somewhat postmodern primer on neoplatonism and New Age philosophy.Interspersed with a few interesting tidbits of Irish folklore and even less historical study, what the author most often cites are classical philosophers and mystics like Plato, Plotinus, Augustine, John Cassian, Meister Eckhart, Buddhist writings, (none of whom qualify as Celtic, interestingly), in addition to a smattering of modern Irish writers who shed no particular light on the concept referred to in the title of this book.Cahill's _How the Irish Saved Civilization_ was a much more helpful, instructive, and, may I say honest, book, in that it actually delivered what it promised. I truly wish I could say the same for O'Donohue's _Anam Cara_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miraculous","review":"Sometimes in life, through mysterious ways unknown to man, things are brought to you and you can either discard them as trash or as little miracles.\\"Anam Cara: The Celtic Book of Wisdom,\\" is such a miracle, recommended to me by a dear friend, the book has opened my eyes to many truths and insight. It is rare that a book will come to be know as something as important as say a religious book like the Bible. This book is that important to me. It will share a spot on my nightstand with my Bible for many years to come and I look forward to rereading it over and over again.No matter what your faith or upbringing, this book will give you amazing knowledge and truth.To my friend Michael, that recommended it to me, I say thank you Anam Cara, and I truly hope everyone is as blessed as I was and am to have read it.

Even if you aren't interested in the celtic way of life, it will open you up to a whole new look on yourself and your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"This book really wasn't worth the effort. Author O'Donohue repeated simplistic assertions such as \\"The body is made of clay\\" or \\"Silence is good\\" ad naseum, tying these trite platitudes together with meandering stories about this-old-woman-in-Ireland, etc. Not exactly the wisdom of the ages. I found about six worthy sentiments in the entire book (for example, the idea that each of us carries a complete world inside ourselves was intriguing), but sieving those thoughts out of the rest of the text was a boring process."},{"rating":"1","title":"nonsense","review":"I don't like to write this review without reading the entire book, but I cannot justify spending the time to read beyond the prologue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!!!","review":"I settled in with this book to explore the thoughts and feelings of the Celtic experience. Perhaps I was asking for too much from such an interesting title. Basically trees were cut down to produce a \\"book\\" of tired dribble on stars, moon light, early mornings and the like. I got 234 pages of rubbish. It was a 1990's version of 1960's flower power. The author certainly has a way with words (what Irishman doesn't) but his talent was wasted (as was my money!!)

As for the song itself, so what if it's cliched? It's a great summertime/dance song and if cliches were outlawed from pop music, than Billboard would be hard pressed to find anything to put on their charts! Just go with it and have fun.

It only shows how to display hard coded values like #fieldname# not query. and then the dynamic name. There was no mention of columnlist after your query or anything.

It comes in a box set as indicated, which includes the 3 discs, A PSP movie (its only for Japanese PSPs though so you cant play it if you bought yours here) and a little thank you note with a booklet or something. Pretty much the only usable thing in the package is the CD, but its still good. If you can find the CD by itself, then I say buy that instead, but for what its worth, this is a pretty good CD.

Always dependable, did most everything we required of it. Then my nephew bumped it off the coutertop (it was a high countertop). We ordered another one and it took over where the other left off. The only reason I didn't give it a five is due to the fact that the discs are not as heavy on this one as on the previous unit, so we're using the old discs and container from the previous one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart DLC-5","review":"Our first cuisinart lasted over 20 years, and we bought this only because we couldn't get blades for the old one. If the motor in this is as good as the old one we'll be very happy. It does exactly what it should do, simply, quickly, efficiently ... and reliably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I'm a Believer","review":"When my girlfriend recieved this for her birthday (she's a long time believer in the Cuisinart) I knew it would be an upgrade from my modest hand me down food processor, but I was blown away. First off it weighs a ton, which really means something with motors. The weight was put to good use, as it effortlessly mowed through food, and it did so with a delicacy that makes food so enjoyable (I ate enough pulverized crap as an infant, so I appreciate foods with texture, and the sharp blades make sure things stay the way they should). I never thought the difference between a regular food processor and a Cuisinart would be so dramatic, but it is. The 7 cup capacity is easily sufficient for a couple adults (I imagine you could throw in a few kids for good measure), and the included blades tend to most uses. It can allegedly do a good job mixing cakes and kneading dough, and based on its overall performance, I believe it, but I'd rather use my Kitchenaid mixer for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I bought this food processor a year ago.I never thought that I'll be using it so frequently. It reduces so much work in the kitchen. I wish that it had little more capacity.9 0r 11 cups will be ideal.I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unpleasent surprise","review":"Beware, as of 2/2/07 Cuisinart does not offer extra blade/disk options for the DLC-5 models. You only get the sizes that come, NO EXPANSION options (6mm, 2mm, French fry, fine grater, dough blade, etc).I received the DLC-5 as a gift and was very excited the first time I used it. It cut great, was powerful, and easy to clean. I decided that I wanted a thicker cut for my carrots. I went online to find a disk/blade and discovered that there are NONE offered. Other models have plenty of options available.Now I'm in a dead end. Does anybody know a work around?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart LC 7 cup food processor","review":"This was a replacement for the same item which no longer operated. The new one is fine and works well"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I LOVE my new food processor! It chops, grates, and slices to perfection! Why then, did I not give it 5 stars? Well, the feeding tube is an oval shape, which most foods are not, so usually I have to cut them before feeding them into the food processor. Also, when emptying the contents, the chopping blade has to be removed by hand or it will fall, endangering fingers and toes! Otherwise, it is an excellent machine, and for this price, you cannot turn it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe a little small","review":"From the makers of the original home food processors, it's maybe a little small for some tasks, but for most food processor needs it does the job perfectly and takes up little space compared to much bigger processors.The negative soup comments are off base because you shouldn't be pureeing soup in a food processor, that's what the blender is for. Each kitchen item has it's proper uses and though there is some overlap, if you own them, you should always use the best tool for the job.This is your homemade mayonaise machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kitchen Must Have!","review":"This is my second food processor, same model, gave my other to my son.

Boy, did I make a mistake on this one, I guess you get what you pay for.While it does well slicing, using it to make sauces or doughs leaves a lot to be desired. There is absolutely no seal between the bowl and the lid - if you put any liquid or flour in the bowl and turn it on, it comes flying out the sides and top. Not only does this make a mess, but it screws up the proportions in your recipes.If you are going to invest in a food processor, I would choose either the very well rated Kitchen Aid or one of the more expensive Cuisinarts (perhaps the classics or the power preps)...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine","review":"I love this food processor! It's fast and very quiet. Slicing and grating has never been so easy and fun! However, I ordered two of the accessory discs listed in the page and was very disappointed when they arrived because they are not compatible to this processor. The stems on the discs for this machine are not removable and the other blades require a removable stem. So beware if you want to order additional discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"DLC-5 Disappointment","review":"A Krups owner for over 20 years, I recently bought the Cuisinart DLC-5 at the bargain price (...) Although described on the exterior of the box as having a 7-cup capacity , the instructions inside caution the user to use no more than 2-3 cups of liquid for any single processing operation. I used one cup of liquid. At high speed (the only one other than pulse on this model) most of the liquid spewed out of the bowl and onto the walls and countertop. I repeated the operation in case I hadn't engaged all the necessary parts. Same result. Clearly there is something wrong when the listed and recommended capacities are at variance with each other. The fact that a 7-cup bowl can't handle a single cup of liquid merely adds to the suspicion that Cuisinart is aware of a design flaw and is now offloading DLC-5 stock at an apparent bargain price. It's no bargain. I've gone back to Krups."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"I grew up as a kid watching this amazing horse. I could not wait to watch this movie.

The creators of this fine work of art treated their subject matter seriously. There was no slapstick comedy where it didn't belong; there was no silliness. Except for that golfing sequence.... It was a good movie experience.I watched only one of the special features, \\"Heart of a Champion,\\" and I found it just about as good as the regular feature, though it was only fifteen minutes long. It shows comments from the persons involved with the movie, and it has a good amount of footage of the real Secretariat, his races, and the real humans involved with him.When Secretariat was racing, I couldn't help noticing the publicity, but I wasn't interested in horseracing. Until watching this movie and its special-feature I didn't really know what this extraordinary creature was all about. Now I do.I look forward to reading the book by William Nack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie and wonderful cinematics","review":"This was a good movie even though everyone probably knows the climax of the movie.

Mostly it works, with a decent cast and some fantastic camera work at the horse races. It is also an interesting story for anyone to watch; you do not need to be a fan of racing to enjoy it.The part where Sec is being born is unintentionally funny because the little foal bangs right into the camera, which you can hear going \\"clunk.\\" Hilarious!

I have a great fan of Diane Lane and John Malkovich and both of them are brilliant in this movie. The film is very thoughtful and touches on one important social theme, women's liberation. But it does so in a wonderfully subtle manner. I love the racing sequences especially the last one. This is a good movie for all to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secretariat","review":"I watched this awesome horse win the triple crown that year. I had never seen a horse lead so far ahead of the pack. He had heart and it showed. I don't think I ever watched him run a dull race it was always exciting to watch this marvelous horse. The movie does him proud. I've already got it on my Netflix queue to watch again.

It is an outrage to not have this included in the extras for this DVD, and a criminal act to have no footage of the real Secretariat at all. I assume that one of the motivations of Randall Wallace, et. al. in making this was to introduce him to young people, but the archiving of this film with nothing else means Secretariat is no more real to my eight year old horse-loving daughter than Mr. Ed is.I enjoyed the movie in the theater - despite a few contrivances, it was marvelous to watch a movie where none of the characters are evil. It should be rented only - Disney should be punished in the marketplace for such lazy packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Race Horse to Ever Live","review":"I guess you could say I love horse movies.

It was as I feared it would be: a production by the Walt Disney factory with pretty horses, wan and wimpy humans, and a story that seemed not to know where it wanted to go. No competition to the hearty, well-told (even with flaws), beautifully and strongly photographed tale of the little horse that could. Another flabby reworked story from Disney... too bad, it could have been a great movie. The bones were there, but no meat. How sad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Inaccurate","review":"This is truly a Disney movie. A nice family movie as long as you don't know anything about horse racing. The only thing that was accurate about this movie was that Secretariat won the Triple Crown! The storyline is really about Penny Chenery's journey and I know they have to bend the truth a little to tell the story in a couple hours. But, the true story is truly exciting; why screw it up so much?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting a percentage will make you lie","review":"Saw a youtube interview with Bill Nack, the author from whose book this supposedly \\"true story\\" movie was based. In it he admits to greatly liking the movie and having fallen a bit in love with Diane Lane during his stint as film advisor. I believe the falling in love part, but if he truly liked this movie he must not think much of his book, because it's everything this movie is not. I guess it's hard to bite the hand that feeds him, no matter how much he'd like to. If he could, I think we would have seen some unbelievable fangs. When I watched this film, all I did was count the untruths and half-truths throughout, so I can just imagine what Mr. Nack went through. That's no way to watch a movie, so my question is this: Why change the truth when the true story is why you want to make the film in the first place? My advice is to save your money and read Nack's book. The picture in your head will be ten times more enjoyable than anything you'll see on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOORING","review":"Great if you are on a transatlantic flight & can't sleep on planes.

I thought Seabiscuit was a better movie, as it was more about the horse (regardless of a couple of minor mistakes) and how all the \\"players\\" came together at a time in our history when the people needed inspiration.I remember when Secreatariat was racing and it was exciting to see a Triple Crown winner after 25 years! I thought the acting by Diane Lane was superb! She should have been nominated for an Academy Award!!The bottom line is that I thought it was a good movie and I will buy the DVD... but Seabiscuit is still tops!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Secretariat deserves better than this movie","review":"Secretariat was a wonder of nature. Watching him run gave me goose bumps.Why did it take so long for someone to make a move about this magnificent horse? Considering the quality of this movie, they should have waited longer. This movie was not about the horse but his owner. Secretariat was, and is, exciting enough for the entire plot. Why dilute the plot with the owner's \\"story\\"?It was poorly edited. The plot was sort of slowly moving along and suddenly Secretariat was being called the wonder horse. There was certainly nothing in the movie that justified that title at this point in the movie.Even the cinematography was poor to average.I agree with most of the oomments made by the 1-star and 2-star reviewers. And did trainers and grooms of high priced thououghbreds really use hay nets?I was disappointed.

We all had fun and after the show, we were talking and she put her arm under mine, and I took it as a sign that she wanted me to hold her hand, so I did and she got excited. She told me later that she was just doing an elbow hook as a chummy-friendly way of getting warm because it was a cold night.

I saw all three races in the 70's and it was awesome first time around. Awesome watching the movie too.The characters are stilted & predicatable & pretty forgettable....except for Penney. The kids in her family don't seem to age very much despite the chronological progression. How neat is that.It's too bad the horse's dam doesn't get more kudos for his successes, all I hear is Bold Ruler this, Bold Ruler that, and from what I've read, he wasn't that great.Phrases like \\"in foal\\" not \\"pregnant.\\" And it's a \\"boy\\"....no. It's a stud colt. That's horseman lingo. >cringe<The race at Belmont is thrilling, but then comes this \\"O Happy Day\\" music??? Religious overtones, notching Secreteriat to the level of a deity?

I actually enjoy when films like this are Hollywoodized, with a little extra drama added to the story, making it more interesting (and historically incorrect, I know, but much more interesting to watch... I don't go to the movies for a history lesson). I was disappointed that there was no real \\"drama\\" - horse racing is always a gamble, and Penny Chenery was no exception; she just happened to get lucky this time.And the movie is nearly 2 hours long - much longer than it needed to be.If you need an inspiring horse racing flick, Seabiscuit is much better (check out Rotten Tomatoes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is a bunch of horse you-know-what","review":"A 10 year old could have done a better job directing. It's *sort* of about a horse, it's *sort* about an owner, it's *sort* about the comeback of trainer, but only skims all of them while indulging us in none. You can't blame the cast - these people are good, yet completely disengaged while on screen. Malkovich is hurrying through it as if he's got something better to do (he probably did!) and Ozzy Ozborn would have been more convincing as the owner than Diane Lane. A complete disservice dealt to the greatest racehorse that ever lived. Watch Seabiscuit instead. That was excellent and everything this should have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"An idiot could see that the DVD was scratched","review":"DVD was listed as being in good condition, but after two players and a disk cleaning it still did not work. Why did I even try to clean it, it was obviously scratched beyond being functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound quality","review":"I ordered this tape in February. Summer is a bad time for me to watch DVD's.Finally open and tried to watch Secretariat. The sound was so low I couldn'tmake out the words. Tried to adjust it and was unable to. Checked DVD playerand all OK. You can only return it within 30 days so I'm stuck with a worthless DVD. I should have checked the return for exchange policy beforeI ordered this, or checked it when I received it. Will know better in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really about the horse","review":"I'm a big fan of Secretariat but this is a movie about Penny Tweedy and Secretariat, how their lives touched. I liked the storyline: that you can make your dream come true but the title isn't true. Secretariat's career wasn't followed to the end, the movie touches on the fact that he was smart and that he had a huge heart but the race footage wasn't real. They only used bits of the original footage for the Preakness. The Wood, the Derby and (worst of all) the Belmont were all fake, not him. For real information about Secretariat, the horse, I'd recomend Bill Nack's book. Let me also say I felt the same way about Seabiscuit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad history","review":"Secretariat was undoubtedly one of the greatest race horses in American history, and thus the telling could not miss as a great story, especially for anyone who loves horses. But this movie by Disney Studios is just plain stupid and factually absurd. Please read Nack's book! Penny Tweedy was no great saint, and she had little to do with the horse's success. Her husband was no villain, nor was her brother! Stupid Disney mess as always, and with a truly great story! - this movie offends horse people. Just like \\"8 under\\" - a historical mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secretariet by Diane Lane","review":"Having seen Secretariet run during his life, I was a little leary of how they would prsent this movie.I was so impressed after seeing it that I ordered it from Amazon. I will never forget his biggest race when he moved out of the backfield and began his own race! To see that big red horse coming down the stretch was almost too much thrill! It was totally awesome! I love the movie!Marilyn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Movie","review":"Ok Ok I know it's not 100% factually accurate and all that stuff -- but this movie is really really exciting. It is well filmed and I think the excitement is really intense. I love the beginning with the quote from the Book Of Job. I think this is the type of movie where you just sit back and enjoy pure entertainment and it's not really all that far off -- Secretariat was the greatest racehorse of all time and he won the Triple crown -- this movie shows that and the acting is really good. I love the scenes from my hometown -- Virginia -- we may not be quite as race-saavy as Kentucky but yes, we love horses too! At any rate, my kids and I absolutely love this movie -- a moving tribute to the greatest racehorse of all time -- from Virginia I might add -- Secretariat, Big Red!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Big Sap for a Horse Story","review":"I've seen the film at least 10 times and I heartily and almost to a word agree with everything that has been written by the other 5 Star reviews. All I can add is that I scream at my 55\\" Large Screen TV \\"Go Secretariat, Go!\\" and cry like a sap every time I hear Penny yell \\"Let'em run Ronnie, let'em run\\" and see that horse make the last turn on his path to victory and history at the Belmont Stakes. I mean every time.I called my girlfriend and briefly discussed the film with her. A major stoic, she said that she cries too and I asked her why? Before she had an opportunity to respond I said \\"Perhaps it's because we witness something perfect of heroic proportions doing something it was designed by God to do flawlessly with all of its heart and being.\\" All she could do is agree.Thank you Disney for this wonderful film in spite of any literary license you may have taken to get the point across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddie Sweat had the true connection to Secretariat","review":"I was unimpressed with this movie. The title character was more of a prop for the Penny Tweedy character. Penny Tweedy was Disneyized into something she was not; the reality is she was a woman of wealth who grew up in the horse industry, not a \\"simple housewife\\" who had a special bond with Secretariat. At the end of the movie, a beautiful black and white portrait of Eddie Sweat with Secretariat was shown. Theirs was the true story; Eddie's bond with this amazing animal was of the heart. A film honoring the Secretariat/Eddie story would have been powerful and inspirational, two things that this movie was not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horses","review":"A picture for the whole family, beautiful scenery, extraordinary horse and a woman who believed in that horse. A worthwhile watch with actors who were meant to play the roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie of 2010","review":"This is a GREAT movie. I cannot understand why it didn't get more nominations or wins for Oscars. The photography, acting and subject matter were superior. I truly enjoyed this movie far more than I expected. Diane Lane and John Malkovich were terrific as was the supporting cast. Kudos to Disney!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Diane Lane","review":"I love horses and I love Diane Lane. Great picture, loved it from the opening credits to the roll of the final credits. Nicely done, great acting, engaging story and wonderful story that needed to be told. This is a Disney film all the way, no nasty or foul language, everyone keeps their clothes on and a moral to boot. If you love horses, good stories or Diane Lane:) Get this. I live only 20 mins away from The Meadow, I remember the house and the fenced fields, the picture was very true on recreating that. Very nicely done, congrats to Disney and of course Diane Lane:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flick to honor a great horse, Big Red, and the biggest Belmont finish ever.","review":"Disney's \\"Secretariat\\" brings back the excitement I remember the world feeling back in 1973, when we met Penny and her amazing Big Red. Reliving the unbelievable Belmont finish as he surged further and further from the field was like seeing Pegasus flying and soaring up to the heavens. Thanks for the memories. I'd recommend this movie for all horse lovers and anyone who vaguely remembers the great Secretariat's amazing campaign of 1973 - this'll bring it all excitingly back to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"This movie has lots of suspense and action. We were all spellbound by the story of this magnificent horse and its determined owner. I will watch it again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secretariat","review":"I have seen this movie a number of times and it still makes me giddy to see what goes on. The actors did a great job. Very intertaining. True about the horse. I am so gald Amazon had it. We will use them in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secretariat the Movie","review":"My wife and I had attended this at the theater and loved it.I pre-ordered if from Amazon and as soon as it came in the mail, we sat down and watched it again.The movie is great. This is a well acted, directed and produced movie. There is no sex, no foul language and no violence, it is a movie with a great story and a great ending. It can be enjoyed by all ages.The Blu-ray with the extras including deleted scenes is also very good.I have a small collection of CD's and DVD of around 400 + and this is one movie I will watch many more times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Walt Disney classic","review":"I loved this movie. It was well done with no sex or swearing! The acting was great and the horses were beautiful. We call this one a \\"keeper.\\" Which means we will soon own it to watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Horse movie","review":"The actors did a great job and I loved this movie. Diane Lane is perfect for her role and I enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-warming true story","review":"This is the slightly sanitized true story of a horse which made a woman and a woman who made a horse. Both became household names."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre movie","review":"It's sad that a mediocre movie like this somehow garners such high ratings on Amazon. Maybe the story of Secretariat lacks drama - but it's kind of needed for the movie. Where was it? I was never convinced that the owner of Sham was a villain. And was there supposed to be drama in regards to Penny's family situation? In movie terms - dramatic tension, character development, pacing, emotional resonance - SeabiscuitSeabiscuit (Widescreen Edition)was by far the superior movie.If you want a predictable, mushy, mostly-fictional horse movie, you've found what you're looking for. But otherwise, save yourself the money and go watch the videos for the actual Triple Crown races that Secretariat won. Nothing beats the thrill of the actual races run by this amazing horse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great horse, mediocre movie","review":"Hollywood tries really hard to create drama and build the story around Peggy Tweedy, the 'housewife' turned horse breeder. But it's a forced effort at best. Diane Lane is stiff and John Malcovich horribly miscast. The horses did a better job of acting than any of the humans. It's sentimental, predictable, and boring. \\"Seabiscuit,\\" this ain't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, hell of a book!","review":"\\"L.O.S.T.\\", a book by Debbie Federici and Susan Vaught, is a hell of a book. It's excellent. It's about a boy named Bren who enters Live Oak Springs Township (hence the name). Just fate that he stopped there to use the bathroom and met the girl who would take him in an adventure. Jasmina, Queen of the Witches is destined to a find a warrior known as the, \\"Shadowalker\\". The prophecies foretold that the Shadowalker will defeat an ancient evil known as Nyre, no one knows who or what it is, well trained and filled with love for the Queen. The story is a suspense with paranormal/fantasy elements. It's well written and totally addictive. I had to READ this book, now!. I couldn't tell which way, and finding out whose Nyre was is difficult and surprising that I didn't even knew who it was. But cannot tell you, you have to get it. L.O.S.T. is a very good, 5 at of 5 in my opinion for having adventure and suspenseful with a twisted surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, It's a Lucky Strike!","review":"If you order this CD, you'll have the \\"lucky strike\\" of seeing some of these sports greats endorsing products (yes, including Lucky Strike). It will help us remember why so many people smoke or use Vitalis, since our heroes did. I was a little disappointed that some never spoke (such as Hank Bauer), but it was a neat trip into nostalgia land to see these players outside of their sports venue speaking for cereal, razor blades, and other products. It's worth the trip back to the 50's to see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking but Useless","review":"The set looked beautiful, but I was never able to use it. The exterior of each copper piece has a protective plastic film on it. Following the directions to remove the film I soaked each piece in a hot water and baking soda solution. Most, but not all of the plastic came off of each pot. After several more soakings and tedious scrapping with my finger nails, I was able to clean one pot, but I could not clean the bottom of either pan no matter how much I soaked them.I tried mixing a metal polish suggested in the instructions to clean the pans. It did not remove any of the plastic, but it did ruin the finish on the pans I tried it on.I e-mailed Cuisinart two weeks ago for help, but I still have not received a response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful - Looks and Performance","review":"I've had this cookware about six months and it performs beautifully. Heats quickly and evenly. Handles don't get too hot. No sticking (so far), even though it's uncoated. Consumer Reports did a recent review of the stainless counterpart (Multiclad) and gave it only a \\"good\\" review, but I think this particular set performs as well as All-Clad and Calphalon Commercial (I have both, so this is direct comparison). The only negative is that the larger (3 3/4 qt) saucepan could use a counter balance handle, as it's heavy and awkward to lift when full and hot. I'd prefer glass lids too, but the contrast of the stainless lids/handles and the copper body is very nice. Need to use copper cleaner occasionally, but it doesn't tarnish too badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but watch for sales/","review":"I have become so enthusiastic about this line, that I have purchaced most of the items in this package from open stock. I'm missing one or two, and have bought a few others not included with this set, but all are consistent. They are built to the highest standards, and if you are careful enough to wait for a sale, they are available here for song (relative to the other brands). At any price, they are lifetime additions to your kitchen. I have a variety of pots in my kitchen that would cause serious envy at a pot museum, yet I prefer using this line on a daily basis. They look, cook, and clean better than any others I have used for most tasks (I still like a thick aluminum, high quality non stick pan for some chores). Even if you have never had the pleasure of cooking with copper, you will be amazed at the even heat provided to the cooking surface, and wonder why you waited so long to take the plunge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time","review":"This documentary is such a disappointment that there are no words to describe it. The director (who supposedly has training in making documentaries) spends hours and hours gazing at same tired, cliché shots of the famous Ganges ghats, the camera is slow, boring, with no discourse or narrative to accompany the shots. I would have imagined that the director himself being from India would do a better job than panning the camera on burning ghats, crazy holy men, and other trifle items that perhaps, would be interesting to an outsider. Instead of bringing out the true nature of the Ganges ghats (the famous dance rituals on the river banks are so poorly shot that you pause to think if some amateur student had been employed to capture those shots). I am not just disappointed with this film, but I am angry as well. I would not recommend this film to anyone, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"Purchased this to help teach myself Powerpoint. It is nice to go at my own pace.
