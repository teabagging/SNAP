Great actors, an intriguing story on the video jacket, and that hint of mystery that threatens to suck us in. Be warned. Enigma fails to deliver at any level. With the exception of Jeremy Northam, the acting is mediocre at best. Jeremy at least manages to appear somewhat interested in the story. Kate Winslet's performance is weak, her character weird and immensely unsympathetic. Rent this first. See if you can make it through the entire tired plot, stereotypical \\"bad guys,\\" and random acts of sex, before you commit to making it your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the video quality of this DVD","review":"Anyone interesting in buying this film on DVD, beware that the quality is absolutely atrocious. It's so bad, I found it unwatchable, so my comment is not about the film per se, but the DVD. When I first started to play the DVD I thought I must have received a defective DVD, but upon searching the internet for DVD reviews of ENIGMA I found that the transfer is atrocious. It appears to have been transferred to DVD from a PAL format VHS tape. The picture is fuzzy, it shimmers, and small detail is just awful. The first 5 minutes started to give me eye strain so I had to stop watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Graham Greene-ian Entertainment","review":"\\"Enigma\\" is an absorbing World War II drama of suspense as long as one takes it as what Graham Greene called \\"an entertainment\\" and does not press it too hard for historical accuracy. Because it has several subplots, which become clear only after repeated viewings, the movie leaves the viewer grasping at a few loose ends that are never tied up completely. With an intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard, \\"Enigma\\" works best when it focuses upon the Bletchley Park team of classicists, mathematicians, and other academics working on cracking the intercepts of German submarine traffic in the North Atlantic. It works less well when it veers off into car, train, and motorboat chases. Nevertheless, clever plot twists, atmospheric English locations, and a talented cast, which includes Kate Winslet, Jeremy Northam, Tom Hollander, Matthew MacFadyen, and Corin Redgrave, ensure that the viewer will be thoroughly entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"insulting. ..... soap opera silly","review":"I guess this movie is supposed to be romantic and cute. Kate Winslet was cute with the glasses? WWII code breaking is a fascinating subject and could have been interesting. Like the movie Pearl Harbor was turned into a soup opera and was awful so was this film. Of course the Polish code breaker becomes a traitor and gives the codes or code machine to the Germans because he is angry the Soviets slaughtered the Poles at Katyn. So the Polish guy helps the Germans? For one thing the due credit was not given in this film to the Polish cryptanalysis on which subsequent British codebreaking was dependent for its successes. The film was financed by Mick Jagger and Lorne Michaels of SNL. Why? Thanks Mick. The Poles laid the foundations for British success in cracking German codes and they get portrayed as traitors in silly soap opera movies like this. Yes it is fiction but unfortunately probly most of the world will learn about WWII code-breaking from this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically Inaccurate Farce","review":"Watch \\"Enigma\\" to kill some time, but don't hold on to the presentation as history. The real story of the Nazi code-breaking team and Alan Turing must be too controversial for a film. \\"Enigma\\" goes beyond taking creative license -- it rewrites history right down to the persona of the lead character. Consider it \\"loosely inspired\\" by the facts. A well done and well filmed piece of fiction nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flick, slightly inaccurate historically","review":"I hate to be picky..but the Enigma system was a stream cypher, NOT a code. A code encyphers the same item \\"battleship\\" say, in a finite number of ways. Eventually they repeat. The Enigma system would NOT repeat (in less than many years). That was it's strength. The movie publicises a little known, and scarcely appreciated part of WW2. Perhaps a major reason why we are not speaking German now. In my opinion: well written, convincingly acted, somewhat unkind to the Poles (who provided invaluable help to the Allies with their cryptographic skills - and were shabbily treated as a reward), but well worth a look. More historically accurate material is available from the Bletchley Park site for those interested in persuing cryptanalysis more deeply. Cheers.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the book","review":"The movie was released here in the US on limited release (couldn't find it in the SE at all), and so I read the book last summer. Rarely have I found a movie that even matches the book, but this screenplay was so artfully edited from the book that I feel it actually is *better* than the book.

Most information is slanted towards how difficult sobriety can be, and almost had me wondering why I didn't have many of the feelings and experiences she writes about.

A must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book","review":"I was very disappointed after browsing through a few chapters.

It's no fun to solve things like those."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Warning to Parents","review":"While this is a very high quality edition of the story of Pinocchio, I decided to return the book. Why? Because chapter 15 is entitled \\"Pinocchio is hanged\\" and includes an illustration of Pinocchio hanging by his neck from a tree with his hands tied behind his back. Although this may be true to the story of Pinocchio, I didn't feel that a book containing an illustration such as this is suitable for young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: the Dover Classic version is an abridged version","review":"Amazon! Particularly with children's books and translated books, editions matter! In this case, the reviews are about very different editions.

But steer clear of the Dover Classic edition, which is the one pictured above--this is not the full text."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like music.....!","review":"Like the previous reviewer, this film has haunted me since first seeing it at a Sacramento drive-in during the late 60's. But, not for the same reasons. The movie itself is interesting, but barely so. What is exceptional is the opening titles.

So, if you'd like to get an eyeful of Big Sur go ahead and watch this movie. However, if you are looking for acting talent, good script, and meaningful story skip it! While some of the dialogue isn't so bad (it was a collaborative effort including the likes of Dalton Trumbo) coming out of Miss Taylor's mouth it is pure drivel. The film seems like a too long SNL skit. It's funny to think that Taylor and Burton were husband and wife at the time since there doesn't seem to be much chemistry between their characters. I so much agree with a previous reviewer who stated that in their next life they would like to come back as Miss Taylor's character and live in a beach house on Big Sur (talk about rich hippies)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful love story","review":"I loved this movie.It keeps your attention and I think Elizabeth and Richard both loved each other till the very end.I enjoy all their movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could everyone miss this...","review":"Many mixed reviews about this movie, but it is astonishing that no-one mentioned the phenomenal, lush, moody score by Johnny Mandel. The score is, basically, a gigantic theme and variations based on Mandel's song \\"The Shadow of Your Smile,\\" and for anyone from that era, the music is hypnotically wistful, sad, and nostalgic for a time that will never be again. Certainly one of the greatest film scores ever made and worth picking up on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This DVD was an almost complete waste of money. All it contains in a bunch of self-congratulatory young chefs running around frantically around a studio kitchen, and then eating their own cooking and praising their own abilities. There is very little to be learned on these DVDs. The one good bit was the chef making risotto, and it was good only for its comic effect, as he ran around the counter from pot to pot to pot. I don't think even an advanced chef has much to learn from this, and it's a total waste for a beginner. Instead, spend your money on DVDs by Julia Child or Lidia Bastianich or Jacques Pepin, chefs who actually teach something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Cooking Video","review":"When purchasing any kind of cooking video/lesson, you anticipate that recipes will be included with the lesson...

If you haven't tried a Dark Hunter yet, you have to. You won't be sorry. I just hope Urian gets a book soon and I can't wait to see what happens between Ash, the Destroyer and Styker.

This is book 5 in the series and those thoughts have started creeping around in my mind. This book put my mind at ease. It's easily my favorite of the series so far. What a unique story putting a Dark Hunter and an Apolite as your main characters. It works so well. The chemistry between the two, especially at the beginning of the book, is just stellar. The story as a whole is fantastic. A Dark Hunter who no one can remember after 5 minutes and an Apolite princess who's life or death will destroy earth. Come on people! Read this book!

The one good thing going for it, is that is gives the other side's (Daimons'/Apollites') point of view.The reason for the 2 stars instead of 1 star rating, is because I just finished reading the first book in the Dream Hunter series which had to be rated 1 star since you cannot assign a zero value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but confusing","review":"I thought this book ranked up there with Ms. Kenyon's other works except for one thing.

Wulf Tryggvasen, a Viking warrior which no one remembers five minutes after they met him, which seems to be fine with him because he always has the best one night stands and no complicated relationships.

Cassandra is the first woman since he's become a Dark-Hunter who doesn't forget him. That's because, Cassandra's not quite human. Her birthday's approaching...a birthday that will either lead to her death, or her becoming Daimon. Wulf is a warrior who has spent centuries killing Daimons...but he begins to doubt if he would be strong enough to kill Cassandra, no matter what. But he'll never have to make that decision because Cassandra doesn't plan to become Daimon. She'll meet her fate. Unfortunately, the gods have other plans...Kenyon's built a world that seems straight forward...good vs evil, light vs dark. But with each new story, she adds more shades of grey and complexities. The result is each book just gets better and better. Kiss of the Night will keep you turning pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another \\"I can't put this book down\\" book from Kenyon","review":"All of Kenyon's books are mind tingling interesting, so Kiss of the Night is also. Wulf, a DH who never died (and therefore isn't bound by the same rules) falls for a half human, half Apollite, Cassandra, who is going to die in a few months. She is the last in a long line of very important Apollites, and if she dies, the sun dies too. You know who would love to see that happen. Wulf must protect her, especially since she carries his child. Wulf learns that not all Apollites are bad (and Daimons, for that matter) You will fall in love with both characters and a lot of the mysteries surrounding Ash, the Dark-Hunters, and Apollites are uncovered...but, then again, many more mysteries are introduced. Also, many of our loved heros from past books make a few intros. This was probably the best Dark-Hunter novel yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly disappointed","review":"I have to say this was the weakest dark hunter novel to date. Storyline way to conjested and complicated. Sometimes I had a hard time rembering the hero and heroines names so many new characters were introduced in this novel. And whats so bad about it is that all the external characters were more entertaining than the hero and heroine. The Phoebe/Urian romance was hotter than the main characters. Will chalk this one up to everyone has a bad moment, and its easy to do since all her other work was so great.

I enjoyed Dance with the Devil so much more. I couldn't fully immerse myself in the attraction between Wulf and Cassandra and struggled with it throughout the story. The physical attraction is hot, but I couldn't understand how sworn enemies could become soul mates. This book has some emotional parts and some good secondary characters are introduced. There is a reunion of sorts between Wulf, Ash, and the four previous Dark Hunters. Simi also returns for a brief appearance.This book is important to the series; however, because it explains more about the different Daimons, Apollites, and other creatures in the realm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop the hype","review":"The first two books were great.

Well, try having STEAMY dreams about a certain Viking Dark Hunter that seems so real, Cassandra wakes up without clothes only to find out that she's got a little surprise as well!!!!

It was extremely rushed and forced. I thought mortal enemies coming together would be more exciting. This stretched the impossible a little too far for me.

Too much discussion of the history of their race and not about their romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The mythology continues...","review":"I enjoy the Dark-Hunter books not only because they have some hot and steamy romance, but because I think that Kenyon's created a really interesting mythology here.

While I used this bag, it caused more frustration than anything. It was always getting in the way and I was having to fold it up so that I could see what I was doing when folding it. The final straw came 6 months after using it. We had been having issues getting the stroller unfolded and I was considering sending the whole stroller back. As a last attempt, I took the bag off, and miracle of miracles! The stroller folds up fine!

I have his diapers, extra set of clothes, wipies, small toys, binky, etc and I use the top small pocket for my cell phone and keys. The cup holders are great for his formula bottles and a small cup of coffee for me(not filled too high since it can spill all over the stuff but this is the case with any cup holder). I did purchase separate cup holder for my husband's big drink cups and one of the mountain climber clips to hang groceries and my Sigg water bottle.

I suppose you could place a traditional baby bottle into these compartments, but my child uses a wide bottle and it just wouldnt fit.

I used the cupholders for my sunglasses and a burp cloth. It wasn't a problem folding the stroller with stuff in the organizer (although I did have to take things out of the stroller basket).

Don't even bother trying to use them unless you have a roll of papertowels handy. I'm not sure I could even fit an Avent wide-neck bottle in there, I think the only ones that would really fit would be the tall/skinny bottles.

It turned out to be an over long disappointment which doesn't seem to go anywhere in particular and soon becomes boring. I have now resigned this film to the trash can. If you are thinking of buying this film because of Jean Reno's fine acting and humour, in films such as LEON and GODZILLA. Then don't bother. Jean Reno is a favorite actor of mine but this film was a complete waste of time and talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"How very...French","review":"A long boring movie with an annoying ending. Some of the photography was good, and seemed to have more character than the characters.Avoid this movie at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It feels right or does not, depending...","review":"Issues of format aside, people either love this movie or hate it, depending it seems on familiarity and acceptance of the metephore on which this movie is based. The US is rooted in English culture, a society with a singular relationship with the ocean: dark, violent, and cold - a sea so dangerous, they dug a tunnel under it. Most of the rest of western Europe, and all those shown in this movie, are connected to the Mediteranian. This creates an all together different relationship with the sea, a bright, warm, and calm place where the ocean is mother, giver of life, and the depths of the sea are the womb of the Earth. Understand and accept this relationship, and the movie makes sense - a cascade of elegant gestures. Do not and the story is but a series of weak and unrelated sub plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but...watch out","review":"Im entirely satisfied with the copy of my Grand Bleu movie.

I thought it was very \\"French\\" in that \\"ooookkkaaay, what was the point?\\" kinda way.

After purchasing Bessons Director's cut DVD (the only DVD version available) I found that it greatly slows the pace of the movie while adding very little story. The new accompanying musical score by Eric Sierra is bland and combined with the different ending, the feel of the original film is destroyed. I regret buying this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"epic movie...fantastic!","review":"this is an absolutely great movie, that if your not watching with a smile on your face, your just not gettin it. I will say however, you truly want to have the version with the Bill Conti music score. I have the Dvd long version with the Eric Sierra music score (which sounds like elevator music), and besides it being long,drawn out, the shorter version with Conti score is the way to go. I love this movie so much that I also bought the VHS version cause of the music score, it just makes it so much more appealing.

Rosanna Arquette's giggly performance is the cinematic equivalent of fingernails on slate. Jean-Marc Barr delivers no performance whatsoever, just mugs for the camera with a lost look on his face. And Jean Reno plays his usual gravel-throated self. Predictably enough, this film has been artificially elevated to classic cult status by dreary film snobs who think a slow pace equals a deep and meaningful story. In this case, only the ocean is deep. The brain behind this film is shallower than a tidal pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good scenery..","review":"I don't know why everyone loved this movie so much.

So, the DVD is ejected and once again I am watching the VHS tape I recorded off Cinemax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as the Theatrical Version","review":"This is one of my favorite movies, but the director's cut is a definite pass. Those interested in an offbeat, strange but good movie should find the original theatrical version and skip this one. The theatrical version isn't a comedy, a romance, or anything that could categorized, but it was whimsical, quiet, full of tiny character details sharply etched. The film score by Bill Conti accented that whimsy and surrealism. In the director's cut, the film score by Eric Serra makes the movie nearly unwatchable. The 49 extra minutes shows that Besson had intended a straight melodrama, which doesn't work. The extra footage spoils the timing of key scenes and introduces unnecessary characters & subplots. Not a single minute of the extra footage adds anything to the original movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music Issue","review":"My only problem with the music is that the original US release had an incredibly noble theme by Bill Conti (performed by flute and harp), which for some reason has never, to my knowledge, been made available on CD.

The Director's cut kindly replaces the Bill Conti score with that of Eric Serra's, a much deeper more romantic electronic score.The story of two free divers. One who is carefree and would rather be playing with dolphins than doing anything else. The other mired in personal feelings of mediocrity. The story follows the two rivals and friends. I don't want to give anything away, but it is a wonderful story.The film actually is a bit dated, and somewhat immature, but worth a purchase if you love underwater cinematography and the cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jean Reno at his best.","review":"Majestic settings and extraordinary cinematography make this Luc Besson's best directorial effort. Jean Marc Barr gives a moving performance as a man who is unable to connect with people, but whose soul is part of the sea. Jean Reno's character is full of wonderful contradictions; a virile, somewhat obnoxious, diving champion whose accomplishments mean nothing without the approval of his childhood friend and rival (Barr). Rosanna Arquette's character almost ruins the movie with her whining and neediness. One of my all time favorites with some of the most beautiful shots of the Mediterannean I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRANDIOSA","review":"Este es el tipo de films que nunca deberían desaparecer.

This version contains the same music score by Eric Serra that is on all the rereleased directors cut versions of the film. If you ever get a chance to see the original US release which was shortened and given a new musical score you will be delighted at the results. There is a reason they decided to do this; because in America we know how to make movies. The directors cut is awful- it distorts the character development and the musical score by Eric Serra is dreadful. It's worth mentioning that the video quality is prettty poor also. Total waste of money"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites...","review":"I first saw this movie when it came out in the theaters...I was around 11 and I loved it from the start and I still love it. I can watch it a hundred times (I probably have) and still watch it again! Now some of that can be from my crush on Jean Marc Barr and my liking Jean Reno a lot, but I think it's a sweet movie. Actually, one time I rented the movie on DVD and I noticed they had changed the ending....instead of a sad ending, they made it a happy ending....

However, I am American and I probably fell in love with it more because of the music than the actual movie (though I do love the movie also). Luc Besson did an excellent job. I am glad he changed the music from Eric Serra to Bill Conti for the American version. It would however, have been nice to see the full length with the Bill Conti music.

For starters, the US Version's Music Score surpasses the European Score by leapyears and this Director's Cut uses that cheesy synthesizery European Score. :-( Secondly, the additional footage simply adds a little more pointless skin in the form of nudity, but adds little or nothing to the overall story except about 50 minutes of your time. It feels like it's dragging compared to the original US Version and often gives you more information than you wanted - sometimes it's best to not tell the audience everything and let them fill in the blanks themselves. The original US Version is one of my favorite films of all times, but this updated Director's Version doesn't make my cut because the extra stuff is pointless and long and the European Soundtrack is horrible!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not about diving","review":"I saw this movie in the the 1980s and was enchanted by it.

As much as I love the additional underwater footage, you don't need to spell out every last beat in this story. The key to the film is the relationship with Jacque and the ocean - everything else is used show how important that is. Rosanna Arquette's part was raised from a supporting cast member to a starting role - WHO CARES ABOUT HER?!?! Nobody. As much as I have loved many of Luc's films, please be wary of the director's cut of this one. Bigger is NOT definately better.

Inside was glued a newspaper review placed there by (I assume) the first owner -- it was an interesting enough find. Of course I read the book, though solely out of curiosity and the fact that I had forgotten Esther Forbes' authorship of the lame novel Johnny Tremain. The book read quickly, though seemed more like a novel from the 19th century than one from the Jazz Age. The content was interesting, but neither 'engaging' nor 'vigorous' as its newspaper review had led me to believe. On the whole, though I admit my pride regarding the ownership of the unique 1st edition, I do not plan on recommending the book to anyone not extensively studying literature regarding early witchery or the behavioral history of early Salem, Massachusetts inhabitants."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright","review":"not worth the price, you can get far better ones in India.

This was definitely one of the hits, an album produced by the stellar team of Stock Aitken Waterman, it yielded a hit in the amazing pop single \\"This Time I Know It's For Real\\". Her voice is powerful, the lyrics perfect, the synth pop backing just right. It's a diamond in a crown of pop jewels that is \\"Another Place And Time\\". The sound is perfect for the time, and the songs are great, impossibly catchy cuts include \\"I Don't Wanna Get Hurt\\", \\"Sentimental\\", and \\"Love's About To Change My Heart\\". This was probably one of the best albums created in the hands of SAW, and provided Donna with a well deserved hit. This collection is a must for fans of Donna, 80s pop, and the SAW sound. Wonderful collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"She must have been in another place and time, because this is definitely not Donna Summer at her best","review":"Not one of the more distinguished productions by the great Stock-Aitken-Waterman team, this album is definitely one of the worst ever instances of a great disco artist trying to make the transition to 80s R&B. This album did spawn the huge hit \\"This Time I Know It's For Real,\\" which is by all means a great song. Unfortunately, nothing else on the album even comes close to it, and since the song is available on most or all of Donna Summer's many hits collections, I would just get it that way instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have Donna album","review":"This has to be one of Donna's most overlooked albums... every song sounds great and her voice sounds fantastic. A very upbeat album with great dance tunes... A \\"MUST have\\" album for any Donna fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad reputation","review":"Donna Summer's 1989 album \\"another time and place\\" is a cheap attempt to break into the pop charts again by teaming up with devastatingly unoriginal British producers Stock Aitken Waterman, the team behind the bubble-gum pop of Kylie Minogue and Rick Astley. As a result, most of the songs on the album turn out similar, and totally lack originality. \\"This time I know it's for real\\" could have been sung by, say, Kylie Minogue with equal conviction. In other words, Donna Summer is really selling herself way too cheap to be working with these untalented producers. Stock Aitken Waterman has only produced 2 great albums in their time. The first is Rick Astley's smash hit debut album \\"Whenever you need somebody\\" and the second is Bananarama's 1987 dance classic \\"Venus\\" and \\"I heard a rumor\\". Donna Summer's album pales in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent CD","review":"I owned the LP long time ago, this album is really Another Place and Time in Donna Summer's music path, it is pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"I was looking for a high-level tool to provide context as I studied for the exam, which I passed. This book didn't provide anything that wasn't already available for free elsewhere and represents nothing more than a slipshod attempt to make a fast buck.

Everyone is different - this book may be very helpful or not depending on who you are, your study habits, etc. Think about it this way: spending less than $30 on a patent bar examination material that may be helpful is totally worth it, even if it is NOT helpful. How would you know otherwise? After all, there are far less helpful patent bar examination materials that cost hundreds and thousands of dollars out there.

I don't know if I remember getting the sweats in three days, because that's how long it took for my shorts to arrive. I can't stress the importance of knowing that, if I might need a pair in graphite, I will get them in lighting time. Sometimes, the shipping time makes all the difference when considering reordering.

I was shocked to discover that by changing the color the quality would drop so drastically.They are very thin and poorly sewn. I discovered a large hole in the seam the first time I put my hand in my pocket. The Russell logo on the leg is a cheap iron on an d not the embroidered logo that is on the 2 previous pairs I ordered. Had I known they would differ from color to color I would have stuck to the colors I had before. These shorts are good for sleep shorts maybe but they are too thin and poorly sewn to wear out of the house.

The were made in Mexico and were great. So...I decide to buy 2 of these. One in graphite, the other in black.The graphite is a cotton/polyester blend which makes for a softer, more comfortable feel. The black is 100% cotton and it's not a soft cotton.Although the quality is good, I think Russell should go back to what made them a good company in the first place.

But truly, this album is a must, Jewel uses her voice well (yet again - 'Spirit' was great) making the already beautiful all-time-favourite carols even more.

Clássicos como \\"Rudolf The Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" e \\"Joy To the World\\" esto simplemente fantásticos, mas é ainda em suas próprias composies que está o grande trunfo do cd, como \\"Life Uncommon\\", \\"Face of Love\\" e a belíssima verso de Natal para \\"Hands\\".

Overall though, it is a very nice CD that I would recommend to anyone who liked Jewel's Spirit album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joy - Not Half Bad","review":"The first half of this Christmas album is very good. Jewel does wonderful versions of classic songs. Beginning with track 8 (Rudolph), however, this album takes a nose dive. While some reviewers consider Jewel's Rudolph a \\"playful\\" rendition, my wife and I just found it dumb (one of those tracks you just want to immediately skip over). In the second half of the album, the best songs (or parts of songs in the case of \\"Life Uncommon\\") are essentially just remixes of \\"Hands\\" and \\"Life Uncommon\\". But you can get these - and many other great songs - by just buying Jewel's Spirit CD (which is excellent). So in a nutshell, the first half of this CD gets 5 stars, while the second half knocks the total down to 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel Celebrates!","review":"When you think of Christmas, you think of the many holiday CD's that most people are ashamed they own. Well, this isnt one of them. From classics such as O Holy Night, and Ave Maria, to new songs, like Face of Love, to even a revamped version of Hands, this album is one which you will love to listen to, and won't mind having on your shelves. I bought it because i work in a store where christmas music is played. so i brought this one in, and even the bosses loved it! It sets the perfect, quiet, holiday mood that not only the employees and bosses commented on, but the customers as well! This Jewel holiday album is a must for anyone who is tired of the same old holiday music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music That Touches The Spirit and The Heart","review":"This is one of the most incredible cd's, Christmas or otherwise, that I have ever listened to. Jewel's voice is so clear and pure it touches my spirit and heart in ways that only Pachelbel's Canon, with it's violins, has done before. The soprano voice fills the space around you with love and happiness. The \\"Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer\\" is just plain fun. I recommend this CD highly. It will fill your home, office or car with a rare beauty. Thank you, Jewel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Christmas CDs!","review":"Can't believe that it has been thirteen years since Joy: A Holiday Collection by Jewel was released.

Jewel's voice is beautiful. It is truly a Christmas favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel Sparkles","review":"Since her bestselling CDs tend toward syrupy angst,( and that's okay ), it's no surprise that Jewel's first foray into holiday music is both sugary and earnestly spiritual.Jewel's strong soprano catches and flows on such beloved Yuletide faves as \\"Joy to the World\\" and \\"Silent Night\\" and gives the tracks a New Agey, I-feel-your-pain tone. To her credit, Jewel manages to find some of the ho-ho-ho of the season in the especially playful rendition of \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\\" which she sings with her soulmate mother, Nedra Carroll.This holiday album is so beautifully arranged and the presentation of songs so tasteful you can almost smell the roasting chestnuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid","review":"A generally uninspired album - at times it sounds as if Jewel is simply phoning her performance in. Her voice isn't powerful, and when the orchestra gets loud she simply gets drowned. The better tracks are definately those where the production is kept to a minimum (Rudolph, I Wonder). In a few others (O Little Town, Go Tell it on the Mountain) her voice gets unpleasantly thin, which I found distracting.Overall this is a forgettable set; personally, I really wasn't moved in a Christmasy sort of way. If you're a Jewel fan it's maybe worthwhile but other folks will find that there are better holiday albums available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to what you know!","review":"I love Jewel--I have all of her CDs and I love all of them--except this one. The same qualities that make Jewel enchanting and beautiful just make her seem whiny and annoying when singing these Christmas songs. I don't recommend this CD at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album was so boring!","review":"I heard the album, and I'm grateful I didn't buy it! Not only were her renditions boring, but her range was pretty limited. In some of her songs, her voice wavered and she strained on the high notes. Her version of \\"Rudolph\\" almost put me to sleep! And \\"Walking in a Winter Wonderland\\" was dull. She sounded more like a choir boy, before puberty, than an actual woman. I think I'll stick to Bing Crosby. This one left me falling asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, my!","review":"When this came on, we said, \\"What was that!?\\" To us it was awful, which does not mean that there is probably someone out there who would like it. Just too crazy for us. We were not familiar with Jewel, or would not have ordered it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Would Have Known It Was Possible to Ruin Rudolph?","review":"If I could give this album 0 stars, I would have. This is probably the worst CD in the whole entire world. I previously did not believe that it would be possible to ruin 'Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer', but I was so, SO wrong. This woman takes every classical Chrismas song and turns them into her own rendition of 'Oh, Poor Me' with her disgustingly whiny voice and extremely lousy musical \\"talents\\". She tackles beautiful pieces like 'O Holy Night' and fails miserably. Her adolescent sound is fine on the sound stages of Lilith Fair, but she should leave the traditional Christmas carols and familiar holiday songs to people who at least SOUND like they enjoy performing. This is the single worst CD of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I think Jewel has the creative capacity to engage in something more challenging than this economic enterprise to cash in on Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This CD is really great! I love almost every song on the CD! My favorites are : O Little Town of Bethlehem, Hark! the Herald Angels sing, Face of Love, and a really beautiful song \\"Hands\\", which, even though it doesn't really pertain to Christmas as much as the others, is still amazing! The only song that I sort of don't like is Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, because she sings it strangley and does a little yodeling.

Her renditions of these songs are Beautiful! \\"Silent Night\\" is My favorite track from her, and she does a good job and it's a nice one to relax to, as well as her \\"O Holy Night\\". I have a Good reason why they put \\"Rudolph\\" on here as well, Jewel and her Mom Nedra Caroll have been singing that even before this cd came out, I also love how she does \\"Hark!\\", and a lot more, and \\"Hands\\" is on here, too! So forget the stress and Take a listen,BYE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Christmas Album ever!!!","review":"I'm actually not a Jewel fan. I don't really enjoy her style of music. I like Christmas music and I was worried I would regret purchasing this album. I did not want to hear her yodeling \\"O Holy Night\\".My worries were put to rest. Her version of \\"O Holy Night\\" surpassed Celine Dion's, which I thought was the best prior to hearing Jewel. She sung the Christian classics in a traditional manner, with a touch of her own style, with a voice surpassed by none. After hearing this album I'm convinced she is the greatest female vocalist of all-time. I still prefer Celine as an artist but that is a manner of taste.This album is the greatest Christmas album in my book. I highly recommend it even if your not a Jewel fan, like me.Just to make it clear, I'm not down on her other stuff. It's just a manner of individual music preference."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT BLEND OF VOICE AND MAGIC XMAS SPIRIT.","review":"If you're looking for a peaceful xmas albums, this is the one, touch with such melancolic style, that's fits perfectly, without making the record sound boring or dated. Jewel's performance is simply angelic. Just listen to \\"I Wonder as I wander\\", such a acapella masterpiece. Her version of \\"O Holy Night\\", \\"hark! the Herald Angels Sing\\", \\"Silent Night\\", \\"Ave Maria\\" are out of this world. The \\"Face Of Love\\" is a great original. Misstep I guess \\"Hands\\" sounds awful corny here. This is a chritsmas collection intended to be joyful melancolic and peaceful, perfect for a chillout hour before the xmas party. Happy Holidays!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Holiday Collection!","review":"Truly a beautiful collection of songs. In \\"Holy Night\\", she sounds like an angel.

Jewels whole career boils down to lip gloss and big well just look at the majority of her pictures. The Lilith wave has crashed -- to bad you quit your day job honey.

I was extremely irate to learn that nearly the whole video is slanted towards Diana, and against HRH Prince Charles, who I think is doing a very good job at being a father. Very little actual footage, and some of that it repeats. Mostly its all commentary from people who supposedly know all about him (and his mother). I was extremely disappointed. The front cover displays a picture taken on his 18th birthday at Eton, and with all the press footage taken that day, none of it is in the video. Its copyrighted 2001, and yet most of it is during his growing up years. The only relatively recent shoots that make the video worthwhile are brief moments taken from his first press conference, the Queen Mum's 99th birthday, and the christianing of his godson. Thats about it, otherwise, it wasn't anything I couldn't have learned anywhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Home","review":"I first heard Fernando Ortega on a secular radio station playing \\"This Good Day\\" from his \\"Home\\" album. I bought it a few days later and it has turned out to be my FAVORITE album of the many hundreds that I own. I never tire of it - in fact it seems to get better with each listening. What a beautiful voice, beautiful lyrics and beautiful music. These songs have brought me (a former unbelieving new-ager) closer to God. Is there any higher praise than that?I've since listened to and greatly enjoyed several of his other works, but I always come back to the soothing splendor of Home. Fernando, you are a blessing.

All of the selections on this cd are tremendous. Iurge you to listen to his music. He is worth a good listen.God bless him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mix of songs","review":"Fernando Ortega combines an easy-going style with a real love for God in this CD. He mixes sacred songs, such as \\"This Good Day\\" and \\"Prayer for Home\\", with more secular songs like \\"Old Girl\\" and \\"Virginia Rose\\". The secular songs are carefully selected to reflect a philosophy which demonstrates compassion and love for others. This is an enjoyable and inspiring album which demonstrates Ortega's core value which is summed up in the final song on the CD, \\"Give Me Jesus\\". It is highly recommendedlistening."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointed","review":"He has been exceptional in the past, but with this last cd I beleive he has lowered his music standard.

After listening to it for two months, I have changed my mind. His songs, This Good Day, Prayer for Home and No One Else have become my favorites!

(Just skip over those two songs and you will love this album as much as you love the rest of his music!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The reason I am saying this book is a 1 star is because it only has 6 sermons in it! I thought it had the usual 59 sermons that you find online. But it doesn't. The title of the book seemed to mean it contained more than just 6 sermons. It might well be worth 5 stars for some or most people, but I bought this book thinking it contained the majority of his sermons. Again, it doesn't. Only 6. I have not read this book, however I did read the 2 Volume biography on G.W. (the biography is AWESOME). I guess it was my fault for not looking into this book further before purchasing. I would bet what is in this book is good, but it's just not what I was looking for, nor did it have any \\"table of contents\\" available online.

(There's also some karaoke tracks that are available only at iTunes, but I can live without those.) This ommission is ridiculous as the running time for this CD is just over 59 minutes.

They loved the show and the OC actors and that blinds them to their vocal deficiencies. In 1975, the split between dancers and singers still held sway, while these days chorus, or ensemble, members must excel at both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic Omission (AGAIN) of \\"And...\\"","review":"Why would they release a new recording of this musical, with restorations, and STILL exclude the song \\"And...\\"? I cannot believe it. It seems like such a no-brainer to me that fans of the musical (and the revival) would want this song. It's annoying enough that the first recording, thirty years ago, eliminated the song, but the fact that it's happened a SECOND TIME is unforgiveable. I never would have bought the recording if I'd known this was going to happen because, frankly, the rest of it is just so-so. This is pure idiocy on the part of whoever made this decision. Way to go, geniuses."},{"rating":"1","title":"New, but Bland","review":"Don't get me wrong - it is wonderful to have A CHORUS LINE back on Broadway. It is also wonderful to have this new recording, which is essentially the entire score. It be nice if \\"And...\\" could have made the cut, but the money hungry producers shouldn't be expected to include that. (Yes, that was sarcasm).The current revival is a wonderful evening in the theatre - but what makes it so wonderful is only PART of what made it so wonderful the first time around. Michael Bennett's choreography and direction are brilliant, and they alone are worth the price of admission. When the show fails, it fails because of the cast. Unfortunately, most of the flaws have been captured on this recording.Some of the orchestrations are bland and sound \\"canned\\" (just as it does in the theatre.) The opening number plays at a DEATHLY pace. Charlotte D'Amboise can't sing. It just doesn't work. Get it if you're a collector, but if you're not - save your money.Get the Original."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLATLINE!","review":"I Loved this show THEN and NOW to experience live. But sadly the revival recording is not half as exciting as the original even if it does have more stuff. It's too clinical and studied sounding. Repeating the dialogue ruins the flow and becomes tedious after one hearing. It's also magnifies why Miss D'Amboise as Cassie never became a first string star. She absolutely sounds like a cat being tortured. Pinched, horrible nasal voice and there's no hiding it even ion the group songs. SAD. I saw this revival and felt the same about her in the theatre. But the album is worth it for the voice of Tony Yazbeck singing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd have to be there","review":"A Chorus Line is one of those musicals you have to see to believe.

My favorite show, hands down. Now I'd like to warn you and say if you love the original cast album, and only know the original cast album, not the show, you might hate this recording, but once you see the show that all changes. I think had a listened to this CD without having seen the show i would have hated it, but having seen the show, i love it. The CD just allows me to take the performance i saw and take it home with me.

YES, BUT ONLY THE ORIGINAL CAST ALBUM","review":"It was, and remains, one singular sensation. A Chorus Line changed the face of American musical theater, with an urbane book by Nick Dante and James Kirkwood and sophisticated yet obvious lyrics and music by Ed Kleban and Marvin Hamlisch. The Pulitzer prize-winning musical has been resurrected in Broadway and on CD . . . And we can't wonder why.

Someone wrote that the arrangements et al were pretty close to the original. Not! There is just something missing here in this production. Perhaps it's the fact that everyone is trying to mirror ... er ... create (re-create) the original. Perhaps it might have been better had they had felt less restricted (in creating a historic theater fable) and had more freedom to get up the energy, drive and passion A CHORUS LINE must have to tell all the stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't say too much good about these sonatas...","review":"I bought both volumes of these sonatas after hearing only the first track and have not for a moment regretted the decision to do so. In college, I had the opportunity to play and become intimately acquainted with these sonatas. Being partial to 'period' performance, I have always been on the lookout for a good 'historically informed' recording and Breitman and Rivest don't fail to deliver. These are sonatas for fortepiano and violin, not violin sonatas and Breitman and Rivest's approach always keeps that cardinal rule of these pieces in mind. The transparent timbre of the gut-strung violin and fortepiano lend a clarity to these sonatas not often found in a lot of other recordings. The impeccable technique of both artists with the judicious use of vibrato by Rivest adds to that clarity. A wonderful opportunity for those who think they don't like period performances to become aquainted with the practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Product Description","review":"Pic's of bowels make them look like 20 oz. sizes.

So all Logitech could do is offer me a refund.I also was beginning to have an issue with the sound going in and out on the right side prior to the breakage described above. Too bad about the poor construction.The sounds was good, and nice features while they worked (which was not long). The noise canceling worked well to reduce airplane noise and passenger chatter. The ability to work as normal headphones once the battery is dead, which is a nice bonus. The case is nice as well, which has pockets for the (enclosed) 2-prong airplane jack adapter, and even a pocket for an iPod.

It even picks up RF from my computer and nearby cell phones, but I continued to use it at my desk to reduce noise while studying. However, in less than a year, the small plastic piece that allows swivel of the ear piece broke when I was trying to adjust for comfort.I am an engineer by profession, so I looked at the joint and realized it was not sturdy enough - a very poor design. I never even traveled with these head phones. Logitech is difficult to contact for support and since I cannot find my receipt, I am out simply of luck.I also noticed this product seems to have disappeared from Logitech web site. Probably because they had so many customer complaints about these problems.This will probably keep me from considering any Logitech products again.

The bass notes are very good and the noise canceling is decent. I thought I could use these for monitoring sound with my videocamera, but the slight buzz (sounds like a slight wind) when you turn on the noise canceling feature is counterproductive.My brother has Bose headphones and they handle a wider range of frequencies much, much better.

On a flight at takeoff (I was requested to turnoff and remove this \\"electronic device\\") they fell off my lap onto a carpeted floor and again the right headphone disconnected and just like the first, dangled limp.

I used them daily at work, an office setting, until, like others, the left swivel attachment broke. As a temporary fix I taped them until it just got on my nerves. The packing slip said that the 1 year replacement was for AFTER the manufacturer's warranty was up; doing my research on Logitech I saw that that period was for 2 years. So I was golden, right? WRONG. I called Logitech and simply because I removed a STUPID little round sticker with a P and three numbers on it from the actual headphones, it voids the warranty. NOWHERE could I find anything telling me NOT to remove this stupid little sticker. And besides, how long would something like that really be expected to last, anyhow?!I'm really fed up with Logitech.

I returned both and tried the Logitechs after doing much research. The phones are comfortable and the passive noise cancellation works well, but the active noise canceling is nothing to write home about. The audio quality is mediocre at best.

It almost makes it impossible to hear the fan next to my desk. I can still hear noises in the room (such as my roommate talking, or a 3-ring binder closing), but this feature lets me listen to music at a much lower volume level than without it.The headphones fit comfortably on me I like the over the ears rather than on the ears setup.The sound quality is good. It is comparable to the Logitech headset that I own with 40mm drivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound quality, but poor build","review":"Bought this pair of headphones before the Christmas holidays to use for my trans-pacific flights. I jumped on it because tigerdirect has such a good deal on a supposedly quality pair headphones from most of the reviews that I read. I have to say that I am disappointed. The sound quality is decent, but that is about it. One plastic piece covering the wire fell off the 2nd day of my usage. Then, the battery seems to run out fairly fast (I had to change my Energizer battery once every 3-4 hours!). I was thinking maybe I got a defective model or something. I already returned this model and will probably spend more to look for a better brand-name headphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cancels noise Poor sound","review":"Does a reasonable job of cancelling background mid & low frequency noise.But sound quality is very poor.I have some $25 old noise cancelling headphones which have much better sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you don't have to return this product.","review":"I ordered the Logitech Noise-Canceling headphones as a Christmas gift for my adult son. When he received them, they were broken (the mounting on one of the earpieces was broken in two). He contacted TigerDirect (the company that shipped the headphones) and they refused to exchange them. They would only accept a return. He returned the item and confirmed they had received the item by 1/14. It took until 1/28 to receive a credit to my account. The headphones might be fine if they work, but this company's customer service is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"humming noise in the right side of headphone","review":"Careful with all the good reviews because I made the choice based upon them. The headphone has a serious flow on noise canceling part. I remember one professional review about this humming sound when you turn it on but did not expect this at all. It burns your ear out simply because it's so damm loud right out of the box. It works turn it off but don't expect high sound quality. My earbud came with HP laptop sounds much better. One star for sturdy case though! Other than that I don't want to waste my time on it. I have to return the same day I got this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the city and good for a trip","review":"My wife and I bought a pair of these before flying from New York City to San Francisco, during Christmas holidays '07. One pair for her, the other one for me, and we couldn't be happier with that decision.If we had bought only one, we would have had problems sharing it.About the trip to SF, I must say that I have never had a more pleasant flight ever!They do cancel the low-range of sounds coming from the engines of the plane and you can really enjoy the music coming from your MP3 player.We also also use them everyday in the subway here in New York. With all the noise, and the loud and crazy people in the subway there's nothing better to just block them out and focus on your music.The chord isn't too long and the headphones aren't too tight so you won't have problems with that either.What else can I say besides that they're pretty damn good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not a GREAT speaker soundwize, its just...fine","review":"Its not a GREAT speaker soundwize, its just...fine. But if you are in an airplane or in a noisy environemnt, is gr8. In other words, if ur in a noisy place where listening to music is impossible, this headset is pretty great, but if you are in your room and feel like listening to music, you wont like the sound :)All in all, its a good headset, battery lasts for weeks. Am talking about like 8 weeks, not 1 or 2. Cheers :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good noise suppression but cable connection was flawed","review":"Cable connection flaw meant you could only hear anything you connected to the headphones through one ear pad and even then the volume didn't go above a whisper. When you pushed the cable end a bit harder into the receptacle on the headphones you heard full sound but the cable connection slipped out and couldn't be made to stay in. Wearing them as noise suppressors worked well on a 1 hour 20 minute plane ride, but there was too much pressure against my ears for it to feel comfortable. I had to return the item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Headphones","review":"These are one really nice set of headphones. They are very comfortable to wear. The sound as far a I am concerned is fantastic. When I am outside running my snowblower I can hear the music just fine.

Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first, but broke after 2 months","review":"So, I was attracted to these earphones because of the price. They seemed like a great deal but the poor quality construction was evident right off the bat. The first pair that I ordered were broken during delivery (right near the top of the \\"U\\"-shaped arm holding the phones in place) so I had to get another pair. They worked great for about 2 moths but after even gentle handling, they finally broke and are now not usable.I'd recommend them only if you get a *really* great deal, but even then, expect to replace them soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Need to Know this Product is Crap","review":"I don't normally write reviews online but I felt I had to in this case. This was a cheaply designed pair of headphones. I bought them about 4 months ago and both sides have since snapped. It was not due to negligence on my part but simply trying to adjust them on both occasions. I would recommend spending more money for quality headphones from another company or even spending less somewhere else because you'll likely end up with a better product.The sound quality wasn't poor but it wasn't excellent either. I would not consider these \\"noise-canceling\\" either. Noise buffering, maybe. They should be advertised as happiness-canceling headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware...","review":"I had these for 6 months and they worked well BUT, the right speaker broke off. Since it was Logitech, I figured they'd stand behind their product but, after several emails it was sorta resolved.

That side just flops over now, not sitting snug against my ear and all sorts of sound gets in. They can no longer function as noise canceling headphones. They weren't abused, or dropped, just not much structure or strength in the design in that area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good earphones but fragile","review":"I found these headphones produce reasonable quality sound and would recommend them except that the folding joint broke on my second flight and trying to get through to Logitech for repairs would make it seem that they are located out of reach of all communication systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Noise Canceling headphones","review":"My husband loves these things! He says they block out most of the sound in his area of work, which is in a cubicle within a building. He uses them for private training videos and listening to music so as not to disturb his cubicle mates. He even uses them at home to block out his kids while he's taking classes online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Logitech product!","review":"I've come to admire Logitech for their quality and innovation. These headphones are the capstone to my experience with their keyboards, mice, PC speakers and AV remote controls. The overall build quality, materials and fit and finish are lacking compared to Bose headphones, but the noise canceling and full sound that comes through is on par, if not better. The travel case is adequately rugged and even has room to store your MP3 player of choice, along with a nice loop to hold a spare AAA battery. Well done Logitech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, great price","review":"Bought these for my husband for Christmas and he and I have both used them on plane trips already. They cut the background sound significantly and the music quality is excellent. The headphones seem well constructed and fold neatly into the carrying case. The case seemed rather large at first, but it really isn't bad to carry in a carry-on bag, plus there is room to stow your iPod in the case. They are great and are priced right. I'm glad I didn't spend $300 on the higher end models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a day of gentle use at the office","review":"The swivel just above the left ear cup broke, leaving it dangling by the wires.

I really haven't used mine much, but my brother loves his. He uses his at his cubicle at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken at the opening","review":"These things are very shoddy. The hinge at the headphone is a weak plastic tube that apparently snapped during the packaging at Logitech.Others have complained that the earpiece was breakable. Ours was broken when the box was opened. This is planned obsolescense in action! In this case it failed before we got it. Don't buy these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I received this product as a gift and was very impressed at first. I listen to music at work, and being able to have the noise from other offices cancelled out was great. However, after a few weeks, the wire connecting the headsets to the Mp3 stopped working. I contacted Logitech, and initiated a warranty replacement. After a few weeks, which was too long in my opinion, I received my new pair, which appeared to be brand new. Again, things were fine at first, but after a while, I started hearing some crackling in the right ear. It wasn't that bad at first, but now, the headsets are not usable. I am very disapointed with the quality of this product. I was impressed at first, but now, I am looking at a different brand. I would recommend that you do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay","review":"I like these headphones. But you need to know two things that have already been mentioned in some of the reviews:1) The noise cancelling does not completely cancell all of the surrounding noise. It cancels the low frequencies...but you will still be able to hear other people when they talk to you (if your music isnt too loud). But I like the noise cancelling feature anyway. It also enhances the bass, which I like.2) These headphones are comfortable, but my ears get hot and red after about one hour of listening.Conculusion: Good value for 60Dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These are worthless","review":"I do speakerphone testing and have noise files on my PC. So I play the noise file and conclude that these are pretty much worthless. They reduce maybe 3 dB of noise at best. And it seems to be lower frequency noise. I found these to be an absolute waste of money. I would do 0 stars if they would let me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"These headphones do stop incoming noise fairly well. They also work with the noise-canceling turned off, which is quite useful They are large, comfortable cans. For the price, they can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I am happy with the DVD and did not find any troubles. Whenever Season two comes out and I certainly will order via you again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Episode.","review":"The previous 5 episodes are well worth watching. This one is not. The plot is pointlessly offensive. It lacks delicacy and nuance. It goes out of it's way to engage in silly stereotypes that are so unrealistic they damage the credibility of the characters.As if that weren't bad enough, there's a bunch of badly edited scenes out in the woods centered around a tripwire that make no sense from any point of view. For example, are the writers so ignorant that they actually think freezers run on LN2? And then everyone runs around getting pretend-shot-at like a bunch of LARPers. Then the scene that made me stop watching: the one in which they decide to run away to beat the claymore tripwire... a bad idea to start with, and then made dumber by the fact that a guy who could have walked out at any time doesn't ... presumably so they can have their 'Lethal Weapon' diving away from the bomb moment. ugh. I'm going to pretend this episode didn't happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!! New show","review":"Basic cable is coming up with some great new stuff and this is one. Love this show, the characters are interesting they do things that make sense and figure out the things that you think any normal person would, imagine that! Hope they keep this one on, really enjoyed the first season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow--What a Strong Woman","review":"Another great episode in this new series. This episode looks at a lady who was convicted of stabbing her husband 47 times and then escapes from jail but putting on an elaborate ruse through a Prison Pen-Pal system. She gets unsuspecting me to come visit her and essentially help plan her escape where she tries to reunite with her son and then escape more permanently. This show just keeps getting better and better in the first season. Jimmy Simpson as Dr. Lloyd really has come into his own in this show and this episode in my opinion was his real breakout in the series. The discussions with his mother on his cell phone are pricelessly funny. Very worthwhile series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent new show with some \\"old friends\\"","review":"\\"Breakout Kings\\" is in its first season on A&E and definitely has the potential to run for several more seasons. The basic premise of the show is that there are a set of convicts with special skills (con-artist, great memory, great fighter, etc.) who are recruited by the Federal Marshall's system to track and bring back to jail escapees. If the are able to bring back an escapee, they get a month shaved off of their current sentence and for participating at all, they move to a minimum security lockup. The show is a great combination of action and humor that feels real but isn't as gory as something you might see on Showtime or HBO. Avid watchers of The Wire will recognize one of the detectives from that excellent show. A great cast of characters. If you were a big Prison Break fan, you don't want to miss Episode 3 (hint: T-Bag). Very worthwhile series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"I originally ordered this tray as a going-away gift for a garden club member.

The topics are treated superficially and the exam software that comes on the CD is buggy. The review questions and exams in the book are not nearly as hard as the real exams. I passed 229 based on my experience as database designer. I flunked 228. To be honest, in the foreword the book states that you need to use the SQL books online as well to prepare for the exams. However on the cover it says all in one is all you need, which is definitely not true. Purchasing this book and studying it is a waiste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!","review":"This book will not prepare you to pass the SQL 200 #70-228 exam. The questions on that exam are much more detailed (scenario-based) than what is offered through the book. You'll think you're cruising right along when you score 90% overall on the practice exams...only to find that the software is telling you that you scored 15 out of 12, or 140% on some section. Additionally, the software will only allow you to select one answer, and will tell you that only one answer is correct, when in fact, there are two correct answers....I can't have any faith in the quality of the book if the exam software is flat out wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least informative reference book ever","review":"This book is the least informative reference book I have ever purchased. The book will not help you pass the MCDBA exams (70-228 and 70-229), nor is it a good reference book for your job. First of all, there are many aspects of T*SQL that are missing. For example, how can one write a book about the Select statement without such basic topics as \\"Having\\" and \\"Group By\\"? Secondly, the information is frequently wrong. Not misinterpreted, but plainly wrong (i.e., SQL*Server will reject your syntax). Finally, the questions in the \\"sample\\" tests have NO relationship to the actual exams. I cannot think of a book that has provided less true information and more misinformation than this one. If I could rate this book with negative stars, I would do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not -At-All-What-You-Need","review":"I wish I had read the other reviews prior to reading this book, because they are right. This book had me thinking I was ready for the exam, when I was actually far from it.To be fair, this is a decent \\"Intro to SQL\\", with plenty of hands on exercises. You do need to be able to trouble shoot however, because some of the examples won't work as written.I feel I'm better off having read this book than I was before I read it, but sad to say, I failed the 70-228 exam. And that's after getting a 98% on the \\"Final Exam\\" included with the book.Oh well, I guess I'll have to find another exam prep book and keep working with SQL.

The answers are often obviously wrong, the hints are not correlated to the questions, it appears the various parts of the exam were written by someone who lacked the knowledge to synchronize them (in a relational database book this is inexcusable). The practice tests have a hard time-out, and when you exit the test it locks-up your machine with an invisible pop-up window.2. The text itself is so unbelievably brief, and so lacking in concrete examples, as to be unusable as either a tutorial or a reference guide. No trace of documentation on any but one feature of DBCC is included; Query Analyzer docs are woefully brief.3. This book will help you FAIL the MCDBA exams. Beyond that, as the other reviewers attest, the content is so off the mark that if you buy it, you will wish you hadn't.4. \\"No Stars\\" is not one of the valid selections. That's my rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing DVD edition","review":"I saw this film first by ordering from Netflix, then decided to buy. This edition is all black and white, although the film was originally one of the first technicolor films, something Fairbanks worked very hard to achieve.

It is totally a \\"just for fun\\" book, as in the fact that you don't exactly glean a lot from reading it other then some humorous moments. Also, the characters are so plainly black and white, good or bad, making it very fairytale/folktaleish. Although I'm glad I got a taste of this type of literature by reading this book, I don't think I'd read another in the series. Give it a try though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Mossflower","review":"This book is about Martin the Warrior. It tells about his life and what happened before Redwall Abbey was even built.

It takes the unification of all the woodland creatures to defeat Zarmina, after they defeat her they start the construction of Redwall Abbey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent book for any age","review":"I'm not kidding, this book is really good! I don't care how old you are, I believe you'll enjoy this one. Easy to read, flows very smoothly the entire time, loveable characters, vivid scenery, and cowardly villians. I really don't know how they can say give this book a reading age of 9-12.. That almost made me not want to read it, but I'm sure glad that I did and look forward to reading the next one.My favorite part of the book? It'd be hard to say, but I'd have to go with the battle between Martin and Queen Tsarmina. There were lots of other great scenes too though. One question I have is why didn't Gingivere ever help in the fight against his evil sister?? He would have been a great help in the fighting besides being able to carry Abbess Germaine quickly back to the injured Martin. I guess he's just a pussycat though.I highly reccomend this book along with Redwall. To anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mossflower Rules!","review":"Mossflower was my favorite book of all time!

Need I say more? Just like the others, this book is excellent, and even in the beginning, it has you caring for the characters or (or in the villainess Queen Tsarmina's case) loathing them. This book keeps you wanting more, and with it's size bigger than usual books, gives exactly that. Out of 5 stars I give it 10! Be sure to check out the other Redwall books also! You won't be disapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awsome adventure of fantasy","review":"Mosslfower is by far one of the best books that I have read from the collection.

Not too mention the description of the food. Brian jacques writes for young adults but the charm enchants older adults as well. You can't help but fall in love with the characters and clear cut protagonists. The antagonists are truly antagonists giving you a stark line between good and evil black and white. Reading this book swept me away. The only fault that I could find in regards to this book is the simplistic plot and character developement. But hey this is a childrens book and I can live with it will all of the other wonderfull things going on it it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the series","review":"Although the original \\"Redwall\\" is probably the best-written novel in the series, one gets the impression that Brian Jacques was still feeling out his style at the time of writing. The original book is a gem of creationism -- it \\"founded\\" the entire world of Redwall -- but it is in the follow-up prequel, \\"Mossflower,\\" that Jacques truly masters his art.\\"Mossflower\\" features the best hero (Martin's first appearance) and by far the best villain (the deliciously evil Tsarmina). It also contains the best epic journey (the original trek from Mossflower to Salamandastron) and the best final battle (Martin's unforgettable encounter with Tsarmina). And as an added bonus, Jacques wrote himself into this novel, in the form of the mousethief Gonff.The world of Redwall is an enchanting one, but in the later books Jacques seems to be running out of originality. For his heroic style in all its original glory, \\"Mossflower\\" is as good as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"The *BEST* of Fantasy!","review":"One of the Redwall \\"Classics\\" with a gripping plot, plenty of suspense and great descriptions and timing.

It has lots of action and is an interesting prelude to Redwall.Martin is captured by Tsarmina and thrown in the dungeons.He manages to escape with the help of Gonff the Mousethief.You'll find out what happens next when you read the book.The only reason I don't like this book is that they put a wildcat as a villian.Didn't they also put a feline in Redwall but as one of the good guys?(Sir Gingivere,I think)Other than that,the book was fine. I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE the Redwall series and I have almost all of the books!I would recommend this to anyone that loves adventures with animals in them.Excellent job,Brian Jacques!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed","review":"As an older person I can say that I probably loved this book just as much as a young person. It has all the action from beginning to end. It also has it many humorous parts along with sad parts. I could not put this book down and stayed up into the early hours reading this one. I hope all the other redwall books are just as good and plan on getting one by one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mossflower!!!!!!!","review":"This book is an AWESOME fantasy novel! It has lots of action, perfect decriptions, one really evil character(tsarmina), one funny and likeable character(gonff), a hero(martin) and a ton of great supporting characters! Mossflower is one of the best fantasy books I have ever read! I can't wait to read the rest of the redwall books because they all sound good too! So buy Mossflower if you are into exciting, descriptive fantasy novels because this is the perfect example of one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as bad as Legend of Luke...","review":"This book... stinks. This book... is not good. This book... I'll stop now. As you probably guessed from the title, I don't like this book. I never will. It is dull in comparasin to other of Brian's greats such as Mariel of Redwall, or Redwall for that matter. As one can come to expect, the baddies are helpless jerks. They attck each other in the middle of the knight, and rush out of doors that they know have arrows flying at them. The only half bright bad guy is Bane, a leader of a group of mercinaries. There is a totally needless insertion of a half blind eagle into the book who dies without doing any damage. [Well, he takes Bane with'im]. I fail to see how a giant wildcat can be scared into death by a mouse. This book is as exciting to read as it is to watch paint dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inflated Reviews","review":"I had read Redwall and enjoyed it greatly. This book was very disappointing. It was so slowly paced I have not read any others in the series despite strong recommendations from friends. I'll take Tolkien."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite, but definately one of the best!","review":"I don't know what it was about this book that made me want to read it over and over again. It didn't have any colosal {I don't know if I spelled that right} battles or anything. I guess it was just the amazing storyline! The adventure was fantastic, but I honestly like whats going on with the woodlanders better than Martin the warriors journy, more action happens with them. In all, this is one of the best Redwall books, complete with an awesome one on one battle at the end. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mossflower","review":"This is in my opinion one of the best Redwall books. The story of a band of woodland creatures resisting the tyrannical reign of the evil wildcat queen Tsarmina, this book has lots of fighting and battle scenes. It is also the first book in which Martin the Warrior appears, the heroic mouse from the northern coast destined to free Mossflower from the cat's oppressive rule! This is the first Redwall book I ever read and it is one of my favorite books of all time! I would give it ten stars if I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is awsome!","review":"This is the best book in the series that Brian Jacques has written. I encourage everyone to read this series, especially this book. Parents will love reading this to their children or having their children read it in less then a week. Definate book to reread every so often. Again this book and the series is awsome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book in the universe!","review":"I have read many, many, great books. Mossflower would totally be at the top of the list! I started reading it, and I just couldn't put it down! The plot and characters draaw you in, until you fell like you are in Mossflower woods, helping Martin, young Dinny, and Gonff find Salamandstrom. This book is amazing, and I definitely reccomend it for ages 6 and up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love the \\"Redwall\\" series.","review":"The kids love them and I enjoy reading them to the children.

I have now begun the series for another, younger grandson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Really good!","review":"Hi. I read the book Mossflower by Brain Jacques. It is an excellant book! Gonff is hillarious and I was laughing so hard I had tears! This is a fabulous book and I am strongly recommending it to you! I'm reading it for the 2nd time now! If you like Brian Jacques, you'll definitly like Mossflower!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST REDWALL YET!!","review":"This book was incredible. How Martin the Warrior fights the wildcat Queen to the end is just wonderful! \\"Your father made a just decision, but yours was the right one.

Great album for kicking back with a cold one, or spending time with your girlfriend. I like 'Watch Out For Lucy' best, but the whole album moves me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes.","review":"A very fine album. Judging from the reviews it is getting here, though, it apparently is very much overlooked!While Slowhand is better, this is DEFINITELY worth adding to your collection if you are a Clapton fan.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A underrated gem","review":"Unfortunately, this album is underrated, however it's one of the best albuns of erics'carer.I don't understand why many claptons fans tkink that a mediocre albun like SLOWHAND is better than this ......Backless is amazing......good rock songs, great covers of two dylan's songs and the fantastics tell me that you love me and promises......Surely, one of the five better albuns of Mr Clapton!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this one!","review":"Great kinda mellow rock album. One of my favorite 70's recordings and I like it more and more as my tastes mellow and a bit of a country rock twang sounds good to me. May have to buy it on CD one day -- Lord knows how long the vinyl will hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"I bought a copy of the vinyl-disc version of this for one dollar at a used record store last year. It has two good songs, the country hit \\"Promises\\" and \\"Watch Out For Lucy\\". The rest is not worth listening to once. (Oh, \\"Tulsa Time\\" and \\"Roll It\\" are okay, I guess.)Recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by JEFF BURNS."},{"rating":"1","title":"not Claptons' Finest","review":"Not one of EC's best, the 1977 album, Slowhand is much stronger if one wants to hear some Clapton from this era. Just One Night is also a better option as it contains several live versions of songs from Backless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak recording with 2 or 3 good tracks","review":"I read a rolling stone review of this album back when it came out and it was the most hilarous thing I've ever seen! Something about this album being a non-entity and that Clapton records the transference of a cigarette from one hand to another and its 10th rate Fleetwood mac and that the band sounds like a hawaiian karoake performance. It's pretty lame - weak and his vocals go out of tune. Tulsa time, Watch out for lucy, and promises are about all there is here - the rest of it can pretty much go away. Golden ring is his attempt to create another wonderful tonight and it falls short. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not EC's best","review":"Compared to his greatest CD's incl. Slowhand and others, Backless is little more than a mistake. Its title refers to Clapton's description of Bob Dylan, that he had eyes in the back of his head, that he was in fact \\"Backless.\\" This CD is obviously under the influence of alcohol and God-knows-what-else and it shows. Only Golden Ring, again written for Pattie Boyd (ie \\"Layla\\") shows some heart. Skip this one for one of his greatest hits packages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"This CD was my introduction, a few years back, to both Teagarden and Russell. I was hooked instantly on both, and have amassed quite a bit of music by both since then. Russell was one of the great individualists in jazz. No one sounded like him. Teagarden, apart from being one of the all-time bosses of the 'bone, may be my favorite male jazz singer as well. If you are at all interested in this era of jazz, this CD is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be great if only...","review":"-they hadn't designed it to attach to your phone with a coiled wire. why not just a shorter straight wire? i wanted a retractable thing so that i wouldn't have to fight with the wire anymore. i'm still fighting it.-it weren't as big as my phone-the earbud weren't so delicate. the only reason i'm still using it is because, after the first one i bought utterly failed after about 10 minutes of use... and i argued with customer service for an hour or two, sent it back to nokia, and demanded my money back... they then sent me a new one. this one still works after a year... but i'm careful with it when i argue with the wire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"Your 7 series key does not fit on this chain!!!!!

I like it, but when I had a few seconds the other day to flicker through Keller, I realized that this book would probably have been the better choice. Perhaps I'll start with it after having finished Wheelock's. I have a question, though: is there a key to the workbook that independent learners can use?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent textbook","review":"I've been using this textbook for nearly two terms and I'm extremely happy with it. The writing is clear and very readable, and the original Latin texts are very helpful. If I don't understand something the professor said, I always refer to this book and with the workbook and all its extensive exercises, you'd be extremely prepared for reading Latin."},{"rating":"2","title":"The actual text","review":"This is the best textbook that I have ever read. It has clear explanations of latin grammar and what the eng grammar means. Worth every penny if you want to learn latin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classics - Latin","review":"This book has been really helpful. I'm using it for my Latin course and have had no qualms with it and it has been a perfect guide. It's very easy to understand and the workbook that comes with it is immensely helpful. If you do the drills along with the chapters, you will fully comprehend the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best movie.....","review":"I had seen this movie before and I thought I really liked it so I ordered the DVD. I was pretty disappointed once I watched it again, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Howard's End","review":"Few filmmakers capture period detail like James Ivory. Here, Hopkins is personification of upper-class British reserve, while Emma Thompson is radiant in Oscar-winning performance. Vanessa Redgrave portrays Hopkins dying wife with poignancy, and Helena Bonham Carter is suitably fiery as Thompsons modern sister. Literate, human drama of the first order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"5 stars for the movie. One star for this disc. I bought this to upgrade from the previous release on DVD which was a very good quality DVD. As this was Criterion and Blu-ray I expected the best print yet of one of my favorite films. To my disappointment this disc if full of snowy grain and flickering in any of the darker scenes. The opening shot of Vanessa Redgrave walking around the house in the evening is ruined with a blizzard of snowy grain. Some of the scenes have a grid-like band across them. I am assuming this is from a defective batch as I see other people are having similar problems. Yet other people seem to not have problems so obviously not all discs released are bad. I, however will be returning this piece of junk. If there is a better disc out there I would like a replacement otherwise I just want a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merchant Ivory Masterpiece","review":"I never tire of this film. The acting,the marvelous filming locations, the costumes.... perfection. I can't watch it without wanting to have a cup of tea and a hot scone to accompany the viewing. In fact, I once stopped the video, baked scones, and continued to watch it while munching a freshly baked scone and a cuppa. Try it. I now own the DVD also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic - Must See!!","review":"This is one of my favorite films, truly a classic film. Emma Thompson, Anthony Hopkins, and Helena Bonham Carter, and Vanessa Redgrave do an outstanding job, as always. The story is interesting and it makes one think of how this would have indeed been quite a scandal back during this time! I love the costumes....and the houses are amazing, all of them from the townhouses in London to Howards End to the Aunt's house by the sea. If you love period films, this one in one of the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"Don't get me wrong. I love period pieces. I loved \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", \\"A Room With a View\\", \\"Remains of the Day\\", etc.... This one, however, escapes me. I keep telling myself I need to see it again because so many out there seem to love it. It almost put me to sleep. I've seen Emma Thompson, Anthony Hopkins, Helena Bonham Carter, as well as Vanessa Redgrave better in so many other films. I personally found Thompson's performance rather dull and Bonham Carter, I felt, was close to terrible. Oh well. I'll check it out one more time and if I was wrong I'll change my review. However, if I wasn't, I certainly will add to this pan. See ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to look at is all","review":"Beautiful scenery, nice costumes, great acting, and handsome people, without a good storyline do not a great movie make."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 hours of mediocrity","review":"***Full disclosure - I'm a film student***I just watched the movie, it was very difficult to force myself to watch the entire thing.I have never seen a more dull movie. I had to take several breaks to go do something more interesting.I really cannot fathom how anyone found this film to be exciting, interesting, or in any way memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"If you like watching a continuous downhill slide, this is the movie for you. The central characters are a bunch of pathetic, utterly passive and helpless victims who you know from the first moment are going to get screwed, and that is what you end up watching for the next 2 hours. Sure there's wonderful cinematography and acting, but the story and characters themselves are simply nauseating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply terrible!","review":"As an Anthony Hopkins fan, I rented this acclaimed film. IT WAS AWFUL! The acting was pretty good, but the story did not ascend, it descended! It was way too long, and, consequently, a movie that achieves only one good thing: MANAGING TO PUT YOU TO SLEEP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Boring drama, almost felt asleep. I can't stand no longer the great actress Emma THompson doing this lousy dramas, thinking they are masterpieces. It's plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible blu-ray transfer of a fantastic film","review":"For those of you who already own this movie in SD, save your money on this Criterion release. It is horrible, nearly unwatchable in places ~ like watching a movie through a curtain. Criterion should be ashamed of themselves for resting on their laurels.Amazon should STOP importing comments from other releases and media when giving stars to a specific item. The well deserved 5 star ratings from the SD disc are making it look as if this blu-ray release is being well received, which is not the case. Of the 65 5 star reviews posted to date, I counted only THREE which were written for this horrific blu-ray release by Criterion. The other 62 are from the prior SD, VHS and Merchant-Ivory Collection releases.Buyer Beware with this Blu-ray release. Apparently we can no longer assume that Criterion = Good Quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray image quality worse than DVD!!!","review":"I pre-ordered this BluRay and to my disappointment, at certain spots, e.g. at several outdoor scenes, I see severe pixelation and 'snow storm; artifacts. Why pay extra to see an inferior image? I wonder if it is the remastering or this particular disc I got, but this kind of quality is deeply disappointing. I certainly had no such problems with 'A Passage to India' and ' A Room with a View'. My BluRay player is a top of the line machine so I am sure it's not my hardware. So what's wrong?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLU-RAY IS HORRIBLE - NEARLY UNWATCHABLE!","review":"This is one of our favorite films, so were were naturally excited to be able to order it on Blu-Ray - particularly with the boast that the cinematographer supervised the transfer. Sadly, it's an absolutely atrocious transfer. We thought we'd just gotten a defective disc, and had Amazon send us another. But, the problems were the same with both discs. Basically, every scene that isn't in bright sunlight (and there are many) is nearly unwatchable. It's filled with the most distracting ghosting and video noise. Absolutely appalling. Furthermore, and equally maddening, the sound isn't quite synced correctly. It's not off enough to seem completely wrong, just enough to drive you slightly mad. I'm really shocked. I've never had this happen with a Blu-Ray, and never had to write a review like this. Do not buy this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"for the blu-ray. 5 stars for the film.","review":"Despite what some deficient Amazon reviewers and Criterion say, this blu-ray release is a disaster. There is \\"snow\\" (digital noise, NOT film grain) and image jittering throughout the entire film. Either the mastering or disc manufacturing was defective. I have played three copies on two blu-ray players and the problems were always the same. However, the real reason I am writing this review is to recommend that it be played at 720p instead of 1080p. The definition is not the same of course, but all the visual problems disappear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film full of English dress and traditions.","review":"Another beautiful film by the combo of Merchant Ivory. Photography makes the countryside in England come alive with the romance and conflicts of Thompson and Hopkins. Film makes you think about class differences throughout time and all over the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is fantastic; the Blu-ray transfer is atrocious.","review":"Despite what Criterion may say, there is a fault with this disc. They have said you need to calibrate your set, or that you shouldn't watch the disc on vivid and sharp mode. But lowering these settings is not enough to get rid of all the digital noise on this disc, and it's the only blu-ray I've ever come across that looks this bad. I encourage you to rent the disc before you buy it, so you can see for yourself.I hate giving one star to a movie this good. But the Blu-ray is not even worthy of that one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, the blu-ray disappoints","review":"I bow to no one in my love for this film, based not only upon its obvious merits but also the Forster novel it is faithfully based on. (Some reviewers don't seem to be aware of this original source.)But, having labored mightily to calibrate both my LCD tvs properly, I must add my voice to those who have problems with this transfer.None of my other Blu-rays seem to have such soft processing nor do they seems as unfaithful in terms of color.I remember an astonishingly beautiful film. Perhaps the actual film stock M/I used was subpar, turning many fleshtones pink and lacking the warmth one would expect from proper color temperatures. It's a disappointment from Criterion.It's always possible that a cost-conscious producer made the original decision to utilize inferior film stock, but I somehow doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not watch it yet !","review":"I bought this for my mother-in-law for her birthday. She had been looking for it everywhere. I waited for the price to drop and it never did ..... why ? Is this movie that great ?? First of all, it has a few different names, descriptions and covers which confused me a bit, but she said it was the right movie and enjoyed it, which is all that matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howards End as a Recurring Character","review":"Well-loved story and exquiste settings and surroundings make for a multi-layered drama.The lush countryside makes the different seasons Howards End progresses through set moodsthat range from cozy to dark and stormy. Beautiful movie to look at but definitely more ofa \\"womens' movie\\" that one most men would sit through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still an interesting film just over long","review":"Normally I would not be interested in a film like this.I just happened to watch it on cable in the 1990's and thought it was interesting.Story really of three families. Yes, you do have to count the Bast's. I did not like those characters the Bast's. Feel sorry for them because they kept doing things wrong. Leonard was mad at the world. No, not for me.Emma did deserve her Oscar for the role.The whole story with these families based on a house in the country. You just have to watch it. Yes, everything in the film based on his house.The one thing I fault the film on is being over long.This is an early DVD so NO extras on it.Good to see the film wide screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Merchant Ivory","review":"This is without question one of the best of the Merchant Ivory Collaborations though I must confess I think all their movies are wonderful. This film is a great adaptation of a classic book. It's always uplifting when a movie compliments the book, expecially when the book is as great as this one. Emma Thompson is just amazing in this movie, her character goes through some real trails, but really I think this movie belongs to Hopkins, his character is so complex and at times you really want to like him and even in the end I kind of felt for him and that's really saying something considering his betrail. I also enjoyed the singular Vanessa Redgrave, she breaths life into her character and can almost feel her pain, it's a fantastic performance. Director Ivory does his typical fine work and the cinematography is spectacular, you really feel you are in Edwardian England, really a spendid work of art..highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray transfer awful","review":"I have to agree with some of the other reviews, the picture quality of the Blu-ray transfer is abysmal- grainy with dark colors and snowy at other times as though viewing through gauze...Criterion should be ashamed. Otherwise an excellent period piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is GREAT!","review":"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!!! Not only is my favorite actor in it(Sir Anthony Hopkins) who gives a brilliant performance as usual but the story is quite strong, also. Normally I don't enjoy period pieces too much but the acting in this film is spectacular! I love the way that Thompson plays a character that is strong, independent and yet so weak when it comes to her husband(Hopkin's). If you have enjoyed Hopkins and Thompson's work before you will not be dissapointed by this great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scott Brock","review":"As a motion picture industry professional, I am appalled at this transfer. Given the overall flatness of the base image, it was obvious that the transfer was from the original negative, or internegative (IP/IN). There is extreme noise in the shadows, manifested by a breathing oscillation in those areas, as if the Criterion/DI colorist was working with bad calibration parameters and either deliberately or unwittingly jacking up the shadows to an extreme - and artificial - level.It is unwatchable.I would have given it a rating of zero stars, but that was not an option in the dropdown textbook.What is wrong with Criterion, anyway? Their black-and-white transfers (SEVENTH SEAL and 8 1/2) are utterly sublime. On my Pioneer Elite Kuro plasma I feel as if these films have that wonderful motion picture film-theater look-and-feel. Color materials, however, seem to be problematic for them; THE LAST EMPEROR was abominable: blown out highlights and very murky shadows.- Scott Brock"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Blu-ray Transfer","review":"There is something terribly wrong with this transfer. Every time there is a dark scene, I see lots of speckles and grains in the picture. And I am not just being picky. I have never seen anything this bad in any blu-ray (or DVD) release. I am shipping my copy back to Criterion for an explanation and hopefully a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Emma's Best","review":"and not really Anthony's, either. I borrowed the VHS from a friend anticipating a lovely, two-hour or so film with rich, well-developed characters, beautiful scenery, and a riveting storyline. I guess one out of three's not bad.Howards End promises a lot but underdelivers. With Emma Thompson, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and Helena Bonham-Carter in the lead roles, one expects a more interesting film or at the very least, an exciting climax. One gets neither. This film plods along for over two hours, much like an overworked carthorse stumbling through the English countryside. By the end, all one wants is some oats and a night's sleep in the barn. What disappointed me most was Bonham-Carter's performance. She is much better at edgy hysteria than what she shows here.Even the climax was dull. (In case you still want to see this film, I won't give it away.)In this reviewer's opinion, if you want a good Merchant Ivory flick, watch A Room with a View instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad DVD","review":"Dragon Inn ranks high among costume martial arts films, and anyone who enjoys kooky, gravity-defying action scenes will enjoy it. The middle sags and the cannibalism subplot doesn't add much, but the battle at the end during a sandstorm is a must-see, as well as a beautifully balletic scene in which Brigette Lin and Maggie Cheung spar. Unfortunately, this \\"remastered\\" DVD is really just another Tai Seng rush job with a really grainy picture. It doesn't look much better than VHS. This movie deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Infamous \\"Dragon Inn\\"","review":"Brigitte Lin is in her usual spectacular role as a kung fu master along with Tony Leung Ka-Fai (\\"Island Of Fire\\"). Lin is truly a great actress with \\"Police Story\\", \\"The Bride With White Hair\\", \\"The Bride With White Hair 2\\", and \\"Swordsman 2\\" to name a few impressive titles. She really is quite a martial artist on screen. She's very graceful and has a strong presence as a leading role. The amazing Donnie Yen (\\"Iron Monkey\\") is also in this film, though he's only at the beginning and end of the movie, he made his scenes effective. The last fight scene with Yen agains Lin, Leung, and Maggie Cheung (\\"Supercop\\") in the desert is quite outstanding. So venture into the desert and rest your head in the dragon inn, but beware...you might not last the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent Swords Play","review":"This is one of the best Kung Fu movies I have ever seen. The fight scenes were amazing and memorable. If your a Donnie Yen fan you will have to wait till the end. But when Donnie Breaks out. He breaks Out.

It is truly a joy to see her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drag On Inn!","review":"The description of this dvd led me to expect a movie like \\"Musa\\" or \\"Warriors of Heaven and Earth\\"--I'd have even been happy with a movie comparable to \\"Crouching Tiger\\"--this movie isn't up to the standards of any of these movies though. More of a farce than anything close to an \\"adventure\\"-the scenery is wasted with a lame plot that drags on and makes the movie seem about twice as long as it really is. Perhaps if my own expectations had been lower--I wouldn't be so harsh on this movie--but compared to \\"Musa\\" or \\"Warriors of Heaven and Earth\\"--it's defintely sub standard. Different strokes--as they say--perhaps you'll enjoy this movie--I didn't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only inn where human flesh is served.","review":"This is the best kung fu movie that \\"I've\\" ever seen!

I was excited to see a movie that combined their talents, but \\"Dragon Inn\\" was a big disappointment. The plot was too absurd for my liking, the characters felt a little two-dimensional and the fight scenes were only a fraction of what they could have been. However, some people really like this movie a lot. My recommendation would be to rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased.","review":"I wasn't pleased with this film at all. It didn't have nearly as much kung fu as I thought it would have. It is mainly a drama/adventure movie. It is comparable to Crouching Tiger, but Crouching Tiger still has a better plot and more kung fu fighting scenes. Donnie Yuen is not even in the movie that much. He doesn't even fight untill the last 15 min. of the movie (which is realy the only 15 min. of the movie worth watching). This is one of those movies that you watch when you need something to help you fall asleep. Oh, and did I mention that it is a fantisy movie. The kung fu that they do in the movie is a bunch of flying around and throwing darts at each other. If there is anyone out there that wants a \\"like new\\" copy of this movie, E-mail me and I will consider a trade. $9.99 sounds like a reasonable selling price to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor, poor, under the over the top par movie (understand?)","review":"This is the worst movie I ever purchased - EVER!! the fights consist of mindless rambling and funny-looking evil ballerinas being buired to their heads in a sandstorm only to charge 20 yards through the sand (still head-deap) and impale androgenous women while barbarians peel the skin off of their limbs with 3 foot wide swords. what a dissapointment. and don't get me wrong I luv totally over the top HK swordfights, but go watch something worthwhile like Storm Riders or the Duel, and 4 all u HK newbies: CT, HD.

Disappointed! I do have a number of older - seventies - Chinese movies on DVD that are much worse, mind you, but those older movies were usually less than ten dollars, often closer to five.The movie itself probably warrants four stars, but again, the price for this \\"bootleg\\" quality DVD is about double what it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"MADNESS!

Sure, the plot starts off all normal action-packed asskicking ragged heroes set against an impossible foe, and even retains a bit (a very little bit!) of sanity up until about the last five minutes. Unfortunately, out of respect for the amazon guidelines about not ruining the plot I had to erase most of what I have ti say about that, but those poor souls like myself who have just watched it and have come to read and write reviews in order to regain sanity know what... I thought I was jaded to movies, and if this doesn't spin you head around for you, I don't know what will. Have fun!Keep in mind: I gave this film 5 stars, it is a wonderful, mad experience that no one should miss, in a realm all of it's own.

The psychological warfare at the Dragon Gate Inn is very well done, with each party trying to fake the other one out. Some very good fights.

A wonderful performance by Bridgette Lin (\\"Chungking Express,\\" \\"Peking Opera Blues\\"). Maggie Cheung (\\"Chinese Box,\\" \\"Irma Vep\\") is also good.

It is presented as a series of comments from the actual participants of theatresports. While covering such topics as the history of the movement, its spread worldwide, women in theatresports, favorite games, and the future of the art, it gives both affirming and dissenting opionions about this particular form of improvision. While some revere Johnstone as a guru, others mention his sometimes inflexible attitudes. Some follow his lead while others choose their own path. This book is an interesting read, in that it gives you the opinions of those who are actually involved. It is not, however, a book about acting technique.

In addition, someone fiddled with the album cover. It's not the same. They should not have done that. I've been a Van Morrison fan for about 34 years now. If you really want to appreciate THEM, try the original vinyl with a decent turnatable (maybe a Dual 1019).. a quality stylus (perhaps a Shure V15 Type II), and some Fisher XB7b's (Avery Fisher, that is, not the post 1975 garbage). Gently drop your tone arm on track two on side one, MYSTIC EYES, the best Van Morrison song ever, and turn up the volume... LOUD! Forget this CD they're pushing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Oregon?","review":"It seems that the great fusion band has given itself to noodling... There are only two listenable, engaging compositions on this album - The Rapids and By The Brook, which are classic Oregon - lyrical, expansive, melodic. The rest of the tracks (I won't call them songs) are little more than experiments in atonality, which exist on every Oregon album, but not in such great numbers. Usually there is more variety - you get three or four lyrical, beautiful group pieces, a couple of equally pretty duets, a piano or guitar solo piece, a jazzier tune, and a couple of noodlers which go nowhere. Well, this album is jam-packed with the latter, unfortunately. I am not against dissonance, you find some of it in many excellent Oregon tunes, but unless you love dissonance for its own sake, there is way too much of it here. Probably the worst Oregon album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonathan Makes Me Cry!","review":"This album is on my top ten! If you have never seen Jonathan live, I suggest you do the first chance you get! These are the songs anyone with a heart and soul can truly relate to!

He can do the Velvet Underground almost better than they could themselves! \\"Tandem Jump\\" and \\"I Was Dancing in the Lesbian Bar\\" are the rockin' and rollin' pick me ups. I've only seen him live once, but when he played Lesbian Bar he got DOWN complete with fan kick! I am going to see him over Labor Day weekend in Seattle and I can hardly wait! I'd highly recommend almost any of his albums, but this one is my favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it up","review":"Having worn out two original 1970 cast albums, it's hard for any other version to live up to comparisons. Whether or not you agree with the pared-down concept, the execution was eye-opening, fresh and contemporary. And no matter how high expectations were built, we still were stunned by Raul Esparza's Bobby - one of the most memorable performances of this generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Side by Side with great Company","review":"I had seen this production in early 2008 when it aired on PBS and fell in love with the music. The production was beautiful, so when I bought this album I knew what i was in for. This CD is definitively one of the best recordings of a Sondheim show. It is expansive and yet intimate, it is polished and refined and yet modern and at sometimes bitingly truthful about marriage and being single and for that matter being alive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"This is a super recording of one of my least favorite musicals (perhaps because shows that come close to real-life issues are much less entertaining than, say, The Wedding Singer). Raul Esparza is wonderful in the lead, and every cast member is highly talented. There are a few new songs in this production, and the recording is sparkling clear. A must have for any Broadway collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Orchestration & Vocal","review":"Economics no doubt dictated the size of the orchestra and thats too bad. As someone who grew up on the original recording with Jonathan Tunick's orchestrations, I am forever disappointed with the sound of the revivals.The orchestras sound thin and don't have any of the magic coloring of Tunick's genius. Although I love distillations of big works by ensemble orchestras, the sound of the revivals have no appeal to me. Too, its a tough thing to match the voices in the original production and maybe unfair to compare them. It just seems that everyting was just so right with the OBC. Newcomers to Company, however, will no doubt be enchanted by this CD as I was 37 years ago by the original which is so burned into me that I am incapable of enjoying the revivals."},{"rating":"1","title":"BADBADBAD","review":"This is such an abysmal show. Yes, Stephen, we understand that you can write music, but next time, try to get a lead who can actually sing that music. The first song I listened to on this soundtrack was Being Alive, sung by Raul Esparza, and I had to switch it off. Unfortunately, after taking a breath, I had to turn it back on again, 1. for morbid fascination, and 2. because I had to learn it. Needless to say, I decided to do a different song. If you want a good musical, go get [title of show], a brilliant new musical comedy. If it has to be Stephen Sondheim, try Into the Woodsor Assassins (the revival). And if you just want a musical in which people both sing and accompany themselves, the revival of Sweeny Todd with Patti Lupone is AMAZING. Save yourselves the pain that is this musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sondheim's a Genius!","review":"This is a great musical production, but beyond that, I keep being impressed by Sondheim's ability to capture and express the tenderness and pain and joy of human relationships.

The sparse orchestration does not suit these powerful scores. As for these singers, they simply don't cut it. Maybe it's just that I'm accustomed to the original cast albums; for example, I think Len Cariou has one of the greatest singing voices in the business. Doyle's approach isn't fresh, it's just self-indulgent. It is simply a matter of \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\" In short, the Doyle's \\"Sweeney\\" and \\"Company\\" are bloody awful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This recording is passionless; phoned in.I love creative revivals, but this is horrible.The idea of using musicians as actors may have worked in Sweeney, but this is lame.Take some valium instead of listening to this CD, it will have the same effect.How in Gods name did Sondheim approve of this brilliant score being put through this meat grinder?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Company?","review":"This recording is not great company. I'm really confused: is it a Broadway recording or a very poor amatuer recording? And if so, did this rubbish actually make it to the Broadway stage? I feel for the people that saw it, and were expecting the rich full melodies that Sondheim produced for this show. The Musical Director for this abomination should be called a Mutilation Director, because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show. So the only advice I give to future Musical Directors that want to revive and revamp a show: If it's not broke, please, please, please don't try and fix it! Some things are just perfect the way they are. Don't buy this CD. I did and it is now a coaster where it gets better use."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Follow-Up to \\"Black Orpheus\\"","review":"\\"In Person\\" continued the sound of Vince Guaraldi's 1962 masterpiece, \\"Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus.\\" Despite being a \\"live\\" album, the audience noise has been removed, and this is all original material.Vince Guaraldi created one of the most original, distinctive, and joyous sounds in jazz piano. This work - like his others - deserves a wider audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Jazz CD","review":"I've been listening to this CD for over 6 months now... religiously (at least once every other day ... no joke.) I mainly listen because this is the best rendition of \\"On Green Dolphin Street\\" performed by any jazz artist. Period. I've also enjoyed his ability to incorporate different styles of music and make them his own (like in the CD \\"From Both Sides\\"). He does this here as well with the latin rythms he weaves into several songs on this recording. You must buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"More atmosphere than substance","review":"The most distinctive thing about this album is the cover design, which reflects the fact this was a compilation of two different live sets: one, a standard jazz set featuring his trio; the other an expanded line-up venturing into Cal Tjader territory, with acoustic guitar (Eddie Duran, who doesn't take any solos here but keeps the Latin groove chugging along) and some heavy-handed percussion.The sound quality isn't great, but in a way this adds a kind of documentary flavour to the proceedings - snapshots of typical club sets somewhere in late 50s/early 60s San Francisco when Latin and pop jazz was ubiquitous in venues such as the \\"Blackhawk\\" or the \\"Hungry i\\".But I can't help wondering if the original LP was little more than a quickly-issued follow up to Guaraldi's suprise hit, Cast Your Fate To The Wind (a.k.a Jazz Impressions Of Black Orpheus), such is the triviality and brevity of some of these tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I'm not much into the salsa stuff, and this album is full of it. There are only 2 or 3 songs that are straight up. That being said, I really like Vince and it was probably worth the 10 bucks just to hear him play \\"On Green Dolphin Street\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The encore is here","review":"I just want to point out that the two reviews mentioning the missing encore are incorrect; the encore (part IIc) was left off the original WEA release, but is present on Universal's reissue. So the version of \\"The Koln Concert\\" currently available is the complete edition. (I believe the encore was actually restored on the BMG version, after the outcry over its deletion. WEA committed many such sins in the early CD era-- Chick Corea and Gary Burton's \\"In Concert, Zurich\\" lost an entire side from the original 2-LP set.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and empty, it's a hollow shell.","review":"I have to offer a dissenting view. Jarrett's playing goes round in circles. He never delivers the goods. This is mood music with pretensions. His vocalized groanings as he plays are distracting and irritating. I attended a solo concert of his in the early 1980s and felt the same way. I think he is way overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"Keith Jarret is a must for anyone who likes good jazz, and I find that concert special - the music means more and more every time I listen to it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"I truely dislike this solo CD, no matter that it is rated highly in all printed and Amazon reviews that I've read. Jarrett rambles on and on and on and grunts and groans his way to a long and welcomed end. And, it's not very good piano playing either. Were the other reviewers asleep when listening to \\"Koln Concert\\"? I pride myself in being open minded and musically literate but I cannot in good faith recommend this disc. If you want to listen to 1970s Jarrett, please try \\"Belonging\\" or \\"Expectations\\". Neither are solo Jarrett but both are excellent. Jarrett is at his best coupled with other great musicians. Also, excellent piano solos by other artists from the same time period include Paul Bley's \\"Open to Love\\" (ECM/ 1972) and Chick Corea's \\"Piano Improvisations\\" (ECM/ 1971)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely and engrossing .... but it ain't jazz","review":"These extended pieces for solo piano are lovely examples of spontaneous composition. As such, they make involving, even engrossing listening, as Jarrett, with a gently propulsive drive and sustained invention, creates tuneful vamps and explores feelings and textures from classical to minimalist to pop. What there isn't is anything resembling jazz feeling, whether based in swing or in the avant garde. The result is almost a genre unto itself, and, as such, it rather leads the listener into a dead end. But it's a nice trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technically awe-inspiring but ... too many notes?","review":"It may be sacrilege to criticise the album that broke Jarrett into the jazz bestsellers league, but when I feel in the mood for listening to a Jarrett CD, I almost never pick this one. I love Jarrett's rapid right-hand runs in the group context -- e.g. in 1976's THE SURVIVORS' SUITE, recorded a year after KOLN -- but I find them dizzying in a solo setting.Compare the number of piano key depressions per minute on KOLN with a later work like DARK INTERVALS (1987) or THE MELODY AT NIGHT WITH YOU (recorded in 1999 after suffering the agonies of ME), and you'll likely get a hit rate some four times faster.Yes, I own some New Age CDs by the likes of George Winston and Philip Aaberg, and I rarely listen to those either. Jarrett is streets ahead of both of these, and other jazz imitators like Lyle Mays. But if I want to hear 1970s solo Jarrett, I tend to choose BREMEN LAUSANNE or even wade into SUN BEAR CONCERTS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless musical document !","review":"Impressive and definitively shocking must have been in the emotive memories of this fortunate people who assisted to that outstanding concert on 24 January 1975. .Jarrett has been one of these musical stars profoundly concerned in searching the future echoes .

If that seems silly, then you undoubtedly have never listened to The Koln Concert. It is inspiration at its finest. Keith Jarrett masterfully takes simple themes and develops them to perfection. It's hard to believe that he created this musical perfection at the same time he was playing it. Keith Jarrett is certainly one of piano's greatest musicians ever, and this album is without a doubt his finest and most important work throughout his distinguished career. Whether you are a jazz fan or not, this cd is a must-have"},{"rating":"2","title":"A misunderstood minor masterpiece","review":"Way too many people have listened t this lovely, tuneful album of solo piano improvisations and have drawn the wrong conclusion. Thus, a spate of semi-talenteed newage pianists playing their tawdry, mindless, manipulative newage tinklings. Jarrett is a master musician who for this recording was in an upbeat, lyrical mood and explored this in a number of spontansously clever ways. Jarrett's harmonic language is essentially Debussy's, so don't expect anything profoundly interesting or groundbreaking - this is not even Jarrett's best work. Well worth owning and listening to, nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keith Jarrett The Koln Concert","review":"Dear Sirs,Some time back, I purchased Keith Jarrett, The Koln Concert from you guys.

In this album, Keith Jarrett has the unique ability to blend all of his ideas into a perfect non-stop flow of emotion and lyricism. Of the many jazz albums I have, this is one of the few that is able to keep me interested and excited for every single moment. Part I on its own is enough reason to get this. It seems as if every note belongs exactly where Keith Jarrett puts it, as if this was a complete and famous melody that he is playing for us. But what makes this great is that it's all on the spot-complete improv coming from this piano master. In my opinion, it's his best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good - 3 decades later","review":"Well, I've personally listened to this music over 100 times in last 20 years.

Keith Jarrett can at times (in other recordings) sound a bit cerebral (although still brilliant), but in this recording sounds like he was playing from his heart and soul. Like many others, I love this recording, and as a pianist myself, I also appreciate Keith Jarrett's technique and skill; but it's the music itself that matters most, and Mr. Jarrett spins beautiful music out of thin air in this (thankfully) recorded spontaneous performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winston/Storry","review":"I've heard and bought Jarrett's CDs before and thought them very good. However, there is always, it seems to me, a close link to folks that record on Windom Hill. This recording is joltingly like those on Windom Hill. I don't want to demean folks that record for that label. It's very nice music. It's not jazz!It seems that Mr. Jarrett goes between WH and jazz. To me he's much better in the latter. If I'd heard more of the Koln Concert I woulnd't have bought the CD. Maybe bought the \\"The Melody at Night, With You\\" again, and sent it to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torturing a piano","review":"If you were curious how a verbalist egotripper sounds on piano, then this is the right material for you.Mr. Jarrett had his only bright solo moments at his very first piano parolas (Staircase, Facing you), some good orchestral compositions (Luminessence) and a triple of great jazz ensemble moments (not so incidentally all of them with Dewey Redman behind the sax). And that's all about him- or rather not: Lately he is teasing the ears of classical music fans with some of the most soulless interpetations one can dream about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quasi-new age tripe","review":"This is music that exists in a vacuum. It doesn't have the structure of classical music, it doesn't swing like Jazz. It's garbage, really. Jarrett has done much better things since, and apparently even he doesn't like this pseudo-mystical hogwash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"This cd contains four improvisations played at the Köln concert.Keith Jarrett has an impressive discography going from Bach to Pärt, not to mention his own compositions. So you expect some amazing improvisations but it's a disappointment.Slamming the same chords for minutes on end with only slight differences in the high tones is not my idea of an improvisation"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music!","review":"I like the consert and its variations of sound.

This is also the season that introduces Kimi and Chuckie's new mommy, Kira! Its a bunch of fun and is totally reccomended to buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strato lives on...Sort of","review":"While Stratovarius is still trying to make an existnecve with some sort of female vocalist (wow, they're really changing huh?) The Stratovarius we all knew and loved can still live on with Kotipelto, the solo band by Timo Kotipelto. There isn't really much difference between this band and Stratovarius, with the exception of the name. It's still the same prog power metal and Timo's soaring higher vocals that sort of remind me of rush. If you liked Strat, you'll like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"soaring, echoing voice- the reason for this CD being good","review":"Kotipelto reminds me quite of Helloween and Europe. Thing I hate is the keyboard sounds/solos where the guitar should dominate.Melodic and relaxing power metal indeed and I'm glad the music channel showed the Reasons clip- thus me being modest fan of Kotipelto.Worth the buy if price not too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Solo Follow-up!","review":"In all actuality, both of Timo's solo albums are not extensions of Stratovarius (unintentionally or otherwise) and this is a very good thing. Like its predecessor, \\"Coldness\\" does not get bogged down in excessively long songs (like some recent Strato kind of does) and he makes much better use of his voice on his own projects by only singing in the upper reaches of his rather impressive range sparingly and then mostly in the background. In comparison to his first solo effort, this one is quite personal and a little bit dark, as evidenced by the beautiful cover art and photos inside. However, like the first one, Timo has most of the same talented guys backing him up and once again, there are no bad songs to skip over. In fact, I would recommend the import version with the bonus track \\"Secret Name\\" which I have, if you can find it for a decent price because it really should have been on the album anyway. Keep up the great work, Timo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Myth Townhall Review","review":"All in all, this may just be the greatest Myth 2 Resource available in any form, print or digital.

If these are supposed to be \\"inventive excercises\\", I can't imagine how real textbooks are. No wonder so many kids are bad at math.The math problems are not very advanced.

It is just wonderful Mozart and very inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money...","review":"This is a big waste of money.

I like the comfort it has on my ear and the sound is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described!","review":"The product description on Amazon's web page indicates that this headset is compatible with the Nokia 2600 phone. So I ordered two of them together, but neither one worked with my Nokia 2600. Since the seller would only refund my purchase price and original shipping charges, I had to pay the return shipping costs myself. So I'm now back to square one with no headset for my phone -- and with less money in the bank than before. The only reason I'm giving this headset one star is because I wasn't able to proceed with my review unless I rated it at least one star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrary to description, does NOT work with Nokia 2600","review":"This is listed as working with the Nokia 2600 cellphone. It does not.

Upon receiving it I was very disappointed because when I would plug it into my Nokia 2600 it kept coming up with the message 'enhancement not supported'. I tried everything to get it to work (including taking it over to my cell phone store and asking them if I was doing something wrong). They couldn't even come up with an answer. You need to take the Boom Headset (HDB-5) off of the list of enhancements for the Nokia 2600, because it does not work for that model. As you can see it gets a very low rating from me, since it didn't work for my cell phone. Your list of enhancements is very misleading and right now I have no hands off device for my Nokia 2600 because of your misleading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intermittent connection causes static","review":"This would be a great little headset, but mine has a poor connection near the phone end that makes static when the wire moves.

This book is the first serious book for lay people and priests to say what really went wrong with the Catholic priesthood in the United States, why there are so many bad priests and so few good ones. Through the stories of seminarians, ex-seminarians and a handful of priests who survived the poisonous atmosphere of modern American seminaries Michael Rose says the unthinkable but true. Not suitable for hypertensive Catholics."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Fruits\\" of Vatican II","review":"This is a sad, but excellent book documenting how homosexuals have nearly hijacked the Catholic priesthood. They were able to do this in the aftermath of the Second Vatican Council, the greatest disaster in the 2,000 year old history of the Catholic Church.We have Christ's promise that the gates of hell will not prevail against the Church, but it is sure getting a beating at the hands of its Judas bishops and priests. Michael Rose does a great job of telling this story in his book. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those Catholics with their heads still in the clouds (the pay, pray, obey variety, who think the pope and the bishops can do no wrong)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely and Compelling","review":"This is a book not to be dismissed lightly. The author doesn't engage in name-calling or finger-pointing. He makes his statements and backs them up carefully - so much so that it's hard to imagine that anyone could dispute his findings. Mr. Rose has done the Church a great service by shining a spotlight on a very unpleasant problem, and one that needs to be addressed immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read to understand the priest scandal","review":"Rose's book is a blockbuster expose of the roots of the current Catholic priest pedophile scandal. Rose brings all of the pieces together so the practicing Catholic can have a frame of reference to understand where some of the ambiguous theolgy being used and taught in Catholic religious education classes comes from.Althought very depressing for the reader to see how orthodox priests have been excluded from priestly ranks, the final chapter offers a grand solution for what appears to be a very deep seeded pathology infecting the Catholic hierarchy and clergy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Put It Down","review":"Being a slow reader, but unable to put GOODBYE! GOOD MEN down, I read the books in three days; that included many underlines and notes.Michael Rose's book holds your attention with its factual interviews with such well know personalities as Fr.

Since then I have remained a Catholic and have read much on the subject of Church, and Church History, and on the present-day crises. Sorry, but Michael Rose did not hit on the right answer for a lack of vocations. He started with a conclusion and worked backwards. His conclusion is that orthodox (conservative) vocations are being turned away, and that the liberal institution is the one turning them away, and he uses some very flimsy criteria to prove it. One only has to look at the dioceses he cites as being low in vocations versus the ones that have higher perentage rates, and one can see that one of the critical variables is urban versus city, instead of orthodox versus liberal. This was just not good journalism. Sorry, the problem goes much deeper than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Caution","review":"This is an ideological work rather than a thoughtful one. We need to ask the question \\"Why are our best and brightest not going into the priesthood and religious life\\"? Some of the seminaries that are very clerical and afraid of questions raised by the broader Catholic community draw many effeminate and immature candidates. This will just make the current problem worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and Stupid","review":"This book is terribly flawed. What does Michael Rose want, a return to pre-Vatican II? The first rule of those studying for the priesthood is to be intelligent, not orthodox. Orthodoxy got us into this situation in which the the majority of Catholic Bishops are \\"Yes\\" men who have no brains."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Feel Good Novel","review":"When I first read this book, I felt really low. However, once I'd finished this wonderful story about 8 small town women who made it good, I felt inspired, amused, and wishing that there had been more... say another few thousand pages....I've read this book six times already, and each time it gets better. Knowing how the story ends doesn't change a thing - Cynthia Hartwick's style is designed to make you laugh, and bring the unforgettable characters to life almost instantly. This is one of the best books I've read all year - fiction doesn't get much better than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feminist Fairy Tale","review":"Hartwick tells a great story with loveable characters.

The women in this book run the gamut from homemaker to lawyer to battered wife to punk computer nerd. Plus, there are a few good men thrown in for good measure.Despite its rampant wholesomeness, this book holds stays interesting with a good plot. It's an excellent not-quite-rags to riches story and isn't it refreshing when ladies do it for themselves?

It crosses the boundaries and makes great company on cold winter nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Friends","review":"I stumbled across Ladies With Options while browsing for an audio book to listen to while communting to work.

Many of the female characters were quietly (and sometimes not so quietly) tough, smart, big-hearted women. It is a fast paced and easy read, with many laugh out loud moments. This is a great book to take to the beach, or sit on the patio and wile away an afternoon. While many characters were one dimensional and predictable, this is somehow comforting in a beach read. You don't have to stay up nights trying to figure out what might come next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladies are delightful, delicious, and delectable!","review":"This is one of those books you hate to see end! Hartwick is a master at the writing craft, and I hope we'll see more of her work soon.

Imagine yourself being 14.5 million dollars richer.\\"Ladies with Options\\" is a humerous and well-written story of a group of 4 houswifes, 2 librarians, and one grad student turning $ into a fortune enough to rival Bill Gates' on the stock market. Told from the perspective of their lawyer, and daughter of one of the housewifes, the story is both unbelievable and funny.What would you do if all of the sudden you had a couple extra million to spend at leisure? That's what the book's about, of course. The book is just so very fun to read, with a touch of romance and characters that seem real. The escapades of these ladies are hillarious.

The plot is really cool. after reading this I like Superman more and even have started reading All Star Superman which is also terrific. Good Stuff"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Retelling of the Origin","review":"I have always wondered about the 'missing years' in Superman's life. You know, that period between being a boy growing up in Smallville, and the time when he mysteriously appears in Metropolis. This book elegantly fills in the gap, and the story is quite well written. Over the course of this book Superman learns some very valuable lessons. Like the fact that he can't save everyone, but that saving everyone isn't what's important. What is important is that you don't give up, and Superman is a hero because he stays in the fight, even when it seems impossible to win.My only complaint is that the book breaks a bit with some of the traditions of Superman, but that is forgivable given the excellent story telling.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"BYRNE WAS BETTER...

If you read it, ignore it. Or don't read it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birthright earned.","review":"This was an very good read. DC takes a fresh perspective at retelling the origins of the man of steel that makes it a worthy read. From the destruction of a the sleek futuristic Krypton, to why Superman became a hero, to Metropolis accepting him. The telling of how Superman learning his origins and how people of Metropolis reacts to finding out he's from another planet. This is an excellent read, and I highly recomend it.

A common complaint that I've run into is that foods \\"stick\\" more than their other pans. This actually IS true if you do not adjust your cooking method. A little bit of oil olive goes a long way, and TURN DOWN THE HEAT!If you cook something at maximum heat, you WILL have issues. Turn down the heat, this requires less heat than other pans I've used, which is good because it is using less energy to cook in the same amount of time.It's very sturdy, cleans easily and is just a real pleasure to look at and cook with! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Futile Frying Pan","review":"Bought this pan hoping it would live up to its description. It didn't! The steel is quite thin. No matter what I cook in it, using moderate amounts of oil, the food sticks and clean up is impossible. I have other stainless steel pans which work beautifully - conduct heat well, food doesn't stick and clean up is a breeze, (no they're not All-Clad and I didn't pay a fortune). Although I've had T-Fal products which are quite good - this is definitely not one of them. Do not buy this pot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fry pan","review":"I bought this pan because I got rid of my non-stick one. When I first used it, I thought oh my what have I done, the eggs stuck and it was a mess. I then decided I would treat it like a chief's pan. I wash it only with hot water and afterwards I smear a drop or two of oil into the pan and put it away. I preheat the the pan before putting food in it and never use heat higher than medium high, I can now fry an egg with a loose yolk and get it out of the pan easily. It's been about two months since I bought it and its working fine. In a years time it should be wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless!","review":"What a ripoff! I bought this thing at Target and I can assure you that it is a piece of crap! The first thing I tried to cook in it was potatoes o'brien. Very simple, it's fried potatoes with onions and green peppers. The potatoes stuck instantly. I don't put the onions or peppers in towards the end, and they stuck right away too. This pan is like a magnet, everything sticks to it. However, unlike a magnet, you will not be able to pry the things apart! In other words, this thing is impossible to clean. I read the other reviews from people saying you need to adjust your cooking style to the pan. Excuse me, but that is ridiculous. My cooking style is just fine and I have been making delicious fried potatoes for a long time now, and this is the only pan that has given me problems. I would take a cast iron skillet over this any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHO'S WHO IN THE BIBLE","review":"Terrific for quick reference, and very helpful to help anyone who is teaching Bible lessons,etc. I think everyone would find this book a must have. Our young people find the Bible confusing, this will help them also, so many times through out the Bible, names are repeated, or sounds the same. This book really, really goes hand in hand with reading the Bible. Great for all ages, we can never learn enough, no matter how many times we read the Bible, but this book helps explain who we are reading about. I'd rate it 10+. Hope this helps.Jeanette Storaska"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depotgang Says Buy This DVD","review":"I was their for the filming of the DVD.

He was a founding member of Kansas and wrote much of their material. Some songs could have used the extra layer of guitar or keyboards that Livgren could provide.

I bought this cd after hearing that Steve Walsh's voice has improved Since Live at the Whiskey and that his voice is almost comparable to his 70's voice. Sadly it's not. I heard this cd only once and that was enough for me. I put on two for the show cd and tbat's what I'm gonna listen to as it is the Kansas I know and love. ... It pains me to hear a voice that used to take the words of Kerry Livgren and turn them into masterpieces. I would change my mind if I heard just one song that sounds almost identical to any song that Steve Walsh sung so masterfully in the 70's.

Verbose with overblown baroque sensibilities, they've become caricatures of what they once were.The lead singer, Steve Walsh, has lost his voice, screeches to hit high notes and becomes more irritatingly annoying as the concert progresses. Even 'Dust in the Wind', their signature tune, becomes too painful to enjoy.I bought two copies of this DVD because I was planning to give one copy as a gift. That won't happen now.

Kerry Livgren, Dave Hope, Warren Ham and John Elefante (all professing Christians in the band) were all lambasted by the other band members for being unashamedly and unapologetic about their faith in the 80's, especially Livgren.

There are only two concert films that i know of; this DVD and 'Live at the Whiskey', only available on VHS. Device, Voice, Drum is great. The sound is excellent, the concert has a cool atmosphere, and best of all, Kansas sounds fantastic. Steve Walsh's vocals are wonderful and the level of musicianship is so good. You can tell after all these years, that this band loves what they do. The Icarus medley, my favorite, was great. If you are a hardcore Kansas fan, like me, this is a must have.

The plot was confusing, and the producers, directors and writers made no attempt to remain faithful to the original storyline. Most of the newer movie versions of old shows at least tried. I found Dukes of Hazzard pretty good. I look forward to seeing \\"Dallas\\" in the theaters. (I think they should get Larry Hagman to play \\"Jock\\"!).

I decided to give it a shot, though. Big mistake. When about the only thing you keep from the original are the names, you know a movie is in trouble. They made Julie, who originally was very emotional and fragile, into a fistfighting brat, and turned the passionate Pete Cochran character into a clown and a moron. The director obviously had no regard for the original, which is too bad. The tv show Mod Squad was nominated for writing and acting Emmys; it broke ground on subjects from racism, to abortion and sex education. The actors were top-notch. None of that can be said about the movie. My recomendation - skip the movie, and rent videos of the original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Stars Apply","review":"First of all, Peggy Lipton's Julie would have whipped Claire Danes' Julie two times over and thrice on Sunday.

Same goes for Omar - not the Linc I had in mind AT ALL!!Seriously, those of us who actually paid money to see this dribble weren't going in for Masterpiece Theatre.

It's flicks like this that tanked M-G-M as a viable studio. The basic story comes from a cookie cutter involving corrupt cops, a prostitution ring, and stolen drugs from the police evidence room. There's more originality in a typical episode of \\"T.J. Hooker\\". The three young leads(Claire Danes, Omar Epps, Giovanni Ribisi) do their best to breathe life in this inert dreck to little avail. Dennis Farina as Captain Greer does himself a favor by dying early and not having to suffer the grind of being in the majority of this swill. Avoid this one at all costs.

The film's pacing is slow, the character development doesn't really exist with regard to some important characters, the writing is poor, and as such it is difficult to judge whether the acting is subpar because the actors aren't all that great (though Ribisi has proven his ability in some much better stuff) or because the script wasn't worth producing. Add to all of this a sad lack of special effects and an unmemorable soundtrack, and you've got an entire work of below-average film making.If you're looking for an arcane suspense/action, \\"Ronin\\" might be a good pick, but even still, for blockbuster quality stick to the well-traveled paths of smash hits.

Lewis delves into the darkest realm of self-absorbance, pride, and the temptation of the human soul through the fictitious correspondence of Screwtape, a senior \\"Tempter\\", to his nephew, Wormwood. In so doing, Lewis creates a correspondence with imagery likening to that of Milton and Dante, but with far greater illumination as to the thinking and workings of the spiritual forces opposed to their \\"Enemy\\", God. Yet within this disclosure of the nature of Evil, Lewis invokes contemplation upon the true attributes of the Divine. Although short and to the point, this book speaks volumes to the goings-on in the eternal struggle between Good and Evil.

Mr. Lewis' religiousness is of a very narrow, cloistered, sort. It arrogantly dismisses practically all worldly conditions and concerns that we may look to religion to address. Neither does it have the depth or feeling one associates with mysticism. It is a religion of the self-satisfied and elect.The conceit of having letters from Screwtape to a favored demon nephew palls at about letter V, there are XXXI.

No attempt is made to discuss the precautions anyone, but especially older people should take in practicing yoga, and I would definately not recommend it for an older beginner, especially anyone with injuries. A far better book is The New Yoga for People Over 50, Suza Francina, which discusses the changes that take place as we age, and shows many asanas with appropriate use of props and modifizations for safety, and which are suitable/unsuitable for injuries, high blood pressure -- a much, much better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration and Encouragement for life-long yoga practice","review":"I had done yoga seriously for 10 years in my 30's, but when I took it up again, to attempt to alleviate increasing 'aches and pains', I thought I was becoming 'too old' at age 53, because I couldn't do it as well as when I was younger. This book showed me that people older than I am were continuing to practice yoga. Now, at 57, I'm enjoying yoga more than I ever did when I was younger; I'm appreciating it on many more levels than simply the physical; AND my back pain is gone, my shoulder tension and sciatica are reduced to mild discomfort when tired, my ankles and wrists are more flexible than they've ever been. All this, thanks to the encouragement of a picture book, (as well as an excellent teacher who trained with the author) to reinforce the previous experience I've had with yoga.

For all the sad reviews of its ponderousness I say they are wrong. Perhaps I am prejudiced by the fact that this was my mother's favorite, what with her being trained as a mezzo suprano for the opera and then becoming an academic with a doctorate in music. Perhaps I am prejudiced by having heard dozens upon dozens. This pace is perfection. The tenor floats above the choir and then lingers...which is what he, and all the other soloists are supposed to do in this piece of holy wonderment. So many people cut the piece into a brisker tempo so that they can get through it in the amount of time most Americans can endure sitting with out their adhd kicking in. That is akin to doing Wagner's Ring in just one sitting. Give this a chance. You should grow to love it deeply and profoundly...the oldest of the recording sounds do not get in the way of the beauty of the interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor recording technique","review":"I own wonderful recordings of Messiah.

I look forward to complex, intensely played music and don't shy away from soft relaxing music either as long as it continues to stimulate my mind.

Actually it does work, but you have to not pay any attention to the instructions, they don't make any sense. you just put ice half way up in the container, use the salt cup provided with the machine, pour salt on it (you can use regular salt) then more ice cubes to 3/4's of the way up, more salt on that. Turn the machine on and gradually pour in the liquid from the top dispenser. It does work. However it does not do diet sodas or fruit juices, only liquids with high sugar content. If you are on a diet, don't use this machine. otherwise it does work. Some writers say that the machine can walk across the counter top it will if you put too much ice in it, it causes the canister to get cold too quickly, and causes the paddles to stick on the ice on the canister.

This hunk of junk will freeze, jam up and sound like a Cessna with a damaged engine trying to land in a wind tunnel. Meanwhile, the unit itself jukes and shimmies across the countertop with its sights set on the floor. The concept seemed like the perfect accent to a child's birthday party in the Deep South but rapidly became the laughingstock of the event.

The last time I used it, I tried Kool Aid, and the whole machine froze up and stopped working. The center rod in the ice/salt container has stopped spinning and actually made the ice/salt intake cap pop off and land on the floor. I thought I had too much ice in it, so I took half of the ice out and tried again, but the cap flew off again.

If you would read this book, be ready to end up upon your knees!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is an excellent and fiery book. Great for repentance.","review":"I think every Christian should read this book earnestly and follow and do it. I also think that not every Christian will be able to. Jesus says that only those the Father draws can come to and believe in Jesus. There are many \\"Christians\\" out there who have no idea who God is, and they will not believe nor understand the Scriptures, and this book.But to those that do, listen to this book and REPENT! And REND your hearts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book sure to afflict the comfortable; buy it!","review":"This fascinating book was originally published in 1959 by British evangelist Leonard Ravenhill (1907-1994). In it, Rev. Ravenhill launches a fiery attack on the complacency and drowsiness of the modern Protestant Church. He calls for prayer, fervent and unceasing prayer.This book is not for those who like their Christianity academic and dispassionate. Rev. Ravenhill blazes through this book like the fire-and-brimstone preachers of yesteryear, calling for \\"hell-shaking prayer.\\" This is a book sure to afflict the comfortable; buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Revival Tarries","review":"This wonderful and amazing author, L. Ravenhill is brutal yet convicting for why God's Holy Ghost power does not and cannot rain among God's people-we're not asking, pleading and begging Him to! Certainly revival-inspiring and a gift from above in reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Christian should read","review":"Every Christian should read this book. It will stir the heart and spirit of a true believer and awaken those who slumber."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEEP","review":"Ravenhill says it like it is, and will bring you to your knees if you have any reverence to the Lord. This is just what anyone who claims to be a Christian should model themselves after. I highly recommend it to all who say they believe in God."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Revival does and does not look like!","review":"Though written a number of years back this is still as current as the daily news. True revival is for the BELIEVER in Christ Jesus. Someone must be at least barely alive to be revived. Bro. Ravenhill pulls no punches but 'goes for the throat' of the problem of 'Why Revival Tarries' for as the scripture says, \\"Open rebuke is better than love that is hidden\\" (Proverbs 27:5 KJV). This book challenged me to examine myself to see if I was in the faith (see 2 Corinthians 13:5).I highly recommend this book.Why Revival Tarries"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five for a changed life","review":"I read this book first when I was 17 (now 23) and I have not been the same since. I have read and re-read this book. It is what it is. It's a violent call to repentance and seeking the Lord. it means to get in your face and challenge your indiffrence. Of course it needs to be balanced with other books, (namely books on grace).This is meant to start a fire in you, not to give some theology on how to pray. If you're reading it as a teaching book, then you must compliment it with \\"Bridal Intercession\\" by Gary Wiens.Read this book on your knees. It's meant to go through you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Praying Prophets","review":"Leonard Ravenhill summons holy praying prophets to rise up in this gem. He calls for a life that is without compromise, being set apart for the Lord. He calls for people to go deep in prayer, and often. He calls for prophets to rise up and speak a message accompanied only with the unction of the Spirit.Just on a side note, this book is a little old. Communism is still a very real threat at the time of the writing. Also, Ravenhill condemns evangelists of his day for buying \\"$3 steaks.\\" That tells you how old this book must be :) If somebody knows where I can buy a steak for 3 bucks, drop me a line...shoot, drop me a line if you know where I can go out and eat steak for under 10 bucks :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest Revival...","review":"In this book Leonard Ravenhill states that prayer and not \\"any dead mans echoed words\\" would provide the path to Christian revival. Leonard has since passed away and yes, some of the examples given in this book are outdated but his deeper message is timeless.Skarp-Hedin, I too am a Catholic Charismatic Christian that felt somewhat offended by some of the text in this book. I challenged myself to see God through Leonard's eyes. If you take the time and pick it back up you will see that Leonard's sword cuts both ways and spares no Christian Denomination.His call is for all to account for their time spent here on earth and how Prayer focuses us in that pursuit.Because Revival starts with you and I, my prayer it that we can see through the growing pains and only focus on the God who made us all. I'm sure Leonard would agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope I can live up to this standard","review":"Unlike the last reviewer I opened the book and read it. This is the only Christian book where on the first chapter I was overwhelmed. I found out about it by reading \\" No compromise the Keith Green story \\" And after reading this book It talked about how it changed his life so I had to check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written and illustrated guide to the outdoors.","review":"An excellent introduction to the world of the outdoorsfor all those who have been longing to get back to nature.The superb use of illustrations clearly depict outdoor life. From basic gear to the process of cooking a fish,McManners captures the essence camping in a simple how-tostyle. Perhaps the only flaw is the book's lack of asection regarding backpacks.

Thanks for the info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for beginner","review":"The version I bought has a different book title, which is name 'Hugh McManners Outdoor Survival Guide'. I found the book title is misleading, since the content of the book is not much about 'survival'. The recent book title is much better. This is not a manual,I recommend it to all wilderness training beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS survival","review":"This is the best survival handbook for quick referance. If you want to take 5 minutes trying to look up one paragragh, The U.S. Army survival handbook is for you. Otherwise, this is an excellent training book. I plan to try to live in the woods for about a couple months. This really helped me prepare. I already tried when I was young. But I came back crying after a week and a half. Now I plan to stay longer, beacause of this.This book includes all the basics of survival. I'm sure there are more detailed ones, but they don't have the basics. This is not really good for a reading book, but it is good for reaserch, as well as training. If you want a good book to live off of the land,this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for a better book","review":"Like hellcatty from Hong Kong, my version is also called a survival manual. While there is some information of use in the book, in most areas it is sadly lacking (although it has pretty pictures). For example, on page 63, it shows Mr. McManners doing a bow drill fire. I'd sure like to see him do it in person if this photo accurately portrays his technique. Unless he has arms like Lou Ferrigno, that top hand of his is going to be all over the place. Similarly, on the same page, his portrayal of hand drill fire making leaves a lot to be desired. He states that the hand drill fire technique 'only works effectively in hot climates, where the wood is really dry.'It also works very effectively, at least in my area, in the winter, when it also can be quite dry. His drill also looks somewhat top heavy and unbalanced. Overall, as stated in my title, save your money for a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Info, Terrible Prose","review":"Hyams has done his homework with this project.

It was available that way some years ago on laserdisc and it looked great. Heston, Cooper and Harris work extremely well together; the model work is better than average for its time; the tank shots feature some of the most convincing water/storm effects ever put on film. The original book was a best-seller when it came out and this film version does a generally excellent job of capturing its essence (am I the only person to detect a certain similarity between it and Morgan Robertson's turn-of-the-last-century novel \\"Futility\\"?). In view of all the unbelievable *junk* coming out on DVD right now, there's simply no reason for \\"Mary Deere\\" to remain buried in the vaults."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SEA SAGA with MYSTERY","review":"This is essentially a man's movie, but for gals who thought Paul Newman's eyes are blue, take a look at \\"Coop\\" in these close-ups! If you love a mystery, this is definitely worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better but still not Sadler","review":"Paul Denegelegi's second Casca book is markedly better than the first but still contains a little too much over descriptive passages, making the book a little heavy at times. This story has Casca meeting a young Marco Polo in Venice and then accompanying him to China and the court of Kubilai Khan and he enjoys many adventures there.Dengelegi writes well when battles are decribed but all too often there seems to be a little wandering from the main plot which detracts from the storyline. Sadler wrote in an all-action mode and this is what Casca fans really want, not a ponderous storyline which is why Denegelegi attracts a lot of criticism.One thing I particularly disliked was the final part where the writer attempted to connect this book's storyline with the beginning of his first book and in the process contradicted Sadler's storyline for the character. Careless and with a little more care this would have been avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defiant to the End!","review":"This latest Casca novel, the 2nd in this new authors Casca tryout, is still unfortunately coming up short.Barry Sadler's Casca novels were fantastic pulp hero type action novels, filling a groove for readers that loved such short novels like Conan the Barbarian could truly appreciate.Out of all of Sadler's writing ventures, only Casca really shined like a well polished blade. I still own all of the series.I am glad and humbled that someone has tried to take up the huge writing reins to continue this series. A solid writer could well take on this saga, giving hungry old readers of the series - as well as new ones - new adventures of Casca, the eternal mercenary. There are hundreds of untold times to pick and choose from.As much as I admire someone making an attempt, this author has come up somewhat short of just making a Sadler pulp adventure story. He shows potential, however. Practice makes perfect.Well, one hopes anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better, but still a way to go","review":"I have to admit that this is better than his original attempt at this series. The battles are much improved. The problem is that he is still overly descriptive of areas of the story that really does not require it. I found myself skipping pages again. When a reader has to skip pages for a lack of interest, you loose the reader's attention. Sadler had the ability to reach out and pull you into the story, and when you did come up for air or food you were ready to dive back in immediately. In this book, ofttimes I found myself on the outside looking in, and I really didn't care if I finished. The author also had a tendency to stray from the story and loose the plot for a while, which confused me at times.I'm sorry but if this author makes another attempt at this series I doubt I will read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"casca junkie","review":"worst casca book ever written. casca is mainly a side bar in the book was so bored did not even finish book . as a fan who is hungry for the next casca book i would starve before buying one written by dengelegi. please get a new author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only Casca book that ever took me more than an evening to finish.","review":"As a fan of the original series who sadly lost them all in a move, I was excited to find new stories by a new author. I tried to like this one, I really did, but it just isn't Casca. Others have pointed out most of the book's faults, but one thing nobody has mentioned that plagued me throughout the book was the poor editing. Constant misuse of words like their/they're and other homophones indicates that no real attempt was made to edit beyond simple spellcheck.

His history seems probable, but I buy these books for excitement and escape, not lessons. His battles are about as interesting as watching ice freeze and I really wanted this to work.

If PD writes a new book, I will give him one more try, but if he doesn't improve - no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read only the parts on Hogan","review":"This a fantastic book for pictures of Hogan demonstrating his swing techniques taken for the illustrations in the \\"Five Lessons\\". Leadbetter makes a very detailed analysis of Hogan's swing and some interesting observations between what Hogan said in his book and how he actually swung. A must for every Hogan fan.However, as soon as Leadbetter starts giving his own \\"My Views\\", watch out. In \\"The Plane Truth for Golfers\\", Jim Hardy differentiates between the one plane (Hogan, Snead) and the two plane (Leadbetter). All of Leadbetter views on how to improve on Hogan's swing are two plane ideas which Hardy points out are disastrous for the one plane swing. Read Five Lessons and this book for Hogan's swing and forget all the sections labelled \\"My Views\\" or you will be swinging the golf club like David Leadbetter, not like Ben Hogan!5 stars for Ben Hogan; 3 stars for David Leadbetter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised by the Clarity","review":"I've never been a big fan of either Hogan or Leadbetter. For me, Hogan's ideas always seemed too narrow and dogmatic, tailored to his own unique swing and talent. This is the best thing I have ever seen by Leadbetter, and this is the clearest take on Hogan's ideas I have run across. It's a very entertaining read, and it offers lots of good ideas for the recreational golfer who also is a student of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new go to cookbook","review":"In Real Food, Nigel Slater manages to invoke the feeling and quality of comfort food but goes beyond that with some of the bold and certainly delicious flavours he encourages us to explore.

Nobody.

The film did pretty well equally insult every race, religion and ethnic group they came across, so it didn't single anyone out. They all seemed like ethnic cartoons!

It is true that the actors didn't have alot of lines in the movie, but I considered this as very artistic, all the casts are very professional by showing their body language.

This film treats one of the most analyzed periods of the twentieth century in an intimate and present manner through the limited scope of a small cast of characters, opposing deep injustice against a melancholy stoicism.

It's a good movie and has a lot of potential, but has a lot to be desired. The movie ends very abruptly without explaining things. There are a lot of plots going on at once; it seems like they move from one to another without ending them. The only one that is really resolved is the first one which involves finding her father, and that one was a little disappointing. This movie creates pretty much a foundation for you if you want to add in your own creative details in your mind.

Depp reprises his 'Chocolat\\" role to equally tiresome effect, while Harry Dean Stanton looks like an actor who can't wait for his character to be deported East by the Nazis and save him from further career trauma. I was interested that the Paris flat appears to be located next door to the city aquarium; during love scenes, the wooden lovers are serenaded by singing whales outside the window -now that is Arthouse, and accounts for this review's only star.The horse defecating on stage says it all; this really is a stinking heap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Lacking/Missing to Make This A Great Movie","review":"Just so-so film overall.....

Plus more on how she went about finding her father in America. The ending of this movie left one wanting to know more answers....Sure Susie was eventually reunited with her biological father, but was it a happily ever after one?? Knowing more about what her biological father had been up to while in America with a bit more detail, would have been great too. Did Cate Blanchett's character make it big in Hollywood?

I was pretty disappointed with this one. It was rather slow movie with a plot that seemed to aim at forms of prejudice, desperate times and desperate women.

I love foreign films,and I'm used to slow pace.But this one just went no where fast. The acting is good. Ricci is great, as is Depp as a quiet Gypsy. Blanchett is good, and Tuttorro even arouses a little sympathy, as an Italian nationalist. But all together this film is uneffecting. I didn't care about the charachters either way.

Other classics include \\"Shy Boy,\\" and a cover of \\"Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye).\\" The whole album is full of catchy beats and great melodies.Now for the bad news. Collectables Records says this CD is \\"digitally remastered.\\" Digitally \\"ripped\\" is more like it -- the songs on this CD sound like little more than badly ripped low quality mp3s, with the muddled and churny sound typical of them.

(the story is a MUSKET not molasses!)The errors continue into even more important realms. (Such as which Nehemiah Abbot was released by virtue of the 'afflicted' deciding they had 'the wrong man' - young Abbot's eloquent defense and calm demeanor should not be negated nor glossed over - or worse - attributed to another man!)On and on, one error after another.Frankly, as often as this book is used as a reference, I'm surprised someone else hasn't pointed out the poor research!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Was the Worst of Times","review":"If I remember correctly, Starkey's book started off as a doctoral thesis. It reads like one, despite her attempt to inject drama into a period of history that needs no such injection. Her modern enquiry is rather dated now, as she used the technique of Freudian analysis to explain away the hysteria surrounding the trials and to explain how something like this could have happened. The psychoanalysis may hit on a grain of truth, but a lot of what she stated was merely conjecture. I would have been more interested to know about the link between the real dangers the Puritans faced (dangers over which they had very little control in their new, hostile, strange environment) and their belief system, which left them ripe to believe in imagined ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job","review":"This book takes the Witchcraft in Salem through the entire process from the beginning to end.

Dewalt has upgraded to a 3 knife model, but it is hard to see how they could improve on this one. The dust hood does a good job with my shop vac attached with very few chips ending up on the table.The only negative I have found so far is the carrying handles. If you don't carry it level the planer can shift on the telescopic handles and pinch your hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contractor","review":"I've read the other reviews of this product, and I have a question: Did the people who gave this product a bad review know how to use a thickness planer? I plane the HARDEST woods around (African Mahogony, 100+ year-old Antique Pine, etc.) with this thing and it hasn't given me the type of trouble that they complain of. There isn't a planer on the market where you would trust preset depth stops, so they may be off... I wasn't foolish enough to try them. If you want to establish a thickness, use a caliper; no one relies solely on an on-board scale when it comes to that. The only problem I've ever experienced was with the dust chute. When I'm really hogging away at a PT 2x12, and I start getting into wetter wood, it will start to clog (because of a slight design flaw). This is a good all-around portable thickness planer."},{"rating":"2","title":"First planer","review":"I bought one of these during X-mas. With the $50 rebate, free set of knives and dust hood, and the additional 10% discount that Amazon offered, my total cost was under $300.

This is the first planer that I have owned, but if it continues to perform like it does now, I don't see how it can be beat. With my new Jet dust collector attached, virtually 100% of the dust and chips were collected. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose Chain","review":"Bought mine awhile back and it did the job fine until the chains that rotate the rollers became so loose they sliped on the spockets.

Have planed over 200 feet of air dried, 6\\" wide, rough sawn red oak. The first set of blades are dull enough to change. I am very happy with this tool so far. The dust hood is definitely a must, and I feel it should be included with the planer. The only minor problem that I have encountered, is that the infeed rollers get dirty quick and begin to slip. But with a little shove, the wood is on its way again. I am however disappointed that amazon deleted the few negative reviews that were here a couple weeks ago. They were not obnoxious, they were just being honest about their bad encounters with the tool. By deleteing these comments, it makes these reviews almost useless.Amazon, being critical of a tool is a good thing. It makes the manufacturers aware that there may be problems, and it only makes for finer quality tools in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"[BAD] DEPTH OF CUT GUAGE","review":"I BAUGHT THIS PLANER ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO.

I immediately mounted two sheets of glued plywood to its bottom so that I could easily move it around and clamp it in place. I have planed material up to 3\\" thick and down to 1/4\\" thin. No problems what so ever. It is loud though, so I recommend ear protection. The dust collection tube works great, but my only complaint with it is that you have to screw it on. It cannot easily be removed in order to fold up the out-tray. This makes moving the unit a bit more cumbersome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool for any woodworker","review":"This is the first planer that i've ever bought but, I have used many different brands, sizes, makes and models. I have read and read on all other planers out there. I must say that I am happy that I went with the DeWalt. The self explanitory controls on this planer make it simple to use. I expected the noise level on this machine to be alot louder than it is, the loudest it gets is when you try to take off the maximum amount per pass that it will take (although hearing protection is still a must). Take your time, and shave off less per pass and the noise will go down as the blades will also last a little while longer. This is a great machine for any woodworker who needs a planer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than I expected.","review":"I read reviews of this product and noticed many complaints about sniping. However, because of the rebate and other price breaks, I went ahead and purchased the Dewalt planer rather than another brand. I now wish I had purchased a different brand. Sniping with the Dewalt planer is a DEFINITE problem and I have ruined many pieces of wood due to it. I also do not like the offset infeed & outfeed extensions. I have several Dewalt tools and like most of them, but the surface planer has been a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work like Norm's","review":"After watching Norm plane old wood for years on PBS I decided to join in the restoration fever and salvage some old carsiding that was in good and dry condition. I have spent hours trying to plane that wood to something useable. As I feed the wood in it simply stops. The rollers mark the wood showing that they are trying to move the work through but fail. I have to push, or pull the wood through. These boards are about 7.5 inches wide and I am trying to only take off 1/32\\" at a time. Any more than that just chews up the wood. The other dissatisfaction I have is the quality the planer does. The wood is not smooth, it gets chewed up and pieces pulled out. I run it through several times with the cutter just touching and still it looks bad. I've sanded the wood before trying to plane it and that helps a little but it never works like I see Norm on \\"The New Yankee Workshop.\\" I regret this purchase and wish I had bought a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought two, gave two away, free and working.","review":"I'am a general contractor in Hawaii, these planers work great the first 10 hours, then broken sprockets and poor stock feed made me give the two I bought away no charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"rebate/dust chute/knives","review":"For your info, I am NOT a \\"home improvement enthusiast\\", I am a professional carpenter.

When I called them I was unaware of the free chute and knives. I went to there web site (WWW.DeWalt.com) tonight and emailed them about the chute and knives, wait and see what happens.

I have used it with cherry, oak and maple with no problem. Blades are easy to remove and install. Very little tearing and almost no snipe when locked. The tool has a carry handle but is too heavy to easily move. I recommend mounting the planer on a mobile support cart. Excellent planer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine DeWalt power tool","review":"In a word; \\"sweet\\".This planer is a solid performer, and the price now makes it a good value to boot. (Not to mention the extra blade set.)Set up is very simple, as are adjustments. The self-feed capability nearly makes it automatic (though you might want a second set of hands for long stock).Heavy, at about 60 pounds, you'll still to bolt it down for stability. Dust collection works very well, attach your shop vac to the chute (you'll need an adaptor) and your ready to mill wood.My experience so far is good, the finish on milled stock is even and very clean. Obviously knots present a challenge, but I think the feed rate is slow enough to deal with them.At this point, I can't find much to complain about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Product","review":"After reviewing the Delta and Dewalt Portable Planners, I purchased the Dewalt. It is an excellent machine. I unpackaged it and immediately started planing some Maple boards. The planner performed flawlessly with no snipe and produced boards that are ready for finish. As recommended by several people, I purchased the dust hood to prevent the chips from reentering the machine and effecting the finished product. My only complaint is, the dust hood prevents the outfeed table from being folded up for storage, and attaching and removing it with screws every time will get to be a pain. Overall, the machine is excellent and worth the couple of extra dollars more than the Delta machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darned good for the money","review":"I must say I am pretty pleased with my DeWalt planer. Although it is not TOTALLY snipe free, it does do a more than adequate job. It is easy to set-up and use right oout of the box. Knife changes and re-setting are a snap with all required tools stored right on the planer. As with all palners, this tool will quickly fill your floor with shavings. However, if used with the optional dust collection port either with a dust-collection system or a Shop-vac there is very little debris. I mounted mine on a universal steel stand with locking casters.

Johnny Coles, Joe Farrell, Cecil Payne, Kenny Barron, Ron Carter, and Connie Kay are some of the most prominent musicians who play on the album.As the title and cover photo indicate, the music has a quality of lightness and casts images of unusual sound-colors in the mind.

Yes, she was educated at Oxford and has lived in England for 15 years, but take it from someone who has lived abraod for quite some time: unless you're a young child (young children easily adapt to new accents and learning new languages) you don't start speaking with an accent unless you are deliberately trying to sound affected.

As a long-time Michael Caine fan, I enjoyed his performance, and I was pleasantly surprised at Demi Moore's believable performance as the dauntless aspirant to the upper management ranks of her company only to be thwarted by the \\"old boy\\" network (British style).Is this a FLAWLESS suspenseful inside theft movie? No, but it's far from the worst, in my opinion. I enjoyed it because it withheld the uncovering of the final plot twists to the very end, although they were presented in a \\"too hurried\\" fashion and, therefore, lost some of their effect.Certainly the movie has some flaws, but I liked it. I rate it 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"first-class caper film","review":"Set in London in 1960, the aptly named \\"Flawless\\" features Demi Moore as Laura Quinn, the first woman to become senior negotiator at Lon Di, the world's premier diamond firm. However, Quinn has pretty much hit the glass ceiling career-wise with the company, and when she discovers that she is about to be let go from the firm, she agrees to join forces with the night janitor (Michael Caine) in his plan to rob the vault of a thermos-full of uncut diamonds.\\"Flawless\\" is a good old-fashioned caper tale done with an abundance of wit, intelligence and style and just enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the audience on its toes throughout. Moore and Caine make a perfect team as the duo plotting the heist, while director Michael Radford generates enough suspense for a dozen average thrillers. The script by Edward Anderson even manages to squeeze in some points about early '60's feminism and South African apartheid along the way.Definitely worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A showcase for one of the best.","review":"I've had the pleasure of working with several pieces of Nakashima's over the years and agree that he's left a true legacy. \\"Nature Form and Spirit\\" is a good description of his work.This particular book focuses more on his completed works than on his philosphy and craft but his artistry shines through in every photo.

I had a lot of ideas about good design. But I never had the courage to read a full cientific book on the subject. THis was the book that explained everything to me. From the hows and whys of human interaction with machines, to metrics and all the way to crazy ideas. I think it is a fantastic book for beginners or experts.

It comes with a lot of Bibliographic references that will enable you to continue to study such a passionate subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best interface design book I have ever read","review":"Jef Raskin's book, The Humane Interface, is the single best human interface design book that I have read. While I am a healthcare preofessional and not a computer geek, the principles of design that Raskin discusses could well be applied to the design of the systems that I use to document patient care and to manage clinical data. I recommend this book to all people who design systems that real people must deal with and use. Part of the frustration of caring for people in healthcare should not be the poor data management systems that require users to learn a multitue of systems and specialized commands; the systems should support the user doing their job.

I rushed out to get it based on my love for comics and fictional futures. The premise is excellent, and Ridley's dialogue is like nothing I've ever read. It's true to life and unique. The only thing that let me down was the main character that we're (I think) supposed to be rooting for (or maybe not...maybe this is Ridley's intention). Soledad comes off as a hateful, bigoted, murderous, merciless human being. And it's not even for an understandable reason.

I've read most of Ridley's work and as far as the character Soledad goes, she's a typical Ridley protagonist.When describing his books to someone who hadn't read him, I foudn myself saying \\"you don't read him expecting everything to be all good in the end.\\" His lead characters are almost never worthwhile as human beings, but the difference in this book is that it's actually easier to identify and sypathize with the primary antagonist, Vaughn. There's more logic behind his murderous actions than there is behind Soledad's.Like some other's have already said: it could be that Ridley is making a statement about bigotry and how it can infect anyone's mind. I just don't feel that Soledad is a character worthy of more than one book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst main character ever","review":"The only reason I kept reading this book was the vain hope that this character would develop some kind of redeeming trait. It never happens, she's treats almost everyone, human or mutant, like crap. She'll watch a mutant save someones life then without hesitation pull out her gun and shoot them. She's filled with blatant, uncompromising hatred and not the least bit of reason or conscience about the people she's murdered. One of the mutants in the book puts it most accurately when he compares her to nazis and klan members.Other than her the book was okay. The action sequences were intense and the other characters were well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally Charged Concept","review":"This book has a main character who is a bigot plain and simple, while some have found this an offensive choice for the story's POV, I believe it was a great decision. It leads the audience to constantly question the ethical dilemas society would face if confronted with superhumans. The violent reaction of the government when a superhuman disaster occurs seems incredibly plausible, along with the survivor's guilt that drives the main character's fanatical hatred. Fans of the TV shows Heroes or True Blood, and comics like the X-Men will find themselves right at home with this book.

The first two failed when water would come out the sides of the head and not through it.The third one (just a month old) suddenly would not flow any water through it and the flex tube would not stay in the desired position.these two problems may be related.We had to throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"time will tell","review":"I had a shower massage by this company for the last fifteen years. This massage was supposed to be its equivalent, it's not. The shower head is too close, there is only one massage setting, My original was metal and this is plastic. Time certainly has a way of making once quality products second rate. It works, it does have a massage and where is the competition. If you need one at least this one is cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"flexi-neck","review":"The unit works ok. I wished other manufacturers would follow suit with the flexible wand/shaft idea. Competition is good, but waterpik must have a patent. The flexible neck is a wonder and works very good. The last unit I owned had a 5-year warranty, but the head broke off just after. So, I decide to purchase an updated version with a lifetime warranty. I found that the function dial on the upgrade is not distinct when moving it to each setting. It tends to glide too smoothly thru the settings, so one must play with the dial for the correct shower type. It does give a wonderful spray in each of the modes, but I don't think six are needed, because there is little difference in spray pattern for a few of the settings. The rubber nozzles are easily cleaned. Recommend taking the flow restrictor out of the flexible wand if your water system is 40psi or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what was needed","review":"We have a very high pipe coming out of our shower wall and this goose neck shower head is just perfect for us. You can use it high over head, medium pointed on neck, or low on shoulders to avoid getting your hair wet. We love it and the pressure is wondeful. This is our second one in the last eight years. You won't be sorry for all the control you have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two of them failed in less than 6 months","review":"Two of them failed in less than 6 months. The first one had an air bubble in plastic base, which broke off. Both the first one and the replacement suffered from low flow after a while. There is an oversized wall lining inside the \\"goose neck\\", which tends to warp after flexing multiple times and almost totally obstructs the flow. I'm flexing the \\"goose neck\\" every day, so I can rinse shower stall walls.Rubber ring gasket is undersized and gets shredded into multiple pieces when screwed onto shower pipe, with the largest one ending up inside the pipe.The good part is their customer service, which quickly replaced broken shower head after I filled a short online form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shower EVER!","review":"Been using this showerhead for the past 10 years. We tried a different one after the first one needed to be replaced (after 8 years of daily+ use!!) and we weren't happy at all! Bought another one of these and our great shower is back! I hope they never discontinue this showerhead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak,cheap, doesnt live up to expectations","review":"No chrome, just plastic, more cheaply made than past versions. This product has a weak anemic stream and does not live up to the waterpik reputation.

The description of the product says there are 6 settings but I can only get 4 to operate. I cannot get the mist or water pause settings no matter how I adjust the head. The water pressure on the center spray setting is amazing. It is almost like a pressure washer. It is wonderful for rinsing shampoo out of your hair in a hurry and rinsing soap off quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shower head","review":"I am a short person and love this showerhead.

Wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unsatisfying pressure.","review":"To be fair, the phrase \\"works at virtually any water pressure\\" is vague. It should have been a red flag immediately, but let the buyer beware. The flex arm works as in the description, but the \\"satisfying\\" shower comment is not accurate. I enjoy a hard needle-like shower, and this is NOT NOT NOT the shower head for me. If you're looking for a \\"gentle rain\\" with the same force as a feather floating to the ground, then buy this one. Me? I am passing this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"This piece of junk is nothing like the one I bought 10 years ago. It's leaky, has no pressure (even with the restricter removed), the setting adjuster is a pain in the A**, the massager setting is a joke.....etc, etc, etc...and I bought 2 of these things for dual shower, so it's not a fluke lemon, only thing it does have is it looks better than the 10 year old one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"I have owned one of the first waterpik adjustable shower heads and it was great!!!

It's the best shower head I've ever had. The flexible head is all I need in my stand up shower to reach every space I need to when cleaning and it stays perfectly still when I use it as I shower. I love it!Each spray setting is strong and I just keep it on one but if you like to change it up from massage to soft spray then this is the head for you too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shower","review":"The flexible shower head is exactly what you need if you are 5'10\\" or taller. This is the first shower I have ever had that I don't have to duck my head to get under. 6 settings from massage to full spray. I did have to go to the hardware to get a 90 degree elbow and a 4\\" nipple because the pipe coming out of the wall was pointed down before installing the shower head. Very satisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waterpik Showerhead","review":"Product works great. Arrived very fast. I prefer the flexible hose on this showerhead as opposed to the hand-held versions that are mainly offered through retail stores. Definately recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes shower time fun","review":"I bought this shower head to replace a similar earlier model, which became clogged and difficult to change settings (I blame it on the hard water in AZ). I have had this one for about six months now. and it works great. Good pressure, even with the low flow thingamajig in there. the individual spray outlets are made of a soft rubber-like material, so if they do become clogged, you can give them a flick with your finger and they clear out. the snake like extension allows you to direct the spray almost anywhere and still have two free hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been looking","review":"We love this shower head. My mom recently moved into a rental and the shower is to low for her ( she is only 5'3 )She LOVES our shower and we finally found it for her @ Amazon !!

Yes its a little noisy during adjustment... but your taking a shower... who cares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great showerhead","review":"We needed this to replace an old old showerhead in an old bathroom - it's nice that it fits right into the spot of the old one and is adjustable for my very tall husband.

So this is a buyer beware. Gives great showers as long as you remove the stupid water restrictor inside the tube. BUT, and I mean BUT...keep an eye for mold!Here it is May 27, 2011 and this showerhead has developed black drippy MOLD around the center nozzles, also some of the outer green rubber nozzles! I've owned Waterpiks since the early 80's and this is THE 1st to ever get mold...nasty. Took it off and soaked the head and tube with bleach. It now appears every 3 months I will need to soak the head and tube in bleach to prevent/retard mold growth. If it starts to gather mold sooner I'll chunk it in the recycle bin and buy something else, but not another Waterpik."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"This showerhead is perfect for a shower shared by someone short (me) and someone tall (my husband) as it can be adjusted up or down, toward the side of the shower or right in the middle of the shower. I have had this model in three houses and a duplex over the past few years, and replace it with the exact same thing whenever I have to. I have also caught my husband using it to rinse down the sides of the shower, kind of like a hand-held sprayer would work - but I wouldn't encourage that sort of behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good shower at last","review":"The Waterpic allows me to adjust the shower for my 6'1\\" height and also allows my 5' wife to adjust it to her height. I love the ability to select the type of shower spray from a gentle spray to hard pulsating beads of water. I highly recommend the Waterpik shower head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fifth Waterpik Showerhead","review":"This is fifth Waterpik Showerhead I've had over several years. When moving into a different house or addition, I ALWAYS purchase one. Guests love being able to adjust height, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pressure","review":"Love it! We have well water and have the worst water pressure, not to mention very hard water. We have removed the water constrictor and cannot get over the difference.

The older model that's all white was in our shower at our old apt and we loved it. This new version leaks. Had to send it back"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good pressured spray but some serious problems.","review":"I bought this in Jan 08. The pressure and spray patterns are great. However, I get a small amount of water that backs up and comes out where my shower pipes screws in the product's neck. Also, I like taking the head and rinsing the soap off the walls when I am through. Several times the head has fallen off. Thankfully, so far it has not broke and pushes back in. All in all I would not buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shower Head","review":"I ordered two other shower heads before this one and sent them back. They both had fixed heads which didn't say in the description. I ordered two of the Waterpik flexible arm shower heads, one from Amazon.com and one from Overstocked[...]. The one from Overstocked was a little over $[...] less but that may have been last year's model. They both work fine. One leaks a little at the connection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showerhead","review":"I love this product- it is flexible, adaptable, and there is plenty of spray and pressure. The best showerhead for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but junk","review":"In our case, just garbage in less than two months. But a very useful concept, since it let my young daughter have the shower head at an appropriate height when she used the master shower. But. It completely stopped working after seven weeks. Wouldn't pass water, and the unit is completely sealed, so there's no way to self-service it, and Amazon's return policy had expired."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer stays in position after 3 months.","review":"I used the flex hose to rinse the shower walls after each shower. It worked very well for three months, but something in the hose gave out and it no longer maintains it's position. May not be designed for the amount of movement I put it through. Loved it right up until it gave out after a short 3 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"not like previous versions","review":"I have had a water-pik flexible neck showerhead since they first came out and it was time for a new one. When the new showerhead arrived and I installed it, I thought it was broken and sent it back. Alas, the replacement was just as bad. It was flimsy and made a rattling sound in massage mode. It did not have 6 settings, just 4--no water pause or misting. The most important setting it is missing is the water pause feature. I have a well and in a dry year it's important to conserve water. The water pause feature reduced the flow to a small stream--just enough to wash my face or rinse my razor while shaving my legs. If you have never owned the previous versions you would like this showerhead. It is easy to install and I LOVE the flexible neck. I will continue using my old one until they make a new one that truly has all 6 advertised settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"shower head","review":"I found the older version better the white one, this one when you take out the restrictor to increase flow, leaks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked like it would work, but didn't","review":"We have a shower stall that we have had a hard time finding a decent shower head for. One user is tall the other short and an adjustable shower head was called for. This showerhead appeared that it would fit the bill perfectly. Unfortunately it never did intall corectly and the bendable neck did not stay where set once installed.The installation seemed easy enough but it leaked even with plumbers tape and the pressure was very poor. Took out the water restrictor and it leaked worse and the bendable neck did not stay where it was set and just fell over. It just seemed poorly made with cheap parts. It clearly was not what we wanted or needed. I ended up returning it as defective.We ended up going to a home improvement store spending more money but we now have a beautiful and very finctional shower head we are very happy with. I hope you have better luck than we did with this selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as nice as the old one","review":"Bought this to replace one that was about 5 or 6 years old. It is not as nice as the old one - fewer settings, settings it has are not the same as the older model. Seems to be much more cheaply made, too. the adjustment ring I don't see lasting very long at all. I am also very afraid to use any of my bath cleaners on it even though it's directions said I could use certain ones. I fear they will mar the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lonesome Dove - Tales of the Plains.","review":"This is probably one of the worst western videos I have ever seen.The story is pathetic and the acting the same,the location did not seem authentic and was based in a very small area. It is very sad that creative people like Suzanne De Passe and Larry McMurtry can be connected to something as poor as this. There,is of course,no comparison with the rest of the Lonsome Dove Collection which were superb. I think the only way the above two people can make amends for this is to make an epic film of \\"Comanche Moon\\" with real top actors and so finish the Lonesome Dove Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent collection of tips and techniques","review":"This book is true to it's title. It is infact a very good book to understand some of the old and new features of Oracle databases. I have learned so many new things while going through this book. It is so easy to read and understand. It has excellent collection of tips and techniques.

END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too informative - gossipy","review":"Various Vincent Price fan club web pages and the word from the street network was this was centered too much on gossip and the daughter's troubled relationship with her stepmom and dad. I tried to balance her viewpoints reading the book, but I was disappointed. Struck me as funny that she didn't dare publish this while the great Vincent was still alive. Bringing up idle rumors that are doubtlessly groundless in a book like this isn't the way I would memorialize my parents. I feel I didn't learn anything new about Vincent, but I learned alot about Victoria Price - which is of no interest to me. Can't compare to the Midnight Marquee book and a book by Lucy Chase Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vincent Price Remembered","review":"What a refreshing way to read about a favorite celebrity. No Mommy Dearest here. This book by Mr. Price's daughter gives an honest and loving portrait of a great star from a daughters perspective. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Daddy Dearest","review":"Victoria Price's book was a big disappointment. Price's own autobiography covers his early years, and the films are throroughly and more acurately covered by Lucy Chase Williams' book. Victoria's book is long, but the only \\"new\\" information would have been better left unsaid. Much of it is republican bashing from both father and daughter, at times it's hard to tell which is actually speaking. To them, it's heroic to oppose fascism, but those who opposed communism as well are \\"villains\\". The conservative bashing extended to trying to prevent the John Wayne Cancer Center from getting money Coral Browne willed them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof Greatness Skips A Generation","review":"Such a charming, elegant, and intelligent man deserved much better. Victoria's liberal bias taints an otherwise sentimental recollection of life with one of the most gracious men that ever lived. Instead read Vincent Price's own writings, which are much more revealing and still widely available."},{"rating":"1","title":"A daughter's views.","review":"I considered myself a fan of Vincent Price since I was a small child. His voice, his height, his choices of roles, I was hooked. However, after having read Victoria's account of his life, I no longer consider myself a fan. Her views on his politics were not necessary. In my opinion, the comments bordered on hate. I wish I had selected a biography written by someone other than Victoria, then I would not have been so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm...","review":"Man, this album kicks ass. The best, along with Road Apples. Starting off with Blow At High Dough, and ending with the tremendously underrated Opiated, which, in my useless opinion, is their best song. If you are a fan of the Hip, then you already have this album. But if not, this is a good place to start, the go on chronologically. 5 stars is an understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second album shows potential","review":"While the first self titled album was ok Up To Here really gave the first look at the full potential of the band. An excellent album. Their most frequently requested - and arguably most popular song in the U.S. - New Orleans is Sinking is about average for this album. There are a couple of songs I am not a big fan of (I'll believe in you for example and blow at high dough is average hip at best) but even they aren't bad. The flip side is excellent - Another midnight, opiated, etc. are absolutely fantastic. I always start on song 7 or so and let it play around. 38 years old is also a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine album - REM derivative","review":"This is a very good album but listening to The Hip, whether on CD or live (and they do put on excellent live shows) reminds one that they are fairly derivative of REM. Downey has a knock-off Michael Stipe voice, facsimile idiosyncrasies and clever, opaque lyrics. Lead guitarist is Peter Buck knock-off; hot licks, deadpan stage presence. Drummer is Bill-Berry-manic.Not that The Hip aren't a great band. They're just another example of the derivative nature of Canadian pop culture. Just as Much Music is MTV 10 years after the fact, TSN is ESPN a decade later, \\"Traders\\" is \\"L.A. Law\\" transposed to an investment bank, etc... The Hip are REM five or six years after the fact. An excellent, if unoriginal, Canadian product. But the album is hot. It's easy to see why US college radio picked up on these guys around '90. And why they can still pack arenas in Canada. Wave those maple leafs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks","review":"I could never figure out why this subpar band got popular, I mean sure Poets had a decent beat but this stuff sounds like \\"trying to hard no soul\\" rock which is the sucky kind.

If you're a fan, you'll read it, but be prepared to be disappointed. The story is weak and formulaic, the mystery is contrived, the characters don't seem as likable as before. Even the title seems to be trying too hard. Hopefully, if this series continues, the next entry won't be such a paint-by-number effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder Book Most Foul","review":"I came across this book at a sale; after reading the first few chapters, I checked Amazon and was disappointed to find that it was still in print. Jane seems like a fifties' holdover, and the descriptions of the many meals and snacks are simply tedious. The worst aspect of this book isn't even the shoddy editing--it's the tone. The anti-feminist take here is appalling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as others in this series","review":"I have read all the books in this series and this was the weakest. I couldn't stay with it and skipped ahead to the end. Hopefully the next book will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Entry in an Uneven Series","review":"The Jane Jeffrey series can be pretty good--and it can positively stink. This entry is a clunker. I guess I keep reading the series for the prospect of a good book coming along; every once in a while one does. Churchill really needs to stop bragging about her parents in the diplomatic corps, and I can definitely do without her incessant snarky comments about her daughter (in contrast to her huge love for her apparently saintly sons). She also needs a better editor. Almost every dialog bit in this series begins with Shelley saying, \\"Jane,--\\" or Jane saying, \\"Shelley, --\\" This book was particularly grating in its gratuitous (and passe) attack on feminism, which Churchill apparently regards as a huge farce, as she does *every* social concern. Give the woman a t.v. set and a bag of chips and she's happy! Jane Jeffrey is more trailer park than she knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this book","review":"Homophobic. Xenophobic. Definitely not as good as the other Jane Jeffrey mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real disappoinment","review":"My wife reads aloud to me by the fire. We have enjoyed other Jill Churchill books, so we were looking forward to this one. My Goodness what a mess! The plot was hap-hazard and undeveloped. The characters, humor and mystery were all non-existent. The pages were full of careless, unedited typographical errors, misspelling, and gramatical disasters. Words were left out of sentences and sentences trailed off without an ending. The conclusion of the book was a relief. What a shame! Maybe Jill Churchill had a deadline she could not meet. Maybe her publisher did not print it correctly. Maybe it was just a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standard","review":"What usually makes Churchill's \\"Jane and Shelley\\" team so personable is their ability to use their knowledge of human nature to solve a mystery they have a sincere interest in. In this book, Shelley and Jane reveal that they don't know much about feminism, equating \\"feminism\\" with \\"man-hating idiocy\\". (I know many, many feminists. Never yet met one who insisted on calling women by men's names.) They don't use any of their own knowledge to solve the mystery--and in fact they never do. It's solved by sheer accident, as if the writer suddenly said to herself, \\"Oops! Forgot to reveal the murderer!\\"I have really enjoyed all the other books in this series (some more, some less, but I enjoyed them). \\"Mulch Ado About Nothing\\" was a bit weak. But this book I actually disliked. I'm not sure whether I'll be following the series in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirated?

I don't have the album yet, and am kind of afraid to get it, as I'm worried that it won't match the quality of \\"Take Me Out.\\" However, the two b-sides on this single are pretty good, so I'll probably take my chances.Do yourself a favor and download this incredible, rocking song by Franz Ferdinand now.

This is their fifth album from 1993.'Naming the Band' is like a notch below. Nice, fun, but not a bang up buster like they are capable of. Sweet.The rest of the songs just don't hit the mark. I can hear them using similar methods, working on vocal harmony, clever lyrics, fun stories of uncommon subjects but they don't come together even close to the greatness they accomplished on those other four albums, aside from the spectacular 'Mr. Duality'.

The writing is a bit naive but one gets used to it and the story told catches one up. It reminded me of a Helen MacInnes novel, with the big difference: this account is real! It was published in 1943 and I understand was a selection of the Book of the Month Club. There is good propaganda in the account, but that does not really detract from the story, and I found that the book was pageturny.

Pick another if you want more than just bare bones basic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumbbell Book Review","review":"This booklet is good for the beginner weight lifter. It has all the basic exercises. What really surprised me is the thickness. It is a booklet smaller than a centimeter compromised of visual illustrations. Even though it's not as big as I thought it would be it gets the job done and illustrates basic dumbbell exercises thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for the perfect remix of \\"Vertigo\\"? this ain't it....","review":"When the Jack Lee Knife mix of this song was charting Billboard's dance chart, I was so excited to obtain it, because a mix of New Order's \\"Waiting for the Siren's Call\\" brilliantly captured New Order's classic sound while bringing it up to modern electro house standards. Can't say the same for this mix of U2's best song in years. What you need to do is get the CD single for \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On your Own,\\" which has the Redanka remix of \\"vertigo\\" as a b-side, a powerhouse 7 minute anthem mix of the song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing","review":"This CD hasn't left my player since I bought it a month ago. The first two songs were written by John Modlin, and they were arranged and performed by John and Larry Baker. They are my favorites! The arrangements and performances by John on other old classics such as the Coast of Marseilles and Classical Gas are terrific. I look forward to hearing his next album of all original music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Permanent Fixture","review":"This CD is has a permanent place on the CD player in our home. I bought it for my wife and we have been listening to it together ever since. A true masterpiece and another John Tesh triumph. I suggest the Pure Movies II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting for the memories !","review":"While John Tesh has provided me with many enjoyable evenings through his music -- this CD allows me to also remember many of the best movies with vivid detail. If you are one who likes movies and music, this CD will allow you to relive the best parts of many excellent movies while working on any project. John Tesh has again provided us with an exceptional production and recording of his music. This CD will be a fine addition to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insomnia??? This should cure it.","review":"This is one of the most uninspired albums I've ever heard. Maybe most of this material has been overexposed but John Tesh sounds like someone had to wake him up to finish most of these tunes. From the sickly sweet 'My Heart Will Go On' to 'Everything I Do I Do It For You', most go from track to track and sound like one big selection. The only bright spot is the organ track on 'Tears In Heaven'. John stick to albums like 'Sax By The Fire'.zzzzZZZZZZ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is not one I have been able to get excited over","review":"This is the first John Tesh cd for me to buy and it will probably be the last, stay tuned. On this cd John doesn't place himself in a position to really shine as a soloist. He uses guitar and some other electroinic sounds which keep his performanace at bay. I have grown accustomed to listing to soloist that can give command performances. This performance of Johns' is a bit shy of what I would call a command performance.My advise to John would be to cultivate his performing skills more to where he could possibly become a great soloist. I know it is a lot harder to performn as a soloist, but these performance are more than worth all that hard work.I Can Not Recommend This Cd"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe it!","review":"How can any of these people below me possibly say that this is a five star record. I listened to this as a JOKE, and it wasn't funny. Soul-less renditions of rehashed music from movies that we are just sick and tired of (we meaning the moral majority). I am beginning to think that these reviews mean nothing since there are too many five star and not enough of the truth (**note to Amazon** if this doesn't get posted - then I know that John Tesh is paying you under the table for the reviews. We will see within the week.) But in all honesty, this is the worst John Tesh album, which makes is a pretty bad album altogether..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"This may be a large but it is too long from side to side, not wide enough from top to bottom, and is the flimsiest window shade I have ever purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!!!","review":"The recording is better then the first recording that came out and the music is just great.

This recording is out-of-print (I've been looking for it on CD for over 5 years)which is a crime because to true jazz fans - as opposed to syrupy pseudo jazz - every note on every cut is right on the money. The band cooks and both Chuck and Gerry are in a zone. Gerry left the band shortly after, my guess is he didn't want to go in the direction Chuck was taking.Come on Mercury, reissue the Quartet recording! Let people hear what Chuck can really do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiney Obnoxious Children","review":"The children in this dvd struck us as providing a terrible example of tone of voice and attitude. We bought this for our grandson, but could not give it to him. Kids often copy what they see and hear. The choice of songs seems good (we could not stand to listen to much of it, however) and I felt bad tossing it in the trash and was moved to warn others of the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Author","review":"I just finished Victoria Beckham's autobiography \\"Learning to Fly\\". In it she discusses a horrible court case her and her husband had gone through with this author fighting for this book not to be made. The guy that Andrew Morton's information is based off of was Victoria's old bodygaurd. He was the man believed by the FBI to be the one sending the kidnap and death threats that held the family's lives in fear for years. I would never support a person that disrespected someone that i admire so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is LITERALLY a collection of tabloid articles.","review":"So why did I pay good money for a book which has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW other than rehashed tabloid articles?? I could have just read through a newspaper archive. This book is full of \\"reportedly,\\" \\"allegedly,\\" \\"it was claimed,\\" meanwhile, isn't Andrew Morton supposed to be a journalist?? Couldn't he have confirmed or investigated any of these allegations, reports and claims?? This was the worst biography I have read in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I never read a book by this author before, so I didn't have any preconceptions. I was looking for a biography of two celebrities I admire so I could learn more about them and their rise to fame. This book was not a good choice. I can't say I learned anything new of any real interest, and I was put off by the hostile tone of the author, especially toward Victoria Beckham. No one is perfect, but this book really seemed to unfairly accentuate the couples' flaws and downplay their strengths. Nobody deserves to be criticized like that. It was unkind and not a pleasant read. I still admire the Beckhams for their many good qualites, however I'm not so sure about the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"this book didn't tell me anything i didn't already know. i guess i was hoping it would go more into friendships and events these two had been involved with but it seemed to just skim over their life with the bare minimum of details. i wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bingo","review":"A fun family film adapted from the children's song \\"Bingo\\" a dog that was owned by a man.

The young boy says \\"Holy S***\\" and the dad says \\"d***\\" within the first 20 minutes alone! Besides the language, the concept of centerfolds and scantily clad circus performers appear for no reason at all. The parents of this boy are horrendous. There were no redeeming qualities to this movie. I recycled ours (couldn't even bring myself to subject anyone at Goodwill to own it!). If you think I'm just being overprotective, then skip it simply for the extremely bad acting. No matter how you look at it, it is bad Bingo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's The Aspect Ratio of The DVD?","review":"This is a cute movie about a boy and his dog and I recommend it to anyone who likes dog movies. Does anyone know what the aspect ratio is for this movie on the DVD? Is it widescreen or an edited pan and scan? I would hate to buy the DVD and find out it's just an edited pan and scan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent movie.","review":"I don't care what people might say, but I love this film. I saw it many years ago on VHS. So for me it's nostalgia to see it again on DVD in better quality... There must be something special about films, which you have seen, been a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"And Awful Was Its NAME-O","review":"This movie will only be appreciated by the youngest of crowds...so WHY ALL THE BAD LANGUAGE? It's touted as a \\"Family\\" film..what family would want to sit around watching little kids cuss and give each other the finger?Maybe it's for an older audience? Ummm...no. The dog drives a car, has a one night stand, testifies in court, gets a nasal membrane transplant (b/c his smeller has worked too hard), administers CPR...Need I go on? Oh...and he spends much of the movie tracking down his human friend who has left him a URINE trail to follow. No wonder his smeller needs to be replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the trash went this trash","review":"I don't even know where to begin. This movie is nothing -- and I mean nothing -- you'd want your kids to watch, no matter how old they are.Kids and adults in this movie swear, flip the bird and insult each other. The entire \\"joke\\" of a family that would wait out a night before looking for their lost child gave my son nightmares, and he's 10 years old. The flashback to a fire that killed the dog's mother frightened him and the dark plot that centers around an eatery that turns dogs into dogmeat utterly horrified both of us. We turned the movie off after 15 minutes and threw it away. I wouldn't regift this DVD to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent","review":"Violent, coarse, and unredeeming. Not for children of any age. If you want your children to learn to pronounce F**K, S**T,P**S, C**P and other expletives,--this is the movie for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Perfect!","review":"This is a CD to just sit back, relax, and enjoy. You're hearing JAZZ as it was always meant to be. Basie and Peterson create music together in the truest sense of music: appearing-and sounding- effortless, perfect, lyrical: you can just smile, and realize they're being themselves, having fun, and creating great Jazz. Freddie Green, Ray Brown, and Louie Bellson add to the genuinely perfect mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"I haven't returned it yet but I'm going to","review":"These bags were just awkward. Didn't really fit onto my luggage rack very well. I've tried every configuration of bungees and straps I could think of and it still didn't tighten down like I wanted it to and it would have been a pain in the tookus to get off to take in somewhere. I ended up with a leather messenger bag from the big named dealer where we bought the bike and it was perfect. Rediculously expensive, but perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chabannes good but difficult to show to younger crowd","review":"I purchased this video after seeing it recommended by the random acts of kindness website. I planned to show it to 8th grade students. The length of the video and its incredible detail made it impossible to show to students of this age who aren't history buffs already. I was able to use a few of the chapters as backup to a description of what was happening at that time. I would not recommend this for anyone below a 10th grade level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Materialized View Section Needs Updating","review":"I only looked at the section on Materialized Views and must say that its one of the few books to cover this topic in some detail. However, readers should be aware that some of the parameters mentioned in the text are not correct and therefore will not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good examples, but not well written","review":"Save your money on this one. I liked the overview of the ORDBMS in Chapter 1, and the treatment of partitioning, but overall this collection of tips is just that-- a set of tips for the expert minus a well-written orientation to new features. If you can glean more information from examples rather than the surrounding text, then this might be a good reference, but don't count on it to teach you the neat stuff in Oracle 8i."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I was very excited about getting this book for my son.

I could use my laptop without having it plugged in for a couple hours at a time, but as time went on that period of time got shorter. A couple months ago my laptop would suddenly just die, and then I'd have to plug in the charger and have it charge all over again.

I found one intermediate level tutorial (scrolling text boxes). Even for a beginer book, there just isn't enough information.

Incedibly written for two young guys, the story and movie are excellent companions. The inner workings of Will are the focal point of the story and kept me interested all the way through"},{"rating":"2","title":"A screenplay devoted to challenging the mind, heart, and sou","review":"This screenplay penned by Matt Damon and his pal Ben Affleck is both immensely heartfelt and beautifully scripted. Its dialogue is extremely well-thought and intelligent. This is extremely evident in the conversations between Will Hunting, a genius janitor with a sad family history, and his psychologist, Sean. It's setting of Southern Boston is also a beautiful addition to the visual images the screenplay plays in our minds. The basic story about a young man trying to cope with family pain is somewhat similar to the film \\"Ordinary People\\". This is a piece of riveting literature not only for Hollywood honchos and box office bullies, but also for people who enjoy a wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Great!","review":"I really loved the movie and I really love the book.

I read this in one night and I was not impressed at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy production, just like the film.","review":"I like the packaging of this nice little book. With the popularity of the film, someone might have been tempted to make a handsome profit by padding up the screenplay with glossy photos and selling the thing for $25 a shot. But for less than $10, this is a nice read and a great treat for fans of the movie. Everything is tastefully done, starting with Van Sant's thoughtful introduction. For film students, reading the script and comparing it with the final product on screen is a great lesson in film-making that money can't buy. In many scenes, the difference between the screenplay and the dialogue in the film is just a few subtle words (\\"That's a SUPER philosophy, Will\\" as opposed to \\"That's a WONDERFUL philosophy, Will\\")that make all the difference. I even like the black-and-white photos placed in just the right spots throughout the book. Classy all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"It's amazes me how brilliant this screenplay and movie are!

But the screenplay is even more incredible, and it is blatantly obvious how talented these two writers and actors are. Seeing the movie enhances the screenplay, as ad-libbing is major and the hilarious stories are even funnier. Even without the movie, this is a fine piece of work and it deserves to be enjoyed by all who would hold it with as high esteem as it deserves. Enjoy and good luck Matt and Ben!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"Why, you ask, would anyone rate this screenplay a mere 3? I mean, there's that searing NSA monologue...that alone is worth a 10!But wait! In spite of a lengthy quotation from that monolog in Amazon.com's review (soon to be removed, I hope), NONE of that monolog is included in the book being sold here!Certainly I expect there to be differences between a screenplay and what appears on the screen; however, film-only material should not be included in a review of a published screenplay without clearly stating that the material appears only in the film version."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad to find this book so dire","review":"I have read many of this author's books and enjoyed most of them; indeed some are, in my view, in the 5 star/keeper category. Not this one. I admit I gave up after page 75. The stilted, silly dialogue, the ridiculous over-done cardboard characters and the wholly unbelievable plot was too much and, frankly, I was not prepared to waste my time plodding through something that had already bored me to tears. The author seemed to have found a plot she could not properly bring in line and then populated it with characters who could not catch my attention. It was, sadly, for me a huge, huge disappointment. Hopefully this is a one-off aberration!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The American Civil War: A Union Divided","review":"Very disapointed at first. Very biased against the south. The first half hour talked how slavery was the cause of the civil war not states rights.

Some information is good but don't belive everthing that is said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yankee drivel","review":"Well, this just goes to show you, Yankee revisionists are still trying to make the South out to be the greatest evil the world has ever seen.

These tunes show what the music world lost through her choice. She has a richness, vibrancy, and depth to her voice which are nearly unmatched; her pitch is superb; and her interpretations are sensitive and resonant. This sounds heretical, but I prefer her work to that of Bessie Smith, Lizzie Miles, or Billie Holliday. The other musicians on this CD are up to the task of supporting her. Anyone liking traditional jazz or the blues will not want to miss this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite in the series, but still good","review":"This book was not my favorite book in the dark-hunter series.

The story line was slightly different but still mystifying. I found it to be a very good follow up to other Dark Hunter books, and look forward to future books by this author. Its about time someone decided to develop a story around a plus size woman. The main character Bride was truly heartwarming. I always enjoy the characters from previous works who show up to give assistance whenever the need arises. The inter-play between the various characters in this story was funny and entertaining. This series continues to entertain me and to think there are so many other hunters to look foward to, especially \\"Valerius\\". I have accessed Sherrilyn Kenyon's website for r dark-hunters and wonder \\"why there isn't a Calendar on the market with those hunks and their bios available?\\" Can someone look into this?

I can forgive what, to me, was very juvenile dialogue in something like Twilight, which made up for that in tension, but this is an adult book and Twilight is probably the only YA series I will ever trudge through. I guess a girl in her twenties might still be in that really awkward stage but I wouldn't be able to socialize with her which left me wondering why the hero would. OK, so she's a bigger girl...why can't she set an example and be proud of who she is? Just a thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Kenyon's worst","review":"You know how you finish a short story and think \\"This would have been better as a novel.\\"? In this case, this would have been better as a short story. It just kept dragging on and on. In addition, Kenyon has taken a pre-established alpha-dog (pardon the pun) character and turned him into a whishy-washy wimp. I didn't even like him in this book when his appearances in previous books practically had me panting. This was the deciding factor for me that no Kenyon book was worth running out to buy the day it comes out. I wait on the library.On a side note, Simi is the most annoying literary character ever created. She is on par with JarJar Binks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in Kindle format?","review":"Why would Book 6 of the series not be in Kindle format when all the rest are?

I have decided her books fall into 3 categories - \\"Buy,\\" \\"Borrow\\" and \\"Don't Bother.\\" This books is a don't bother, because it's just irritating with a big \\"ick factor.\\"The entire book is essentially \\"really hot studyl guy has the hots for an obese woman.\\" Yeack. It's very difficult to like a character who likes nothing about herself and just feels sorry for herself. Several of Kenyon's characters - (such as Grace in book 1 and Sunshine in book 3) are described in rather unflattering terms, but in this book Kenyon takes it to a whole new level, and NOT in a good way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Completely Forgettable Trash","review":"Looking for something light to read between the last Dexter novel and the upcoming Vince Flynn, I pulled this one off the shelf. My Wife likes Kenyon, so I thought I'd try one. Unfortunately, I realized about 100 pages in that I had already read this one before. What total trash! Oohh, he's so sexy. Oohh, I can't wait to get in her pants...\\" Blah, blah, blah. The unfortunate part is that it starts off almost interesting. But, it falls quickly after the prologue. Its a book about nothing, without Seinfeld's wit.Basically, all we have here is a writer detailing her leather-clad, bad-boy [...] for her readers, like all her other books. She came highly recommended, but I would never pick up one of her books again. Just creepy-bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"The sex scenes are quite disturbing. Especially when the heroine is a size 18. Maybe the author is trying to reach out to the plus size women and I totally get the point, you don't have to be stick skinny to live in this world, but this a romance novel and I'd like the author to at least keep the heroines the dress size they usually wear.She also has to be more convincing on how a classic handsome looking heart throb managed to fall in love with a woman such as Bride. She just seems a little plain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up All Night Reading.","review":"I've read four of her books and I'm fully addicted and can't wait to get the next one! I wind up staying up very late trying to get to the next page and once I get to that page I want to read more - I can't put it down. It's entertaining, funny and full of action and romance!

I liked the continuation of the story of the wolves. I especially liked how the ending wasn't wrapped in an over sized bow. We hope it turns out okay. I found myself routing for the characters and how the heroine spent time thinking her love for the hero through.

The heroine whined so much about her weight that it was all I could focus on. I wanted to read a romance. Not a book about a girl with a weigh complex. I would have liked someone who was comfortable with themselves & less self obsessed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greeeeeeeeeeeeatttttttttt!!!!!!!!","review":"I absolutey love SK.

Bride McTierney is a normal human being. In this installment of the Dark Hunter series, Kenyon gives us a better understanding of the Katagaria and Arcadian worlds.I enjoyed this novel, as I have the other Were novels. I thought the plot was well crafted and the action paced well. The supporting characters have a depth themselves, especially if you've read the other books in the series.Bride is a a sensible heroine and I appreciated her size. Vane is a lovable sort of hero and despite him being described as feral and dangerous on numerous occasions I had trouble seeing him as anything else than a big, loving puppy.I enjoyed their story and look forward to reading Fury's, which I hope Kenyon will write soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book introduced me to this series!","review":"I am amazed. I love this book, and I went and bought the rest of the series a week later! I am a big fan of Laurell K Hamilton, though I admit her latest books have to much sex in them. Though the Dark Hunter series is in the romance section at the book store, it has less sex and the same amount of action as LKH's books that are in the scifi/ficiton section. I love the witty humor, and the guys of the DH series. I am a dedicated fan and can not wait until her new book comes out. Definately a worth while read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, Not the best.","review":"While this book was enjoyable, it didn't have me on the edge of my seat for most of the book and it had a few flaws. Bride was a heroine that had major self image issues, which bordered on annoying. The ending seemed a little rushed and Bride has a complete character change in the last few pages. So that's my deal with giving this book a 4. I liked Vane very much, and could see the set up of the next book in the series, Valerius and Tabitha's, which I am really looking forward. All in all, not the best in the Dark Hunter Series, but I'm one book closer to Acheron!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fallen angle","review":"love this movie just bought it on amazon it is a great movie to watch any time of the year with whole family i will give this movie a 5 star rateing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things lost and found in a movie.","review":"Fallen Angel is not just a Christmas romance.

I was skeptical that such a small tube was enough to lubricate the entire screw, but it was exactly the correct amount.Update 11/2010: As another reviewer mentioned, only 1-2 months after application all the hideous noises returned. Reapplication led to similar results. If you buy this, be prepared for frequent re-application at a high price. Rather than buying more, I will be trying the other Genie product mentioned by the other reviewer.Update 6/2012: Turns out the problem with my door was related to the design of the screw drive, not the lubrication. I have returned my review to 5-star. Per an Overhead Door repairman, my Genie/Overhead Door Screw Drive opener has a design flaw that creates a gap in the screw components when the parts are subject to cold temps.

A lot has changed and there is little to explain all that has happened over the years, but I was drew into this story as things unfolded. I enjoyed this one. I like to think that Pea was Call's Deputy in the flashback because it was during the time mentioned in Return to Lonesome Dove when Gus and Woodrow weren't talking.

He is a ruined man after his walk in the wild!

What remains, however, is awfully good. You could call this an experimental work where some stuff came out well, some stuff badly. Overall though what you get from this album is a set of songs that differ from the usual mundane releases so popular with record companies. Efforts such as Corpses, My Star and What Happened to Ye are just fantastic. The overall sound is raw and underproduced- in contrast to a lot of music these days. And also in contrast to The Seahorses album released by the other half (John Squire)of the Stone Roses song writing duo. The debut album by The Seahorses, \\"Do it Yourself\\" is quite simply rubbish! Maybe there is something in what Ian Brown said, \\" the difference between me and John Squire is that I write songs for the people while he writes songs for himself\\"!! Nice to see that they still get along then!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I was exploring the Paris Virgin Megastore and stumbled upon this.

I was confused: was this horrible thing what I listened to in the France? Well, it was and now I'm stuck with it. Maybe somebody will buy it off me. But it's got sloppy drums, sloppy vocals, the lyrics are nonsense (\\"There are no lions in England/No no no!\\") and it just frustrates me to listen to it.

The word is starting to percolate in society and become stigmatized. This book highlights the anguish individuals with this illness experience and the projection of this pain that their loved once have to face. Authors honesty about her own thoughts and feelings helps the reader empathize with her, even as they might wonder, how can she not see what she is doing? This book provides insightful information and realistic hope to families and patients of BPD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am the partner of a borderline","review":"I bought this on the strength of the other very favourable reviews, seeking to understand more about the condition which my wife has suffered from, seemingly for some years now. As soon as I started reading there were so many similarities between Rachel's story in the book and my wife's story that I was desperate to get to the end of the book as I knew it had a happy ending. Although this is just one woman's story there will be something in this book for anyone who suffers from BPD or the people who love them and wants the inside story. One word of caution - leave the psychiatry to the experts, my wife did not appreciate me telling her that her inner child was acting out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"An excellent read - hard to put down.

Frankly it struck me more like-Rachel's rather a spoiled rich kid brat who grows up to be nasty spoiled bratty wife. She blames all her issues on BPD. The book was poorly written, one long overly melodramtic tale of endless whining and self pity. Bleeeh....don't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I have never written a review on here before, but having just finished this god-awful book, I am moved to. This may be the WORST book I have ever read...the writing is flat, boring, redundant and Reiland explains every little thing to the reader to make sure they \\"get it\\" (even simple things like the meaning of every possible bit of symbolism in a dumb bear she gave her therapist). By the end of the book, I honestly wanted her husband to leave her (with her poor kids)and for her therapist to call the cops. Mental illness is one thing but for Reiland, it seemed like she just didn't want to take responsibility for her actions and her husband and therapist enabled her to be a giant turd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost like reading my own story","review":"This book shows you the true, strong, feelings and emotions that are involved in borderline personality. It's not psychobable. It's an honest and straightforward picture of what it is like to be borderline.

It explores the reasons for the diagnosis, the individuals \\"ourbursts\\" and typical borderline behavior, and how her therapist deals with it and helps her gain insight to her illness. Definitely worth reading for anyone who has BPD, treats BPD, or even knows someone with BPD! BPD individuals can be difficult to work with at times, but this book shows that through perseverance, anything is possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"a touching story","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The story is a very touching and moving one. I feel as if I had gone through the inspiring and at times heartbreaking journey with the author. I didn't think psychiatrists such as hers exist. If they really do, then anybody would be truly blessed to be their patient. The author is very lucky to have had the support system that she did, so we need to keep in mind that her story is an exception, not the norm. But nevertheless, I gained a lot of insight into this condition, and also into the 'human condition' in general. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"this book was very well done. i have bpd and i found myself crying through most of it. i couldn't put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"Love this book.

After 8 years of therapy, I realized along with my diagnosis of PTSD, I also suffer from BPD. \\"Get Me Out Of Here\\" helped me face some of my own issues and has helped me open up new dialogue with my therapist so that I can heal too.

Thank you, Rachel Reiland, for your honesty and willingness to share your experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding insight on BPD!","review":"I thoughly enjoyed the first-person account of recovering from Borderline Personality Disorder. Rachel Reiland is a truly talented author who happened to suffer from this form of mental illness. If you have been recently diagnoised or have a loved-one who has been diagnoised with BPD, and you want to know what it is truly like to suffer with BPD... You NEED this book!

As I read through the book I had various emotions from sadness & tears to laughter & joy. Anyone who is living with BPD or has a family member dealing with this disorder will find this book very insightful. It is not a self-help, medical read but of one's personal struggle with BPD. I speak from someone who is dealing with it personally and could relate to many of the issues that the author dealt with. My heart goes out to everyone who is living with this disorder as it can be very difficult and overwhelming at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Not Supposed to Be Here","review":"Even people who have not been touched by mental illness will enjoy this fascinating, compelling story. Rachel Reiland's honest, insightful recounting of her battle with borderline personality disorder offers a vivid picture of the borderline mind and the devastation it can cause, but also testifies that recovery is possible. Those whose lives are affected by the disorder will find hope in Reiland's courageous story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book. Worthless. She praises abusive healthcare staff for \\"helping\\" her. Awful!","review":"I cannot believe this book got so many good reviews. The psychiatrist that she praises so much was obviously a coN and abusive person. It hurt me to even read about what he and the hospital staff have done to her. Just like One Flight over a Coockoo's nest. The behavior of healthcare workers was completely inappropriate and abusive. Their licenses should have been taking away for treating a patient in such way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Me Out Of This Book","review":"I think my problem with this book is that the author is so cruel and selfish it's difficult to care whether she recovers or not. She hates her husband, hates her kids, hates her therapist, hates life, hates herself and on and on...Her misery and self loathing seem completely justified. But she's nowhere as sick as her husband who doesn't stand up to her abuse of the entire family. He's the one who really needs therapy.I'm halfway through the book. It's been a struggle but I paid for it and I'm going to read every torturous page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading for mental healthcare counselors","review":"Okay, I did not know what to expect when purchasing this book, but I was intrigued by the synopsis. As a Board Certified Member in Expert Stress (BCETS)and a member of the American Academy of Experts in Traumatic Stress (AAETS) actively involved in treating veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, I suggest this should be required reading for EVERYONE in and considering on entering into the mental healthcare profession. Rachel eloquently elaborates on, not only what it is like to live with BPD, but describes the epitome of professionalism in counseling -- transference, boundaries, self-disclosure, and counseling metodology. I wish that I had read this book early in my journey in counseling. It is directly applicable, not only to BPD, but as dissociative identity disorder (DID) and other DSM-IV-TR disorders resulting from trauma in which transference is an issue. A 5-star rating is an understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing heartfelt story","review":"An amazing heartfelt story through the recovery process. I am so grateful that she shared this with us, perhaps more people will get the help they need after reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I picked this book up the other week and was quite looking forward to reading it as it sounded like a great memoir.My advice is this; if you're going to read this book be prepared for a very long (nearly 500 pages) rather dull and quite repetitive read. It seemed as though 80% of the book consisted of descriptions of Reiland's angry, out of control screaming matches with her patient-as-a-saint psychiatrist. I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again and it becomes rather boring.I have to say that the only thing that kept me reading is my interest in the process of Reiland's recovery from BPD and my hope that I would read of some sort of major transformation. However, overall I just found the book rather shallow, and although it IS indeed a memoir, I was continually irritated by Reiland's overwhelming sense of narcissism and self-absortion. Definitley not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Great book that gives an accurate portrayal of Borderline Personality Disorder! Keep in mind it's fiction though so not autobiographical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, too bad it was defective!","review":"I was really enjoying this book. I had purchased it with several other books to save on shipping costs. By the time I started reading it however, I was already past the return option date. I got to the middle of the book and discovered that an entire section of the book was REPEATED, (about 60 pages) and then after those erroneous pages it picked up as though the previous section was correct. After I got over being extremely angry, I tried to get help from Amazon with it, but it was too late. So...........I encourage all amazon customers to check their books upon receiving them to ensure that they are constructed appropriately. Otherwise, you might be stuck with a useless book, and an unfinished story, just like I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written in form, but flawed in substance.","review":"The reviewer below who cited logical errors in Raschke's thinking is dead-on, and he identifies a common larger fallacy in postmodern thinking - namely, inconsistent logic. It's a favorite tool of the modern scholar to use straw men and ad hominems, because in so doing, they subtly trick their listeners into thinking they've got the \\"other guy\\"'s number, then they go ahead and tear apart the argument.Personally, I'd be wary of anyone who wants to marry Christianity and postmodernism, because the two worldviews are fundamentally opposed to one another. This book is slick, and Raschke's a talented writer, but he's wrong. A better (or at least complimentary) read on postmodernism is Groothuis's \\"Truth Decay\\", because he accurately represents both thought-systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's all just Hold Hands in Church and sing \\"Imagine\\"","review":"I've been reading several of the tomes on the Emerging Church and the need to become \\"postmodern\\".

It is a quick read, which has the potential to relax, and will most certainly not tax the reader.

A good book to read quickly while you're looking around for something more substantial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Drum Heads!","review":"As far as I understand, you are supposed to replace your drum heads every 3 months. I do not know anyone with that kind of income, but regardless, I have had these drum heads on my set since October of 2006! Since then, I was in a touring band and they never let up. They're loose tuning heads, so drummers with small shells that need a deep sound will find it here. They're also incredible for any other setup one could imagine.

Good entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute story about daughter-father relationship","review":"This is a really cute story about the relationship between a father (Peter Falk) who is a mobster just released from prison who meets his daughter for the first time. It's a comedy with some foreseeable events but it's the performances that are fun to watch. Falk is terrific. Weist is lovingly hilarious as the \\"oversexed\\" mistress and mother of the daughter. Brenda Vacarro is wonderfully funny in a campy role as the wife. But Adrian Pasdar as the daughter's love interest and \\"young sidekick, mobster wannabe\\" is usually the perfect foil for the rest of the other outrageous, campy roles. Pasdar charmingly steals the scenes. Even though he is often the \\"straight man\\" in this comedy, he manages to play the comedic parts very well and is as funny as the more seasoned actors. Though dated (the daughter is a \\"Madonna wannabe\\") it is a truly fun ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this book right when it came out and just checked back to see the reviews. As an Apps DBA I was expecting alot more from this book. In my opinion 95% of the book is just filler with the largest sections of the book being about tunnig NT(for the users) and dealing with business people. Parts of this book might be a decent read if you are just starting to learn about Oracle apps, but a tunning book about Apps it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short hose and flimsy head.","review":"When I installed this the flow regulator was so aggressive that the trickle of water was unacceptable. After removing the flow regulator I was back to the good water pressure I expected. However, the first time I tried to adjust the spray with the water running the head came apart. Apparently the shower head is constructed so poorly that it can only handle about half the pressure my shower puts out. This is the first time I've ever had a problem with a shower head or any other plumbing fixture so my water pressure, while good, is not beyond normal ranges. Also the hose is just barely long enough for my shower where the head is mounted about six feet from the shower floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"For the $23 I paid for this...

It smells pretty bad initially but after few days it is okay, otherwise no complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Average","review":"The design is great with a sharp look which is the plus side to this review.I purchased this from its reviews here on Amazon to replace a cracked plastic shower head. After installing it, I notice the water pressure had reduced about 40%.

Overall settings and look are really nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking","review":"Keep Looking. I bought this showerhead because of the high number of reviews. When it came in, we took out the flow regulator 1st thing and installed. The water pressure is still pitiful. We always had great water pressure so I was very disappointed. Also, I bought the crome one for the blue circle and it was not blue, but grey. The dial to change pressure is cheap. We went to Walmart to look at other options, and I was hesitant to try anything there without being able to read reviews :-).. but we did buy the Peerless Four-Spray Hand Shower and Shower Head Combo, Chrome #76410. I love it! It is for sale here at Amazon for a few dollars cheaper than I paid for it and is free shipping. The new one has fantastic water flow. It does have a problem keeping the hand held secure, but we will find a way to fix that because it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odor problem","review":"While this product seems to be okay mechanically, I am seriously disappointed by the odor.Composed entirely of cheap plastics, the overpowering stench of platicizing chemicals is disgusting. The hose is the worst part.The stench has not passed in 3 days hanging in the shower and my experience is that when it's that strong it will not dissipate with time.When it warms up in the shower, it gets even worse.This is a serious caveat for those with asthma or COPD and I would recommend against this product for anyone bothered by chemical odors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I read PRO and CON reviews. I should have believed the CON.HOSE - The hose leaked so badly that I threw it out. Leaked with/without teflon tape. Leaked with rubber washer/ without rubber washer / with 2 rubber washers! It leaked so badly I find it hard to believe it was designed to work with this faucet. I threw it out and spent another $18 at hardware store for replacement hose (not Waterpik) that worked great immediately.SHOWERHEAD - Cheap, flimsy. Turn the selector knob and the head pops off. I have to place my hand over the shower head push and then turn it to change water flow. I have subsequently found better showerheads at my local hardware store - for the same price! Lesson learned...One star because it does allow the water to flow through its head. I'll replace it soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior","review":"This works but...Using the basic spray pattern, the water shoots down in a straight line instead of fanning out as it does on other shower heads I've used. Not quite comfortable--having all the water striking roughly four square inches of skin.The other spray patterns are pretty much worthless. And water leaks out around the edges of the head. NOT a white tape issue, this is happening around joints created by the manufacturer. I don't like the stiffness of the cord either. It's always getting in the way. Next time I'll go back to Delta."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS ITEM","review":"The spinning face, which selects the mode and sprays water has come loose.

But this is probably easy fix by tightening everything just a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"great hand-held shower","review":"We bought two of these for our showers, replacing one hand-held shower head and one fixed shower head. We've been very happy with them.Pros: Nice look with brushed nickel, great water stream settings. I specifically wanted at least one setting that didn't pulse and that was difficult to find, but this shower head has it. The part that holds the shower head when not in use seems sturdy and unlikely to break (as our old one did), and is stiff enough that we can adjust the position of it to point the shower wherever we want it, allowing us to use it as a fixed shower head as well as a hand-held shower head.Cons: It says it has five settings, but two of the settings seem to be identical, making it really only four settings. Doesn't matter much to us, but a little bit deceiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"What! No Massage?","review":"I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon usually because the customer reviews are right on. I guess I should have read more closely. What a disappointment. I wanted to replace one I had - the \\"Teledyne Original Shower Massage\\". I loved it.

This product is good except the hose is very hard to bend even used for a few weeks. I had to replaced the hose with the old hose I have.

I will never buy this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"water stream too narrow","review":"Nice brushed chrome finish. Water stream is too narrow in comparison to other similarly priced water-pik models.High pressure concentrated stream seems to be missing from this model. I repeatedly have to replace these models (4-6 months on average) as the unit becomes defective in the way of the water stream being directed in an unintended direction and in a diminished fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"The pressure isn't that great and the diameter is small so the water spray isn't that great. Also, the mist setting shoots out over everything, literally sideways (I'd like to know how one would be standing there) and soaks everything. But, for the price, it's adequate."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS! Works GREAT AND Inexpensive!","review":"You cannot go wrong with this unit. It works as described and is SO easy to install. I just followed directions and set up was easy and it works like a charm. It said to hand tighten, so I did and was careful to not over tighten. The key is, it's so easy to install you don't have to give it extra strength in tightening etc. Just follow the directions. I only wish I had purchased and installed this unit sooner!

I can only describe it as reminiscent of some sort of industrial or chemical plant. I shudder to think of what factory this thing came from.Thirty minutes and a mild headache later, I'm heading out to buy a replacement from a local store, and I'm throwing this shower head in the trash.Greatly disappointed in Amazon, and what can only be abhorrent quality control at the presumably Chinese factory from which this came."},{"rating":"2","title":"shower","review":"Pretty basic shower head...processed and shipped right on time.

The product is made of all cheap plastic. The nut which screws onto the pipe is plastic and immediately cracked in half. The hose is also a cheap garden hose type which does not have the weight to hang down. The hose causes the shower head to twist to the side when in the cradle.

Had forgotten that I had returned a similiar waterpik showerhead a few years back for the same problem. Only one of the settings worked--the full shower setting. All the other settings had no force at all--not really usable--would not pulse enough to massage or even wash off soap effectively. And this was with the flow restriction device removed. Also, fairly large and clunky. To late to return, will be giving this piece of bad design to Goodwill. Sealed tough plastic packaging required heavy cutting to open--high self-inflicted cut potential. Would recommend looking for other manufacturers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks no matter what I do","review":"I should have listened to the other reviewers who said it leaks. Ok, I read the instructions BEFORE I installed it. Not much to read... mostly pictures. The instructions say not to use teflon tape... I think. The way the instructions are written it is hard for me to tell if they mean no tape on all showerhead models or only the fixed showerhead models. But, I can't see why that would matter. Either way: 1) I tried it without tape and hand tightened, and it leaked; 2) tried to tighten it with pliers, still leaked (worse); 3) took the vacuum breaker off and it still leaked (in two places now); put the vaccum breaker back on and put tephlon tape on the male threads and hand tightened, it leaked; 4) left tape on and tightened with pliers, you guessed it... it leaked. Should be rated at 3.5 GPM -- 2.5 GPM through the showerhead and 1.0 GPM down the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Massage setting is weak","review":"I had a great showerhead before with an effective massage setting for sore muscles. This one stinks. Wish I could return, but obviously too late now."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy product","review":"The hose still reeks after 6 months. It practically took an act of God to get it to quit leaking during installation. I had to double a gasket by taking one from my old shower head. The spray options were a joke with the mist one spraying sideways. Water pressure was low even after I removed the restrictor. I just replaced it with a new moen and will take the loss of my $$$ rather than deal with this piece of junk any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"breaks when installing","review":"I rarely write reviews here on Amazon because I'm usually satisfied with the products I buy (i.e. I'm not very picky). This is the first time I've utilized Amazon's return policy (very convenient I might add). Anyhow, the first one I received broke while attaching the cheap plastic piece to the faucet. I returned it and promptly received a replacement. This one broke in the exact same way with minimal pressure. I give up on this brand. I'm going to try something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Plastic Parts","review":"While this item is listed as \\"brushed nickel,\\" and the shower head itself looks OK, the arm that holds the unit onto the shower is nothing but cheap, plain dove gray plastic (not even metal-look, just plain PVC). A metal attachment is standard and not only does the plastic look terrible (and is never mentioned, or shown, anywhere in the description), but it also doesn't seem like it would hold up very well either. This one is going back to Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've had several Water Pik hand-held shower heads and been pleased with all of them, but this one was a huge disappointment.

My advice is to stick to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"But exactly what one would expect for the price. I use it outside to wash the dobermans. I think they wanted to attack me for making them feel so 'ghetto'.

Garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly a trickle.","review":"Do not purchase this if you are looking for a hand-held water massage.

I didn't want to invest a lot of money since I live in an apartment and needed something that would install easily. I had the old head off and this installed in 5 minutes.

I don't love it. It has only one setting that I like and use. That's a shame with a total of five possibilities. The one that I choose to use has too high a flow, but still is the only one I like. If my husband had not thrown out the packaging I would have returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally feels like we have pressure","review":"This is our third showerhead attempt. Moved into a house with very low pressure in the shower. Tried two other shower heads and one was okay, but took a long time to rinse hair out. The other one we tried had to be returned immediately, as the water literally only dripped out. This one works great on one of the settings, and so we're very happy with it. The pulse setting and one of the others doesn't really work out due to our pressure, but I understand from other reviews that we could pop something out of the head to allow more water through to make it work better. However, we're happy with the one setting, and do want to conserve water, so we will use it as-is. Some others said the hose was unwieldy, but I thought it was the perfect length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant Drip","review":"Apparently this model has a overflow feature which is suppose to let the water drain momentarily.

The problem is that, even with the water restrictor removed, the water pressure coming out of this thing is pitiful. The holes in the nylon washers through which the water flows are about 1/8\\" inch in diameter.It is like a Seinfeld episode. Do I have to go on the black market to get a shower head with decent pressure?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaked but was able to fix :)","review":"Was a little frustrated at first because no matter what I tried it leaked right where the pipe from the wall and bracket meet. Followed the instructions and didn't use pipe tape. It also says to hand tighten only. A quick call to Waterpik customer service solved the problem. Simply use bar soap and coat the threads of the bracket and pipe. I did use a wrench to gently tighten and no more leaks. :) Also had a little trouble removing the orange water flow restrictor but needle nose pliers solved that problem and I was able to pull it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Flow - Very Disappointing","review":"I recently moved to a new apartment, leaving behind an amazing handheld Waterpik showerhead that had great pressure. I couldn't find the same model (it was an all-white, plastic showerhead), so I bought the TRS 553, which seemed to be the closest match. Even after removal of the watersaving flow regulator, the 553 has an abysmally weak stream. And making matters worse, after 3 weeks of use, it sprang a leak that I couldn't fix even after reapplying pipe thread tape.I thought the pressure problem might just be due to living in a new place with lower pressure, but the bathtub fills very quickly, and the problem was solved when I switched to a different showerhead I found on the internet (although still not as powerful as the old Waterpik).If you're looking for a powerful spray, avoid the TRS 553."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent spray no power on massage!!","review":"I bought this to replace an old 5 mode shower head that had decent but not great massage setting.

It looks good but if you are looking for a massage nozzle don't buy this product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The only good setting on this head forms a too tightly-focused shower. The mist setting is too wide. The flow is slow, even with the regulator removed. The hose is not long enough. I was disappointed that the head does not pivot up and down, only sideways. However, it was very easy to install, not costly and it looks nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent showerhead at a good price","review":"I gave this as a gift. The recipient loved it, once it had been adjusted for maximum force. \\"Best shower in years!\\"The hardest thing about the installation was uninstalling the old showerhead, which was ______.

We have a water well system and it does not provide the high pressure that this device MUST have to function as described. The only setting that worked well was the standard shower function. The hose is beyond cheap in both looks and function! Hard to unravel and has little flexibility.

I am changing over all my fixtures to brushed nickel, and expected that the mounting bracket would have the same finish as the shower head. No so with this model.

In fact the tighter it was, the harder it was to swivel the unit on the ball. Tightened all connections as much as I dared; tried toggling the water saving trickling button.

Inferior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waterpik TRS-553 Does the job but useless flow and miserable plastic cord","review":"Basically all the reviews with a one or two stars for this handheld shower set were correct. Here is the recap:1. Very low pressure/water flow. Not sure what the manufacturer's OptiFlow technology is but definitely it has failed here.2. The cord is a plastic hose that you wouldn't use as your garden hose. That's how bad it is, I ended up buying a SS from HomeDepot and replaced it.3. The different flow options are useless, when using anything but the basic/normal setting you might as well turn off the water.On the other hand:1. The installation was simple.2. No leaks - I made sure I used extra washers and tapes wherever I could after reading the reviews to be preemptive.3. The handheld shower itself is light but solid.

Apparently, some people had good luck with this product; however, it is clear from the rating distribution that many people also had problems with this product. Do not take a risk. Do not buy this product. In addition to the leakage problem, it also has a cheap low-quality feel even by standards of plastic shower heads.

Love the water pressure from it especially since the area where I live it's very low to start with.Added plus, is my four legged kids like having their bath with it too. Rinses them off really fast. Could use a on/off switch for that use, but not complaining since that isn't the true purpose of it. Highly recommend and would purchase again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"First of all, let me state that I dislike low flow shower heads. Living in California makes it difficult to purchase, from a storefront, one that is not. The reason I deducted a star from this unit is that the low flow devise is difficult to remove and the hose could be a foot longer. Once the devise is removed, the flow is substantial and that was my main concern."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 10 months of use, not so great","review":"I've been using Waterpik's for years. My initial impression of this model was that it seemed very light, and therefore of lower quality than other Waterpik's I've owned.After 10 months of use, I'm not happy with how it has held up. The water is emitted from small rubber openings -- some of which have distorted so that water sprays off to the side. On mine, one stream now sprays towards my eyes.

This Waterpik is plastic and broke when we tightened it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great showerhead, could use some improvement though...","review":"Before I begin, I have to say that the showerhead gives great pressure and gives a very strong, even, and wide flow from the head.With that being said... The only way to achieve good flow is by removing BOTH the restriction plug AND the filter. When removing only the restriction plug, the water barely trickles out. This is one reason why it doesn't get the full 5 stars. Without the filter screen, there is a chance stuff will soon plug up the holes in the showerhead.The other 'con' is that the hose that connects the shower head to the pipe is very heavy, not very flexible, and has the tendency to stick up off the wall. It would have been MUCH better if it was made out of flexible steel/aluminum piping or a softer material than rubber.In the end though, the showerhead has a very elegant look, has great flow and very easy to switch settings, and does not have any issues with leaks. For under $25 - you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as old model.","review":"The spray force is too low even with the low flow device removed and the hose is a foot shorter than my old Waterpik which lasted ten years till the hose broke.Not a happy camper with the newer model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really pretty good for the price","review":"The shower head is made of plastic, but what isn't these days.

I purchased it knowing that it didn't have a tuner. I use Comcast HD digital cable with this unit. The HD channels are spectacular. The non-HD channels are so-so. This unit is in my bedroom. I am about 8 feet from the picture. The picture looks fine from that distance. The non-HD channels are grainy up close. The sound isn't great, but adequate for a bedroom/office/kitchen type application. I am using the DVI connection for the video and the RCA type connections for the audio. One reviewer mentioned HDMI. Don't be confused, this unit does not have an HDMI input. It isn't really necessary since DVI looks just as good. HDMI adds surround sound capability but this unit only has two speakers, so it won't make a difference. I recommend this unit if you have a small space to work with. If you have a little more room, I'd go with a slimline CRT as the non-HD pictures are much better. All in all it is a good tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV","review":"This TV is easy to operate and has a great picture. I have not noticed the sound volume being inadequate in our bedroom.

The cigarette smoke was so stale and strong it made me nauseaus. You could even smell stale smoke in the hallway by her door, t was THAT strong of an odor. She was a 3-4 pack a dayer and never opened windows. A few spritzes and the next day when I went back, no smell. The true test was when I had to sell her car. The car smelled awful (smoke again) a few sprays, kept the windows up and smell was GONE. A week later when showing the car, still no smell! Anyone can cover it up with fabreeze or the like, this gets rid of it.

Helped me keep track of my dog's location and her activities even when I couldn't see her.With all of the crops still standing in the field, a Brittany disappears quite quickly in 10 foot corn and sunflower fields. The unit worked well, always giving me a read on her. The only problem I had with the unit was that there is a 5 second delay between information updates, and that interval can be too long when the hunting is going at a fevered pitch. The product seems to be well made and well thought out. It does the job it says it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under appreciated","review":"Despite being inexplicably released direct to video, this is an entertaining and suspenseful film featuring a few big name actors, shot on location in Arizona. See IMDB for a complete synopsis- I was hoping to find a copy on DVD rather than VHS, but that doesn't seem to exist. The film was originally shot for theatrical release, under the working title \\"Rope of Sand\\" on locations in northern Arizona as well as Tucson. If you watch carefully about five minutes in, the detective played by Scott Glenn walks past a tv news crew at the scene of a murder- the bearded fellow in the black jacket next to the tv cameraman is yours truly, and believe me, it was pretty cold in Tucson the night that scene was shot! I never got paid for that extra role, and the film bypassed the theaters, so my 15 minutes of fame (actually, 15 frames) is reduced to a VHS tape. Still, I rather enjoyed the film, and its fun to have a copy to show the grand kids someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't right to be made!!","review":"This movie is not to be seen if you don't have a respectful mind. I,a native that comes from the Dineh(Navajo)Nation do not think this was appropiate to make for money or for any reason at all.

Why not release all of the 1987 performance?? The energy in Hey Pocky Way alone eclipses all of 6/16/90. The bonus material shows the Dead full of energy , playing with zeal and having fun and this is what we love to SEE and seeing how this is a VIEW from the vault you would think that would play into what they choose to release. If you want to see the Grateful Dead as you remember them then this is worth it for the bonus material only .

A must-watch for those who enjoy romantic, good storylines with a hint of action. A classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless classic!","review":"A timeless mix of romance, sentiment and the supernatural that is superbly evoked in all areas. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore are superb in each of their roles. Swayze plays a murdered banker who comes back as a ghost and frantically trys to warn Demi Moore shes in mortal danger via psychic Whoopi Goldberg, who is vastly effective and highly amusing in the role giving this film a great balance of comedy and high drama. The comic moments merley proceeds to lighten the somewhat sombre and potentially maudlin atmosphere of the film whereas the special effects are positivley stunning and the love-beyond-the-grave theme is beautifully and touchingly done. The ending is sure to leave a big lump in your throat! Fantastically well written, Ghost emerges as one of the greatest films of the 1990's and makes compelling and essential viewing. A masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great love story","review":"This is one of my favorite movies.

The DVD arrived well packed in good shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ohhhhhh Mah Luve, Mah Darleeng ......","review":"When I first saw the trailers for Ghost, it was marketed like a thriller, but the surprise cam when I realized that it is poignant story filled with relationships that developed between the characters. There is the romantic love between Sam and Molly, the betrayal of Sam by Carl, the friendship between Oda Mae and Sam. Sam was the central point that glued all the characters together. He helped Oda Mae realize the importance of her gift and her heritage from her mother. Sam continued to protect Molly and helped her to move on by telling her that even if he is gone, their love continues because it is with him. Carl gets his just desserts by sinking into the darkness. I definitely did not remember this movie as having too much publicity, but through word-of-mouth it became a blockbuster and definitely rekindled the careers of the Righteous Brothers with the classic \\"Unchained Melody\\", which my parent taught me is not to be called the theme from \\"Ghost\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"Patrick Swayze is convincing, even if a little too brash, but watch this film for Demi Moore, who is absolutely delicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, ok blu-ray","review":"The movie itself is a favorite so I was looking forward to getting it in blu-ray. The video is a step up from the sd dvd but definitely not one of the better blu-ray transfers for a catalog title. There is some grain in the picture and at times the picture is a little soft but overall better than the sd. The CGI effects however are hurt by HD and don't look as seamless as in the sd dvd. The audio is TrueHD. It is clear and crisp but since this movie is mostly about dialogue the lossless codec doesn't add a lot. Surrounds are easily heard during the action sequences. Overall if you don't have this in sd in your collection I would get it over the sd. If you have it in sd you might want to rent it in blu-ray before deciding to purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Ray is good...........but not great.","review":"This classic stands up well. There are some nice additions to this BR-Disc such as interviews from the time the movie was made which are a little haunting when Patrick Swayze appears for his insight. So, the special features are enough to lure you in more about this movie and it 's background.The Blue Ray transfer either could have been better or it was as good as it was going to get. The clarity is soft (but improved from the DVD version)and blacks are okay. The color match up well but are not instant by first notice. The audio is decent as well. So, if you are interested for Blue Ray reasons? It is a nice investment to your collection ongoing or just starting out.But, I strongly suggest to first check out either [...] or Blue Ray Digest for a more well thought out review of this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demi Moore!","review":"Now I remember why I always loved Demi Moore!

I have tried many times to enjoy this disc but the surf sounds (which begin even before the first hoot from a whale) ruin it.

I can hear mistakes in the repetition of the whale sounds and the whale sounds do not sound natural in rhythm. They seem to continue too frequently within a repeated loop. Also, there are some parts where a sound was started and then quickly stopped, then started again. With earphones on I am sensitive to these kinds of sounds and hear the mistakes. In addition, the surf is quite loud. That is fine, except that my mind is on the surf at that moment and then I hear deep water sounds of whales which take me to the deep sea. Am I on the beach or listening to whales in the sea? For listeners who are especially critical, and want to hear convincingly natural sounds don't bother buying this cd.

It is short (140 pages of large print). It lacks detail. It is simply a rehashing of some basic facts of the War in South Carolina. It appears more like a college term paper written by someone who read \\"The Road to Guilford Courthouse\\" than a well researched book from a College Professor. I read \\"The Road to Guilford Courthouse\\" only a few weeks before reading \\"Partisans and Redcoats\\". Believe me, \\"The Road\\" is much, much better (only lacks maps..but otherwise very good).

A fast read, as much as it seems to have been written: in a hurry (it ends quite abruptly too). The social environment is well described, from the personal accounts of many protagonists on both sides, to the battles and skirmishes that took place along the broad map of South Carolina. It was as crude as all civil wars: Fathers against sons in some cases. A very visual account, and fast paced.If only it were a little more organized, geographical and chronological-wise. The action takes place as soon in the piedmont as in the low-country, and we move from one family or protagonist to another at lightening speed. Easy to get a little confused. But it does convey the general picture well. Yes, you can get the general idea of what the Revolution meant for South Carolina in this little book. What a tough people the Scots-Irish are. God bless them and the South."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read, if brief","review":"I found this book to be both enjoyable and informative, however it was also brief and at times confusing.This book covers the battles between the backcountry forces and the British and allies from the fall of Charlestown until the battle of cowpens.I would recomend this, however it seems both a bit short and the authors writing style confused me about the timeline a bit, however the timeline in the back and the maps of the battles made it all make sense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forts of the West","review":"Arrived in good condition.

As noted in the Amazon review, the cinematography is enthralling, which just adds to the over-all feel of the western period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing quasi-historical Western from Hallmark","review":"The Johnson County War is a great subject for an authentic Western, and Hallmark's track record (plus Larry McMurtry's pen) would seem to bode well for this production. Unfortunately it's not very good, despite magnificent scenery and adequate performances by Tom Berenger & Michelle Forbes. Rachel Ward steals her few brief scenes, but Burt Reynolds's acting is almost as garish as his face lift. If 60 of its 180 tiresome, cliche-ridden minutes were cut, it might make an above-average made-for-TV movie, but even that drastic snooze-factor reduction would fail to rescue it from mediocrity among theatrical releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cowboy at Heart","review":"I was disappointed with this movie. I loved Tom Berenger in Last of the Dogmen, which although a bit soapy was fun to watch. This movie, because of the script, dress and acting left me cringing. At the same time I also watched Toshiro Mifume in several samurai movies. The old black and white movies enveloped me because of the acting and authenticity of the experience. Johnson County War seems to have been made by people that do not really understand the classic western. This could have been much better than it actually is.Johnson County War"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just about worthless","review":"Larry McMurtry should be lynched for writing this non-event. On and on it goes, interminably. It could have been 90 minutes long, and actually been worth watching. But because the network had to have as many commercial breaks as possible, they crammed a 90 minute story into 180 minutes. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terrible, not great","review":"This is a very uneven movie, especially from an acting standpoint. Tom Berenger and Luke Perry have moments in which they seem to be asleep while acting, but then are just fine at other points. Burt Reynolds is woefully miscast. Adam Storke and Michelle Forbes are fine throughout, though. As for the story, it is a mishmash of just about every Western cliche you can think of, none of which pay off very well, as the movie comes to a flat conclusion. Still, there are occasional flashes of inspiration, so if you're a die-hard fan of either Westerns or writer Larry McMurtry (who adapted the screenplay), then this might be worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"JOHNSON COUNTY WASTE","review":"DO THE WORDS 'HOSS APPLES' MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE.

However, the movie itself is a very poor adaptation of the novel, both on a technical and conceptual level. I'm sure Macdonald didn't envision his characters breaking into song and dance in the middle. And the beautiful atmosphere created by the book's illustrations is nowhere to be found in this movie.And for an interesting anecdote: the book is worth seeing/reading simply because it is, reputably, one of Tolkien's favorite childhood books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy!","review":"I ordered this great package.

Plus, the same shots are shown over and over (deer, ducks, etc.). All that being said, if you want a video about Ashland this is the one to get since I don't think there are any others.

The package certainly leads you to believe you can do this. The manual and tutorial are also weak. After spending about 6 hours trying to design my deck using the 2D plan format, I found the software doesn't even give you an estimate of materials or building details. It does open up to a spreadsheet telling you how many posts you'll need, but that's it. This product was a waste of money.I sure miss the \\"Books that Work\\" series on \\"How to Design & Build Your Deck.\\" It was limited in designs you could build, but it was focused on deck building and included how-to pictures and would provide a detailed plan with a complete bill of materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"i purchaed this program to design my deck.All it does is create a picture.I used to have a program that designed a deck and also gave me a break down of materials to build it and accurate dimensions in which to cut my lumber and also a walk through the construction.This program [punch]does nothing like that at all.If anyone wants to build a deck using this program they are wating there money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I recommend a pencil instead","review":"Home design software should have both flash and substance.

You can put together a nice cartoon of your vision but you can forget about getting any useful blueprints or material lists or even getting the precise design you want. I was looking for a product that could produce the drawings I need to get the go-ahead for my deck from the building commission. Instead I was able only to get a rough layout of my deck. I say rough because Punch restricts you to a handful of basic designs and shapes. The most unfortunate fact is that all of PUNCH's competitors seem to have fallen away so it's either PUNCH or a pencil. I recommend the pencil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I just bought Punch deck design. You would expect that it would be taylored to designing decks. Guess again. It is nothing more than a simple cad program with a few deck related overlays. You must build multiple decks to create a single mult-tiered deck.

But there is a lot more to the music from this biggest of countries. Classical music flowered in Russia during the Romance period, and some of the most beautiful and evocative music to come from Eastern Europe and Central Asia appeared at this time. This CD provides a great compilation of many of these works. They include works from Borodin, Gliere, Mussorgsky, and Ippolitov - Ivanov. None of the famous pieces are included, instead we have a lot of less well-known, but still beautiful works of classical music. They include ethnic pieces such as Polovstian Dances, patriotic pieces such as the Slavic March, and ballet pieces such as the Red Poppy Ballet.

Fred was just playing for a few friends before everyone was ushered out into the cold. And that's probably the best way to describe \\"Intentions...\\" It's Fred playing personal, direct and honest and real, a memoir and a testament about growing up, waking up, and just starting to attach a larger meaning to the everyday moments of life. I think the thing I like best about this album is the way it chronicles a specific place and time in wonderfully evocative, concrete detail, but also manages to end up being about the far larger process of growing up in an America where things don't always turn out as expected, but where faith and hope and love can still make a difference.

For anyone interested in gender studies, women's studies, or just 50's/60's culture, this book is just great. I had read Peril's column in Bitch magazine and decided to get her book. (the column is similar to this book) I couldn't believe all of the amazing and frightening tidbits of female life in the 50s... like Lysol being sold as a douching product?? And even more disturbing was the death toll from using Lysol in such a capacity. More upsetting still was the company's reaction to these women's deaths - the women had failed to properly dilute the product and, therfore, caused their own deaths. Most of the book is not so disturbing. In fact, most of it is really charming. The kind of stuff that makes you look at bullet bras, cardigans, saddle shoes, and other icons of 50s femininity and think \\"wow, I've got it pretty good.\\" A great read if not for academic purposes then for simple head-shaking humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice gift","review":"made a nice birthday present. hubby really liked it :) it was on sale so that was nice :) :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for art, much less so for theology","review":"I did a double-take when this author attempted to explain details of Roman Catholicism as a key to grasping Bosch's paintings.\\"The ceremony takes place at an altar that contains precious relics, which are real pieces either of the body of Christ or of a saint, or of something they have touched.\\"Ok, that's not Christian theology at all. Simply put, it is blasphemy. No editor caught this one?Luckily, the author seems to be much better at writing about art than theology. However, as I am a neophyte about art (hence, my reading of this book) it makes me much less sure of the accuracy of the author's views after seeing such a huge blooper about something that even the most basic Christian knows.I am enjoying the art info enough to give it this four star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine product except cats not really interested in chewing them","review":"I bought these for our cats as they are ~10 yrs old and I was hoping this would help them clean their teeth.

I was seeing actors in scenes that weren't there before! It looked absolutely beautiful, it was breathtaking. It sounds great, looks great, and IS just spectacular still 24 years later. My only problem with this release is a few special features. We get a featurette with most of the actors talking about the film and a trailer but that's about it. I was hoping for some deleted scenes or outtakes and a commentary. I did love the booklet with all the song lyrics, that was so cool. Overall I am happy with this dvd mainly because it was so long in the waiting and it just looks so well done and everytime I view I remember why it such an important piece of the 1970s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Movie - DVD ...","review":"Paramount made us wait for this gem of a movie, boy did they make us wait. Let me first start out by saying how much I love this all time classic, absolutely no dispute about that. But I'm afraid the DVD is an almost unbelievably poor transfer - from virtually the first second you will notice huge levels of grain on the picture. For me it's just too distracting and made me eject the disc within the first five minutes. The 5.1 soundtrack, what I heard of it, was OK - but again it didn't have the punch I was expecting.

Some of the music really is intellegently written, and the singing isn't too bad either, the I just have to say, that it does not deliver anymore. I would like to say I am a big fan, as I was ten years ago, but watching it recently, I realized that this movie was utter crap, and I cringe at it.

I must say that it's nothing, except the story of two teenagers, whose life stories their senior high school are told through rock 'n' roll music. Actors are mediocre, John Travolta stunk.

Some of the songs are catchy (Summer Nights, and Grease Lightning) but the movie is badly directed and the song and dance numbers are really bush league!

But the dialog track is astonishingly muddy. There is a noticeable difference between the audio quality of the dialog and that of the musical numbers.

Olivia Newton John as the preppy that develops an interest in that bad boy and metamorphs herself. Stockard Channing as a bad girl leading a pink lady gang that looks for trouble and stirs the pot.

And the DVD it's a great option to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best musical of all time.","review":"This is definately my favorite of all the musical and dance movies ever. Grease can be summed up into one word: Awesome. The music is electric, fast paced, and exciting. The plot is funny and charming. The cinamatography and the nostalgia factor is also good. The movie is hands down perfect. Danny and Sandy are icons in the movie world. They are the ultimate teen couple. The film is definately one of the greatest films of the nineteen seventies. This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again. See it at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about a goody girl and a cool boy who fall in love.","review":"This movie is very capturing and interesting.

Grease is about two highschool sweethearts who madley fall in love over summer vacation and then they meet at school. Those two are Sandy and Danny. Kind of rimes doesn't it. Anyways they fall in love but then they start to split up as the year goes by. Danny is the most popular guy in his senior grade while Sandy a brand new school for her is nerve wrecking. She hangs out with the pink ladies who date the most popular guys in school. Sandy is totally oppossite of the pink ladies because she is really charming and sweet but then in the end she changes her looks and her adittude to get Danny back. With Sandy and Danny hitting the Dance floor with lots of music you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the One That I Want","review":"John Travolta and Olivia Newton John share amazing on screen chemistry in this comedy/drama about two teenagers falling in love one summer night. Travolta's struggle to overcome his ego and to impress his friends becomes less and less important as he begins to realize that Newton-John is the One That He Wants! It is a classic love story meets ruthless comedy. The music is fantastic. Grease shall go down in history as one of the greatest musicals of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Tell You More!","review":"A hit! What else can I say? This movie is a great view of teenage lives in the late 1950's, early 1960's. Though the actors are a bit old to play high school kids, they can do it very well. The music is so original and awesome, and the non-stop comedy is great! To enjoy Grease the best, I recommend buying the 20th Aniversary Edition, and if you can't, that's ok, you'll like it just as much. I have never seen the Broadway version or any play version, but this version is really great! Watch it right away. I would compare this movie to \\"Hairspray\\", another must-see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This dvd is \\"NOT THE WORD\\"","review":"I wanted to preview this dvd before I bought it and thank goodness I did. The big dissappointment was lack of extras. Has hollywood gone very greedy. I say yes. The only extras are interviews. BIG DEAL. What about commentaries, Making of,maybe bloopers. I thought because it took such a long time for this to be released, the studio would have been working on a nice package with plenty of extras. Not so here. Hollywood is just so greedy I'm sure they might wait til they get suckers to buy this and then they will come out with a big package.Another big problem ,in some scenes the ads in the background are unable to read. The picture and sound are not up to DVD quality also. Thank god I didn't have to pay to preview it either. My advice is keep your VHS version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia rules","review":"Grease is a fun-filled movie taking the viewer back to a time when America and American culture were changing from a poverty-stricken era to a time of care-free living.

But I never realized until a short while ago when I watched it again. The music rocks. If this was the only soundtrack I had, I'd die happy. Actually, I'd probably die singing \\"you better shape up, cause I need a man....\\". I forget what it's called.

I guess the courts don't think she's so great. And well... this movie is what the title says it is- total trash. The Grease reunion was a bunch of old worn out people trying to act young again- it was really pathetic. I hope kids these days have something more to aspire to than the idiots in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"One for the choice of title","review":"This movie could only have been produced in America: musical, bulky cars, greaseballs and bleached-out white rock 'n' roll. I don't like musicals and my review will be colored accordingly. This movie is as light as that sugar fluff that they eat at the \\"Carnival\\" at the end. Not one second could I connect with anything that was going on. Was this a highschool or an elementary school? Surely this must be a fantasy about what the 50s were like. With a little more biting spunk this could have been a great Monty Python parody, but to me it's just a movie to quickly digest and forget all about it. I guess as a musical it has value and energy, but for the rest it had all the ingredients of those nauseating American highschool movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already have it!!!...","review":"I already purchased a grease movie and it has already been shipped to me.

One other note; for some reason in all of the shots that were in the soda shop they having digitally blurred out the Coca-Cola logo in signs and menu boards. This is distracting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Hearted Fun","review":"Whereas this movie is not overly deep, it does deal with the fun times of high school. Friendships and relationships are portrayed in a amusing manner. John Travolta and Olivia Newton John fit their parts like a hand in a glove. Thesongs seem to blend in nicely from scene to scene and the special effects of the day work real fine. Especially like Frankie Avalon's moment in the spotlight. The time period is a bit helter skelter it seems like the movie jumps from the beginning of the school year to the end in almost a heartbeat. But that is not enough to flatten this effort. It has a wide appeal so most audiences will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paramount deserves to burn...","review":"Nothing about the movie, just the DVD. And not even this DVD. More the fact that I know that next year, Paramount has another DVD of Grease coming out. No word on what's on it, but undoubtedly it will be better than this DVD. That annoys me...I know you want to make money. But...any fan of this movie, I'm sure, will tell you, that no matter how much they want the movie on DVD, they would rather stick to their well-worn VHS copies for another year and get the real deal the first time around than get the movie bare-bones and cough up the dough for it only to find out later that there's a better disc, maybe even a better set of discs in store.This is only made worse by the fact that most Paramount DVDs contain a trailer and nothing else in the way of features -- their most packed DVD is the original Tomb Raider.

I suppose they look at it like I looked at Frankie Avalon and Annette movies - but I think it's a cute and fun show."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teen's Review","review":"Grease is without a doubt the best movie in the world. Perhaps my crush on John Travoltra rates it higher in my opinion, but I am postive that everybody who has seen it agrees with it's perfect cast and enjoyful songs and lyrics. I believe that this movie earns more than just 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Movie, Great Quality","review":"Just watched this through the Xbox 360, rented the HD version. Quality was quite good, audio and video crisp and clear. The only issue I had was that the website claimed this was a 5.1 transfer of the original, but the subwoofer never kicked on from my reciever (set up in \\"straight\\" mode, which depicts exactly what the movie portrays with no processing by the receiver). Not really a problem for Grease, as it was never meant to be heard with a subwoofer.Gave it 4 stars simply for the price of the rental... A little steep for the HD version.

Indeed \\"Grease\\" was part of the 1950s nostalgia phenomenon of the 1970s along with \\"Happy Days\\" and \\"American Graffiti\\" that continued with films such as \\"Back to the Future\\" and \\"Stand By Me\\" in the 1980s. America was harking back to a kinder, simpler, innocent era post-Vietnam, Civil Rights, and Watergate.\\"Grease\\" still holds up as decent entertainment today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Musical of All Time!","review":"I went to watch this movie in 1998 when I was 11 when it came out in theatres to celebrate it's 20 year anniversary (I believe.. was it 25th?). Now, more than five years later, I still haven't forgotten how captivated I was watching that film on the big screen.Since then, I have purchased the film, but I still find it hard to believe that it's an \\"old\\" film. The plot is simple, but the music makes it work. The script (the acting seems fine to me, although others have commented it as being mediocre) is flawless; every character's own personal story and turmoil is written perfectly into the big picture.All the songs are great. I love the songs sung by the main cast (ex. Greased Lightning, Sandy...). The soundtrack is a great one, too. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves a good flick. Even if you don't like musicals (and I don't), you'll fall in love with this movie time and time again. It just doesn't get old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is great, DVD really stinks","review":"I've been waiting years for this DVD, so I bought it the first day of release. The wrapper promised high quality Digital Remastered image. What went wrong? They apparently didn't think to clean the film of dust (there are some real whoppers that flash by), and spots reveal that the lenses were dirty as well. I've got DVDs of 1930's movies that look better than this. Shame on Paramount! Rent this before you buy, check it out, and see if you really want to reward them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, Directionless Jazz","review":"I hoped this would be a challenging, exciting album, especially with the line-up (Konitz, DeJohnette, Holland, etc). As it turns out, Satori is just a boring exercise in shapelessness. The standards here are supposed to be played conceptually, but the group plays like it had no idea what it was going to do prior to beginning. Any interesting musical ideas that pop up on the album are abandoned almost immediately in favor of wanking. Particularly atrocious is Marital Solal's gross overplaying and lack of ability to listen to the other musicians. Further weakening the album is the poor sound quality, typical of 70's jazz. Holland's bass and DeJohnette's drums sound thin and empty. This one belongs in the bargain bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot's of misunderstandings in this text","review":"While the topic for this book is very hot, there are several severe inaccuracies in the use and application of JDeveloper.There is also way too much theory, and while theory is fun for graduate students, the body of the text is wanting for real-world examples.Overall, I am sorry I bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"The flow of topics is not so good.

I read other reviews and saw pictures on their site of cases where eye envy worked well, so I thought I would give it a try. I followed the directions and applied the product to my pets' eyes 1-2 times per day for three months. I didn't notice any changes at all and was very disappointed in the price I paid when I observed no results. I think temporary result can be noticed when the stains are covered with a flaky white powder (only a cover up). I would not recommend wasting your time or money with this product.

Bingo is still entertaining but Soul has more 'soul'. It's also a very dark look at a time when men were judged by how they would behave in society and the irony hits you in the face. Today we have so much outlaw actiions taking place and people look the other way on black player's behavior. One such player during those cruel times judged by his character was Josh Gibson, who in any league would have been a bonafide slugger, hitter and catcher. That they choose Jack Robinson on how he would behave doesn't set the record straight. Soul lays it down by also showing two black men and their professional respect for each other.

When the main character (Garner) is being \\"wrapped\\" by Dane, I felt like it was happening to me. The relationship with Garner and father was excellent, though unresolved as many relationships are...particularly with parents. I am looking forward to reading other Waterhouse mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed heroine tangles with a serial killer","review":"As Waterhouse's story opens, narrator Garner Quinn, a forceful, driven and highly successful writer of true-crime books, is convinced of the innocence of a young farmboy accused of being a serial killer known as Holy Ghost. She champions his cause and works tirelessly to free him.Once the young man is acquitted, Quinn, despite her promise to spend time with her teenage daughter, is immediately caught up in her next case. How can she help it when it concerns body parts found in the sculptures of Dane Blackmoor, a romantic enigma Quinn once cast as her father in lonely childhood fantasies? Is Blackmoor a killer? Is Quinn being stalked by the real Holy Ghost?Although the plot takes several meandering turns, Waterhouse's writing is punchy and vivid, her flawed heroine skillfully depicted, and the ending pulls out all the stops, involving the forces of nature as well as the diabolical workings of a sadistic killer's mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately unsatisfying","review":"While the plot is full of twists and turns, the characters never emerge beyond the two-dimesional. The author sets up complex relationships between the heroine and her father and daughter, but never develops them at all. The plot has large holes in it; the heroines actions are often inexplicable except in terms of advancing the plot. For example, a policeman comes to her door after her house has been ransacked and her daughter is missing, yet she fails to enlist his help, so that she can be alone when the killer attacks...So many threads of plot are left hanging that the story seems abandoned rather than concluded. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful writing -- one too many plots.","review":"I really enjoyed the sophisticated pen and hope to see more. Wonderful development -- of each story. Waterhouse created Garner Quinn, a character to whom anyone with an ounce of critical marrow could relate. Garner Quinn could easily live on in subsequent stories -- which could be the flaw with this one.Waterhouse, in her enthusiasm to create a brilliant mystery, actually created two. If it had worked, the brilliance would have been in the glue that held them together. Instead, without any connection whatsoever, other than Quinn's frantic pace of overlapping one crime with another, all that is left is a quick summary, short explanation of why any of it happened at all.I think that with more indepth development of a single plot, further development of her household relationships and the true brilliance of her penmanship, Waterhouse will become one of the best in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, read something better.","review":"Believe it or not, the \\"statue mystery\\" is nevercompletely resolved. The climax of the novel concerns a completely different thread. Despite being portrayed as a strong independent character, the heroine is really a passive victum throughout the text. My guess is that the author had outlines for two different mysteries and threw them together to meet a publishing deadline. Alsoas a Jersey Shore native, I'd like to remind Ms. Waterhouse that there are no beach-front homes inSpring Lake."},{"rating":"1","title":"did I get a bad copy?","review":"I thought, I bought a real new CD of VDGG \\"World Record\\", but the jewel case was of such a bad quality that I think I got a good copy of the original CD. The CD it self has a small hole in the silver coating, wich just did not disturb the music. Somehow a CD you would expect from China, not from a country like the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful grooves, but rather dark","review":"Such a shame this was the last real VDGG-record. On this record, the band is at its most interesting. Without the pretention of 'Pawn Hearts' and musically stronger than 'Still Life', this record should be everyone's first step into the spooky world of Peter Hammill. More electric guitar than ever and that seems a good thing. Hammill is certainly not a virtuozo on his six-string but the emotional force of his playing is overwhelming. The rest of the band takes you on tight sax-organ groove. The production is rather minimalistic, not too much sonic effects and that only makes the record stronger: your attention stays focussed in the music. Meurglys III seems to be too long but that's not true: not a single second is wasted. It's twenty minutes of loneliness, anger and desperation. And it works. It does not drag, unlike the earlier, pretentious stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so VDGG....but I like it","review":"This is the only Vandergraafgenerator record I've ever owned. OK, I had some Peter Hammill stuff, and some other records on tape. But World Record was my first VDGG-experience.I understand, that it is not VDGG at their best, because it was a bit too much VDGG-light, and then it occurred to me...I guess I don't like VDGG, but hey, I like this album, including the reggae-like ending of Meurglys.Actually, thirty years ago I have used it as background music for a slide show.So, if you like Peter Hammill or VDGG, but not the very avantgarde, complex stuff....you could try this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly awful covers of songs that deserve better","review":"I'll admit it: this is the only album by The Bobs I own. And given the way I feel about this one, I'll never buy another. I love acapella music in general - it's just this album that I don't like.A few of the tracks have caught me the right way, particularly Disco Inferno, which I enjoy quite a bit. On the other hand, I dislike The Wind Cries Mary, Lonely at the Top, Particle Man, and Searchin' enough that I can't even stand to finish listening to them when. Particle Man's slow tempo and the Popeye-styled brass sections make it particularly painful.I'm no purist - changing up a cover can be a great thing. I just feel that The Bobs made mostly wrong changes in this album.

The first one was for my grandson who is 20 and I paid over $200 for it. It played for about 5 months. Fortunately I had purchased an extended warrenty for it. The second was the Zen V 4 GB and that was for my 14 year old granddaughter. That one played less than 2 months and cost about $140. I would think that, since they cost quite a bit, they would be made to withstand the wear and tear that young adults give them. Manufacturers certainly must know that they will be used practically 24/7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Things Come in Small Packages","review":"The Creative Zen V was recommended by a friend. When I opened the box< I was a little surprised by the size. Its very small. BUT it performs very big.

Do buy the extra power supply to charge the unit without having to plug into the USB port on the computer.I have yet to use the recording features of this unit, but plan on doing so at some point.

It sounds fantastic, the earphones are pretty good, so is the radio. Video player though is useless. It is promised to have 15 hour battery life?!

Then they tell me I'm responsible for all the shipping and a $25.00 diagnostic test (Now isn't this part of the \\"labor\\" warranty that's good for a year?) not according to them. So, just to get it to them it would cost me shipping and the $25.00 up front for the work \\"(oh, diagnostic test)\\" plus all the parts if they can fix it.

I've had good luck with my Zen Sleek Photo, so the the Zen V looked like a good bet.The first Zen V we ordered had a defective navigation joystick. It wouldn't scroll up or down, even after upgrading the firmware and resetting the player. Creative tech support said we should return it, so we exchanged it for a second one. The second one had the same problem, so we gave up on the Zen V and will pick out another player as soon as we decide on one.I'm hoping we just had unusually bad luck to get two defective players in a row, but it's left me wondering about Creative's quality control.

It freezes up often and when it does you have to wait for the battery to completely die before you can charge it up and turn it on. all the features on it are great but if you can't turn it on what does it matter? Just check the creative web site, you'll see, i have never seen such an eloborate \\"trouble shooting\\" page. It seems these players in general have so many problems they have devoted pages and pages on helping you fix your mp3 player. my unit is only 6 months old and is currently out of order.

I think I was sadder to lose the peeler than the boyfriend, to be honest.Anyhoo, I replaced it with what I thought would be the best-ever vegetable peeler: the OXO swivel.The serrated blade on this peeler makes it the most annoying kitchen implement I own. I am constantly picking peel out of the blade as it gets stuck in the teeth. The handle feels ok to hold onto I guess, but its poor performance negates any user-comfort. I absolutely have to get something else - every time I go to make a dish that requires peeled veggies I audibly sigh at the thought of breaking out the OXO.I recommend a peeler with a smooth blade. Like my Pampered Chef peeler. <sob> wherever that dumb boyfriend is now i hope he is enjoying THE BEST PEELER I EVER OWNED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!","review":"I bought this product due to the good reviews on this site.

The handle is sturdy and feels good in the hand. The \\"grips\\" help avoid slippage with your wet, kitchen hands. Swivel action helps when peeling uneven surfaces (think potatoes). The guard over the top of the blade aids in gripping and safety.The peeler I had before this was some cheap little thing I got at the grocery store. It's definitely worth a few extra bucks to get a real peeler. Especially if you love sweet potato mash as much as I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NONE BETTER","review":"I bought these for myself a year ago, and was amazed at how easy they were to use.

I have had a number of vegetable peelers in my time but really this one is in a class of its own. It glides over potatos and carrots with very little effort and the peels are not too thick. The last one I had peeled such thick slices that I barely had any carrot left by the time I got through peeling. This item works well, and it looks nice too. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"functionally perfect","review":"I ave been using these peelers for about 10 years now, they last about 4 years and work better then most.

I prefer the other style for ease of use. There's nothing wrong with this version; but the other style of peeler, also from OXO, (but not a swivel peeler) is slightly better in that it's easier to contol when using it, in my opinion. I LOVE working with the \\"Good Grips\\" line of products because they're so comfortable to hold and use. I have most of their products in my kitchen and I have recommended them to many friends who also have become die hard fans. That's the reason I gave the OXO \\"Good Grips\\" Swivel Peeler a 4-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution! Not safe to use!","review":"First of all, let me say that this peeler is comfortable to grip, and is very sharp! It has no trouble peeling potatoes. However, due to the wide gap between the blade and the handle, combined with the extreme sharpness of the blade, it's very easy to slip and injure oneself. Every other potato peeler I have ever owned was only capable of peeling fruit or vegetables. You would not be able to damage human skin even with effort. However, there is no safety built into this peeler. Today I slipped and took off part of a fingernail, including some skin! I was not using much pressure, as it doesn't take much pressure to remove the potato peel using this peeler! With a sharp knife, using less pressure generally means that there is *less* danger of cutting oneself, but I have to be very, very careful with this peeler. Will be looking for another one that is designed with safety in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"Best peeler ever! Easy to hold, super sharp blade, just slides across the potato!

While I like the Oxo line in general, this peeler is maddening. The grip is fine, but the blade is just a little too short for peeling large potatoes or other vegetables. To make things worse, the plastic piece at the end (designed to better stabilize the peeler, I suppose) gets caught up on the vegetable you're trying to peel. So, you can either peel really slow, or gouge your veggies to death.In short, I can peel faster with a paring knife than I can with this tool. Keep looking, this one's not worth the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"suited to carrots but worthless for potatoes","review":"As with all OXO Good Grips products, the handle on this peeler is great. The blade, however, is less than 2 inches long, making it very difficult to peel rounded items like potatoes, though it does work well on long thin produce such as carrots or cucumbers. Another problem is that the tip of the peeler is rounded and has a rubber coating, rather than the pointed corer found on most peelers. In short, this peeler is a nonstarter if you are looking to peel potatoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!","review":"I tried this in a kitchen store, bought it immediately and upon arriving home, I threw away the 4-5 other kind littering my drawer.

Some may argue that this peeler DOES have a \\"pitter\\" at the tip, but honestly that plastic scoop-shape tip doesn't do much)- price (it should be cheaper given the lack of a pitter)Recommendation:- buy a different peeler; one with the same type of handle, but an additional \\"pitter\\" (a good one) at the tip"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible blade, Nice handle","review":"I am so disappointed in these. The handle is awesome, and I was excited to have a comfy grip when I peel carrots, potatoes, squash, etc.Total failure. Just plain doesn't work. I first tried a butternut squash and thought maybe it was just a super tough skin. Nope, my 99 cent peeler worked great. The blade extension for gauging potato blemishes gets in the way on large flat sections of the squash as well.So I tried fresh carrots with the OXO. Nada, the blade dug in at an awkward angle.I've talked to a couple chefs and a culinary school teacher, and they all agreed - \\"Stay away.\\" They just don't use them.I recently talked to my bartender too, and he said in 15 years he has never seen one in a professional kitchen.Now the OXO sits, rusting, in my junk draw with spare potato masher and bad chopstick collection.\\"Form follows function\\".

Whoever it was that came up with the bright idea to graft a swiveling cutting blade onto a veggie peeler musta been some kinda sadist! Or he might've been the same guy who invented the pivoting-head shaver, and thought he could apply it to other household gadgets with a similar degree of success. In any case, I've no clue why this so-called \\"innovation\\" is considered a convenience. The moving cutter tends to slip quite a bit, causing uneven peeling and skipping on whatever I'm skinnin' for dinner (usually a spud or a cuke). It takes me twice as long to peel something with this implement that would've been done a lot faster and with much better results had I simply used a fixed-blade implement.

I have other Oxo products and though most I got awhile ago, they work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"Like many of the \\"Good Grips\\" products, it's really astounding how much better this peeler is than \\"traditional\\" peelers (you know, the all-metal, slightly rusty thing that had been in your utensil drawer since you bought at at the supermarket when you were stocking the kitchen for your first apartment). This inexpensive gadget produces much better results, much faster and more comfortably, than any other peeler I've ever used. It works equally well on potatos, carrots, apples, etc. It's cheap ($5-$6 for an essential kitchen tool you'll own for years) and works great; why in the world wouldn't you buy it? If you cook and you don't own one, stop reading and buy one now. It's a no-brainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grip but will rust","review":"I've had my Peeler for over a year. Almost as if a switch had been thrown, it has become almost completely rust-covered over the past few weeks, after no rust whatsoever since its purchase. Even the handle, which is difficult to clean, is now embedded with rust. I'd would follow the Amazon buying guide and just get a cheap peeler that you'd can 'refresh' from time to time."},{"rating":"1","title":"cutting area too small","review":"I just purchased this one, and after 1st use, cut my finger. \\"Why?\\" might you ask, because the area is too small that you peel with. It is inset between the parts that hold the blade. This MIGHT be good for carrots, but if you have a large potato or one with a flat side, it is very ineffective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I bought this book on a whim because I was interested in Spanish cuisine. I didn't know anything about it but figured with over 300 recipes I could find something I liked. Every recipe I have made has been fantastic. I found the dishes very easy to make even if they involved a lot of steps. Instructions were very clear and easy to follow. The smoked almonds I had actually made before with a different recipe and had so so results. The recipe in this book was much more clear. We bought an ice cream maker to make the best ice cream ever(honey cinnamon!). My parents also have the book and after eating the ice cream they bought an ice cream maker! I like that it combines traditional and modern cuisine. A must for the serious cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to Spanish cooking","review":"As I have recently become a little obsessed with Spanish food, I decided I needed a decent cookbook. I certainly picked the right one. First, the recipes in this book range from very high brow main courses to simple, easy, delicious tapas. I am starting small and working my way up. Second, the author does an amazing job of explaining Spanish cooking: product definitions, descriptions of the regions and their cuisines, suggestions on cookware selection, etc. I have literally sat for hours reading and looking at the pictures. It was a great purchase and I know I will get a lot of use out of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Enchanting 100 Years Later","review":"Four English children discover the magic of a ring, a castle, true love, and many adventures. How amazing that over 100 years later this story still enchants children and adults alike. The mix of magic with everyday life is brilliant! My children and I enjoyed reading this story that inspired other fabulous authors like C.S. Lewis. We're grateful for Nesbit's creativity that not only kept us spellbound, but also opened the way for many of the modern fantasy books that we love."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book that launched a thousand fantasies","review":"This book launched a whole subgenre--fantasy books in which a group of three to five children (usually mixed gender) cross the boundry between the everyday world into the world of fantasy. It is the inspiration behind CS Lewis's Narnia books, Edward Eager's books, and generations of more recent novels. And it happens to be a wonderful read!

The punctuation and type-setting is a complete mess. Many punctuation marks are missing, while others are in the wrong place.

Card's view of the world is right on. Awesome novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Particularly Original or Exciting","review":"With Mr. Card, you either love him or you hate him, and most of the reviews of this book are in the 4 to 5 star range. But I couldn't finish this book. Card is beating the same dead horse over and over again: talented, but abused children rise up to best their betters (grown-ups) and win the day. However, I couldn't help but get the impression that Card's just writing to fulfull a contract or to wring as much blood out of the Ender turnip as he can. I never believed that these characters were children, nor could I get into their plight. I think I've out-grown Mr. Card's universe (as well as his turgid writing style). Mr. Card is writing pulp now. Perhaps he will improve with his Biblical fiction. That seems to be where his heart is anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Card trying to write like Card","review":"This book is a sad example of Card trying to write like Card. It doesn't even seem like the normal author in this tale. The characters are shallow, the plot is thin (and borring), and when the last page ends you are left wondering at the title...why was this book called \\"shadow of the hegemon\\" WHEN the hegemon (peter) is almost completly ignored. Yes he pops in once in a while and writes a few essays but there was never one momement when you even glimps what will make this man great. This book is nothing more then a poor chance at making money off of \\"Ender's Game.\\" It falls flat"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bean Stalk","review":"Card has tossed another \\"Shadows\\" book out of the Ender Wiggin series of sci-fi. As much as I enjoyed the Ender novels, I am coming to enjoy the Bean novels even more. From the dregs of Battle School to the real world, Bean overcomes as only he can, with guile, guts and a lot of know-how.I can't wait until Card gives us the story of Bean after Peter matures into the Hegemon of the future. It should be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant followup to Ender's Shadow.","review":"If you were a fan of Ender's Shadow, you will undoubtedly enjoy this book as much as I did as a fantastic sequel.This sequel fills in much of the gaps whereas the Ender's Series concentrated primarily on what happened to humanity in outer space. Ender's Shadow and the books that procede it concentrate on the struggle for humanity to unite under one ruler in Shadow of the Hegemon.This book was great as it tells you what happens on Earth while Ender is busy helping humanity colonize \\"The Hundred World's\\".Card adds a bit of refreshing insight into the life of another hero, Bean and adds another interesting perspective on the Ender story with the story of what happened after Ender left Earth.If you haven't read this book, I highly recommend that you don't miss out for much longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why i think this is a good book","review":"Why I think this book and others in this series are good is simple. They kept my attention. I am a sixteen year old girl that when I get bored I want a good book to curl up with no distractions and I totally get lost in the charecters and thats what happened when I read, not only this book but all of the ENDER books, I got lost for hours on end. With Bean having to save his friends, nobody quite knowing whats going on, and the budding romance between him and the only girl in BATTLE SCHOOL to have fought in the Bugger wars. A good end. Or is it a new beginning...? To this the bean segment of the series. I don't know about anyone else who's read these books but i hope he comes out with more of them maybe Enders children...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Orson Scott Card, Master author","review":"I've been reading Orson Scott Card's books for 7 years. I've watched him mature from a great writer to a sensational one. I'm going to give an example from bean; Card talks about his emotional reactions being stilted, because he didn't learn them from an early age, and yet none of his actions are truly stilted. He feels awkward, and yet at the same time Card conveys his actual actions as completely, believably, human. In other words, he displays Bean as feeling emotionally stunted, but at the same time his actions show maturity. I wonder how may of his readers see how deeply he writes. I wonder if I truly see how deeply he writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIGH","review":"What a huge disappointment. Ender's shadow was a great read. Shadow of the hegemon was an utter waste of time. Im an avid Orson Scott Cart fan, but with the exception of the Alvin Maker series, he's not the greatest sequel writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Card is slowing down a bit","review":"Ender's Game was fantastic. The rest of the books surrounding Ender's life were different, but good in their own way. Ender's Shadow was a glimpse at the original story from a different perspective, but it was still intriguing and very fun to read. Now, we have Shadow of the Hegemon, and we're starting to ask the big question: Do we really care that much about Bean?The book is pretty good, but not on the same level as Ender's Game. Of course, if you look at Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow, this book is the next progression in the \\"series\\", but somehow it leaves you wanting more.Mr. Card, Ender's Game was terrific, and we would have been thrilled had you left it there. Fortunately and unfortunately, you didn't.Final thoughts: If you loved the series, get the book. If all you've read is Ender's Game, please, for the love of all that's sacred, leave it there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Story, Characters, Politics","review":"Ender's Game and The Speaker for the Dead are worth the time. This book is not.Card thinks too much about his insight on political science. In the afterword, he brags that he's been interested in international relations since he was a kid. Unfortunately, he hasn't grown up. His plot is two dimentional and he has no understading of the history or politics regarding Russia, America, Thailand, or any other country.His characters are also thin and two dimentional. The story: Bean and all the other \\"child warriors\\" return to earth, where an evil kid somehow awaits them. The evil kid leads entire nations to kidnap on all the other smart kids in order to rule the world. Huh?Read Ender's Game and forget about this one, unless you're stuck on a 13-hour plane ride with nothing else to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Writing, Excellent Narrators - Jolting edits","review":"First let me clarify that I loved the writing and the assorted narrators. I discounted a star on this audio version for the poor editing. I can only assume that the word Hegemon was mispronounced throughout the book and the \\"patch\\" used to insert the correct pronunciation is a bit jolting. It does not sound as though it was recorded with the same equipment and I'm not sure if it's even the same narrator. For those of us who like to be totally immersed in the story - it will jolt you back to reality. The first couple of times I found it amusing but after that it became annoying. I think I would rather have had the mispronounced word rather than the jolting edits. I ended up listening to this audiobook while driving - I wasn't as immersed in the story and not as annoyed by the poor edits. From now on I will check the reviews of product from this company and will read the book myself rather than pay for a poorly edited audiobook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find time to read the book","review":"Most reviews I've read on this page address the book itself, not the audiobook. Not a mention of recording quality, production, or any aspects of the recording. Card mentions repeatedly at the end that audiobook is his preferred way to present his works, but if this is the best they come up with I disagree. FIND THE TIME TO READ THE BOOK. To me these little things in the recordings progressively became more annoying: the recording sounds very tinny, and for some reason \\"the hegemon\\" is recorded out of context?; continued mispronunciation of the antagonist throughout the book; and cheesy, poorly thought out musical \\"interludes\\" that become more invasive and jarring. Buy the used book and enjoy this great book for a fraction of the cost of this audiobook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A childrens book for adults","review":"What's good - great fun to read, good insight into tactical desicion making, some nice historical perspectives, interesting characters and great presentation of conflictWhat's not so good - the evil kid (Achilles) does not have enough background to adequately explain his actions. Peter Wiggins is also poorly explored.Other : The Ender series is loosely based on an idea that very, clever children are capable of providing answers to questions that adults can't. This mindset has become very popular of late. When you run out of ideas - let someone or something else make the decisions.Card is well bright enough to provide an aged nun, Sister Carlotta, to temper the ego of child genius.Children will love it and adults should hope to learn from it.Engaging, clever and timely; we are lucky to have Orson spinning fine yarns.caslo"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I'm a great fan of Card's \\"Ender\\" series, but this chapter falls far short of the standards he has established. Seems to me that Card is simply trying to beat a dead horse and write as many books as he can about the world of \\"Ender's Game\\", rather than expanding his scope and exploring fresh avenues.The premise of the novel - that the Battle School graduates would be kidnapped to help others plot military strategies - is 100% ridiculous. From this flaw, everything else goes downhill, and one can only hope that Card can do some serious CPR in order to revive the dead horse with what he says will be two more novels in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"no words can describe","review":"If your not a fan become a fan so you can enjoy this novel, and if you are a fan read this right away. thats is all i can tell you. that and \\"share this dragon if you do lucky end for them and you\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me caveman book critic","review":"Shadow.

It gives more depth about the character known as bean. They tell about his personal life and how he struggled to stay alive. Bean is my favorite character in the Enders game series. He shows the most wits and learns the fastest. He develops emotion, which he has never felt before. Bean, ends up saving the world along with a team of super intelligent kids that think they are playing a game but in reality they are actually commanding star ships in a galaxy where the buggers reside.Not only is Bean a survivor of 25 which 23 were burnt down, he ends up finding his parents and eventually meets his long lost bother. His savior, who is also like his mother, finds Enders brother Peter. Bean helps peter become Hegemon.To me this is the best book of the series, because to me Bean was my favorite Character, because of his intelligence and his past experiances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book but Amazon issues","review":"This was a great book to read, the story I enjoyed very much. My experience with the actual e-book was ruined however by the fact that every page or so the last sentence would not flow into the next page from the previous one. I had to keep removing the eBook from my device and re-downloading it in order to no skip the last few sentences at the end of a page and the beginning of a new page. This is why i switched to Google books. The kindle App is just plain horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orson Scott Card For President Of Deseret!!!","review":"First Of All......the \\"Ender\\" series is the best SF read of all time.After reading \\"Shadow Of The Hegemon\\" cover to cover nearly 6 times (I have apprx: 2 chapters left) in the past few months, I must admit that with every new book, I have new a new favorite.Shadow Of The Hegemon is now the #2 book in the series.....only because it would be morally wrong to place it in front of Ender's Game.I personally feel that the storytelling in \\"Shadow\\", eclipses at many points that of the original. It keeps you in suspense much like the \\"battle against the buggers\\" did in \\"Ender\\", but with more plot twists. But yet as always with Orson Scott Card, The Story NEVER Gets Lost In The Storytelling.Orson Scott Card Books Only Get Better With Every Read....And Re-Read, And Re-Read, Etc.Ps: I now have my wife HOOKED on the \\"Women Of Genesis\\" Series...Thanks Orson, For Writing About Something Dear To The Hearts Of So Many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appaling, boring and rapidly becomes intelligence insulting","review":"With great hope I opened this new book in the Ender series, hope that it improves on the previous one in the series, Children of the Mind. Which was just plain boring. Had to skip to the end as could not bear the appallingly plodding script and magical approach to plot devices. Bad luck for me, this is worse. Within a few pages the stupidity of the plot, shallowness of the characters and non-exploration of SF causes headaches. Perhaps one of the worst books I've bought. Do not buy! Orson has lost it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the soul","review":"This book gripped me and broke through my reading dry spell. Read it all in one day, and wished there were more. Not a master work like SONGMASTER or ENDER'S GAME, but a stirring read relating to what it means to be human in this universe.Small brains natter about details and unimportant errors. But as usual, Mr. Card, for all his intellectual prowess, is speaking to the soul of his reader. Too many zomboid americans who think they are cultured because they learned to read will not connect with this material. They will be unable to relate to the spiritual, emotional basis of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's Killing It...He's really Killing It","review":"He wrote a masterpiece worthy of Heinlein (sp?). Now he is churning out plot filler like an anonymous serialist. The Ender series is working on the Star Wars principle--the closer to the original the book is, the better it is. I stopped reading this one 1/4 of the way through after realizing that, a) not only was I not enjoying this book, but b) it was also sucking the life out of the other, good books in the series. For this reason, it deserves a couple of negative stars, but the space-time continuum of amazon.com won't abide that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Shadow","review":"In truth no matter how good this book may be it is not ever going to gain the same level of popularity that Ender's game has. Personally I like where these books go as they give a in depth look at the other children from battle school and what they return home to. If you were a fan of the Ender's Game and want to know about the characters that remain behind after Ender leaves this is a pretty good read. HOWEVER be warned that you will never be able to look at Ender's Game in the same light again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to measure up","review":"The Ender Quartet was great stuff. Ender's Shadow was awesome. But something happened between the last Shadow and this one... whatever it was, Card failed to come through with his normal grandeur.The story itself is somewhat hard to buy, granted we suspend disbelief for fantastical works, but it was still a little much. Kidnapping the kids to force them to command your armies? Even a mediocre commander is going to give you better results than an enemy held at gunpoint. I simply couldn't buy it.The endless amount of Bean being compared to a Christian ideal is exceptionally irritating. Card can only bring it up so many times until you want to scream \\"Ok, I get the point, not get on with the story!\\"The whole thing left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction. My advice to you is just to quit with Ender's Shadow and guess as to what else happens... certainly much more fun than wading through this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Card Does It Again","review":"Orson Scott Card has done it again ladies and gents. From going back into Bean's past (as you would have read in Ender's Shadow) to the heroics of Bean and the other Command School children. This O.S.C. book is based after Ender has left Eros (end of Ender's Game) where Bean and the other Command School children are being kidnapped by different countries to prepare themselves for an overlearing war that may be ahead for them. Bean proves once again to be even more clever than the great Ender Wiggin himself. Bean seems to be able to overcome ANYTHING ,as long as it is for his survival. The plot is overwhelming and I couldn't drop the book down for a second. It is as great as Ender's Shadow was when it was published. Achilles returns once again for you \\"evil minded people\\". \\"Shadow of the Hedgemon\\" has shown that even a brilliant child can create chaos. Go ahead and grab this book if you're a vivid Ender fan. It is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Card is desperate","review":"What was Card's intention in writting this book? To make money, I suppose. But while this is most writers intentions, you can tell Card's desperation in this book. He should have stoped writting about the Achiles character in Ender's Shadow, but he does so again in this book, with guarentee that he'll be in the sequal to this. The Bean character was strong enough to hold \\"Enders shadow\\" together, but he came across as an unhuman like character. In some respects the book is satisfying, but not enough for me to recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Card's writing, especially his, uh, \\"Enderverse\\". I loved Ender's Game, I absolutely adored Speaker for the Dead, I'm reading Xenocide and I love what I've read, and I liked Ender's Shadow.I don't like Shadow of the Hegemon though.It's nothing but boring, long and tedious talk about...politics. Also, Card doesn't seem to understand how much the world would have changed in 200 years. I don't know, I seem to like Card better when he's writing about philosophy, not politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way To Political","review":"I was a huge fan of Enders Game and Enders Shadow, however, Shadow Of The Hegemon disappointed me. There was almost no action in it. The whole book was just political conversations, so political, that they were hard to follow. What little bit that I was able to follow, was uninteresting. If you were a fan of the rest of the Ender series, I recomend that you at least try this book. That is why I gave it two stars instead of one. You may get something out of this book that I did not. But before you dive into this tale be warned. It is extremely political and almost entirely comprised of long conversation. But at least attempt to read it like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncle Orson Does It Again!","review":"... If I'd listened to ...[the negative feedback], I would have missed out on an outstanding read. Card had a tall order in SotH and he pulls it off well. The international events and military operations frame, but do not interfere, with the continued personal stories of Bean, Petra, Peter, and Achilles. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless","review":"OSC is capable of much more depth than Shadow of the Hegemon has. It is a watery story with little character development and the pace of a poorly played chess game. Granted, it is difficult to write characters who are supposed to be smarter than the author, but OSC did it with Ender's Game.....OSC admittedly wrote Shadow while concurrently writing a different story. It shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAN AND PETRA--WHAT A TEAM","review":"I love this new series about Bean and his role in saving the universe. Card continues the story of Bean that he began in the book Ender's Shadow, in fine fashion. There was a huge gap in time between Ender's Game and Speaker For The Dead and this series shows what happened during that time.The Battle School kids are all sent home after the Bugger War. Someone or some Country steals all the kids from Ender's Jeesh hoping to make their country the superpower of the world. Bean and Nikolai are the only ones not captured. Bean along with Sister Carlotta and Peter Wiggin work to get the kids released from their captors. All are released but Petra.In this novel it is up to Bean and Peter to save Petra and stop Achilles from taking over the world. This is a great book and very enjoyable. The only thing that gets me is, how many times is Achilles going to get away? He should have been dead several times over already. Well, can't have everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make sure to read Ender's Shadow First!!","review":"This book holds up to the standard set by Card in Ender's Game with some differences. One of the most obvious is the lack of 'science' in this sci-fi, as the book focuses more on the political plot and employs less of the futuristic and 'techy' stuff. Any fan of the series will genuinely love the continuation of the saga, whereas someone reading it as an intro to the series may not like it all that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet!

Each succesive RW has inevitably reflected the time it takes place (notice the succesive tolerance of class, race, sexuality from then to the new seasons).

I've been buying it for at least a decade whenever I see it, and it just keeps getting better.The crafts range from charming to elegant, and are never cutesy or kitschy. I don't think anything in this magazine ever looks homemade, which is so often the case in Martha and other American magazines. I also enjoy that it has a variety: an issue might include a few sewing projects, a few knitting projects, some recipes, a fashion spread, a few things to make for kids, a lavish embroidery project and a few smaller handwork projects, and a few pages of shopping suggestions that make me desperately wish for access to French stores.The pictures are so beautiful that it's impossible not to be inspired, and the very diagramed instructions for each of the projects in the back of the magazine mean that, so long as you understand the basics of the specific craft (sewing, embroidery, knitting, etc) you don't need to be able to read French."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Customer Support again","review":"My MIL ordered this magazine for me as a present but did not realize that it was in French.

The CS reps solution was for me to donate them!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If Martha Stewart were French, she'd publish this magazine","review":"If you read French or not, this is a wonderful magazine. The crafts include embroidery, collage, knitting, tapestry, cooking and more. The fashion and style areas give novel ideas for using junk like funky-labeled tin cans for a beach house door curtain, making mirror frames from bottle caps. Think sort of, Martha Stewart with a French twist. The trimestrial issues have a holiday or seasonal theme, Christmas, Spring, Summer, Autumn.Every issue has an abecedaire (sampler) in a clever type of embroidery. Usually there is a knitted pattern, most often for babies but not always. There is usually a travelogue to an exotic place, with great photos. And you can get a long long advance look at US style trends--for example, Marie Claire Idees featured toile and transfer printed china years before it got to be a hot trend in the US.

By doing so, he unravels a splendid story which everyone can relate to, in their own personal interpretation. Though the formula is repeated in each of his novels, it does not grow stale because of his masterful, emotional storytelling. A winning novel in every respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A peak into reality...","review":"Wow!

The deterioration of the city is paralleled by the physical condition of an elderly professor with Parkinson's disease. Set against the horrors of overcrowding, family secrets, tensions between the various family members, Mistry fully explores the tightrope walk that constitutes just getting through life for most people in the world - yet he does so with humor, tenderness, and a haunting feeling of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not A Fine Balance","review":"A very enjoyable book, full of irony, humor, and social commentary. It offers a picture of middle class life in contemporary India, commentary on the state of religious and ethnic relations there, and the stories of several interesting and well drawn characters. Although it deals with mundane people in rather ordinary circumstances, there were several parts of the book that made my heart race. It's a testament to the author's skill that he can make ordinary moments extraordinary (and it's striking that none of the most overtly dramatic moments are told in the present tense or fleshed out very much). Nonetheless, in my view, the book falls short of Mistry's spectacular A Fine Balance. It just doesn't have that book's scope or impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Sleeping - Maybe Only a Power Nap","review":"If you would like to fall asleep to the gentle sounds of the ocean, then this recording is NOT for you.

However, \\"Midaq Alley\\", while a pleasant read, wasn't anything to write home about. The characters are lively and the setting fascinating but the author never delves deeply enough into the life of any individual to make you feel as though you fully understand them. The style may have lost something in translation, but it lacked the richness of language and description that I expected to find from an internationally-recognized author.Not bad, but altogether a little disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is kinda....","review":"If I were to choose a book that I could not live without, it would certianly not be this one.

The main character in this book is Hamida, but this book is composed of many characters who have their own little stories within this book. And she represents Egypt in World War 1. She was tricked into becoming a prostitute for money, makeup, and fancy clothes. If you think about it, Egypt was given the illusion of becoming world power if it were to join the war.

Producer-composer Giorgio Moroder put together great topical sounds -- like Blondie's \\"Call Me\\" -- with his ripoffs of Mozart's Clarinet Concerto slow movement and other composers to create an aura of eroticism and mystery suitable to the moments portrayed in this flick.It seems inconprehensible to me there is only one review of this wonderful soundtrack on Amazon. People that like film music should at least listen to the sound bytes and, more likely, invest the tiny amount asked for Moroder's production. The music gave the movie a film noir element that increases its credibility. Dont' hestiate if you like music from the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Electropop Standouts of the Period","review":"\\"Love Theme\\" and \\"Seduction\\" rate as probably two of the best pop-electronic film themes of the 80s, and, well, \\"Call Me\\" is just downright great. Why Giorgio bothered to squeal his way through \\"Hello W.A.M.\\", I don't know. It hurt the end of the film, itself, and adds nothing to this soundtrack. \\"Love and Passion\\" - lyrics by director Paul Shrader - totally sum up the feelings of any intelligent person who has tried to live too long in Los Angeles.This dates very well because L.A. is STILL the L.A. of this film (1980) - fun, dangerous, superficial, materialistic - so take it along on your next trip and drive along the lonesome freeways with Moroder's hypnotic electrobeat propelling you along."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic that influences the music of today...","review":"I grew up listening to this soundtrack as my parents played it quite a bit.

Chapter by chapter the authors cite the same sources and say the same thing in slightly different ways.About midway through the book, it becomes clear that the chapters have been written by shadow dwellers describing the same shadows that they see from their shackled platonic position in some common academic cave. Perhaps colleagues, wired through some philosopher's conference, brains in brain vats, enjoying the view from a Matrix of their own making...That in itself makes it an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the desert","review":"It's kind of disrturbing if you are a imaginary kind of person, can't take you to mind trips you donpt need before you go to bed how ever it's a good lecture"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is about the seller, not the battery.","review":"Advertised as brand new, the battery arrived in a semi-sealed plastic enclosure, but it won't hold a charge.

The first time was a pair of Sonus Faber Grand Pianos - $3,500 /pair at the time. They provided what I can only describe as a religious experience. The second time was when I listened to the Athena F2's. They filled the room with music that was effortless and unstrained, and created a soundstage that brought the music to life.The third time I was blown away was when I heard the price of the Athena F2's.

Credited as the first punk-rock band, the Velvet Underground is one of the few bands that were willing to be avant-garde by mixing music with every other thing provocative, sweet and sad. The song Pale Blue Eyes, in my opinion, is one of the most beautiful, depressing and well crafted poems ever written. The twentieth-century author by the name of James Joyce once wrote that beauty consisted of three things: wholeness, harmony and radiance. The Velvet Underground's self titled album defines beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I don't drool over the Velvet Underground and their important influences in rock like many people do, but not giving their few album releases a chance would be missing something big. Well, somewhat big.This album is a giant change compared to White Light/White Heat. THAT was one insane listening experience. This album however, is MUCH more laid back and easier for casual music fans to accept. While I have to be in a certain mood to appreciate the quiet tone throughout the album, I can't ignore the fact that, when I AM in that mood, this is really good stuff.Not the best album they ever did, but probably worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mellower texture","review":"Another remarkably solid disc from the pioneering alternative act, TVU concentrates more on straight-ahead acoustic melodies with a touching religious overtone, while still retaining their edgy experimental side. Some of their more sincere, distortion-free material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful songwriting.","review":"Here I go ahead where many have gone before to write about the Velvet Underground. All of their albums are essential for one way or another, the first two mainly for the fact that nothing else sounds like them (an achievement considering how many have copied them). The last is simply so catchy. However it's their third that is most wonderful. The songwriting is simple, and concern universal topics, such as love, fear of rejection, moments of happiness, loneliness etc... As such the songs seem to speak to you, recognise how you feel, live and simply 'are'. Linked to the fact that they are simple songs, based around a chord or two, your not being asked to any long solos or anything of the sort. Mo Tucker's vocals on \\"After Hours\\", are beautiful and fragile."},{"rating":"2","title":"not nearly as cool as their other albums","review":"With the exception of a few brilliant songs (Candy Says, After Hours, Murder Mystery), I can pretty much live without this one, as opposed to the other 4 studio albums of theirs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh look, Lou Reed on heroin...","review":"Oh, their finest hour, eh? This album is so full of soulless and bland material, its sickening. I hate Pale Blue Eyes with a passion. Sheryl Crowe covered it, and really, I can't make out the difference; both versions blow.Basically, the band was trying to make up for releasing an album as coked out as White Light/White Heat. If you like your Velvet Underground spineless, this album's for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzling to see how this is praised so much","review":"It seems to me that a large part of Velvet Underground's cult fame and mystique comes from the fact that these guys can't play well.Lou Reed can't sing worth a nickel. Period. He talk-sings his way through most songs, and when he does try to actually sing, it's a pathetic attempt. Mo Tucker's voice is also a joke on the song that she sings. The songs are all 2 or 3-chord repetition, the guitars are frequently out of tune, and Tucker can't keep a steady beat to save her life.So somehow, bands that (1) can't play, (2) sing about the sleazier side of life, and (3) get ignored -- sometimes rightly -- by the public, somehow these bands rise to legendary status. Makes you wonder where people's values are."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this was their most accessible work................","review":"I was intrigued by many of the reviews of this album and bought it without being familiar with any of the cuts. Well, if this is their most accessible album, it's hard to imagine what their others were like. Musically, this is absolute drivel. Perhaps if one was looking for poetry and can ignore the rudimentary vocals and the dearth of melody, it's of some value. The musicianship isn't special, either. While listening to this, thoughts of slashing my wrists began to seem favorable in comparison. I ended up giving the CD to someone as a white elephant. The single star rating is only due to the lack of a \\"zero\\" option."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Restrained Classic","review":"The Velvet Underground's self-titled third album is a dramtic departure from its two predecessors. Restrained, spare and haunting, it contains a bevy of classics from a band that continues to have a huge influence more than three decades after calling it quits. Artsist as diverse as R.E.M., The Feelies and Sparklehorse have either covered songs from this album or taken musical and lyrical samples from it. It also contains some of band leader Lou Reed's best-ever songwriting. The two quiet masterpieces are \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Jesus,\\" the latter of the two even managing to be surprisingly spiritual. Other highlights include the rocking \\"What Goes On,\\" \\"Candy Says,\\" and the (somewhat) hopeful \\"Beginning to See the Light.\\" The only songs that don't work a the two overly arty experiments that conclude the album.Overall, an understated classic that will stick in your memory long after it has finished playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Velvets","review":"High proportion of the tracks on eponymous Velvet Underground long-player cd are good ones. Worth buying for 'I'm Beginning to See The Light'. Even without Nico, the ballards are impressive with the male voices on the album. Check out the first bars of the album tracks on Amazon if you're familiar from 40 years ago with the group. You'll hear the tracks are good'uns. You might want to buy this 2nd time around. Best wishes, Andrew."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE V.U. album to own and love","review":"Forget \\"...& Nico.\\" Yeah, VU's first album was retrospectively groundbreaking, but \\"The Velvet Underground\\" was the band at its peak. It has plenty of edge, but with plenty of pop moments, too. After \\"White Light, White Heat,\\" this may sound like mellowing out. It is. But it's no mellowing out at the expense of great songwriting and almost singable (!) sounds. It isn't perfect: \\"The Murder Mystery\\" doesn't hold up to more than one listening, and \\"After Hours\\" works OK as an album closer but is otherwise mostly fluff. Beyond that, there is not a weak link on the album. The lead break on \\"What Goes On\\" alone is enough to justify owning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know music could do that","review":"By the time \\"What Goes On\\" was through with me, my eyes were shut, my stomach was up with my lungs, and my tongue was out with my chin. I wiped the drool away and thought, \\"I didn't know music could do that.\\"The guitar. How is that possible? Well, to get technical, Lou's solo was recorded several times, and it came out slightly differently each time, and then the recordings were placed one on top of the other, much like an Andy Warhol silkscreen painting. But I didn't mean how is that technically possible. I meant how is it possible that such a fantastic, blurred, soul-crushing sound exists in this world?Here we are, 43 years later, and nothing approaches it. I know music isn't a competition, but something about this album just seems unfair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking, and yet...","review":"This album does contain Pale Blue Eyes, one of the greatest ever from this group, but it also contains Murder Mystery, which is just overwrought glop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their most accessible album","review":"After the noise fury and hedonistic characters introduced in their first two albums, Lou Reed & Co. take a wide left turn on this graceful classic. This is an album of fantastic breadth with some of Reed's finest writing ever. The quiet beauty that surrounds songs like \\"I'm Set Free\\" shows that the Velvet Underground could perform just about any type of song. The rhythm-guitar on \\"What Goes On\\" is simply awesome. \\"Beginning to See the Light\\" is joyous. Other tunes demonstrate the group's vulnerability. The bookend songs, \\"Candy Says\\" and \\"Afterhours\\" are heart-breaking. \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Jesus,\\" perhaps the best songs on the album, are soul-wrenching. Though this may not be their best album, it is my personal favourite and my recommendation for those unfamiliar with the group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottle #3","review":"I have plenty of perfume bottles but Michael Kors is the only one I wear.

I really love this perfume and enjoy the refreshment after pumping.. I do never intend to degrade the quality of one of my favorite perfumes by saying this, but it is somewhat comparable to the one of the air-fresher scents that was so refreshing as well.. But one thing that I like to point out is, this one has a little too heavy and dense aroma comparing to other products, so I'd rather pump it only once or twice. It maybe because this one is 'Eau de Parfum'..not 'Eau de Toilette. I highly admire the maker's talent to discover/create this special scent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Kors by Michael Kors","review":"Absolutely disgusting. I had not only myself, but four other women of varying ages but who are very tasteful try it and the responses were all the same...\\"Smells like an old lady\\"...\\"Smells like old Avon\\"...\\"Smells like a cheap drugstore perfume back in the 80s\\". I am a big fan of most of the Michael Kors perfumes, so this was a major disappointment. It has a strong, overwhelming scent of gardenia and honeysuckle, and I know some have said that men loved it, but I just cannot see that being true. I even had a few guys in my office smell it, and THEY said it smelled like their grandmother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tons of compliments from men","review":"I have been stopped on the street from someone that got a whiff of my perfume.

Out of all of my perfumes, this one gets the most compliments from men and women."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product Was A Fake","review":"I have bought this product many times. I received this and noticed that the bottle was only slightly different.

As a result, my wife opened her beautifully-scented gift with about 1/3 of the perfume gone. For the price paid for this perfume, I would think that better packaging could eliminate such expensive waste. I enjoy ordering thru Amazon, but as a result of this experience I do not know that I can ever order liquids again in this fashion. I would like to think that either Amazon or the manufacturer would like to make up for this unpleasant experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible in a good way","review":"the only reason this is getting 2 stars is because it really is amusing to watch, but every aspect of this movie is *bad.* From the plot to the writing to the acting, to the soundtrack.

Still, it's worth seeing once, just to laugh at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent quality for the price.","review":"I was surprised when it came that part of the stated size was a white border, making the actual picture only 8X10.

Looks nice enough in the frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth Browning poems","review":"This book was one of the earlier American editions printed. It is a complete collection as the authoress intended them to be. I am enjoying reading them and feel like I'm there, as the one I got is 150 years old. There is something about a book that was printed when the author was still alive. It not only includes her famous \\"How do I love thee...\\" poem, but many other wonderful love poems that I was able to discover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you ready for an amazing surprise?","review":"If you only know Tiny Tim from \\"Tip-Toe Thru the Tulips With Me\\", you will be surprised by this album. Most of the songs here aren't sung in his high pitched falsetto voice, but rather his natural baritone voice. Admittedly, there are some people who can't stand him in any voice, due to his extreme tremolo when he holds a note. Personally, I dig him. On this album, Tiny Tim and Brave Combo work very well together. It's a natural combination, since both acts are lighthearted and perform in a somewhat retro style. Simply put, this is just a fun listen. Recommended for fans of cool and strange music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy","review":"Bought this for my daughter, but she found one elsewhere, so I kept it.

I checked several food stores and department stores without luck.It's well constructed and rugged. I have had no problems with the many fruits I have cored with it!

Coring an apple would be a breeze with these considering how well they cut into those hard canning pears...Well worth the cost..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kitchen Tool","review":"This corer works beautifully every time. No more seeds left in an apple after coring. I find that it works much better to use this followed by a knife to make apple slices than to use those corer/slicer tools, as the latter are frequently too small, or move through the apple at an angle, leaving seeds in the slices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but wish it were sharper","review":"A great tool as are all OXO tools I've tried. I understand they cannot make it too sharp for safety reasons, but if it were just a little sharper it would be 5 stars. Being dull, it's safe, but requires too much pressure to push through an apple. Ironically, applying the extra pressure actually makes it less safe because it's not as stable when one has to push so hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what i was looking for.","review":"Nice sharp apple corer. Works as you would expect. I would have liked it to be slightly larger diameter, but for most of the apples it removes enough of the core.

Although sometimes I halfway miss the core, and have to go through again (my issue not the corer). It's very easy to push through and core, and takes a nice clean section out of the apple. If you're making apple dumplings, pie, etc it makes the apples look very \\"professional\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a corer...","review":"Not much to say here. It does the job. I've used it on a few dozen apples, put it through the dishwasher, and its still working.

He was extremely sceptical towards recording, and consequently, there aren't many albums under his name. In the early 1980s, he agreed to do this album for Rounder Records, and the result is a glorious piano record. Washington handles jazz, blues and pop tunes with the utmost grace and skill, and he comes across as a musical entertainer of the highest order. Like many of his contemporaries, he knew how to please an audience without making artistic compromises. Washington is great to listen to, and he is a very important musician, because of his influence on later players like Longhair and Booker. If you like this album, you should also try to seek out the very rare \\"Live At Tipitina\\" which captures Tuts in his element; in front of an enthusiastic, noisy audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The View From Rat Lake","review":"I don't remember ever ordering this book.

And all previous and current data and workout information is lost. You have to start from day zero.I wish the customer care service was better and did solve the problems, but they keep saying that they do not know what is happening. It is a shame for Polar company. I am looking for another brand right now.Best RegardsAFAP"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Heart rate monitor","review":"Purchased the Polar Rs 200 and love it. I am new to running and it greatly assists my workouts. The chest strap is compatible with my gym's cardio equipment so it makes it easy to monitor my training sessions.

Overall I would recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent HRM","review":"I bought this to replace the Polar F11 I had for a few years before. Even though the F11 is more expensive, this has more features which makes it more fun to use. I've yet to get the foot pod but that's not far off. People complained about the buttons but they feel just like the ones on my old F11 so I'm not sure what the deal is. The extra button on the top is very useful when doing manual laps. If I broke the one I bought, I would definately buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart rate monitor","review":"This product works great and does everything that I need it to do. Only complaint is the display, I wish it would keep the display that you used the last time you worked out so I dont have to keep changing it.

Little or no compression gives it great dynamic range. Now, it is a \\"live\\" recording, so we get to hear the crowd noise, etc. and there is a little background \\"hiss\\". But, this is a 1965 recording. So don't let the reviews that say this is not good sound quality fool you. They must be use to compressed MP3's or something.If you're a fan of The Ramsey Lewis trio and have been waiting to replace the vinyl with a CD, now is your chance.

You're unlikely to agree with everything Maher said in the book but it's guaranteed to make you think and hopefully it will also make you alter some of your behaviors that will at the end make this a stronger nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stand up well over time","review":"Please keep in mind, my review of this book is just over 10 years after 911 happened. I usually agree wholeheartedly with Maher's point of view but given time to reevaluate 911 with greater hindsight, I would think that even Maher would want a rewrite of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"I found this in a bookshop at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport. The cover did it's job by reminding me of WW2 patriotic posters, and I found myself almost reading the whole thing before I even bought it. Good sense (and an impending departure) prevailed, and I devoured it on my flight to Allentown.For those who never saw his program \\"Politically Incorrect\\", you missed a gem of a show. This book is your opportunity to make up for what you've lost. I doubt that you, no more than I, will agree with everything in the book. My advice: Take three ideas for action from this book and make them your goal to achieve them and so defeat the terrorist threats to western civilization."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you ride alone, you should ride with this audiobook","review":"I listened to the audiobook version of Bill Maher's book (three cassettes, unabridged) and found it to be both thoughtful and very entertaining. Maher reads aloud the essays from his book in an energetic and engaging manner that makes you forget he's reading a prepared text at all. The nature of the book- lots of short essays on a variety of topics- reminded me a bit of Dennis Miller's various \\"Rants\\" books, but here the emphasis is less on comedy and more on making interesting points about various aspects of the post-911 world. But don't worry, the heavy topics are definitely balanced with some laugh-out-loud humor; in fact, Maher usually uses that humor to punctuate and underline his most serious points. In any event, this is definitely a painless way to expose yourself to some of the difficult issues we need to think about these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent positive propaganda","review":"This collection of 33 WWII-ish posters range in subject matter from terrorism to the drug war and America's love affair with (big) cars. Each is accompanied by a one- or three-page Maher rant and often by a reprint of an inspirational vintage poster.I found the posters themselves as well as the commentary quite moving and Maher, often strident and sometimes bullying, nevertheless reveals a heart that loves America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff..","review":"Such a great idea to use 40's style propaganda and apply it to today. The only complaint I have is how the book is a bit short on substance outside of the art work. Fans of Maher will notice some re-hashed stuff spread throughout. None the less, it's a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"He called US Pilots COWARDS","review":"This is merely another diatribe from a Hollywood elitist who thinks his celebrity status validates his opinion on anything and everything.Recall that Mr. Maher called US Pilots cowardly for bombing from 50,000 feet, while he never risked his life for his country. You will then understand everything this useless book has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far below standards for Bill Maher","review":"This is an over-priced, over-sized edition of some of Bill's philosophy. I love his philosophy, but with the \\"poster pages,\\" it comes across like an over-priced comic book.His comments are \\"right on,\\" ... Thus the 2 stars. There's no bang for the buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"clever, but...","review":"Maher says that it's only right for people to be scrutinized at airports because they're Muslim. But Bill, how can you tell? I'm Lebanese and I'm Christian. My uncle's mother-in-law is Arab and she's Jewish. Christian Palestinians do exist. Shock and awe! You can't tell someone's religion by seeing what country they're from. And I have news that may surprise the perspicacious author - not all Muslims are misogynistic killers. Knowledge does win - and I know Bill Maher is very knowledgeable - but I don't think he should have published this book without being more informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"When You Ride Alone You Still Ride with Bin Laden: What the Government Should Be Telling Us to Help Fight the War on Terrorism -","review":"While I remain a fan of Bill Maher, \\"When You Ride Alone You Still Ride with Bin Laden\\" disappointed me. It was hard, if not impossible at times, to distinguish Bill from a Bush-supporter vs a Bush-basher. His arguments and allegiances seemed to be all over the place in this...very easy to read...book. Definitely not his best piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"TELL IT LIKE IT IS PHIL...ERRR...I MEAN BILL","review":"Tell it like it is Phil...errr. I mean BillHey, Dr. Phil isn't the only one who tells it like it is. Bill Maher pulls no punches and says it all with wit and humor. I love the way he trashes todays climate in light of these nutty terrorists. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Maher hits on almost as many points as he misses--not unlike his very politically correct Politically Incorrect television show. The man has a brain, but he's just mixed up. His book is overloaded with the usual leftist silliness he shares with Michael Moore et al, but he also strikes a cord of common sense from time to time. Is it worth [the price]? No, but it is worth a read both for the small portions of common sense it occasionally doles out and for the insight it provides into the minds of emotional thinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected this book to be funny","review":"Seeing that Maher thinks he's hilarious, I thought he would at least write a book that was mildly humorous. Not so.His attempt at humor is lacking in originality and does not spring from a very deep well. This book does not grab you, compel you, make you look at issues differently, or use humor as a tool to change your perspective on current events. He fails at his primary mission to be funny, and his secondary mission to provide insightful commentary in today's most important issues. Clearly he thought he was being cute and witty in writing this book - too bad it's as flat as yesterday's diet coke.True, the points he is trying to make are good ones, and kudos for the attempt, but as far as political humorists go, this guy is at the bottom of the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me laughing!","review":"I really liked this. I don't agree with everything Bill says, but I sure like the way he says everything. (Makes a good point about profiling, though I'm against it.) He's funny. This book is, too, and that's why I buy books... to laugh. Yes, some of the diatribes are rehashed from his t.v. show. But who cares? If you like him, this is a great investment. If you don't, buy \\"Savage Nation\\".Another very funny book I recently enjoyed (and you may, too) is \\"No One's Even Bleeding.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Common sense finally revealed!","review":"I read this book in just 2 or 3 days and I must admit that it keeps you reading it more and more. Bill goes on to demonstrate that today's gov't is more preoccupied with usual politics and profit making, rather than truly getting citizens involved in helping this country win the war on terrorism.- He shows the importance of oil independence and its role in our current war and general world affairs- He illustrates that our heroes are not given any respect, contrary to what gov't says- He shows our ignorance as Americans of others in the world- And he creates guidelines for what really needs to be to help the country recover from 9/11 and move onHis sense of humor and satirical nature gives this book an even more lucrative content, however I didnt give it 5 stars as it featured small amt. of facts and stats and etc. to back up his claims and opinions. Although I do agree with almost 100% of what he says."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only Bill Maher Were as Intelligent as He Thought","review":"Then maybe this book would have been worth the purchase price. As it stands, this is more of the same sanctimonious clap trap that grew tired long before his show was cancelled. If you must read it, do yourself a favor - check it out of the library and pocket the dough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Half as Smart as He Thinks He Is","review":"At least this book actually IS politically incorrect, unlike Mahrs mercifully departed show. However, he gets too much credit for that. Where he lives and hangs out-- in Hollywood-- this IS the majority opinion. It might not play in Peoria, but Mahr caters to his audience as much as any politician, and there are enough of them to make him rich, just like the other over rated blowhard, Michael Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-righteous blather","review":"Maher is a pompous jerk that is as arrogant as the conservatives he condemns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Hello!

The account is sombering. There is great characterization. There are high points (the Delta Force rescue, Army SF & SEAL actions) and there are low points (the PJ rescue & Arrowhead presence patrol). Once again the truth the America is almost too-civilized to win a fight against a foe that has a fighting spirit. I hope the author writes again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but its the common sense that sells!!","review":"The thing about Bill that I like is, BOTH sides gets it. No one is left off the hook and I think this is what separates him from scary Dennis Miller (I actually feel sorry for Miller because he is so angry). But anyway, Republicans AND Democrats feel Bill's furor and I like his brand of common sense. He leans a little to the left right now (he's libertarian), but I think it has more to do with his dissatisfaction with Bush's job performance. There are a lot things I agree and disagree with him on (I do agree with him that John McCain would had been a better president than Bush). But the bottom line is he has common sense and is motivated to speak out on what he sees as a dangerous movement in this country to go backwards. That is why he wrote this book.

The book is fun, the prose is simple, and it made my 3 yr old laugh and laugh. It was clever and made its point well. The book is a board book, and durable, but it is also a lift-the-flap book, so it requires supervision so the child doesn't pull the flaps off. That said, ours lasted over 2 years and served us well.I reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTE THIS IS A LIFT THE FLAP BOOK!","review":"Was very surprised this was a lift the flap book as there was no indication of that in the title or descriptions / reviews. I am debating returning it. Pictures are very cute but really repeats the same thing page after page. Does an elephant use the potty? No, A bear, No etc. Flaps are separate pages attatched by 1/8 inch seam which my 2 year old could easily rip off if I don't add more tape. Maybe that is why they list it as for 4yr olds... but most of them would not need this book.

Other reviewers that rated this set poorly should have sent their knives back.I have been using this set for over a year and could not be happier. It is true that there are better cutlery sets, but for a significantly higher price. I have had no problems with my MV-55's nor have other family members who own the same set.

On the side of the box they offer a generous guarantee:If for any reason you are not satisfied with an OXO product, return it for repair, replacement or refund.These set sells at many retailers for $150 or more and they are an excellent value at that price.

The author states on the page for the Superhero book that he is on a mission to write one book for every year alive. He is turning into a book writing machine and it shows.Too much detail about things that don't need to be explained, e.g. I do not care about the history of comic books.Boring writing style.I really wanted to give this book five stars because these type of books make science entertaining and fun to learn about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"Love this book.

Kline says \\"angels\\" (see also p.242 in The Genesis Debate, ISBN-13: 978-0970224507)This is directly against the next verse, Gen. 1:27, \\"So God created man in his own image, in the image of GOD he created him, male and female he created them.\\"There are numerous other instances that Kline shows his tendency to New Age instead of Biblical, Christian, and Reformed Thoughts.

Songs like To Hide A Little Thought, Let Her Go Into the Darkness, and Nothing Can Change This Love are all great. You Must Ask The Heart and City Vs. Country are the best on the album.

Editing isn't that great (you even see a place where the fudged up). He has a couple good fight scenes but that's pretty much it. If you want it because the story sounds interesting, go for it. But don't buy or even watch this movie just for Chan, you'll be disappointed.If you want a good Chan movie, go get Rumble in the Bronx."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT A JACKIE CHAN MOVIE.","review":"First off, let me just say that this was not a Chan movie. He may have directed it, but he doesn't appear in the movie until about 20 minutes in or so. On top of that, he is only in one brief (and not too spectacular) fight scene (the scene that lands him in jail actually) that proved to be one of the few fight scenes in the movie. Sammo Hung fans will also be disappointed to find out that not only does Sammo not have a single fight scene, but that he is, at best, a distant supporting character.Despite the fact that this is a bad Chan movie, it's a fairly entertaining movie in and of itself. Chan fans will pass out when they see what happens to Chan at the end though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a typical Jackie Chan movie","review":"This is not your typical Jackie Chan movie. It is not a comedy, Jackie Chan is not the star and he actually dies at the end. This is a prison movie that steals a lot from Paul Newman's 1960's movie \\"Cool Hand Luke\\", only without the humor. I suggest anyone born in the 70's or 80's rent \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" for comparison. Paul Newman's version is a lot better. \\"The Prisoner\\" also steals a scene from Burt Reynold's \\"The Longest Yard\\"Even though this movie isn't very good, (it has all the prison movie cliches) I liked seeing Jackie Chan expanding his range, he can do serious work.To me, the most interesting thing about this movie is recognizing the scenes stolen from other movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"I honestly did not like this movie.

He thought wrong. This is a terrible film. Bad writing, bad editing, bad acting...the works. If you want to see a good Jackie Chan movie check out Drunken Master, Young Master, Drunken Master 2... I'm a big fan of most of his movies, but if you watch this one you will be disappointed. We all make mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie Chan is the Prisoner, Indeed","review":"I was disappointed with this movie - I was expecting some Kung Fu action centered around a plot, at least any plot. There is no plot in this movie. It's just The Day-To-Day Life In Prison, which soon gets rather boring and one begins to wonder what the point of the movie is. The ending doesn't really match with the rest of the movie - it's like watching two movies in one. Overall, there's not much kung fu action to be had in this movie. There's nearly more gun shootings than necessary and fist-fighting scenes. The dubbing is also the worst I have ever heard. No attempt has been made whatsoever to match the spoken words with the lip action. Sometimes, I wasn't even sure if it was the character speaking, since the mouth was closed most of the time and the tone of voice did not match the character's demeanor.If you need a movie to put you to sleep, this one will do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy Kung-Fu Movie","review":"This cheesy kung-fu prison movie, contrary to the box art, does not \\"star\\" Jackie Chan. Chan and several other Hong Kong actors (like Sammo Hung) reportedly did this as a favour to co-star and producer Jimmy Wang-Yu (\\"One-Armed Swordsman,\\" \\"Fantasy Mission Force\\"). Much of this movie is laughably bad, with goofy dialogue and entire scenes ripped-off from \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" of all things. Jackie Chan is in the movie for about 15 minutes.The DVD is in the aspect ratio of 1.85:1, and it looks reasonably good. The dialogue is dubbed, but it hardly seems to matter in a movie like this. There is a commentary by a martial artist and filmmaker named Phillip Rhee that is okay. His historical insights aren't fabulous, but his anecdotes about some of the films stars are enjoyable. Rounding out the extras are some cast biographies and a trailer (which, deceivingly, shows Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung as being the central characters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"Before deciding to write this review, I REVIEWED other's reviews on Jackie Chan: The Prisoner. One person described this movie as a FIVE star one and kept on saying it was \\"The bomb of a movie\\". Well, I'm here to tell you IT IS DISAPPOINTING (I would use bigger font but can't). JACKIE CHAN ISN\\"T EVEN THE STAR. He's a Co-Star and had NO EFFECT on the movie. The plot......, storyline ........ Storyline was original but............. Acting was OKAY. THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORSE Jackie Chan movie I've ever seen or known. If you are Jackie Chan and are reading the review, I'm SORRY but it............ I would suggest Jackie Chan Fans to get the movies: Operation Condor (First one. Second Sucked),Shanghai Noon (A MUST SEE) Rush Hour (Interesting Movie) and I've heard Drunken Master 2 was good. Anywayz, I'm still a big JACKIE CHAN FAN but hey...Bad Movies exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prisoner (1991)","review":"JACKIE IS ONLY IN 30 MINUTES OUT OF THE WHOLE FILM! Though it is still a good film! it's about this cop who goes undercover in a prison to find out who ordered the assasination of his father-in-law. What he finds instead is a prison system so fraught with abuse that it's hard to tell who is part of an elite group of assigns recruited by the prison warden. THE REAL NEGATIVE POINT ABOUT THIS FILM IS THAT THERE IS NOT A POSSITIVE THING IN ANY CHARACTER IN THE FILM!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Island of Fire","review":"This movie is actually an older HK movie called ISLAND OF FIRE. I saw it in SF Chinatown many years ago. I agree it is not a good place for new Jackie Chan fans to start. It is a grim movie with a very downbeat ending unless they have changed the ending for this DVD version. Still it is a good example of the different types of the movies being produced in HK's \\"Golden Days\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie Chan is not the Prisoner","review":"In this movie, Jackie Chan is not the main character. He is not the Prisoner, but he is a prisoner. This movie is filled with senseless violence and profanity. This movie's title is a classic sellout by people who want to capitalize on the fame of Jackie Chan. This movie is not funny like Jackie Chan's latest movies are. The plot is impossible to follow and filled with things that just dont make sense. Finally, a horrible end to a horrible movie, Jackie and a couple of other escaped inmates are gunned down while trying to escape, only the main character makes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A JACKIE CHAN MOVIE","review":"Not a bad movie for this genre, but the title of the movie (\\"Jackie Chan is the Prisoner\\") is a Big Fat Lie. This is not a Jackie Chan movie -- he's just one of many in the cast. Maybe it's naive to let such bold face lying (marketing) bother me, but it still does. We got the movie, actually believing that it was what Columbia/Tristar Studios promised it would be ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Jackie Chan movie.","review":"This is not a Jackie Chan movie. Jackie Chan is in it, that's for sure, but the extended cast of various action stars makes him just another character.He's not the main character, not that there really is a main character, it seems. The plot, tangled as it is, seems to be about some prison that pretends to execute people and then uses them as assassins. But we only hear about this during the first few minutes and then at the \\"climax\\" at the end of the movie where Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan, Andy Lau and that other guy run around an airport shooting a bunch of people with not much reason. Most of the movie deals with innumerable subplots that serve only to drag out this ordeal.Yes, Jackie Chan shoots people.So we have here a movie with Jackie Chan where you only see Jackie Chan fight a couple times (the highlights of this movie) and then a bizarre climax where pretty much everyone dies.This movie seems far, far longer than the 96 minutes of my life it has stolen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Jackie Chan is not the main character, he isn't even dubbed in his own voice. Minimal fight scenes, and the fight scenes they had could've been done by any acter. This is unlike other Jackie Chan films, the fight scenes just aren't fun. I wouldn't spend my money on this, instead save your money and buy Drunken Master, or Who Am I, two other Jackie Chan dvds that are worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This is my first review, but I just Haaaad to say something. Number one, as everyone has stated, Jackie Chan is only one minor prisoner. Number two, there are TWO Tony Leungs, and the Tony Leung who was in 'Gorgeous' is Tony Leung Chiu Wai, the Tony Leung in The Prisoner is Tony Leung Ka Fai (from 'The Lover'). I can't believe somebody didn't do their research. And number three, you would think that with such a distinguished cast as Jackie Chan, Andy Lau, Tony Leung (Ka Fai) and Sammo Hung, that a better film would be the result. What we actually do have is a muddled, confusing mess. If you like any of the actors involved, or are looking for a good representation of Hong Kong cinema, or just a good action yarn - don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Offer Jackie Couldn't Refuse, But Maybe You Should","review":"Bottom line: Jackie Chan owed Jimmy Wang Yu a favor, but apparently so do a lot of people.

He's still writing songs, and it's a shame that his newer tunes aren't more widely available. Still, the songs on \\"Seven Days\\" are gems. My favorite among them is \\"There's the Cross\\", a contemporary hymn if ever there was one. A number of other tunes on this CD also reflect Brett's growing interest in writing worship songs that are better-written than most! Brett is one of the better songwriters out there in Christian music. Do yourself a favor and get to know his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"I have had this CD for about 2 years now and it has inspired my own musicand style.

Totally worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and Cute","review":"Like it or not, this book is realistic. Children, \\"good or bad\\" can relate to this book. There is a David (boy or girl) in every school. For parents who receive calls at home that their little one is acting up once again, this book is a relief that they're not alone. In the real world, no young child is perfect like some adults want them to be, and just because they act out or don't listen at school doesn't necessarily mean they're a brat. David is obviously young and is simply learning about the world on his own without his parents holding his hand in the \\"big boy\\" setting of school. For the poor reviews of this book, I ask: Can't children just be children? Why take this book so seriously? I'm a mother of two sons. I think I might know what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not judge it by adult standards.","review":"The book is written for kids. My two children laugh during theentire book.

The illustration is made just for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing \\"Sequel\\" book","review":"I read this sequel to \\"No, David\\" with great anticipation and excitement. \\"No, David\\" is one of the all time favorite books that I love to read both for myself and to read at my child's elementary school. The final page, where Davids' mother affirms her love *always* makes me shed at least a tear or two.\\"David Goes to School\\" is NOT such a book. While the author means well, this volume is not anywhere nearly as fresh as his first David book. Indeed, I would say that it borders on being pretentious.If anyone would like another Shannon book to add to their library of childrens lit I would recommend \\"A Bad Case of Stripes\\".

No matter how many books we read them each night, they ask or us to read this one before bed. I got online looking for more books by David Shannon as this is the first one we've gotten. I intend to purchase them some for Christmas. As for the reviewers who said this book could teach bad habits, I disagree.

David!\\". They start laughing on the first page, and are delighted all the way through. This second book just isn't funny for this age group, with the exception of just one or two pages. I think that my children, who thoroughly enjoy the naughty antics in \\"No! David!\\", and probably relate to them, just don't understand what David is up to in his \\"big kid in school\\" setting (arriving after the bell, cutting in the lunch line, having to use the rest room repeatedly, etc). If possible, borrow the book from the library and see if your child appreciates David's new situations before purchasing the book. For an older child, it may be one to read over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all Davids (and other children)!","review":"My son, David, is a big fan of David Shannon and was excited to find a second book after Shannon's \\"NO, David\\". \\"No, David\\" was one of the first books that my son could read and he loves the pictures.

After the initial 'Anne' books, a sequel was squeezed in between this book and \\"Anne's House of Dreams\\". I think LMM was under pressure to write sequels, so after this the books are either average or poor, excepting \\"Rilla of Ingleside\\". In this book, Anne is more mature. She leaves Prince Edward and heads to Redmond college. There, tension arises between her and Gilbert--one wants friendship, the other love. Anne is getting a taste of living truly independent, away from home, but she has wonderfully amusing new friends to help her. Love, humor, and drama make this a very satisfying book indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this story tells us that udo what u think is right.","review":"This book is about how Anne went to Redmond Collage which is a very rare thing for people in Avonlea.

She of course went back to Avonlea during vacations/breaks. She really enjoyed this. She went through many proposals, but she had to say no to everyone of them.

It's tradition. And, this sequel is just as good as the first two. This author, L.M. Montgomery, was so skillful, it's as if she poured out a beautiful soul onto the pages, fully alive and full of wonder, inviting us, her kindred spirits, to join her in her imaginings and adventures.We're halfway through Anne of Avonlea now, and can't wait to start Anne of the Island next. Nobody wrote characters more real. There is no way to fully experience the richness of these works except by reading them, or hearing them read. Movies can never do them justice, as good as they can be.Yes, Anne still delivers thrills, scrapes and wonders after all of these years, and they're just as fresh now as they ever were."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book too much.","review":"This book wasn't very romantic in my opinion.

I loved just about everything about it, especially Sharon den Adel's powerful vocals. As I often do; if I really like an artist, I'll pick up their entire back catalog, but it was a mistake, at least with this album. \\"Mother Earth\\" is very boring, without the rock influences of \\"Unforgiven\\". But the worst part is Sharon's voice. It sounds like she's trying to imitate a fairy princess, and the music writing shares this influence. Top-notch instrumentals don't begin to make up for this lack of verve.

My friend had me listen to clips of it; I didn't figure it would be that great, seeing that my standards for female singers have been set very high(with Lisa Gerrard, Tarja Turunen, and Candice Night),but my mind was instantly ensnared by her captivating voice. Sharon Den Adel's voice is beautiful;she has one of those voices that could make a grown man cry (and almost did). She is truely an underground metal empress. The atmosphere that the instruments create fit perfectly with her voice. I don't know how it would be officially categoized (power metal, gothic metal, new age metal? Certainly not doom metal.)If your musical taste for female led bands are above the shallow pop junk of Evanescence, buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply beautiful.","review":"After hearing the music of Within Temptation, I have not been able to appreciate any other music as much as I previously had.Powerful vocals and the contrasting clash between the male and female voices provide a backdrop for the incredible fusion of melodic and metallic that is Within Temptation.From the songs of heavier Goth/metal to the almost classical beauty of the lighter songs, the natural sounds will leave you breathless.I'm spreading word of their music to everyone I know, and I haven't met a single person yet, whether they primarily listen to oldies, classical, punk, or anything, who hasn't loved it.Somewhere beyond Enya, Evanesence, and Rancid lies Within Temptation, and this album is their grand masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been waiting for this CD.","review":"I love this CD!

Sharon does a fantastic job on that song, but otherwise, her voice is just outright annoying! I listened to the CD three times thinking I wasn't giving Within Temptation a fair shake, but I couldn't make myself like it! There are two major elements that turned me against this band. First, Sharon tends to sound a great deal like Alanis Morrisett, very annoying for me! Secondly, the music just sounds watered down, again, very annoying! If you want a great female led band, then give Nightwish a shot. Purchase Nightwish's Century Child, and you won't be disappointed!

The soloists are each fine in their own rights, but as is the case with every recording something works better in one or the other version, and one might prefer some of the soloists from other recordings, however, here the parlando-scenes between the witch and her suitors are really funny, and the duet between Vakula and Oksana clearly conveys the frustrations of the two lovers, who cannot handle their mutual attraction.I warm enormously to this fairy-tale opera, which reflects so much of Tchaikovsky's russian spirit.

I'd forgotten how funny, if predictable, it was and Hugh Grant is a lot of fun in it. The plot concerns a dapper Englishman who marries into the mob, and gets to meet all the inlaws - what follows is mad cap comedy, kind of along the lines of meet the parents.This really is a funny film, and perhaps Liz Hurley should produce another comedy.That's right - Liz Hurley produced it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grant & Caan Lift This Lighthearted Mob Spoof","review":"This was an entertaining comedy, similar to several other films I've seen in which an innocent-appearing nice guy gets caught up in the middle of a mob family. (i.e. Matthew Broderick in \\"The Freshman.\\")In this film, it's Hugh Grant who winds up in mobster James Caan's clan. The latter isn't known for his comedy but he's good at it. Sometimes just the facial expressions on Caan's face brought out big laughs with me.Joe Viterelli is perfect for any Mafia-type story, as is Burt Young. It was a little strange, though, to see Young look like such a shriveled up old man. Jeanne Tripplehorn provides the romantic interest in here.My only complaints were too much usage of God's name in vain, especially for a comedy, and the typical on again-off again marriage plans you've seen so many times in movies for many decades. Overall, however, a good lighthearted comedy that should please a lot of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't recommend to everyone","review":"Finally I suddenly realized why I was attracted by this movie so much. If you also regard social intercourse(I mean, the composition of every single expression and reaction, details of body language, etc) as a kind of real art, one of the highest achievement of our(your?) civilization, you will enjoy this movie like me. This is not a meaningful movie(under it's exquisite appearance it is almost a little superficial and dishonest but not obvious), but it is nearly perfect on it's topic. To me it is extremely funny though I prefer to use \\"exciting\\" and \\"interesting\\". Every joke isn't new but they've expressed themselves thoroughly. There's a key word: maintain one's composure. Another key word: unconcerned. Adding Hugh Grant's performence(innocent and compliant but more and more nervous and trustless), oh! my! ...It is really touching my heart at it's every moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cast wasted on a mediocre script","review":"Hugh Grant had a hard act to follow after 'Notting Hill' and this film didn't do the trick. Grant's comedic talent and dry wit were not enough to help this inane script. Like this year's other mafia spoof, \`Analyze This', this comedy about a proper English auctioneer marrying into the mob isn't sure whether it is trying to be serious or slapstick. Unfortunately it fails at both.Grant provides the film's only redemption, scattering laughs sparsely through the film through sheer talent. Jeanne Tripplehorn looks terrific in a red slip and did a credible job of making this resemble a romantic comedy. James Caan's dramatic talent was wasted in his vacuous role as the prospective father in law. Probably the best performance was turned in by Burt Young playing the serious don as Uncle Vito.I rated this film a 5/10. The film has its moments, but not enough of them. For Hugh Grant fans, it's worth a look. Otherwise you might want to pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mickey Blue Eyes","review":"This movie is probably one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Hats off to Hugh Grant.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it when you have nothing else to do","review":"\\"Mickie Blue Eyes\\" is a mob-style comedy that doesn't do a very good job of covering either the mob or the comdey part of its genre. I personally enjoy James Caan and got this movie just because of him and the preview. This is not one of James Caan's better movies and the preview apparently had all the funny material from the movie within it (once you've seen the preview you have pretty much seen the only parts of the movie that were any good)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"A movie with a script that has a potential ! It is promising a certain degree of entertainment but Later on the movie bores the heck out! The Mob family concept in the movie is far beyond being entertaining. In other words I'd definately Rent the DVD then Buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MASTERFUL NOTHINGNESS","review":"Hugh Grant is not too offensive in this role. He is not too cutesy here, and that is something for which to be thankful. In the film Grant's character Michael is engaged to marry Gina, the daughter of an Italian-American mobster (played by James Caan). Michael is a successful auctioneer, and after his engagement to Gina, Gina's father starts using Michael and his connections to the art world to launder money. Soon the FBI is onto the scheme (with Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson as a particularly funny FBI officer). Michael attempts to hide these dealings from Gina (Michael of course did not want to get involved with all of this illicit activity in the first place but was railroaded-it is the mafia after all). When Gina finds out their relationship crumbles. An accident causes even more problems, potentially fatal ones. Overall this is not a great movie and not even particularly funny. However, you will be able to sit through it and maybe get some entertainment value from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugh Grant Provides Lots of Light-hearted Fun !!!","review":"Whenever I find an unfavorable review for this film it really mystifies me. This is one of my favorite comedies!! Hugh Grant does his usual excellent job since this story serves as a PERFECT vehicle for his familiar cinematic personna. There are definitely some unforgettable scenes here...I'm talking about the botched up marriage proposal of course, and who can forget the part where James Caan has to teach Grant how to talk like a gangster?! There are soooo many laughs-- never a dull moment and a great bargain for such a fun movie! If you like Grant, this DVD is a must have! If you don't, then you cannot recognize a truly charismatic performer when you see one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie worth watching!","review":"Definitely a great romantic comedy, Mickey Blue Eyes, brings to the screen the story of an Englishman working at an auction house in NYC who proposes to his girlfriend of three months only to find out that her family is part of the mob. Things become a bit more complicated when he believes that he can handle the situation...Hugh Grant, Jeanne Tripplehorn, James Caan, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!In short, Mickey Blue Eyes is a movie worth watching and even though it is not quite as good as Nine Months or Notting Hill, it is definitely a keeper! 4 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, intelligent and totally outrageous","review":"I nearly fell on the floor laughing the first time I saw this movie and the only thing that stopped me from rolling around on the floor was the sticky soda and week-old popcorn littering the theatre floor.

I was honestly ready for it to end for quite some time before it did. Micky Blue Eyes didn't seem to know whether or not it wanted to be a comedy or if it wanted to be serious. The film was confusing, too coincidental, silly, and unbelievable. The cast was all decent in their roles though. Some people may get a kick out of Micky Blue Eyes, but to me it wasn't that captivating. There's a funny moment here and there, but that was rare. I managed to sit through the whole film; so it wasn't completely bad in other words, but it did have some flaws that I've already mentioned. Try something else. I actually give this 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good, not good at all","review":"Mmmmm, yes Hugh plays a bumbling English cliche. And guess what? He falls in love with an American! Wow.

I have to add a review, because contrary to most reviews I read on this site, I found this book extremely difficult to get any useful information out of. The examples are not practical, when they provide a sample program they totally disect it in to a long-winded discussion with much more detail than is needed. They take about six pages to go through a ten line program.If you have some programming experience in another language and just need a reference (as I did), this is NOT the book to buy! I recommend \\"C: How to Program\\" by Deitel & Deitel, which I have been using instead of this stupid book through the duration of my course.Maybe this might be halfway useful if you have never programmed before and need a really slow baby-steps book, but I really believe that it is not a good C reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money; Buy Something Else","review":"The book is terrible.

Yes, I too first thought it was terrible because it is NOT a 21 Days for Morons type of book. This book covers 95% of everything there is to know about C. It is all there. My 3rd ed is extremely well worn. There is a reason this book is chosen by universities. It has real, useful code. If you were to program up all the examples in this book, you'd have yourself a nice little library of functions. Multi-dimensional dynamic arrays, numerical methods, data structures.

Bear in mind that this was the only book I used to learn C, but I can say I am pleased. Coming off the hideously lyrical SICP book, I found this took a good approach to learning C, instead of trying to wade through the all theoretics in complete detail, you are taught \\"how to program\\" in Chapter 1, and once the reader is on their feet then you are taught how to really program in C! I was totally satisfied with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Scholarly","review":"It's hard to choose books like this... seems like a lot to choose from. I finally got it, and began to work through the exercises. It is well written, and VERY thorough. It was tough, as I am not trained in mathematics; I still ground away until I finally 'hit the wall' after about 300 pages. So I wrote a lot of programs, and learned a lot, but I still would not recommend this to those who don't have a nearly university-level math background.

If you can program at all, this isn't the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buying my second copy","review":"I got this originally for an advanced class in C when I had already been programming in it for a few years. I had been using K&R; as the bible but K&R; is a little too terse for me and I needed some examples. I have been programming in C for 20 years but I have a terrible memory and always need to refer to some part of it for syntax and usage. This book is just right for me.It is so useful I keep it with me all the time. All my friends in the lab were borrowing it so it got so dog-eared I threw it out and bought a second.It not only covers basic and advanced C, but it also has some data structures with linked lists, stacks, and queues in programs that actually compile and work. I also use the little bit they have on the differences with C++. You need another book if you really want to get into data structures or C++ but this will get you through the most common situations. Very useful indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on C","review":"This book is meant for readers who already know some C programming. For those who are absolute beginners, just find some website that gives an introduction to the C language and then buy this book!

If you really want to 'understand' C and take your first steps to be a better C programmer, buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best reference book in C programming","review":"Simply the best book for both beginner and professinal programmer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes you to the next level","review":"Unlike some other syntax-oriented books, this book goes into some great non-toy code, for things such as resource scheduling and binary and general trees. I have spent about 18 hours on the exercises per chapter, and I feel very confident about my knowledge of C. But as the book itself says, if you haven't programmed much, start with an easier book on C."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've found to learn C","review":"Although there are more than a couple typos in my printing of the 4th edition, this is by far the best book on C programming I've used.

I have all the CD's these guys have put out and EAST SIDE SOUL continues to my favorite of the bunch. This album was produced by Cesar Rosas of Los Lobos. The album starts off with \\"FUN & LAUGHTER\\" which lets you know that's what THE BLAZERS music is all about. Then a few tracks later you get a latino classic \\"CUMBIA DEL SOL\\", but this is done BLAZERS style it's outstanding. My favorite song on the album \\"DANCE THE NIGHT AWAY\\". The last track \\"Ooh-Poo-Pah-Doo\\" is a great song where THE BLAZERS play off their fans during live performaces and it gets the crowd going. This CD starts off hot and leaves you BLAZIN -----"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal","review":"Rather lame. Not much to write about or listen to.

It's like cutting Godzilla out of a Godzilla movie. What's left? A hot video becomes a boring DVD because these morons think they can improve the original movie by slicing out most of what the viewers want to see.

Get the video, or wait until these jackasses wake up and release the original uncut version on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD version of Sexual Malice","review":"The DVD version is \\"R\\" and most of the totaly hot scenes are much edited.

Even though not all of her students treat her with total respect, Anne still believes that \\"there is good in every person if you can find it\\" (pg. 29). She always seems to make out the best of unpleasant situations that come her way. She takes the time to look past the negative subject and searches for an optimistic point instead. This book is full of Anne's ability to handle things with a joyful attitude (, for example with the unfortunate conditions of Marilla's eyesight). I would greatly recommend this to all who enjoy experiencing cheerful and humorous feelings while reading, especially kids and young teens and those who have read and enjoyed the first book in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne's Optimism Lives On!","review":"Anne Shirley, now a teacher, has still got that admirable enthusiasm and optimistic spirit within her that keeps the reader's spirit up and interested.

I've read the first five books many times. But this one falls quite flat. LMM spends about a page every chapter describing the flowers and the trees and whatnot, which gets old fast. Additionally, I feel like I as a reader got demoted. While Anne and Gilbert have their lives, the reader gets relegated to the kiddie table to see what hi-jinx the children are up to. I'm sure the children are great, but I've followed Anne from eleven years old, and I want to stay with her. I felt condescended to.The quilting chapter bored me utterly to death. The other characters that were introduced came and went too quickly...except for Aunt Mary Maria, I felt cheated out of getting to know anyone. The whole book is too much telling, not enough showing. Overall..it was just a struggle to get through, which I only managed because I think it's a shame not to read the whole series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book for all ages!","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and loved it. Now I'm 21 and recendly read it again, and I liked it even more. The plot is great. The characters are alive, and the writing is superb.A must for anyone that wants to laugh, love and cry with the town from Avonlea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this novel so dull?","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Anne of Green Gables, but Anne of Avonlea is devoid of all that made the first lively and captivating. We rarely see the world through the descriptive lens of Anne's eyes and colorful words in the second book as we did with the first. Instead we are bludgeoned over the head with narrative bucolic scenery after narrative bucolic scenery. Gone is the tension between Anne and Gilbert and gone is the hilarity of Anne's growing pains, and no sympathy is created for the twins Anne and Marilla have adopted. It's as if Montgomery has dumped them into the story and left them there to fend for themselves. I am only halfway through, but the narrative has become so tedious and dull with scenery and very little story, that I may not be able to wade through what should have been edited and rewritten."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great novel","review":"I enjoyed reading Anne of Ingleside. The author captures the life of Anne as a wife, friend, mother, and relative. Anne does so many things for her kids by giving them love, care, and understanding. You can almost feel Anne's happiness, fear, anger, and doubts in her life. Therefore, I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to read something wonderful. I sure loved it from the beginning to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"Like the first Anne book, Anne of Green Gables, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. And though many think these books sentimental mush, I seemed to garner a lot from reading them.They teach me to see God in new and exciting ways - to see God more in Nature and the world around me that He has created - to look for the best in all people I meet, especially those who are hard to like, ie Mrs. Rachael Lynd and Mr. Harrison. We have to learn to see past the exterior to see the person inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best series I've ever read!!!","review":"This is one of a heartwarming series about the life of an orphan who is one of the most real characters I have ever read about! I recommend the whole series this book included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is one of my favorite books by Lucy Maud Montgomery (or any author for that matter) and I've read most of her works. Each chapter reads like an individual short story and the tales are beautiful and funny. A must-read for any Montgomery fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"It seems that Montgomery didn't know what to fill this book with. There are some nice stories about Anne's children (who are very sweet kids indeed), but there is also the extremely boring chapter about the gossipy Ladies' Aid meeting, or the too lengthy presence of the personage of aunt Mary Maria. Anne herself has turned into a common housewife, and there is nothing left of the good naughty little girl with the great imagination or the clever and ambitious young woman. Gilbert is a doctor, Anne is \\"Mrs Doctor\\", and we almost forget about the earlier school and college competions between both of them, where they are equal and both interesting. Reading the previous books one could think Anne would become a famous writer, not just the shadow of man she loves. She is really a wonderful mother and wife, but she could be these things without losing her personality too."},{"rating":"1","title":"anne of ingleside","review":"Since this book was in hardcover, I was assuming, in the lack of a date or description, that it was an earlier edition. What I got was a cheap-looking modern edition that I never would have bought if I had had information as to the publication date, which was never listed. I don't like being exploited like this. Books should be advertised with dates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne of the Island","review":"In Anne of the Islnad, the character that I have grown to love and become familiar with, grows up and moves on to college. With college, comes new friends and new romances too. The only part that continued to annoy me was how Anne was rejecting everybody who asked her to marry. However, Anne learns through her failures and to my contentment, ended up with the one person whose heart truly belongs to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"a lovely book-though not as beautiful as the other Anne books. I was terribly disappointed with the names of Anne's children. Imagine naming your child after your sur name!(Shirley). And it seems so stuck-up somehow to name your child after yourself(Anne or Nan) I think Montgomery could have been a bit more original with regard to the names.I like their system of naming your children after people you love-like James,Walter,Rilla,Diana. So why on earth could not Anne do the same with Nan and Shirley? Otherwise quite an entertaining book- I'm a HUGE fan of all Montgomery books and my personal favourite is Rilla of Ingleside.Makes for good reading and the language is flawless and absolutely beautiful...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"The narrator is the worst; she makes this book imposable to listen too. At first it was funny, but then I thought about how much money I wasted on the book, and how I knew I could never listen to it, then it was not funny anymore. Save your money, otherwise it is \\"your money or your sanity.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This classic story is ruined by the wooden voice of the narrator, making it very hard to listen to. All of L. M. Montgomery's characters are so vibrant, and to hear this story read in such a deadpan fashion is awful. Even Anne sounds dull, and that's hard to achieve when you're telling the story of one of literatures most lively characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne of Avonlea","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Anne is a teenager becoming a young lady and she undergoes many changes and her experiences are funny and meaningful to her.

I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said.I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books. At least the movies keep your interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Lucy Maud, Hate the Painfully Inept Narrator","review":"I was so disappointed with this book! I was driving from North Carolina to Austin TX, and Anne of Green Gables narrated by Barbara Caruso was great (even though she pronounced Avonlea as Aay-von-lee instead of Ah-von-lee). This one was terrible!! The woman speaking has random inflection, putting the wrong emph-A-sis on the wrong syll-A-ble, if you will. It completely sounds as if she's reading words that she doesn't understand the meaning of. And the voices she uses for characters! My sister and I literally tried to talk each other into listening at least to the first chapter, to see if we could adjust, but we had to turn it off. It was unbearably painful to listen to. Who hired that lady?? Her voice itself is nice enough, but good lord was her inflection awful! We chose to listen to fuzzy radio stations through the last three states rather than subject ourselves to this version of the book. Spare yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jump on This!","review":"This is the one! I think that they have finally found their true sound, and I am impressed! But, that is why they were chosen to do the soundtrack for \\"Charlie's Angels\\". I don't know how the film will rate, But if it is anything like this album, it will be a hit as well.

I docked it a star because I thought the songs didn't flow into each other very well, and because some of the synthesizer sounds are dated. Nitpicking (and it is nitpicking) aside, if you like Parliament, you'll like this, and if you liked Parliament but always thought they could have been 20% jazzier, you'll love this. In addition to those elements, Bernie throws some rock, classical, hip-hop, and gospel (and maybe other stuff I haven't picked out yet) into the soup.Among the many guest artists: George Clinton, Bootsy Collins, Bill Laswell, Maceo Parker, Tony Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bumping","review":"anybody that comes out the P' Funk Mob has the juice.and Bernie Worrell is no exception.he is scary talented.from funk to classical.this disc reflects that&more.he is a Keyboard Genius.it's cool having Bootsy&George on this set.a real treat for Funadelic Funkateers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"This bottle opener is excellent.

Not on this recording. If anything, she gained feeling and emotional content due to living life.You would be hard pressed to put together a better group of sympathetic musicians from this period to back her, and to play such GORGEOUS solos.BEN WEBSTER, HARRY EDISON, BARNEY KESSEL, JIMMY ROWLES, RED MITCHELL, ALVIN STOLLER - Wow! These gentlemen were (are) a singers' dream to record with. Sinatra should have hired similar personnel when he formed REPRISE, but this is getting off track here.Like K.O.B.(for instrumental jazz), THIS RECORDING belongs near the topof anyone's Vocal collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Temple Movie","review":"Although I am not a special fan of Shirley Temple movies, I must say that this one was quite appealing and is the best of her movies that I have seen (I've seen most). Temple is unfailingly cute as the little orphan, and the romantic storyline is engaging. The movie does, of course, border on corny (as do all her films), but it's other merits overshadow that and it's quite entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"The sound and picture quality are terrible! Looks and sounds like an amatuer video. It is a real shame that such a great man is portrayed in an awful DVD. Don't buy this DVD. It is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Insights","review":"I rarely buy new books for above $20 for casual reading so this book was a venture out on a limb, and it was worth it.The book is filled with a lot of infomration about his service as SEC chief, and Levitt describes some of the unseen risks in investing, taking investment advice, and believing the numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much needed infomation","review":"Arthur Levitt tells of his years as Chaiman of the SEC and some of the changes he sought to level the playing field for the small investor. That he met strong resistance every step of the way is not surprising. Those who made their money and maintained their power by keeping public investors in the dark were not about to allow Levitt to change the old way of doing business. He persisted and progress was made under his administration. Even more changes have been made since he retired from the SEC as the debacle of Enron and others made it apparent that the old system no longer worked.This well-written tale deserves its best-seller status."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is more aggressive than the content.","review":"The book is full of inside stories of corrupt corporations and the SEC's involvement to correct them. As far as any portfolio use, chapter ten is 26 pages of 401(k)tips. Otherwise there was nothing truly useful for investing. I am self-employed, so this one chapter was of no help to me either. No disrespect to Arthur Levitt and his understanding of the market but this is more of a non-fiction or autobiography than a guidebook to \\"Take On The Street.\\" If you like direct and helpful books such as the \\"All About ....\\" series of books by Richard A. Ferri or William Bernstein's style, you should overlook this one and it's similarly named clone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hybrid Book That Leaves Much To Be Desired","review":"There are a few good moments in this book and I must confess I am only half way through it. But what blew me away was what I read in the acknowledgements. Mr. Levitt, a former stockbroker, credits Warren Buffett with informing him about the core of broker comepensation and mutual funds compensation. Gee, didn't Mr.Levitt know the core of these issues when he was at the SEC? It just strikes me funny that a long time vetern of the securities industry would tip his hat to Buffett on such basic issues. Outside of this the book is a gathering of books that combines the worst in biography, advice and expose. Mr. Levitt admits that his poweres were limited by Senators like Phil Gramm, but his book is also limited with few insights worth paying for. Two stars for the insider scoop, but it is really a one-star book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow For Motion","review":"Take on the Street bogs down in detail, which makes reading it a lesson in patience. It is often hard to see the forest for the trees. One of the most interesting facts in the book was how Levitt got his job. He says he contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Clinton campaign. It seems that the best person for any job in Washington is the person who raises the most cash!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pitt makes me really miss Levitt","review":"Chances are anyone who rates this book as a 1 is a broker, member of AICPA, or serves on the Senate Banking committee. I am an investor who is very concerned about the greedily protected lack of transparency in the way public companies report their earnings or lack thereof, so I am giving this excellent book a 5.The book is useful because it describes how securities markets really work. It also functions as practical investment advice which details what is happening with your money after it leaves your hands. It should be required reading in MBA programs. Finally, voters will be much more informed about how Congress, through its protection of accountants, investment bankers, and brokers, is interfering with the efficient allocation of capital in the US economy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sales Job","review":"Page after page says Levitt is like a God when it comes to helping average investors. Give me a break. This is such one-sided reporting that it made me ill to read. A balanced approach has been thrown out the window for a PR campaign filled with errors. Destined for the bargin bin!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half A Book","review":"The first half of the book was very informative on the inner workings of Wall Street. The last half seemed to fall into more of a political mode. Mr.Levitt allowed his democratic leanings to show when he started to blame republicans for his failures. The democrats were given forgiveness for \\"unwittingly\\" pressuring him. Last but not least, the book ends with a self serving letter from none other than Tom Daschle.Read this book if you can get it for half price."},{"rating":"1","title":"fox in the henhouse","review":"It is pretty hard to stomach that someone who knew just how serious investors were being huckstered through the boom, and was the one person who could have brought some honesty into the picture, didn't. Now he wants to sell his advice. I'd rather believe Abbie Hoffman (Never trust anyone over thirty)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Clinton stooge who looked the other way","review":"Nothing in the book about the dot.bom scam which was the biggest financial scam in history. $500 billion stolen from the public. The scam sucked the little guys in on IPO date when the shares were traded by investment banks and hedge funds to the moon. The whole thing was bogus. Where were you Mr. Levitt and your predecessor Mr. Waldman during Clinton's reign of terror? Playing golf? Giving lectures?What nerve. Millions of small investors got hosed on your watch and you have the nerve to publish this drivel. Nothing changes on Wall Street. Always a scam going to screw the little guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Must Be Kidding","review":"This is a shallow work that is no way a help to investors. It should have never been placed into print. I lost thousands of dollars in the market and if the author had told investors this information while he was in office I, along with many others, would have been saved."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Notice","review":"This book is so dark I could not see any light.

The quality is quite disappointing, from microscopic, threaded pins that hold the bulbs/covers in place (NOT), to inconsistent fitting of the actual LED bulb prongs into their bases.

If you have not seen the film I do not want to give the plot away. This is an intelligent mystery distinguished by witty dialogue, stylistic photography and production design and excellent acting. Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews and Vincent Price are perfectly cast. Preminger being more of the technician and perfectionist assembled all these talents to produce this genuine classic.

His biting tongue, never better. Jean Tierney, beautiful, sexual, confident as Laura. Then first, middle and last, the haunting music of the theme of LAURA. If you haven't seen it, you must.

The extras are awesome, especially the Biography special for Ms. Tierney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laura is Perfect for Mystery Fans","review":"There's nothing more fun than an old film noir on a rainy evening, a bunch of junk food - maybe Dots or Crows - and a dark, quiet house. Make it a double feature with Gilda or Out Of The Past, and you can avoid the stultifying bilge of reality TV. Who needs to be reminded that people are vain, greedy, and stupid in the present when you can see ruthless, beautiful, and greedy people in film noir and actually be entertained?"},{"rating":"2","title":"More contemporary than it appears","review":"As I pen this, the DVD is not yet out. The 5-stars are for the movie itself. Anyone who has spent the 80's and 90's in an urban professional environment knows what is going on in this tale set in 50's Manhattan. This would make an interesting remake: Laura clearly was a woman \\"up to stuff\\" that would probably be portrayed a bit more graphically today. She had her \\"male friends,\\" obviously, but what would be blatant on today's screen is only hinted at here. As the prissy Waldo Lydeker (Clifton Webb) puts it to Laura (Gene Tierney): \\"You always felt that a hard body was the mark of a man...I hope you have a perfectly earthy relationship.\\" Clear enough for you?This film is truly a perfect noir...but a noir with a hint of velvet. I eagerly await the DVD, which I will watch (if not from the bathtub, a la Waldo Lydeker), then with a VERY cold martini and canape. I HIGHLY suggest you ALL do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"who dun it\\" ever","review":"The acting is great, the story line is unpredictable and overall a great nail biter. I love the old classics because they provide suspense without all the gore of present day movies. If you love classic murder mystery this is the movie for you. This movie keeps you guessing until the closing minutes. The cast is superb and the acting definitely 5 stars. If you have not seen this movie and you are a true murder mystery buff, you will not be disappointed with this classic. This is my all time favorite movie! Glad it is available on DVD, I wore out my VHS version!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true \\"noir\\" film","review":"I don't think this film should be labelled as \\"film noir\\". Its main characters are extremely wealthy Manhattan residents who overdo the \\"rich snob\\" act. Most of the scenes take place in apartment sets that look more appropriate to an Astaire film. While Gene Tierney is truly beautiful to watch, she fails to convey much of a sense of a femme fatale. When you first see her acting in a Clifton Webb flashback, she is way too \\"goody two shoes\\" to support a noir film. Speaking of Webb, neither he nor Vincent Price is at all convincing as a man who might successfully compete for a beautiful woman's attention. Frankly, both of them act more like caricatures of gay New Yorkers than as romantic leads. You might as well write a movie script that has Felix Unger as the prime suspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Overrated.","review":"Viewed: 10/12Rate: 310/12: Laura is overrated with the capital letters of OhiO. The film is done with very little intelligence, and the characters are thoroughly obnoxious and mostly jackasses. After fifteen minutes, I was watching the time. Ten minutes later, I was thinking of what to do the next day to run my errands. Five minutes later, I fell asleep. No way that the stupid detective (what an idiot he was in trying to solve the mystery and for letting Laura to be unprotected and revealed afterwards) will end up kissing Laura. How many packs of cigarettes and gallons of alcohol did everybody consume during the film production? My goodness, had anyone told Vincent Price that he couldn't act? All in all, Laura is one of the most convoluted films noir I've seen with the most predictable who-dun-it suspect, and, in fact, it's not noir by any means. Just give me Sunset Boulevard any time of the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously overrated","review":"Another classic movie that isn't. The acting isn't all that great, especially Vincent Price miscast and unconvincing as the movie's dandy; I didn't believe for a moment that a real Laura would have ever had any interest in him. And the moment we learn that Laura falls for the cop, Dana Andrew's Lt. McPherson, is a true groaner. Even Gene Tierney doesn't really impress. Yes, she's beautiful. But she is also stuck in a movie with two love interests that don't work; there are _no_ memorable scenes in this movie involving her. Last, but definitely not least, the murder mystery is at most mediocre.So what generates the high interest and ratings for this movie? One has to suppose it is a period piece, one that really worked in its day. Tierney wears one dress that must have been a serious wow'er back in the 40s. And perhaps the music is as good as some reviewers suggest. In sum, even so, count this one as seriously overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"Plot falls together nicely, but one can easily figure the culprit with a little concentration. If one can get over the musical theme which is played incessantly over and over and over... one might be inclined to rate the film higher. I couldn't and won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't this supposed to be out on DVD last November?","review":"I ordered this DVD early LAST YEAR, and it is yet to be released. There are so many mediocre if not downright awful films that are always being released onto video and DVD, yet this film, which is truly one of the best classics of all time, is still not available. What is Fox doing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stinks...point blank and period.","review":"Film noir? Hardly. At least one other reviewer down there hit the nail on the head. This movie is just absolutely horrible. At an absolutely bare-bones minimum, give me anything by Bogart/Bacall. Better yet, give me something along the lines of Lady from Shanghai or anything by Welles. This is just trite, over-acted trash. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with my DVD set","review":"I wasn't told that the DVD I was to purchase could be not compatible with my DVD set. Now I know there are several zones and a DVD readable by USA devices doesn't work in Europe sets. Too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film Noir at its best with a great cast and a surprise ending!","review":"Laura (1944) So Dana Andrews falls for Gene Tierney after seeing her portrait. Love at first sight? The problem is, he's a cop working on a murder case and she's the victim. Or is she? So begins one of Hollywood film noir's earliest classics. Clifton Webb is the true star in this hefty slice of suspense as the lovestruck, yet sardonic narrator. Film noir dominated 40's and 50's cinema and Laura stands as one of the finest example of the genre. The title theme itself is equally legendary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting theme, gorgeous Tierney","review":"The plot twist in this brooding film noir is that the detective falls in love with the corpse. There's much to enjoy in this movie, including the haunting theme music and the lovely Gene Tierney. The acting is good but the plot is a little silly and the detective's investigative techniques seem childishly amateurish.This extra material on this DVD includes a long documentary about Tierney's tragic life which is well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laura","review":"This is truly a timeless movie. I hope no one ever does a remake. Too many remakes have been a waste of time. Some examples of very bad remakes:Alfie, Around the World in 80 Days, Cape Fear, Father of the Bride,Flight of the Phoenix, House of Wax, King Kong, Ocean's Eleven,Planet of the Apes, Poseidon, Psycho, Sabrina, The Fly, The Jackal,The Karate Kid, The Parent Trap, The Pink Panther, The Stepford WivesYou've Got MailThe most notorious were the disastrous attempts to remake Casablanca. The only near successful was a Bugs Bunny cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and Beautiful","review":"i remember when i was a little girl watching this movie with my daddy it was a movie that stuck to me because of the beautiful Gene Tierney but when i watched it as i got older i realized what a superb movie it really is awesome acting and a great ending plus that portrait i still remember it and always will (rocks)"},{"rating":"2","title":"PUrchased for a friend","review":"This was chosen for one of three lectures which will be given this month - Totally enjoyable movie - Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect DVD","review":"Laura is one of my favorite movies. I was not dissappointed. The DVD is perfect. The condition is perfect. It is in the original black and white just as it should be. It is a full screen edition which I was grateful for. There are also special features like an excellent biography of Gene Tierney with interviews with her sister, Pat, her daughter, Tina, and even Oleg Cassini. Also her double. Many clips from her various films. There is also a biography of Vincent Price. There are commentaries, deleted scene and movie trailer. For anyone who admired the work of Gene Tierney and loved the movie, Laura, this is a must have. I am very happy that I got it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All around great!","review":"Laura (Fox Film Noir)Do not hesitate! Great actors, superior print transfer,extra features, engaging plot, will want to watch againand again! This goes on my special shelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Film Noir !","review":"Laura is indeed a very good film from the \\"film noir\\" catagory. Gene Tierney is a beauty that has always lit up the silver screen. I thought Clifton Webb's acting was the best in this example of \\"film noir\\". A fine moive for your film noir collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Images distract from the text","review":"I understand the philosophy behind this book for teaching a child to read. However I found that the images in this book are distracting and do nothing to advance the text. It's a sweet idea to have one's child be the illustrator for one's book but in this case I don't think it worked. My daughter asked me if it bothered me if she did not use the book with her son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"I bought this on a whim because I like vocal music and the cover looked cool. It's not what you think. This guy has a good voice and the music selection is great. He sings everything. I can't really label the type of music...it's all over the place but I liked the Tom Waits song. Really..this was a good buy. It listens well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cabaret Sounds","review":"Great debut recording from this NY cabaret singer. His choice of songs and lyricism is wonderful. This is a live album but doesn't have a lot of audience hubbub in background. Title track is singer's debut writing and an excellent addition to the cabaret repertoire. Don't be surprised if you hear more from this talented guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Another masterpiece from Giuseppe Tornatore. If you've ever watched Cinema paradiso you you can expect a movie as beatiful as that. I wish it never finished and I could sit and watch for ever. There is something different about it, It doesn't let you blink from the beginning to the end.Certainly deserves 5 stars(Actually 7)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happened upon this wonderful sleeper movie for Pianist","review":"I loved this sad but campy and movie. If you don't go nuts and get too anal about the pianism in the movie and just enjoy it for the joy of piano then you can love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legend 1900","review":"One of the best 'Family Movies\\" WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE. Very clever take on a child born on a cruise ship,and traveled around the world, never leaving the ship.

Unfortunaly I was stuck with the movie cause it didnt work on any dvd set nor x-box or playstation 3"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster at Sea","review":"It takes better than two hours to find out if the faux legendary pianist 1900 will go down with the Virginian when it is blown up at sea after being taken out of service. And it is two completely wasted hours. Hard to say what is most annoying -- the omnipresent voiceover, the philosophical twaddle that rationalizes why he never leaves the ship, the philosophical twaddle when he almost leaves the ship, the bad acting, the farcical piano duel with Jelly Roll Morton, the fleeting love story with a young passenger who looks like Amelia Earhart confused about why she's on a ship instead of her plane. The movie is splendidly photographed -- give it that much. I watched it because of the director's earlier Cinema Paradiso. He is a far better cinematic teller of memoirs than of fables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie - Terrible Sound Mixing","review":"I emailed the following to the seller and never received a response:I saw 1900 (not in its entirely) on TV and loved the movie. I kept checking to see when it would be shown again so I could record it. Finally I ordered it and was anxious to watch it and then have some friends over to watch it.After watching it, I can't invite my friends. I had to keep turning the volume up and down. It was often so difficult to hear the dialogue and I would turn it up, then the background music/sounds would overpower the voices and be very loud and I'd turn it back down. I missed some things because I couldn't understand what they were saying. The mixing was terrible. I agree with my husband, who has a music studio and knows all about mixing.Is this a quirk in a few DVDs or all they all like this? Also, is there an edited version without so much cussing? I don't remember all of that in the TV version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I could tell that it was heavily edited though, there were some points where it seemed it should have kept going on. I read up on the film later, and yup, the producers got greedy and cut a lot out to make it shorter so that they could show it more times per day in theaters. Idiots.But a great movie! Just be careful with the kiddos, they drop a few F-bombs here and there...tastefully, but F-bombs nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Film","review":"A gem! Enchanting. Loved the story, acting & the MUSIC. Well worth watching more than once. Close to 5 stars. The demolition scene will ROCK your subwoofer! Tim Roth's performance is top knotch.

I say privileged, because one would have had to have been a sleuth to have known about it or seen it in its limited theatrical release. It is criminal that the studios lack the vision to back these rare gems they keep burying in the sand.Spend whatever, do whatever to find a copy and consider yourselfthe richer for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legend of 1900","review":"I thought this moveie was one of the best I have ever seen.

Am I crazy, or what? Last night I started watching this movie, which I had rented on DVD. OK-- now my problem is this. While the movie had sound-- music, chairs being moved, crowds shouting in the background, when the charactors spoke, their lips moved and nothing came out. This went on and on, till I jumped forward to the middle of the movie, and it was the same there. Did I get a faulty copy? Blockbuster only had one copy, so that was it.From the reviews, I get the idea that this movie is very good, but frankly, I'm at a loss. What gives with the lip work?"},{"rating":"1","title":"totally boring and pointless!","review":"The fat guy starts the movie with \\"this story is so amazing nobody would believe me\\". After almost 2,5 hour suffering, I could answer him: Yeah right! Oh this story was soo stunning! He lives on a boat and is good at piano! And then nothing. Thats all. I always waited for something to happen, for the plot to move forward.After the first pianoscene when playing in the storm I thought there might be a chance...but then no.And \\"A could never live in the land, with thousands of roads, dont know where to go. All I need is my piano with 88 keys\\". What is this? Some kind of kitch philostophy? Give me a break. He could go on with something like: \\"People should never travel, our country should isolate and dont accept immigrants, all we need is what we have...\\". I like the actor Tim Roth (Rob Roy, Planet of Apes) and I like piano music, but this movie just crap. I could go on with details like the last eternety long dialogue but I stop here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and boring with some interesting camera work","review":"I first saw this on a cross country flight. I saw it recently on DVD. The DVD is well done- nice quality. Beautiful camera work. But the movie was long, boring and flat. I was reminded while watching that after the first viewing I spent the month it was in inflight rotation- reading instead of movie watching while jetting cross country. This movie is one of the reasons people take their laptops and their own movies on flights today. Pass!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Yourself DO NOT WATCH this Movie","review":"Formula=nice music, existential nonsense, pathetic writing, irritating actors, catatonic plot development = 1900!!!!!!!!If staring deeply into the eyes of ugly fat guys with bad teeth and twitchy eyes is your idea of a good time, this movie is for you.Just like the Titanic, you can't wait for this ship to go down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant. thanks","review":"The present arrived the next day or two days after I had purchased it.

One year before i saw it, I heard the Roger Water's song \\"lost boys calling\\" The song was excellent but i never heard it in the proper context. When it's played on piano in the film, when 1900 sees the girl, he tracks her and plays it, she leaves and there's only the sea. The song is also on the end credits.The acting is superb, the story even better. I think those who've seen this will never forget the \\"piano duel\\".I watched it with my girlfriend, we were both amazed and truly moved at the end. Even if I was alone, I think I would've shed some tears.Fantastic film.A.P.L"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great idea!","review":"What a wonderful concept and so well done.

The book describes Stevenson's two year journey from the Marqueses Islands, to Tahiti, then Honolulu ,and finally Somoa. Stevenson uses the great adventures he experienced and his masterfully writing skills to paint a breath taking view of the islands and thier many beauties."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful storyteller!","review":"Really, this book made me want to turn my back on old Norway and become a Pacific Wanderer for all future. Stevensons prose is magnificent, persnal, witty, earnest and serious, and what's more, he is a rare example of a Victorian gentleman who met people with plain friendliness and curiosity and respect, which makes you trust everything he says about the King of Apemama, everyday life on Butaritari or cannibalism in the Marquesas Islands. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, handle fell apart","review":"It is definitely not one of the best OXO products. The one we had in our apartment came apart: the plastic part of the handle separated from steel. The cutting wheel is inadequate for good slicing because it is small and flimsily attached to the handle.I used to work in a pizza place and have sliced plenty of pizzas. Based on my experience I would recommend looking for a pizza slicer with a large cutting wheel that is firmly attached to a solidly built handle.One more tip: when slicing pizza hold your pizza wheel at about 75-degree angle in relation to a table - your pie won't slide around then!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, good price","review":"This is a good pizza wheel for a good price.

But maybe that's how it should be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I found it to be too much touchy feely and fluffy, and too little substance. Other than trying to compare setting up a CMM program to choreographing a ballet (which didn't do it for me), I found nothing insightful about this book. I have a large CMM library that I frequently reference, but this is one book definitely collecting dust. I would recommend not wasting your money as there are far better books on the market that address the subject in far greater depth and breadth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book in Search of a Good Editor","review":"While this book does contain a good deal of useful information, it is presented in a manner that cries out for a good editor.

I would recommend it only because I have been able to find nothing else like it in the marketplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"dated","review":". . .This was the first book to address CMM. Unfortunately it is dated. The cd-rom contains a little useful material -- if you don't have anything, but is insufficient to do CMM.There are commercially available prewritten processes but they may be difficult to adapt to your organisation. Caputo won't help there either.If you get Paulk and Dymond you don't need this book. You cannot do CMM without Paulk (or TR24 and TR25 which Paulk is mostly a rehash of). Hence you don't need Caputo too.You will need the Framework by Olson (download from SEI) to supplement Paulk. Dymond is a useful pictorial overview.This book has been OBE due to time and has been overcome by better tools. You do not need this one. Get Paulk and Dymond instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time...","review":"For any organization that is looking to adopt a methodology or improve it software development process, I would recommend against looking at CMM and this book.An organization would be better served by looking at methodologies such as Rational's Objectory (now called Rational Unified Approach) and the corresponding books as it has been real world proven vs academia proven..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Data mining....","review":"This book is a lot like looking for gold -- you have to spend a good bit of time searching through tons of rubble before finding a good nugget or two. If you are looking for technical/practical assistance on keys to implementing the CMM then look elsewhere; the book will do nothing but frustrate you. If you are looking for organizational and managerial help then you *might* find this book useful, but your money is probably better spent elsewhere. The book is heavy on 'organization-speak' and light on real, practical instruction. There are some good war stories, but you probably have ones of your own that are just as good and relevant. The CD and associated forms aren't very useful and they are somewhat poorly organized. The book is not totally without merit, but I still can't find anything in it that even remotely justifies its price."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are learning CMM, this book will not help you.","review":"The book spends an overwhelming portion of its content focusing on a ballet and how it relates to CMM. As an author, I got the impression she was using this as a technique to meet her page quota. The author overuses glittering generalizations about how to manage people and an organization. In that sense, this book is a rehash of useless management fluff from the 80s. This book contains about 15-20 pages worth of useful information and should cost $10.

It starts out with \\"Window Shopping\\", a brilliant play on words about starting a relationship. The first single, \\"Fools Like Me\\" is definately the stand out track, but \\"Hand Me Downs\\", \\"I control the Sun\\", \\"Diamonds\\"' and \\"accident\\" all deserve a listen.

This album includes both her usual catchy, up-beat pop-rock tunes, as well as songs with a more mature, melancholy tone.

The majority of the album uses a culture roots feel, but with a modern sound that inspires dreamy and optimistic feelings. There are two fast \\"dancehall\\" songs toward the end of the album, and two others that sound more like ambient hip hop than culture reggae, but mostly the album is smooth and easy throughout. \\"Girl From Kingston Town\\" and \\"Saddle Up\\" are masterpieces. Even the crossover material sounds very good. When this group finally realizes that rap is out of style, and focuses more on their beautiful, harmonic singing concept with one-drop reggae beats, they'll be the most infectious group in contemporary reggae."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"Why does Amazon make me do these reviews?

The melody he relies on through the first movement and several times thereafter isn't bad but it isn't much either. I also don't like his use of the big clapping sound that was almost comically overdone as a backbeat in the 80's. Vangelis at times uses some really cool drums which makes that cheap backbeat almost like a physical shock to hear - so out of place. In fairness, that might not have been the case when this soundtrack was first written, and it might not bother somone who doesn't find it to be an 80's new age cliche sound. I just expected more meat and potatoes from the guy who wrote the virtually unsurpassed soundtrack for Blade Runner! Besides that clapping backbeat, the repetetive simple melody and some fluffy nice chord washes - I didn't find much there there..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mystical Voyage To A Vast And Haunting Land Of Ice And Snow","review":"Vangelis' soundtrack to Koreyoshi Kurahara's seldom seen and all but forgotten '84 film 'Antarctica' is one of the true undiscovered classics of the last twenty years. Possibly second only to his highly acclaimed 'Chariots of Fire' masterpiece, 'Antarctica alludes to a less emotional, more remote musical experience.Vangelis' ethereal soundtrack masterfully transports the listener to a barren, yet exquistely beautiful soundscape that superbly captures the sense of isolation and loneliness of this vast, frozen continent. The pieces are haunting, mystical, yet surprisingly peaceful instead of disquieting. Without a doubt this is one of my all-time favorite CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antarctica.......","review":"After listening to and enjoying the Blade runner soundtrack by Vangelis I Purchased Antarctica. The emotion in the music as well as the intense crisp feel, remind me of the visuals in the movie of the same title. I had bought and listened to the cd B4 seeing the film, i think that was a good thing...If you like film scores from out door theme films and or have enjoyed past Vangelis CD's then Antarctica is worth a listen....try it in quiet place with suround sound and closed eyes, its like winter but without the cold toes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Time Favorite Music","review":"My dream is to someday travel to Antartica. When I do, I will be playing 'Antartica' on a CD with earphones while viewing the magnificent stark beauty of the continent, it's ocean and icebergs. This album makes me cry every time I play it. Vangelis was able to depict the 'feel' of this place, even though it is devoid of people and cultures. Actually, there is a 'culture' there; it belongs to the penguins, sea birds, whales - and the beautiful variations in blue."},{"rating":"1","title":"!Qué simpleza!","review":"No había oído casi nada de Vangelis. Tan solo lo que todo el mundo: carros de fuego, Blade Runner y algo de 1492. MOvido por la excelente calificación de este disco me decidí a comprarlo. Y por Dios, !que simpleza!. Del primer tema, con ser bonito, ya estás cansado a los dos minutos, cuanto más para que se repita una y otra vez durante todo el disco. Esto no es más que pop del más simple, adornado con algunos efectos orquestales mediante diversos sintetizadores. Sin duda, está bien, para lo que fué hecho: una mala película documental de segunda fila.Si te gusta Vangelis (como cualquier otro artista) te vas a \\"tragar todo lo que te echen\\", pero por favor, creeme, hay músicas más complejas que te aportarán mucho más.

Nothing is gained in the translation. Same old thing: young precocious talent must fight lack of confidence in order to be a champion. Our hero is played by Kip Pardue, an actor with all the burning charisma of a CK-1 model. So I guess the girls will like this. Maybe. Myself, I enjoyed the eye-candy provided by Estella Warren, Stacy Edwards, and Gina Gershon. The list of what I DIDN'T enjoy is too volumnious to itemize here; let's just mention the [bad]dialogue, terrible rock soundtrack, and whizzing, mostly computer-animated photography and leave it at that. Thousands of starving filmmakers can't get their stuff shown even at Sundance, while *Driven* plays in multiplexes nationwide. Sweet dreams, kids. By the way: a movie about professional racing that doesn't spend any serious time in the pit is, well, not really a movie about racing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ever?","review":"As a fan of auto racing, particularly CART and F1, I had been cautiously anticipating the release of this movie on DVD for some time. However, it turns out thatthis movie was more unrealistic than my worst fears had considered. For example, in one seen, the movies two protagonists start their race cars, and go racing around on city streats at top speed. I suppose that Stallone forgot that Indy Cars do not have their own starters, they must be started with an external starter. Nothing about the racing and wrecking is realistic, despite the fact that Sylvester Stallone was seen at several races in the year prior to this movies release.When you combine the unrealistic nature of the movie, with the complete lack of plot, and the poor acting, this movie doesn't even deserve a full star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Among the worst of the worst","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

The storyline is kinda ok, but the scenes are so ridiculous that it makes the movie laughable. Driving F1 cars in the middle of city streets? cool idea, awful in the story.

I am a huge race fan, and jump at any chance to see race action on the screen. The endorcement by CART was even more of a plus for me. When I finally saw it on the screen, I could not believe it. I had never been more disappointed by a film. The acting was horrible. The special effects were impressive, but unrealistic. The race scenes were even more unrealistic, and the story did not to flow well. I could not find a connection with any of the carachters. They did not spend time developing them at all and there were just brief comments placed in the most awkward places to try and make up for it. The special effects were well made but they needed to do more studying on how the cars would react in the accidents, or how they react in a race in general. The movie need someone who was more educated in racing to help bring things together. It really had a lot of potential but in the end it fell way short."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHAHA!","review":"I like car racing... To my humble point of view, this is one of the very worst film I have seen in my life. Everything is absurd, the actors and the story are like the worst tv soap. The caracters shows the most primary psychology you can imagine. Everything is a laughable exageration. Yes, I had a good time seeing this film just to see the incredible number of absurdities and bad sequence one after another. I THINK THIS FILM HOLDS THE ABSOLUTE WORLD RECORD OF the worst scenario. Hollywood at its very worst. A real satiric comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is \\"rocky\\", not Rocky","review":"If you are a real Sylvester Stallone fan and love car racing, you might be able to find some redeeming feature in the movie, but otherwise it might be a good idea to pass it by. Stallone's character is an over-the-hill race car driver who is called back to his racing team to help groom a talented but inconsistant rookie driver. The writing is pretty bad and doesn't give the actors much to work with. It's difficult to imagine that drivers would stop in the middle of a race to help an injured driver, but that's what Stallone would have us believe. The story is stilted and predictable, but there are a few interesting race scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst car movie ever made. Complete crap!","review":"If Mr. Stallone was such a great race fan as he claims to be, he would have taken the time to be sure the technical details of the film were correct, even if he didn't have a story.Point: Exploding race car filled with methanol fuel does not burn yellow like gasoline does. It is colorless, maybe slightly blue.Point: Burning methanol fuel does not spread over the surface of a pond or lake, it mixes with water and goes out.Obvious computer generated action sequences and effects only make this film more laughable than it would be. The cast looks like they are straight out of a Japanese animated TV series as well.Steve McQueen didn't have a story for Le Mans, but he let the racing action speak for him. If only there were some realistic action in this film to speak for Stallone we would all have been better off.This film belongs in the $0.99 discount bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long wait for nothing","review":"I waited a long time for this movie to be released on DVD to be extremely disappointed. From the annoying music to the computer generated crash scenes this movie stinks. I am a very big fan of Stallone but this one left me thinking that I just wasted $... .Anybody that thinks this movie portrays realistic racing scenes has obviously never watched a CART or F1 race! When is the last time you saw a driver throw quarters on the track and pick them up with the rear tires while inducing a skid at 200+ mph?I feel that I could never connect with any of the characters in this movie.

At least, when Austin Powers was parodying James Bond, one could laugh.

When I heard that Stallone was writing it, I became a little less excited, but still optimistic. Being a huge CART fan, this was going to be the movie that helped define the league.How unfortunate that this movie turned out to be a steaming pile of cow manure! The 'plot' is ridiculous. The 'action' is not even remotely close to real life. The 'special effects' look worse than most 1980's video games. I've never seen a movie with more potential go so horribly wrong. It's too bad that CART ended up going bankrupt after this movie. Who knows, maybe if the movie was halfway respectable, it could have helped CART's financial woes?

Still, this second Sylvester Stallone-Renny Harlin collaboration is fairly enjoyable on a junk-food-cinema level. The racing sequences are exciting (despite some obvious digital effects) and, surprisingly, Stallone's character takes a back seat to the young leads. However, one wishes Stallone had written a screenplay that wasn't a \\"Rocky\\" retread - right down to casting Burt Reynolds in the Burgess Meredith role. As a result, \\"Driven\\" covers the same narrative ground that you've seen in previous Stallone efforts.

It is filled with absolutely laughable impossibilities (dozens . . . maybe hundreds) like being able to jump into an IndyCar, turn the key (connected to the non-existent built-in starter), and take off down city streets at 200+.

Screenwriter/Producer/Star Stallone mumbles his way through his own bad dialogue and Burt Reynolds looks like he's about to drop dead of embarressment, though he; like Stallone, has made more than his share of turkeys throughout his career. Director Renny Harlin (who can do much better) even throws in some cheesy computer graphics of racing during the climax. Does he really think viewers are that stupid?

When he decided not to make it because of the limited access he would have to the teams I was disappointed. However, after seeing the movie I was glad F1 decided not to get involved.The race scenes was like watching a video game on a big screen TV. Every accident was over the top. Even funnier were the inconsistencies regarding the cars. You need a special starter to get the hydraulics started and then you can start the engine. However, in \\"Chicago\\" both Kip & Sly were able to start the cars without them when they went racing through the streets. The plot was not much better and the characters one-demensional.This movie is good for unintentional laughs, just like any movie where Keanu Reeves is trying to play a serious character."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Extreme Waste of Celluloid","review":"I had high hopes for Driven.

Plus, I hadn't seen a recent Stallone film, so I was interested to see how he would fare in Driven.Fortunately, I only rented Driven, and did not buy it or pay to see it in cinema. Overall, the acting was so bad and the storyline to inept that I barely got halfway through the film before I was too fed up to continue with it. While actual ABC/ESPN auto racing announcers are featured, they do not call the film's races ANYWHERE close to reality; I realize things for a film are scripted, but the passion simply is not there. The three-coin trick was intriguing, but that was the highlight of the first half of the film - which certainly does not bode well for the second half :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for a good racing movie?

But worst of all, my spyware free computer got infected by every spyware you can imagine while I was downloading updates from Norton. And to top it off Norton could not fix the problem. It took me three other anti-spyware programs to fully undo what Norton did to my computer. Avoid Norton at all costs, if you don't heed my advice you will regret it. Look for other programs such as McAfee AntiSpyWare 2005. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"It slows down your computer, even if you have the most powerful processor.

This scoop puts all the others to shame. I it is now the first one I grab when i need to scoop ice cream.

The part of the scoop that attaches to the handle is only about 1/4 inch in diameter. It's a total scam; they made it look thicker, by making the part that holds the scoop 4 times as wide. You can't tell by looking at it, because they have cleverly disguised it with the plastic handle. I found out when the handle broke off in my hand, while trying to scoop some hard ice cream. Oxo, you should be ashamed of yourselves for making this piece of junk, which was clearly designed to deceive the consumer.

This product has an annoying flaw, however. When you wash it, water gets trapped in some tiny nooks and crannies. Then, when you are scooping ice cream, especially ice cream that's straight out of the freezer, the pressure from scooping opens up these nooks and crannies (e.g., around where the scoop shaft joins the handle) and water starts dribbling out and down into the ice cream container.If you only use this scoop occasionally, I imagine the water trapped inside would have evaporated. Since we tend to use our scoop every week or so, this water dribble happens frequently.

Problem was that it got all corroded and nasty looking over time. This scoop works so much better, even without running it under hot water first! The handle is much nicer because of the grippy material, and it cuts through ice cream that seems pretty rock hard to me. i think the little points on the scoop help with serving harder ice cream. Easy to wash and my husband even used it to scoop out the insides of our pumpkins this Halloween!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scoop","review":"This is a wonderfully designed scoop. It really makes scooping ice cream easier and more pleasant, even if it is frozen hard. The blade is thin so it cuts through, but is very strong.

The plot is just terrible, and the acting even worse. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joey Lauren Adams are the only decent thing about this movie, and even their quality acting is degraded by this script. The LSD scenes are a beginners tutorial in kai's power goo, and the overall message of the film is on par with the just-say-no campaign.

Quit simply it was horrible. Some of the sex scenes she had were too racy for my taste and just dissappointing that she would agree to sell herself like this.

I just didn't like one thing about it, when the main character, Allen (adrien Grenier, or however it is spelled!), is on drugs, I guess they wanted you to see the movie from his point of view, but all that really happens is the picture squishes (for lack of better word) up, and THAT REALLY GETS ANNOYING!

It was in tip-top shape!The movie is one of our family favorites, and we looked long and hard to finally find it again. It is Western story telling at its best, and Richard Widmark gives one of his best classic performances as the outlaw. If you're not already a Robert Taylor fan, you will be at the end of this movie! The last scene at the end, in the graveyard, marks the nature of the entire film, and the ending is happily satisfying.

It's now 4th year as I was using it, and I'm finally getting tired of it.Just a horrible quality, and at that time I have paid for it twice as much.Suction cups do not hold the mirror! By the time you are going to shower the next morning or evening, the shower is dry, suction cups do not hold, it falls. It has scarred my wife many times falling during a night. Fortunately it didn't break, but it has chipped.Overall, this is one horrible mirror! Also, it fogs like crazy! Spraying it did not work. The spray just adds a blurry film on it, so you cannot see anything!Do not buy this!

The first one lasted three years with minimal maintenance performed, quite a bargain for such a cheap mirror. While still functional at the end of that time, it finally sucumbed to water spots/stains and my desire to get a new one. The three suction cups have a double cup design and work better than most with only occasional adjustments needed to adhere it to the flat surface of the shower. Others have discussed the limited number of cleaning pads supplied by the manufacturer which is true, but again for the price only so much should be expected. As an alternative to the cleaning pads after each use I spray a generic daily shower cleaner on the surface of the mirror which keeps the water spots from forming as well as maintains it's anti fog capabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"fogless mirror","review":"Very cheep construction. the mirror fogged up after a week or so.

A year has gone by and the mirror fogs instantly. I gave the mirror credit because the suction cups still seem to hold... Sort of.

Psychological and humanistic astrology are wonderful fields for exploring the intricacies of sex and many interesting metaphysical books have been written on the subjects of relationships and intimacy, but, unfortunately, this is not one of them. Every tired old cliche about sun signs is trotted out and discussed in a sophomoric manner--there are even lists of \\"unsexy\\" members of each zodiacal sign.

Each sign is explained in terms of how to lure someone of that sign, how to interest, how to seduce (many creative, fun ideas), sex with that sign, how to handle a relationship with that sign (must do's and no-no's) and how to end a relationship with a person of that sign.

The book reveals quite some interesting tactics. Then comes the 'sex part' and how to handle your mate.

The language simply cools down the heart like a mountain-full of ice by the beauty of it. And it's hatred for the world behind the mask just burns your heart as it did with Christophe.

It has given me a greater appreciation for biblical prophecy and and greater awareness of what not to use for end-times prophecy. Mauro goes through the last 3 prophecies of Daniel and shows how they are all related but specifically the 70 weeks prophecy. He explains what each verse is referring to and has a great understanding of biblical events that would take years to learn. He points out how Matthew 24 has been fulfilled at the destruction of Jerusalem in 70AD. How Daniel's 70 week prophecy was specifically talking about the Messiah coming and the Jews crowning sin of putting him to death and the destruction and scattering of the Jewish nation being the punishment of that great sin. This review of these prophecies is hard to dispute because of all of the biblical evidence that Mauro uses. It is a must read for anyone interested in biblical prophecy.

It's pure entertainment.As a one-time surfer in Hawaii, I remember being creeped out for a week or two after seeing the movie.All the actors did a tremendous job. Roy Scheider (police chief), Richard Dreyfuss (shark expert) and Robert Shaw (boat owner) are stand outs, but the supporting actors, such as Murray Hamilton (mayor) are good, too.Famous for the line \\"You're gonna need a bigger boat\\" and the cello-based score that only requires 2 notes to define it.The reasonably-priced DVD has the widescreen movie, a good \\"making of\\" documentary, deleted scenes and out-takes, and some other minor extras.

I have to see at least part of it every time I pass it on TV.The fear factor is always there in this movie. The shark appears out of the deep unexpectedly, and still makes you jump. But the suprising part of this film is the humor. Bordy pulling up his shirt of look at his appendix scar when Quint and Hooper are showing off their scars. \\"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\\" Hooper making faces at Quint behind his back. Very well acted by all parties, and what can you say about Speilberg's direction? It is all very human. Quints telling about the story of the USS Indianapolis is one of the greatest speeches in any movie, emotionally powerful.The Widescreen DVD is incredible. The print is clear, and the sound clean.

A definite buy for anyone who likes movies.5 stars for sure"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new classic restored","review":"I owned the previous DVD edition of \\"Jaws\\" and decided to upgrade to the Blu-ray after reading a glowing review about the transfer in Entertainment Weekly. I wasn't disappointed. The film looks better than I've ever see it before. It is almost as if extra lighting was placed in some of the scenes. The picture is crisp, colorful and pops off the screen. The moonlit scenes, chiefly the opening sequence, is stunning in its clarity. I also noticed how incredible the sound is. The scene where Quint runs his nails down the chalkboard never really bothered me before but here it is excruciating. Plentiful extras include 2 documentaries, the best being the most recent \\"The Shark is Still Working\\" which contains fascinating interviews with actors (even those in bit parts) and an intimate look at Verna Fields studio.

A police chief (Roy Scheider), a sailor (Robert Shaw), and a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) ride on the boat, called the Orca, to kill the giant great white shark, that had eaten some people on the beach in Amity Island. The fact is that this movie is rated PG. It should have been rated PG-13 because of the violence in it and it is not a movie for younger kids to watch. But, it is a cinematic masterpiece.

The sheriff (Roy Scheider) and two other men took an adventure to hunt down the shark. You know how big that thing was? That could've been food for a month.

Remastered in 5.1 with new effects added. Effects that are just plain bad. Effects that sound like they were taken from free MP3 clips on the web bad.

This is no \\"lets have a big monster eat people\\" movie, it has a group of characters who are struggling against a threat, a threat the size of their boat! The slimy Mayor is just one of the great parts, and they all fit together seamlessly. The reason this did not get 5 stars is quite frankly that it is not perfect.

For the most part, DVD's are so inexpensive now (the new Special Edition 30th Anniversary of Jaws is only $16.99 at Amazon) that they're practically throw-aways after a couple of years (when the newer special edition comes out).

Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are phenomenal, but Robert Shaw's Quint is quite possible my favorite movie role ever. The whole thing is fantastic. (This version is widescreen.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most effective thriller since Psycho","review":"Well I have to admit that I spent a month without going into the water because of this movie, it's true, it's frightening, and spielberg was only 26, that's amazing. Even before the monster show his face you're already scared. It's a masterpiece, a movie from a time where action movies where good as this, Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark, unfortunately today we are obligated to watch such ridiculous patriotics and idiotics movies as Independence Day(ugh, that hurts!!!!!!!!), Armaggedon(One of the worst movies of all time) and Godzilla(or How to spend millions in garage)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Buy... When You Can Burn...","review":"Anyone who is tired of the ... crap (thought I was gonna say something else didnt you) that Spielberg does with his DVDs (no commentaries, excessive double-dipping) should crossover to the dark side - burn the hell out of him and his company by burning his movies...burn Spielberg burn (just had to say it one more time.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry...","review":"I wanted to like this film. Really, I did. But there's not a scary frame in the film. The suspense falls flat, the dialogue is ugh, the characters to me were nothing more than fish food, and it's vastly overrated.

The movie is not complete as I saw it originally at the movies and also on TV years ago. The deleted scenes are in the original full lenth movie. Why call this a collectors addition and take out the original scenes and then say they are bonus materials.This is a edited movie version and not the original. This is not a collectors addition. Just a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie. Lousy video presentation.","review":"I love the movie JAWS, and I agree with the AFI that it's one of the 100 greatest American films of all time. But this particular video presentation does not present the movie in it's original form. This DVD does not contain the original, oscar winning sound effects. Instead, this DVD contains a bunch of newly re-recorded sound effects. To me, this is the equivalent of re-writing Shakespear's plays, re-writing the novels of Dickens, or tearing up the Mona Lisa and painting a new one. Besides, the DVD format allows for up to 8 different audio track to be included, so even if they did record a new one, why not also include the old one? I guess George Orwell was right. History is indeed being re-written. What a shame. Hopefully someday they will issue a DVD that contains the origianl soundtrack to this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaws (the movie) Problem with receiving DVD","review":"I have not received the DVD that I ordered instead I received a link to watch the movie through my computer.

I mean all your really gonna get is an Extra hour on the Documentary, a snippet of a young Speilberg... and a tasty new DTS track. The Image Transfer is the Same... which considering the age of the film is Amazing (though there is some grain and dirt flaws that could probably have been Ironed out for this Edition).All in all if you haven't already got the 25th Edition, this is the one to get... but if your Happy with what you have, don't feel the need to upgrade.

Sorry all, but I refuse to buy something that I have to wait until chapter 19 to hear some great sound effects that last a second. My advice is this. If you want to get this movie on DVD because you are done watching VHS tapes, fine. But do not buy this if you want to hear a great sound format. Also, the DTS version is a joke. I don't know if it was just the one DVD that I happened to buy, but it wouldn't allow you to choose the DTS format at all. Why pay extra for DTS if you can't even use it? My spouse and I laughed while watching it due to that there were maybe 4 times that you heard the \\"shark coming sound effect\\" on the rear speakers, and even then it sounded so mono.

I was but a schoolboy, and after that day, I never stopped drawing sharks on every piece of paper I could find. It's great to see one of my most loved films restored beautifully on Blu-ray. I can finally see the patterns and the textures on Mayor Larry's jacket, the sun-beaten craggly features on Quint's face, and all the details on Bruce the shark.

It scarred me for life! I have always hated the ocean and been terrified of boats ever since then. I am terrified of large waves and salt water. I blame this all on seeing Jaws at such a young age. It's a super movie, mind you, and I can easily sit through it (and often do), but I can't bear to go to the ocean.I asked my mom why she didn't take me to see Sweeney Todd when I was also 3 - but she said I was too young. I'd rather she took me there - that way I would at least be scared of eating meat and loud operatic theatre - a much healthier phobia, I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"JAWS ANNIVERSARY - WHERE IS THE DTS?","review":"The Image quality is magnificant, but, adding to the review by \\"englishonly\\", who stated \\"there was very little activity in the rear speakers\\" consider this sound may be no more than Dolby Digital, and might have more activity on the Pro-logic setting. Are the extras in DTS and not the film? The advertising doesn't indicate that. WHERE IS THE DTS? My DVD player tells how many channels are outputing and the Decoder displays that info (2 channel). DTS won't activate, and on the same exact setup, Saving Ryan indicates DTS and rattles the rafters. Buy this for picture quality,YES. Buying for DTS?, better find out first.

I guess most people like it because it has a lot of names involved with it. Maybe I'm biased because I am not a swimmer and have never been into water sports, but I just find it extremely boring after the first attack or two.

Of course, I realize this is just my opinion, and I'm not masquerading it as anything more, but come on, now. Why is it so great? Why is it so suspenseful?

When he falls into the water he is clearly seen NOT wearing shoes. But when the shark tears of his leg, it HAS a shoe on it. Another easy on to spot was at the starting at of the movie. When Chrisy (I don't know how to spell her name) is tugged by the shark, her mouth doesn't match the screams she makes.

If you are an aspiring filmmaker and do NOT like this movie, please change professions now. We don't need people like you trying to make movies when you don't like one of the finest.

Bad idea!The excellent music composed by John Williams will always make me think of JAWS.The police chief, played by Roy Scheider is suspicious that it is a GWS but the mayor, of course doesn't want to believe him until it conclusive, which it is fairly soon. The police chief wants to close the beaches, but that would costs too much in economic terms so he is vetoed.All-in-all an enjoyable movie, but not right before you go on vacation at the beach.Throughout the movie the GWS is anthropomorphized so that we / the movie makers give him almost human intelligence.Not recommended for anyone who wants to swim in the ocean.

But, do you really want realism or special effects, I want realism. If you are in a boat, do you ever really get a good look at a shark, probably not. As a parallel, 2001 is actually set around Saturn, but the rings would severely date the film, so Jupiter was chosen; if Jaws was full of special effects the film would a) look like any number of monster films, and b) look dated today. In 2001, 26 years later, Jaws packs as much punch as it did in 1975. Is Jaws really about a community versus a shark, yes; but, it is also about a man torn between what's right and what's politically desirable. Honestly, it is pure 1970s in execution, but in message it is fresh even today.

I am tempted to buy it, though, just because you call the people who love it and want it suckers... :) (And I don't care if they come up in 5 years with a 35th anniversary set, I won't buy it.. or if I do, I'll sell my 30th first)Enjoy the movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE EVER CREATED","review":"This movie is the best movie ever created. The reason this movie was so popular was the sharp plot. This movie has scared so many people in the world. This movie is a very scary thriller .This movie is about a shark that is attacking and killing people near the shore of a beach, and so the only way to stop the attacks is to close down the beach. The mayor doesn't like this idea though because a big town holiday was coming and everyone usually swims on this holiday. So he hirers three people to get the shark in time for the holiday. What they think is going to be an easy capture, they are wrong and they are in for the thrill of their livesSo if you like thrillers, shark movies, and great classics, check out JAWS you'll never want to go in the watter again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all-time great horror films","review":"Steven Spielberg's 1975 masterpiece shows what \\"Jurassic Park\\" could have been if Spielberg had been serious about the dinosaur film. \\"Jaws\\" owes much of its success to a superb cast with three-dimensional rles to fill and the power of understatement. While the conclusion is riveting with the shark in full view, it owes much to the build-up, in which the shark remains elusively out of view for so long. And it doesn't hurt that John Williams added a masterful score. This is one of those rare cases where the film is better than the book.

To this day, people are scared to go near the water because of it; and the famous score is perhaps one of the most widely recognized pieces of music in the US.The beauty of this film is that it's subtle; you don't even see the shark until halfway through the movie. The viewer isn't just scared of the shark, they are scared of everything that is unknown and uncontrollable. The superb acting and camera work only enhance the tension, and the fact that the action takes place in a summer paradise creates an uncomfortable dichotomy that pushes it over the top.\\"Jaws\\" is one of the great films of all time. The fact that it is a genuine crowd pleaser makes it all the more special. For these reasons the bonus feature on the making of \\"Jaws\\" is all the more interesting, because it shows how a movie that seemed almost cursed became a hit.A great movie, and a great DVD.

Except for one scene, and it's not even a real important scene, but it actually looks worse on the Blu-ray than it did on DVD. It's the scene where Brody, Lorraine, and Hooper are sitting in Brody's dining room talking about the shark and drinking wine. Looks pretty rough.

I prefer this style over the swivel because it's easier to control and I'm less apt to cut myself. The blades are sharp enough to skin some winter squash, but dull enough so that my blade-phobic friend can peel potatoes.The OXO rubber comfort grip is what distinguishes this peeler from others with similar designs. I can easily prepare enough russet and sweet potatoes, turnips, carrots, etc. for a large holiday dinner without getting a cramp and without the tool slipping from my wet hands.I've had mine for about 5 years and it's still in great condition, but having an online source for this is very convenient because in my area, most stores carry only the swivel version."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was great at the beginning","review":"I've been using this peeler for about 2.5 months. At the beginning it was the greatest peeler I've ever owned. I mean I could peel through veggie skins like butter but within a couple of months the peeler stopped becoming so sharp.

The book is full of fascinating surprises: Woodrow Wilson's speech to the first World's Salesmanship Congress in 1916; the Duluth-Dresden connection; Hitler promising to protect Europe from American economic domination.

The characters never came to life for me... they, and the plot, never seemed to be more than flat words printed on chalky paper. Some may think that Cather's style is pleasantly simple and moving, but it only moves me to read another book by another author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talky & boring","review":"O Pioneers! is talky, talky, talky and boring, boring, boring. No wonder high school students hate it. I am far past high school, but I could not get through it, either. Cather seems to write chapters for the sake of cranking out pages, but many chapters go nowhere and lead to nothing. Like one chapter where she goes with her brothers to visit a strange Russian named Ivar who has peculiar ideas on how to raise pigs. Does she go into the hog butchering business? Or big time hog farming? Does she even follow his advice? No. Nothing happens and the hogs don't come up again. And her endless descriptions of the scenery are enough to make me wish she got stranded in the Gobi Desert. She just can't stop with the scenery, which makes up a good half of the book. Maybe she should have been a painter."},{"rating":"1","title":"O Please tell me this book is NOT considered a classic!","review":"The book starts off great, with a warmth and vividness that makes one care about the characters. Unfortunately, that brief spark of brilliance fades all too quickly. We soon find ourselves mired in a muck of endless drivel. Early on, a time leap propels us 16 years forward where we lose a sense for who the characters are. From that point on, the author gives us no more than a two-dimensional portrait of our heroine and her family. In depth descriptions are reserved for the landscapes and boring events, instead of for the emotions that motive the main characters. Inexplicably, some of the characters turn into brooding morons with (seemingly) no redeeming qualities. This work left much to be desired. Read \\"O Pioneers\\" only if you want to see how a great start means...absolutely nothing! For more enjoyable reading try authors like Lucy Maud Montgomery, Henry James, or Jane Austen...you'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not available.","review":"I have tried more than once to order this title on my Kindle.

The sixteen year jump in the middle of the book lost me. I lost all view of the characters and the situations in which they were involved. I was surprised to see Cather stoop to such a level. I highly recommend her other works, but O Pioneers, one of her first novels, didn't inspire as did the others. Some will find this story very enjoyable with a great descriptions of the Nebraskan plains, but for me, the vivid descriptions didn't overcome the lack of plot and storyline.

And I also love good Christmas tunes, so I was all excited when I found and ordered this one.And it's certainly an entertaining enough CD, with the usual charming lyrics. It's just that - for me at least - the music itself wasn't nearly as attention grabbing as with my other CDs by them -- I kept forgetting the CD was on, as the music just faded to the background of my attention.Still worth buying though -- either for the perennial Bobs fan, or just for someone looking for some Christmas music that's far from the standard fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"An acquired taste","review":"Not everyone will like this slow-moving coming home tale about three sisters and their dying mother and child abusing father who is now senile.

This novel is certainly very explicit in its descriptions of various crimes and the overall brutality that takes place, however there is more to the novel. Not only is the writing surprising good and well paced but there are also very deep moments throughout the narrative.

If you are looking for a book in the vein of Sixty-Nine, however, you're not going to find it here. The only similar thread is that of the influence of Americans in Japan, a topic of long and careful (and genuinely satisfying!) conversation between Kenji and his extremely creepy client. If you like chills, In the Miso Soup has them in spades. The ending is almost anti-climatic compared the the events that lead up to it, but Murakami makes you care for Kenji in a way that many authors don't. This is a quality book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and thought provoking","review":"While not usually a fan of the \\"slash and trash\\" genre, Murakami's newest gives a reason to explore the subject of the serial killer. Examining both Japanese and American stereotypes and ideosyncracies, the book gives a fascinating portrayal of the \\"man on the edge\\". The book moves quickly and was over way before I was ready for it to end. While not his best work, this was worth waiting for. In many ways I can see this as \\"American Psycho\\" done correctly. The violence is a little over the top in some sections, but in a kind of quirky style, so not really offensive. Nice translation, no real issues there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Hoping to expand my experience with oriental fiction in a story by a Japanese writer I ordered this impressively recommended novel. It was more than novel. It was wierd, with a story line that wasn't believable even pushing the limits in accepting the supernatural.

Thats what NBC did in this case. Clearly Richard was too \\"raw\\" for TV in the 1970s, and so this should have never been attempted. The failure of the show, when Richard himself cancelled it out of frustration, only confirmed this. The only good episode was the \\"Richard Pryor Special\\" which is not included with Vol 1 or 2. True Pryor fans will only be disappointed with these DVDs...I know I was, and I have been a fan his entire career.

The group is very tight and adept at handling diverse songs such as The Hustle and Mexican Hat Dance. The rock and roll version of the Hokey Pokey on this CD is dangerously contageous - you may find yourself humming it throughout the day. The CD includes instructions for each dance. What could be more fun than following the instructions for the Chicken Dance? You'll also find new steps for the Jeapordy theme song. All-in-all, this isn't a CD for the unadventurous. For those with an appreciation of this band and their musical approach, though, this is a star addition to your collection of Brave Combo tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the younger set!!!","review":"What the previous reviewers failed to note is the obvious youth appeal of this CD.

I can hardly believe that a race car needs 10 second to get to 30mph and fly out of control on slightest turns. Yes visually it feels you are still at 5mph.

Its bowl size is much smaller than I had thought and hoped it would be. It's too small to make a really good cone. Also, the upper portion of the handle flexes when digging into hard ice cream. The tang of the scoop only goes as far as the bottom of the hole at the top of the handle. As the top of the handle is \\"empty\\", it flexes or bends.

As a novice and somebody who wants to know how a movie is made this book is perfect. I was really impressed by how simple and to the point this book was on the mechanics and made it an easy read.

This means it came from outside the US. Second, the first Harry Potter book's original British title was \\"Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone\\" (as was the Internation English movie title). The title was changed when J.K. Rowling sold the rights to Scolastic for US release.The next important thing to note, the songs that are included. If you search the web, you will find that most of the movies listed were released the same year (the rest seem to be 2000). This is the connection.I find this to be an interesting way to package some good music from multiple venues in one place. However, I definately see where it would be confusing for someone who is ONLY looking for music from the first Harry Potter movie. If this is what you are looking for, you may be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"To that Mike guy and his one star rating: what? Did you even finish the book? The ending is quite interesting, to say the least.While i do agree Stackpole's style can be somewhat dry at times, he does slowly input detail that brings the world, and most importantly the plot to life. There are a good handful of suprises in the book to keep it lively.His battle descriptions are very interesting from a military standpoint but lack much of the emotion that would draw me deeper into them. Stackpole presents the battle tactics in a clean, logical way that makes it easy to draw parrallels to modern warfare.For the most part it is a step above the usual fantasy series released these days and a worthy read. Definitely better than Fortress, and almost as good as Dark Glory War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it as a gift!","review":"I purchased it for my Husband, and he loved it!

I figured initially that the car must need to be warmed up but unfortunately, the heat was not affected by the engine warming up at all. Neither levels of airflow produced heat. I suppose there is a chance that we received a faulty product or there was a problem with our cigarette lighter (although it definitely had power).

Behind the \\"chicken-shit\\" does Fussell really think the war ought not to have been fought or that there was a nice way of fighting it - the whole history of war suggests not. And for those who have read his earlier books it is an unrevealing account of Fussell the person. For example he barely mentions his son - who's crazy experience as a bodybuilder were the material of the son's own book and must have touched the father is some way. His first wife appears to have had a career as a writer on food; she passes in barely a couple of pages.

This component cable set appears to be well manufactured, but is a little thin as far as the wire gauge goes and the output to my TV shimmers and wavers constantly. Output is bad for both games and DVDs -- I don't know how anyone can buy these cables and use them. In fact my Intec S-Video cable looks much better and it's constucted of higher gauge wiring.

I would give it a minus 5, actually, but that wasn't an option.I do not recommend this to anyone. It is easier to whack the lid with a butter knife and then smack it on the underside of the jar a few times...works for me, and hey, it's free!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Anyone needing assistance to open jars. need not waste their money on the oxo.

It does do that fairly well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy tool","review":"I have had this for quite a few years. While my wife often has difficulty opening jars with it this is more a question of applying sufficient force and in the correct direction. As other reviewers have mentioned, this can leave marks on the jar lid but the marks are quite minor. Also as others have mentioned, this device can slip off the lid -- but I find that happens most if the opener isn't positioned properly i.e. flat on top of the lid.In terms of durability I've had no trouble whatsoever with this product and we use it reasonably often for a home kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must in the kitchen","review":"I have owned this item for a few years and think it's great. Works well on great big jar lids as well as little bottle screw tops like those on a salad dressing bottle. The trick is to push it firmly so it is wedged in tight when you go to twist. Any one with dexterity problems or limited strength should have it but it's a must even if you don't have these issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Useless","review":"From the moment I got this jar opener, it was a waste.

Great gadget, easy grip, and...Now, I can do it myself (most of the time, my weakness not the products)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be recalled","review":"Bought this six years ago to use instead of the under-cabinet one that was already installed in my kitchen. The under-cabinet one was better at unscrewing a lid, but occasionally the jar would slip out of the vice and my hand would get pinched. Well, this OXO opener proved to be a disaster in every way. Like other reviewers noted, it doesn't secure well enough to the lid, slips off the lid, and hurts your hand when it gets slammed into the jar. I'm surprised no one has sued the company for manufacturing this awkward, uncomfortable, dangerous product."},{"rating":"1","title":"OXO changed the design. Not good.","review":"Apparently OXO changed the design of their jar opener. I already had the jar opener that was pictured and I wanted a 2nd one for on the go because they work so well. When I received my item, I ended up getting the one pictured here:Good Grips Jar Opener. Like the previous bad reviews, this model has sharper teeth which tend to cut into the jar tops. It's not built as well as the old model and my guess will fall apart before my old one does, which I've had for around 10 years. So much for new product design(AKA cost cutting)."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"Very poor, stupid design. It does not generate enough pressure. It slips, damaging the jar top as it rotates against it. Then, it slips off the lid entirely, hurting your hand, since you have to press down very hard to get any traction at all. I still use it sometimes, but either the rubber pad or hot water method really work at least as well. I look forward to tossing it as soon as I find a decent gadget."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T WORK","review":"The serrated grip slides on almost every jar that I've tried opening with this instrument. For me, it is nearly useless and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well","review":"This is the second one I've had. The previous one worked great. The metal serated edge was staked on with plastic, and upon opening a small jar, it torqued it out. So, I bought another, and was glad to see they used metal rivets this time. However, they changed the serated edge, and now all it does is saw through the tops. I hope they redesign it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment from Oxo","review":"I've gone through two of these and won't purchase another. The first one broke after using it a three or four times, but since I like Oxo products in general, I assumed it just a fluke. The second one I simply threw away. As other reviewers have pointed out, it uses tiny, metal teeth to grip the lid, which slip and could conceivably cause injury. It was worthless, so I'm back to the old technique of using hot water on the lid and banging the sides with a spoon. Works better than Oxo, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves jagged edges on metal lids","review":"Don't use this product to open jars with metal lids, such as baby food jars. The metal teeth leave jagged edges on the lids, which makes it really easy to cut yourself if you ever try to open the jar with your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work at all","review":"This Jar Opener was given to me as a wedding gift with several other OXO tools. I love the other items but this thing isn't even good for a door stop. It doesn't open any of the jars I've tried it on, just does a good job of scratching the lids up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I own at least a dozen Oxo products and I love every one - except this one. It doesn't make opening jars easier at all. It slips on the lids and only opens jars that I could easily open by hand.

Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Bought two of these, one for my mother and one to keep. What a total waste of money. Even my husband could not use this device easily. We finally just trashed them both as no use allowing junk to take room in our kitchens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aughhhh, competely useless!","review":"I have always wanted one of these and finally wasted my money and bought one. More pressure is needed to hold this device on the lid of a jar than it would take just to open the jar in the first place. If you are buying this because of small hands or weak grip, don't bother. My husband can make it work, but by the time he is in the kitchen he can just open the jar for me. The teeth to hold the lid are shallow and slip off the jar if you don't apply enough downward pressure. I have never been so disappointed in a kitchen gadget!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I've bought several of these products after hand surgery.

It was a waste of money. It is difficult to use.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Need More Power","review":"This item lacks the heavy dutiness that it needs to open the toughest of jars. This opener does about the same as I can do with my hand, and that's about it. It is not long enough to get the leverage required to open some jars.

It really deserves zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This jar opener is terrible","review":"Unfortunately, this seems to be the only type of jar opener available, other than the largely ineffective plastic grip pads. You will discover that, although it works, it is clumsy in actual use, and worse, it will always gouge metal out of the jar lid, frequently leaving jagged metal edges to cut your fingers. If anyone ever discovers a better type of jar opener, please let me know. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Item","review":"I recently purchased this item to keep at work. I didn't realize it was different from my old one at home as it doesn't have metal on both sides. Results - it won't open anything. Because on the one plastic side, it slips and cannot grip the lid. Suggest only the ones with metal on both sides - they really work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work due to terrible design","review":"Don't spend your money on this unless you only plan to open things with small metal or plastic lids (milk containers, baby food jars, etc.). If you're looking for something to open things like large pickle jars that are hard to get your hands around this will NOT work. This product was poorly designed and was clearly not tested properly. And for $9 it is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"an awesome helper","review":"This is a great tool. I've got carpal tunnel and not much upper body strength, so jars can be a pain. Highly advised for those with arthritis or other hand related troubles, Oxo makes a great line of very comfortable-to-use kitchen gadgets. Don't wait for a strong friend to help get into your jar of pickles, just get one of these. Very reasonably priced for the quality, it works well and is built to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vast improvement over those rubber pads!","review":"This jar opener was one of my favorite gifts from my bridal shower! I was sick of using those rubber pads; not only did they tear easily, but also they didn't work very well. So far, OXO's version has been a big improvement: the little metal grips easily take hold of most lids, and with a simple twist, the lid is off cleanly and neatly. I have found that the unit can sometimes slip, especially with a very small lid, but if you use it carefully and on a firm surface, you should have mostly success, as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usually works, sometimes slips. Damages the lid.","review":"The handle sure is comfortable, just as you'd expect from OXO. Unfortunately this jar opener does not work all that well. Instead of gripping the jar lid with non-slip rubber, it grips it with metal teeth. These sometimes slip off rather than gripping. And when they do grip, the usually leave quite a mark in the jar lid -- sometimes even cutting through very thin lids. Often takes 2-3 tries to open a single jar.Skip this product and instead buy a jar opener that grips the jar lid with rubber or a similar non-skid, non-damaging material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking","review":"The opener is too fragile for the task. The serrated blade is held in place by thin, brittle plastic that is easily broken if one inadvertantly twists or \\"levers\\" the handle even slightly up from the plane of the lid - easy to do with a tight lid.Should you decide to use it, try to keep the body of the opener pressed flat against the cap - easier said than done when trying to stabilize the jar and get leverage on the tool handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the leverage I need","review":"Being relatively young and arthritis-free (at least for now), I don't usually have any problems twisting off jar lids. But, once in a blue moon, I get that one jar that almost requires explosives to pop the top off it. And I hate opening one of these with just my bare hands. Fortunately, I found this little device, which has a good sure-grip handle, which acts as a fulcrum to apply the necessary leverage and loosening force, but with significantly less effort than I would if I did the job bare-handed. Just secure the gripper onto the cap, give it a firm, but not-too-hard turn, and another almost-impossible-to-open jar is rendered easily accessible! The opener's metal gripper teeth do dig into the lids a bit, but never to the point of turning them into injury hazards (danger of cutting yourself on the grooves the teeth leave on the lid) in the cases I've used it.All in all, this labor-saving device is a simple, yet very helpful and highly valuable kitchen helper!\`Late"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muscle for those of us without any :)","review":"I love this jar opener. I'd give it a 5, but it does occasionally slip off the jar (what opener doesn't?) and it does leave grooves in the lid at times. However, 9 times out of 10, it does an effortless job of opening even the toughest jars. I've even used it on plastic bottle tops for sticky Karo Syrup, and soda tops that have pressurized themselves onto the bottle. The positives far outweigh the negatives with this tool. It's size is great, too! It's able to accomodate small caps to large jar lids.

This was the first film to use 3-D as a tool and not a gimmick. For this reason alone, it's an important piece of film history.

Not much else happens.The third film in the now dead in the water series appeared to be the worst it could possibly get, that is until Joseph Sargent dropped the Jaws The Revenge stinkeroo into theaters a scant four years later.Jaws 3-D is marred by slow pacing, poor effects, a terrible score, and a juvenile script. Connections with the first two films are slight, making me suspect that the references were last minute additions to an in name only sequel. A real low water mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Scare","review":"This Jaws movie is entertaining. The first two are better than this so called 3-D flick. It is a scary movie but it is as fake as King Kong. The setting is diffrent bacause its not on Amity its Sea World. This time Sean and Mike Brody are the stars of the movie. This movie is so much diffrent than the first two. Its just a little darker. I hate the part where the guy falls into the sharks mouth. This movie is a guarented laugh...and a little scare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilariously Inept Piece of Trash","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen!

Although, it does have enough unintentional laughs to keep you awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too fake...","review":"Although vaguely attached to the original in its content, this film is hardly worth being included in the series. This time, the shark (which has grown to Godzilla proportions) decides to wreak havoc on innocent bathers in a more hyped up beach resort (obviously the producers were tired of the quaintness of Amity Island.) Mother's revenge on those for stealing her baby? Alright, so the shark's top \\"lip\\" twitches, but the characteristic grey-white color of the Great White shark has been lost?! I wonder if anyone noticed, but the shark is kind of lazy too. It hardly moves, besides a feeble \\"wagging\\" of the tail once in awhile. What happened to Joe Alves jr.'s original design (which was perfect)? Obviously twenty-five feet just wasn't big enough! Please, just stick to the original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"This movie is by far the STUPIDEST movie I have ever seen. Here are my reasons:1. The quality of the mechanical shark is equivalent to that of a Happy Meal toy.2. There's blood every 6-10 minutes.3. Sharks getting into Sea World? Whoever made this movie was really running low on ideas.4. The characters are stupid and unbelieveable.5. After the main characters (I can't remember their names) capture the shark that had been tormenting them and killing everybody, they put it on display at Sea World. That's real smart.6. The shark on display wasn't really the shark that was killing everybody, it was actually the CHILD of the shark that was killing everybody, and then they have to kill the mother (The writers probably decided to add that in because it probably would have been a weak ending if they hadn't).I could go on forever with reasoning why you should not watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films of all time.","review":"Awful. Awful. Awful. Did I say this film was awful. This film is a complete piece of cinema trash. Almost as bad as the fourth installment Jaws 3 is one of the worst animal films ever!!! The film is rediculous. First of all, how does a series of sharks terrorize the same family no matter where they turn. I mean did the great white shark community plant microchips in them or something. This time around \\"Bruce\\" makes a trip to Sea World (which by the way is no where near an actual beach) and plans to terrorize all the people who get in it's way. The effects are some of the worst I have ever seen. Ataris have better effects than this film. Do not. I repeat, do not see this movie. It is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a crappy movie.","review":"I did not know that white sharks grow up to 35 feet.DUHH!! They don't! Since when do sharks care for their young? They don't. Baby sharks are on their own since birth and in some cases, the parent tries to eat them. Really fake and cheesy effects. I went back to blockbuster for a $2.14 refund on this movie. Okay for a snowy or rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hysterically Bad!","review":"While the original Jaws had us glued to our seats in a state of sheer terror, Jaws 3 had us rolling around the floor laughing our little 3-D glasses off ! We snickered at a 35-foot piece of foam-rubber with ugly fake teeth and we howled at the so-called actors who took part in this honey of a film. Inept is too kind a word to describe the thespian skills of those who grace this glorified middle school production. I wonder if Mr. Gossett or Mr. Quaid proudly include this masterpiece on their resumes? Honestly, Jaws 3 is so hysterically bad that it's actually fun. No, it's beyond fun -- it's an outright blast! It's kind of like one of those horrid 50's flicks -- ya know, something like \\"Godzilla Ate the Blob and Tossed His Cookies on Tokyo\\". Truly one of the worst films of all-time, one which I'm proud to admit I've watched at least a dozen times, Jaws 3 gets funnier with each viewing. It must be seen to be believed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. A very cheesy movie.","review":"Okay, as far as we know, great whites don't grow to 35 feet.

Jaws 3 doesn't seem to keep the plot as much as the 1st and 2nd. I would say it's ok, but it was lame (for a 13 year old or higher) and worse, what happened to the special effects? It looks like the shark is a drawing on paper, cut out and put onto the screen. (In some scenes) so does all the other special effects. I wouldn't suggest this movie if you want horror, or 3-D graphics. If your looking for any of those things, I would suggest the 1st Jaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE BEST!","review":"Jaws 3 can't beat Jaws1 and 2 but it is not that bad like Jaws 4.

The slow-moving plot is just a rip-off of Gorgo and the special effects are utterly laughable. Especialy ridiculous is the climax in which the mother shark's choppers fly towards the screen like the false teeth of some cartoon character. Utterly dire! The series should have stopped after the excellent Jaws 2 rather than dragging it down to this abominable level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull sequel has some virtues like...","review":"Originality, music, and the fact that doesn't hurt the original(unlike Jaws The Revenge does by pointlessly killing off Martin and Sean Brody).

Younger brother Sean(Who has aged about 12 years since Jaws 2!) comes to visit him and guess what..The Shark starts munchin'! The Shark has to create mayhem whenever the Brody's are around!

Originally released in theaters as 3D, the DVD is presented in 2D for some reason. The visuals look like someone put the film together using the MS Paint program on their computer. At times the shark actually looks as if it were cut and pasted on the background (and the shark itself screams \\"fake\\"). Terrible special effects, subpar performances from actors you expect better from (I'm looking at you Louis Gossett Jr). Even the soundtrack is bad bad bad. I just don't know what Universal was thinking when it released this film.

Good acting, tho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should I be cheering for the shark?","review":"The first two Jaws films kept you on the edge of your seat, seeing the characters as real people, hoping they'll make it. However, in Jaws 3, I couldn't endear myself to any of the characters, so I actually was backing our angry shark. If that was the intent of the filmmaker, then success was achieved. However, hoping that a shark will devour your characters isn't really scary. It's actually like backing your favorite football team, hoping the players get as many yards and touchdowns as possible. If you're all for Team Shark, you'll be pretty satisfied. I was entertained, but not so much that I'd waste my time with another viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"would give it 0 stars if I could","review":"This movie is, well, just about every bad thing I can possibly say about a movie.

From the unconvincing FX to the terrible storyline this jaws has no bite at all. The film was originally shown in 3-D and believe me it didn't save this clunker one bit. I saw this in a theater back it the day it I remember it looking terrible in 3 -D. Strangely enough, this is a sort of remake of Revenge of the Creature(from The Black Lagoon). The first film is a classic, the second film is fair and this third film is a bomb.....of course we have Jaw 4 - The Revenge, which is just stupid, but at least it's unintentionally funny. Skip this dud and Revenge too."},{"rating":"1","title":"honestly, who cares..............","review":"a shark invading Seaworld, wow, were the writers on drugs?

I mean, lets face it, this was always intended to be much more of a gimmick movie then it was about the continuing adventures of the Brody clan.I would pick this up in a minute if it was released as (maybe) a \\"midnight movie\\" with a pair of glasses and maybe a bag of popcorn or something. For a studio to roll this out there naked and expect people to buy it is just crazy. The movie stinks; it's simply not good enough to stand up on its on merit. Part of the reason people went to the theaters to see this was to catch it in 3-D; to take that away just doesn't make any sense. It was never meant to be without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should've stopped at Jaws 2....","review":"Disgracing the Jaws franchise, this movie was incredibly poor. Jaws 2 was decent, but this movie was trying to milk the Jaws name of everything it had, and it looks like it was already dry. Atrocious special effects and bad acting are abundant in this film. It was meant to be seen in 3d, but since probably 1 in a billion Americans has a pair of 3d glasses, these '3d effects' are just painful to look at. The best that can be said is that it is remotely entertaining to watch if you are feeling lazy and want to stay in bed on a Sunday afternoon and you happen upon it on TBS or TNT."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Thumbs WAY Down","review":"I'm sorry, but I hate this movie. It's not scarey, the special effects were done to be seen in 3-D and look REALLY bad on a TV, the acting is substandard, and the plot is pretty dumb. If you're a Jaws fan, avoid this film. There is nothing here except an excuse to make a 3-D movie with a shark in it. One positive note for this film. It's not scarey so it's probably the best Jaws movie for kids"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Like the First Two","review":"I remember seeing this in the theater when I was a kid but spent most of it with the 3-D glasses off my face. So I rented it the other night just for kicks and wow what an awful movie. It has none of the man vs nature and man vs man moments like in the first two. The 3-D effects make it seem even more of a joke. They use old shark footage for some of the scenes which in no way matches the scenes they are being used for. Very blah all around with no really interesting characters. You don't care about any of them really. Badly written, poorly shot, and just mediocre acting. Don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where oh where is it???","review":"I would love to review my DVD, however, I have yet to receive it!? Where could it be?

First of all there is no way a big 20 foot shark is going to fit inside the doors to get in Sea World. And like knowone would have noticed it in the tank before later in the movie. It was way to unrealistic and should never have been made just like so many other sequels. The story was dumb. Plain and simple. But the movie did have some interesting qualities to it. I liked how they brought back the Brody brothers. It took me at least 3 times to notice they were the Brody Brothers but hey it was cool when I did notice it. Also I did like how they did the ending.

Am I the only one that thought that this movie made me a little less intelligent when walking out. This was a special effects movie where the effects were not that special. As for acting, was there any? Does Arnold even speak English? His voice needs to be dubbed like in the good old days. The end was the only enjoyable part because this was where I was set free at last. This was over two hours of my life that I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gab you're the only good in this sh...film","review":"Well what can I say? Arnie chasing the Satan with a 9mm? Well I don't think this is the movie we need! Who would believe that a man can just run away from the Devil and hide from it that easily? I mean come on! The Devil is not that easy to deceive. Ok Gabriel was great again I can say that. That is why this film is two not one star. Not even worth it to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Arnie A Break","review":"Irrespective of where you are, I have the funny feeling that this film is made fun of or ridiculed by the general public & the critics. One thing about critics is they are paid to criticise movies. For that simple reason, I watched the movie anyway. Arnie just got better with age. Even though there's still an element of accent in his command of English, his acting ability is improving comparing with his Conan the Barbarian day. A lot of people are mocking fun of the story line but why should we take a movie that seriously? Isn't that the purpose of going to movie is to escape from reality? In terms of entertainment factor, it's superb with plenty of actions & sarcastic jokes. Arnie gave us a superb performance & so does Gabriel Bryne (a very different role from his other movie touching on spirituality, Stigmata). Well, credit also have to be given to Peter Hyams, the action director who had also directed Van Damme in TimeCop. Highly recommended especially for Arnie's fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one was evil, all right...","review":"I'm sure that this was designed to be a thought-provoking movie. Unfortunately, the only thoughts it provoked in me were to wonder how so much money could be wasted on such a bad movie. And it was BAD. Arnold Schwarzenegger is absolutely awful as Jericho, the Devil-killing bodyguard. Robin Tunney (the Devil's victim) looks clueless for most of the film. And Gabriel Byrne, as the Devil, just seems bored and mean. These aren't bad actors, either--I think that most of the fault lies with the script, which has cheesy lines and over-dramatic pauses. Plus, the action jumps from scene to scene so fast that it is often difficult to figure out what is going on--and this is hardly Shakespeare. Yuck. \\"End of Days\\" is only worth seeing to catch the special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comeback For Arnold!","review":"This is the first movie Arnold released after his heart surgery. End of Days will take your breathe away and leave you at the edge of your seat. Get ready for high speed action and thrills! This is one of the best action movies Arnold has ever made. If you loved Eraser and True Lies, then End of Days is the movie to buy and watch over and over. 5 Stars all the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Hollywood Action Trash","review":"I admit, the 'Terminator' movies were fun. It was pretty much the first time we saw science fiction mixed with action but it was delivered in a way that made it fun to watch. 'End of Days' is the antithesis of that. I don't even know what this is. If 'Rosemary's Baby' or the uncountable number of films you could compare this too were never made, it would still be sub-par at best. The story is cheesy, period. Satan, for no apparent reason, has to impregnate a woman on a certain date to have a son or something. Big muscular, depressed ex-cop must defeat the forces of evil while fighting inner demons (no pun intended). I have never been this bored for a complete movie. Even the top of the line special effects couldn't salvage this mess of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This movie was so horribly underrated. I loved it immediately when I saw it in the theaters. Byrne makes such a great villian and its wonderful to see Arnold back on the big screen. Although Robin Turney should just crawl back under that rock she hid in after Craft fame, I thought she was horrible.Highly recommended movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The embodiment of BAD","review":"Talk about every single element a movie can screw up on. All aspects were poorly executed. The script was full of flaws, and was bland and uninteresting. The acting was ludicrous. I love Gabriel Byrne and he did a decent job, but he doesn't save the movie. The directing was so horrible I was actually laughing. Cheap, lightning quick editing used in a completely wrong way. Peter Hyams's last film, 'The Relic', wasn't bad but seriously lacked. But this film is just awful. The special effects were ok for awhile, but they actually got worse as the movie progressed. There are a couple of good shots, but they are buried among a heap of complete idiocy. I'll never get those two hours back. Don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok.....let's buy it & offer it to our beloved mother-in-law","review":"What a piece of garbage this was, I'm glad I didn't go to the theater.

The plot line is laughable, ripe with gaping holes; the fx ultra-cheesy. Not even good for a laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply boring and bad acting","review":"if you compare this to arnis ohter action movies, this is one of the worst. I loved Terminator, True Lies, Total Recal and Eraser. This time, arni tries to play a deeper character and totally fails. You don't believe him a single scene, his austrian accend is just funny (first time i saw him in english). also the story and the directing are just average - it bores you right from the beginning - you don't buy the plot. Only david byrne's acting is quite amusing, but he has only two or three scenes of dialoge, where he can't develop a deep Satanic character. He can't compete with al pacino in any way. So to sum this up - this movie is about the same quality as Last Action Hero, forget about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A love it or hate it movie, and I love it!","review":"\\"End of Days\\" is not a great film but it certainly is an entertaining one and that is why I like it so much.

If you have absolutely nothing else to do, you've read everything in the house and a friend just happens to stop by with this movie in hand, sure, go ahead and watch it. But it's not worth going out of your way. Sorry Arnold. You should have left this one for Steven Segal."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of days","review":"I'm a big Arnold fan, It pains me to say this , but this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot was very formulaic, the characters lacked development, the special effects were old hat. I like to suspend reallity for a good sci-fi flick but this movie was entirely non-plausible from the very beginning. Had it not been for the audio effects that really shined on my home theater system, the movie would be better placed on mystery science theater. Dont waste your time, watch the weather channel this evening instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not In The List of Schwarzenegger's good movies","review":"Among Schwarzenegger's good movies (not best), i can't consider this movie.

Arnold made his work as usual, this to say like a man without brain who wants to destroy everything. The violence in that movie is gratuitous, if I were Swarzy I would retire immediately. You could see that movie as you eat a hamburger, it is the same product. To finish, i can say that Arnold destroys everything, include the cinema !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving for the religous!","review":"I feel that Arnold did a great job with this movie! It makes you think about the way you are living- does Satan try & get you on his side? If you are religous, you will be scared watching this movie, I was very powerfully moved by this movie even though it was not real it made me rethink my religion & beliefs. Hollywood made you think about God & the devil. I think it is a must see for all! Very good flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is just enough","review":"This is one of the lousiest films Arnold has ever made! I usually enjoy his films, and because they are usually so ridiculous I find myself laughing more than being scared. *End of Days* was too pathetic to laugh; it was just plain stupid and gory - very gory. (Do not let children watch this!) As usual the script is lousy; special effects are nevertheless amazing.The only reason this film deserves one star is Gabriel Byrne: He was the perfect actor to play Satan.If you're looking for *T2* and the like, stay away from this. *End of Days* is in NO way similar to Arnold's previous films. If you want to waste your time, the way I did, take your chances and rent or buy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"ICK?","review":"Okay, I am not going to totally diss this movie. But personally, I hate movies with Arnoald what's a netor, or what... For the story line, and the very very neat graphics this was a let down. It was a little slow, and you had to dig to understand the stuff, and it's all church, stuff and things, and it was really kind of bad.

No, and that's what it's going to stay at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again...","review":"The idea of satan's return to earth around new year 99/00 is very predictible.

Otherwise, it was a flop!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie could have been better","review":"Arnold usually does not go wrong (he was really young when he did Hercules In New York, so let's give him a break) but this movie is surprisingly dull. I am not at all convinced that the actor who is supposed to be the Devil comes even close to fulfilling the expectations from his role. Overall, I don't think that the concept behind the script is bad (and even if it is, Arnold is notorious for compensating for such shortcomings by saying \\"get down!\\" or something)but everything else, including the supposed \\"horror\\" this movie \\"inspires,\\" is rather disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST action movies ever.","review":"This is basically every action movie sequence all jumbled up into a very predictable piece of trash.

Trust me, stay away from this one, buy Terminator or Running Man or something..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Rollercoaster ride!","review":"Forget Stigmata which takes itself way too seriously. Give me Arnold and the Anti-Christ! This DVD is a fun popcorn-muching romp, beautifully photographed, killer surround sound, great special effects, and enough explosions and scares to satisfy. It also loads up aplenty on the extra features. Don't miss the Devil's Playground special effects section!Okay, so the plot has a few holes, and Arnold's attempts at drama make Pia Zadora look like Liv Ullman, but thankfully those scenes are short and few. And with Gabriel Byrne playing the most delicious, sexy, tongue in cheek Devil-May-Care, it balances out Arnie's shortcomings. The ending also gets a wee bit silly when Satan turns into a monster that is a cross between Alien and Ursula the Evil Octopus in Little Mermaid."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ONE OF ARNIE'S BEST","review":"I had rather high hopes when I rented this DVD, but alas, the plot is silly, the acting (with the exception of Gabriel Byrne) is amateurish (sorry Arnie, but the hype of this being your most emotional role leaves me laughing) and the dialogue is embarassing. I'm only giving the film two stars because of the special effects, which alone make this turkey an interesting watch. A much better film in the same genre is \\"Stigmata\\". Hey Arnie, have you considered retiring and going into politics?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst movie Arnold has done.....","review":"Remember Last Action Hero? Well, this one is better, but that does not say much. Most action films have poor acting and this one is no exception, in fact, this one has worse acting than the usual.

Unfortunately, it does not save the film from being just a special effects nightmare.

Its mindlesss, souless excess, without a single creative idea in evidence. I don't expect intellectual inspiration from an Arnold movie, but one should at least get some great action sequences and something approaching continuity in the story.

I got explosions, guns, foul language and even some mild nudity. I don't know about you people, but that is what I pay for in an R-rated action flick about battling the Devil. Give Arnold some credit for still displaying more dramatic range than Sly, Van Damme, and Seagal have in all of their last ten movies combined while still not really even trying. Not the best action flick in recent years, but still better than most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative and routine","review":"OK, I finally saw it on cable. Yuck. Though I only have myself to blame if I'm surprised it's bad. The movie makers tried to cash in the apprehension some Religious Right nuts tried to create concerning the Millennium. In a sense, this movie was inevitable. What a story line. It's derived from countless other movies. I was going to list some, nbut there are just too many. Mostly fair acting. Arnold was flat, as usual. Tunney? Eh. She's a cutie-pie with a nice chest. That's about it. Byrne, though, was quite good as Satan. I especially enjoyed the conversation between Byrne and Arnold in Arnold's apartment. It warmed my atheistic heart. Maybe that was the movie's high point. Heck, I can see myself watching it quite often when there's no actual good stuff on TV.

A big suprise was Byrnes performance as Satan. If you doubt it, you won't after that first scene where he was taken over by Lucifer. CGI was very good, sound was great and the sets were dark.

I recently saw it for myself, and I discovered something shocking: the movie isn't that bad.Arnold plays a former cop-turned security agent, who must protect a young woman from being impregnated by Satan. This has been foretold to happen in the final hour of the year 1999. If Satan succeeds, the world is doomed. But, hey, we got Arnold Schwarzenegger to save us -- humanity's got a fighting chance.While the movie can have some nagging inconsistincies, and the plot stretches what credibility is has, the movie seems to work. Arnold tries to mature in this movie, by showing that his old style of doing things may not work anymore, in one of the most memorable scenes.It's not a terrible movie and it's not an amazing one, but it's worth checking out at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Formulaic Ahhnuld Movie","review":"After losing $7 and two hours of my life seeing this at the theatre it is time to get petty revenge/vent. This movie contains another typical \\"action\\" plot that is predictable and full of dull characters. This can be balanced out with great action which this movies lacks. The acting is...well nevermind. The dialogue is unintentionally funny, but that does not justify owning this movie. The real tragedy here is Gabriel Byrne, who is the man, in a horrid movie. If you really NEED to see a supernatural type of movie see The Sixth Sense again or take a nap. To sum it up over the hill action hero, bad script, no action, good trailer and marketing= every bad HOLLYWOOD movie. On the plus side the explosions sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Satan gets blowed up real good","review":"Comparing the Exorcist to this movie is like comparing Laurence Olivier's Hamlet to Godzilla versus Mechagodzilla. Interesting that so many people applauded Gabriel Byrne's portrayal of Satan. How would they know? Perhaps this movie appeals to satanists.

In the meantime, viewers are subjected to a bad, done before script,hammy acting, and violence out the wazoo! I had some higher hopes for this film ( at least as far as you can hope for with a Schwarzenegger film)as the trailers made it look like he was typed a little bit out of cast. But as soon as Arnold has to save Robin Tunney from the the incarnation of the Devil ( played very badly by the usually enjoyable Gabriel Byrne), he turns back to the action hero everyone loved before his surgery sidelined his career. Ultimately, it is a predictible film at best, and one that won't put Arnold back on the map.

I am not Catholic, but I am a Christian, and I took offense to much of this film. For my friends' sake, I endured it until the final scene, when a possessed Schwarzenegger looks up at a portrait of the agonal Christ on the cross, and says: \\"you died for nothing.\\" I stood and walked out, along with a friend of mine.

They are just there to be enjoyed, to get a couple of hours of escapism entertainment. Among the baloney, however, are a few profound statements of truth. Rod Steiger provides them as a priest in the film. Unfortunately, the devil (Gabriel Byrne) has some, too!Overall, the story is very involving, so much so that it that at 125 minutes it can wear you.

But I do not recommend full price renting or buying of this DVD. This film could have been potentially very good, the idea is neat but it fails on all levels.Arnold is great.

Let it suffice to say this: so far as I can recall, this was the first and only time a movie forced me to get up and leave the theatre. I don't know what's wrong with the people who've given it five stars, and I don't want to know. But I was so dismayed by their approval of this garbage that I felt some sort of corrective was in order. Hopefully, this review will suffice for that purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad movie","review":"This movie has great special effects, lots of gratuitous sex and violence but the plot is predictable.

Not worth remembering except that I could have seen a better movie in those 2 hours. Gabriel Byrne impressed again, and there were some hot chix, that can't cover for a terrible movie.

Why?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful movie","review":"End of Days - I just bought this movie on DVD and I feel so ripped off - the movie has some of the worst acting I've ever seen (Arnie is ok) - the girl in it is awful, Arnie's friend in the show is awful. Gabriel Byrne isn't convincing as Satan and corny lines are just out of place - the subwoofer works well on numerous occasions and visually it's ok, but the plot is bad, the script is worse and the acting is ridiculous - reminds me of cheesy low budget acting.save your money, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of those movies that twists religion.","review":"This movie is totally ridiculous. A burned-out cop (Arnold) with little or no faith stopping the devil who seems to have a Y2K plus a girl problem? hollywood movies like this is another perfect example of twisting biblical text to wow an unwary audience.

Mediocre acting combined with a pseudo-religious plot equals another movie flop.Watch Last Action Hero instead...that was a far better movie than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pepys Diary","review":"This is the best, easiest to understand of all the Pepys' writings I have read.The illustrations are very well done.PS.

Sure, they can make a few stupid songs like \\"Say I Yi Yi\\" that get radio and videoplay for awhile, but as far as a really good album, no they can't do that. I'm giving this album 2 stars because it has \\"Say I Yi Yi\\" and \\"By Myself\\" which are hits that were enjoyable for a few minutes. This album might really be worth a dollar, but thats being generous. If you enjoy listening to a group of people who want to make noise instead of music, then this is for you.

You install it, it works for a while, and then magically disappears so no apps will recognize it. This has happened on multiple systems, so there is a flaw at their end, not just one configuration file on one PC. Even EpsonScan does not recognize it.

My primary purpose was scanning 5x7 and 4x5 B+W film and it has been great. Very impressed with the dust remoavl feature and when unsharp mask is applied in photoshop the sharpness is great. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this scanner for medium to large format film scanning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance","review":"I bought this scanner for scanning x-rays & slide films.

I purchased and returned a Microtek i900 because I didn't like the gray reflective document mat. I use scanners frequently to copy and digitize documents and wanted a white reflective mat.The Epson Perfection 4990 does a superb job with photos, documents, and film. I'm extremely happy with this purchase and feel I've obtained a scanner that will meet my needs for years to come.If you expect to scan in any film or prints that are creased or torn, make sure you get a scanner with Digital Ice. Nothing compares to this technology -- it's a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice step up","review":"I've used plenty of Epson scanners before but this one does top the cake. It turns out beautiful scans of photographs and does an amazing job with 35mm slides and film negatives.I would have given the scanner a 5 star rating except that there were a few issues. The first is that a high end scanner such as this should have a Firewire pass through so that it can be part of a longer chain of devices. Secondly, I'm using the scanner on a Mac OS X machine and the software took a few tries before the entire package loaded. I also get some \\"application unexpectedly quit\\" when quitting out of the application. Lastly, although the results of the 35mm slide scans were fantastic getting up and running was a little less than intuitive.If you want a great general purpose photo scanner, don't hesitate on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overall","review":"Love the scanning quality, speed, film options. The only thing that I wish it had was software that came with my last scanner where I could scan in multiple pages to one document and create PDFs from existing documents. This one you have to scan the pages in separately and combine them later, and you can only scan in as a PDF, not create from existing files."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epson 4990","review":"A very good machine with high resolution for a good price but it has a delicate feel to it. Film and slide holders are flimsy and will not stand up to heavy use. Software installs easily, runs well and dust removal feature works better than expected but is a little slow despite the USB 2 connection. It arrived undamaged, but it is not well protected in it's shipping coantainer. Overall, however I'm pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agreement with Monsarrat","review":"The intro by Monsarrat contains the statement \\"No one save a power maniac, a sadist, or a nautical romantic can hold any brief for submarine warfare. It is a repellent form of human behavior\\".How true. In recent years it has become popular to idolise the role of a U-Boat Captain. Whilst taking nothing from them from life within the confines of an 'iron coffin', it was one thing to match wits with a surface warship and a very definite other, to sink defenseless merchant ships without warning. That did not take courage or bravery to accomplish. This is from one who was on the receiving end of a tin fish."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is bested only by Iron Coffins and The Boat","review":"Don't miss out on this one.You have action packed history:the Gibraltar passage,underwater fuelling,snorkelling,the southern cross,three boat passages of the Biscay,command intricacies and combat,a Nicholas Monsarrat (The Cruel Sea ) introduction and a fantastic tale of escape and surrender to Argentina 3 months after the end of the war,leading to suspicion of a possible Hitler escape.A must read if you can find it.Mind you I have read many many books on U Boat war,including the 2 volumes of Hitler's U Boat war and Operation Drumbeat.Contrary to those history books this one gets you down in the sub.Hold your breath and dive."},{"rating":"2","title":"No translator mentioned","review":"I read the 1957 reprint of 1952 edition. Paperback. No translator is mentioned and this gives the impression that the book might have been written in English by Shaeffer himself. But reader remains in doubt.Monsarrat's introduction (is he also the translator??)is out of place and unprofessional. We are trying to look at things from German point of view and this guy finds it an occasion to give us another dose of the victor's ramblings.The book finishes leaving the reader in want of a few more paragraphs of information on author's life after war, but all that's given is one sentence. I wished there were later books by Schaeffer one could read but as far as I know this is the only one he wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for serious actors","review":"I ordered this book in hopes of finding what it promised...some fresh new material that could possibly give one \\"an unfair advantage\\" in the audition process. In spite of a few negative reviews I'd read on these pages, I chose to believe the positive ones because I had some important auditions coming up and I WANTED this book to be all it promised. I NEEDED it to be ~~ and it wasn't. I eagerly read every single piece and there was not one monologue appropriate for or worthy of a serious adult actor or actress, no matter what his or her level of experience. These might be \\"okay\\" for introducing high school students to drama. But with all due respect to Pierce and Onorato, as an acting teacher as well as performer, writer, and director, I just couldn't justify asking a student of ANY age to chose to commit to any of this material over the works of some of our great - and even not-so-great - playwrites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and Direct - Excellent Book","review":"I have the book and the video that came together and I found it very helpful. Where else will you find Monologues that are just a minute long. It's also nice because JP cuts to the chase and tells you what you what to focus on, as well as the strenghs of each monologue. I'm glad I have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising!","review":"The colors of this cutting board are NOTHING like the picture, instead it consists of muted green and blues -- very dull -- instead of the vibrant oranges and purples which were apparently enhanced to promote false advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even nicer looking when you see it yourself!","review":"My uncle is a chef (really a cook) and an avid outdoorsmen. I was so happy to see this gift. I thought it would be perfect for him. He had an early Christmas with us so unwrapped it yesterday. He made a big deal about it and seemed to really like it. He said he would definitely use it. It comes in a nice box and lookes too nice to be a cutting board, but I know my uncle will use it. He seemed honestly pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very attractive","review":"This is a very attractive cutting board. I like that it is glass for when I'm cutting something like raw chicken, which I don't want getting contaminated inside knife created grooves on the board over time. I take off one star because each time I wash it it seems to get wet between the glass and design. Over time that may cause problems the way water normally does, as it doesn't dry as fast between the two. Right now though it is a nice little extra to have both functionality and beauty in my kitchen tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got mine autographed!","review":"This album was the Bobs answer to the \\"unplugged\\" craze of the 1990s. The Bobs \\"plugged in\\" and used various electronic effects to distort their voices on some of the songs here. For example, Joe Bob used feedback to make his voice sound like an electric guitar on several songs here. They also used toy drums and cardboard boxes for percussion on a few songs. The resulting album is my personal favorite Bobs album. It has their trademark vocal harmonies and humorous songs. Songs about singing, tattoos, bumper sticker slogans, hungry astronauts, obituaries, coffee, love, smoke, neo-beatniks, outlet malls and Andy Kaufman. What more can you ask for? There is also an unlisted bonus track, which is a brief clip of producer Scott Mathews practicing on the toy drums for \\"Meat on the Moon\\". Buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The foundations of a great band...","review":"This album makes clear how Accept was destined to be a great metal band. Although slightly different fromtheir breakthrough album RESTLESS AND WILD, it's clear since the word \\"go\\" how he musicians were skilled and creative.This album has eight strong songs. even the repetitive chorus of \\"I'm A Rebel\\" will get to you. The ballad \\"The King\\" is very good. In short, I love all the songs here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can one song make the CD?","review":"Yes, when that song is \\"Street of Dreams.\\" It is the best ever by Blackmore et al. \\"Can't Let You Go\\" is some righteous powerful vocals; dessert if you will to the main dish and another reason to grab this CD. The best part is neither song has anything to do with the Knights, Wizards or Dragons. That little banjo player (thanx Ian) really had gotten quite bent, but with this collection was bent back INTO shape. Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"I've just bought this cd, and I like it very much. My favorite songs on this album are: 'Fire Dance' and 'Drinking with the Devil'. The rest of the songs are very good also. The songs 'Anybody there' and 'Snowman' are instrumental. I dont like that. 'Anybody there' is okay, but 'Snowman' is just boring. But the rest of the songs are very good. 'Street of dreams' became a great hit. I have to say that I like 'Straight between the eyes' better than this album. But that doesn't mean that I dont recommend this album to you! If you are a Rainbow fan, you must have this album. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good Album!","review":"I always loved this album. A better one out of the three Rainbow albums with Joe Lynn Turner.

I thought every song on this album was absolutely decent, The singer Joe Lynn Turner kinda sounds like dio so for what ever reason dio left this singer was a great replacement for dio, the keyboardist David Rosenthal probably not like toney carey but he's a fine wicked keyboard wizard for these great songs and ritchie blackmore's guitar's were wickedly awesome!My advice: Say no to the radio and buy some rainbow albums!\\\\m/ Stay metal \\\\m/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Hits Bottom","review":"This is BY FAR the worst Rainbow album. With the exception of \\"Street of Dreams\\" and \\"Can't Let You Go\\", this album is a complete throwaway. This shows a group that is completely bereft of ideas, both musically and lyrically. Blackmore's guitar playing has rarely been more mediocre and the lyrics sound recycled and stale. It sounds as if very little time was spent making this album; like it took about 30 seconds to write each song. It is not surprising that Rainbow broke up after making this; there was obviously nothing left for them to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BOTTOM.. Look at the lyrics !","review":"I dont'know how it happen, but Blackmore allowed singer Joe Lynn Turner to take complete control of the song's themes, and we Rainbow fans were obligued to hear lousy tittles as \\"Can't let YOu Go\\", and other titles that seem more like Poison. Turner always wanted to sing this horrible lyrics (he did it again when singing for Malmsteen in \\"Odyssey\\"). Sad !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after just 2 years!","review":"I like to cook, and I like a good sturdy carving knife; that's why I bought this one.

I questioned the design when I first saw them advertised, but saw several good reviews so went ahead and bought them. DON'T Be fooled! They may work great for some little PC type speakers that weigh a couple pounds, but when tasked with holding an 8 pound speaker, they just drooped, no matter how tight the ball fitting. Don't waste your money on this unless you have really light speakers. I am very disappointed because I've had good luck with some of Omnimount's other products. Also the included hardware was junk! Had to go to the hardware store to get decent mounting hardware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for small speakers","review":"These mounts are a good idea for small speakers, but do not attempt to hang a speaker approaching the rated weight.

This book gives me the feeling that it is someone else's work and not Kenyon's.

The more I read about Ash (& there was alot in this book) the more I want his story. I hope it will be coming soon. The main characters Valerius and Tabitha were great. The Daimons in this book were very strong and difficult to beat. There were some very unexpected deaths. I won't say more.

I also believe Ms. Kenyon to be a wonderful author. I'm just really suprised that I enjoyed this novel that much!! Throughout the other novels you develop a natural dislike for \\"Val\\". It's not something you can really help since you're existing in the perspective of the other characters. Since they hate him, it rubs off on you. That's why i wasn't too thrilled about reading his story. But as soon as I picked it up I couldn't put it down. I love \\"Val\\"! He's nothing that I expected him to be. Ms. Kenyon is a genius. It takes a skilled writer to affect peoples consiousness and she's done it. This and her other novels are definitely worth the read. Keep'em coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"You really can't go wrong reading this series. Each one brings you further into the world of the Dark Hunter that gets deeper. Great story line. It grabs your imagination and doesn't let go. I really hate finishing this book. You just want it to continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seize the Night (Dark-Hunter, Book 7)","review":"Even though I am not a romantic, I love Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark-Hunter series. Haven't read one yet that wasn't very entertaining. Good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light-hearted Enjoyable Book","review":"I believe this book is one of Sherrilyn Kenyon's best of the Dark Hunter series. I love the strong female (Tabitha) character and she can fight together with the rest of the Dark Hunters, in spite of her being human and mortal. And off course, I love the hero Valerius, the Roman General turned Dark Hunter. Very enjoyable good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Dark Hunter book.","review":"This book was a very short, but a delicious Dark Hunter book. Val is uptight and doesn't know how to relax and Tabitha can't wait to get him out of his element. And does she! With that aspect only being part of the story, the other part is her family dealing with Val, this is truly one of the better Dark Hunter stories. Oh, and a very dark turn for Squire Nick in this book, I can't believe it! One book closer to Acheron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelved until a later time","review":"This is the first (and most likely only) Sherrilyn Kenyon book I've read. The premise sounded interesting, given that I'm an Anne Rice fan (mostly her early Lestat and Lasher books).This is book 7 of a series on immortal Dark-Hunters who hunt vampires. This book centers on Tabitha and Valerius. Tabitha is a human who hunts vampires and it's during one of her hunts that she meets Valerius, a Dark-Hunter disliked by everyone else.I haven't been able to finish the book, not so much the plot, but SK's writing style. She is constantly going on about how this guy is so sexy and all about their sexuality and deliciousness and then doing the same for the next guy. It gets old after a few lines. And her sex scenes seem to go on forever. Don't get me wrong, I love a good sex scene in a book, but when its pages and pages of it...After reading half the book, I haven't learned anything but what I've written above."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Job Well Done!!!","review":"I was so suprised to find this book better then I expected it to be. I could not put it down, it made cry, laugh, and it was filled with tons of passion that you wouldn't believe. Sherrilyn Kenyon does a wonderful job of developing her character and setting the mood. I never imagined myself reading these types of books, but thanks to Kenyon I have now read all her Dark-Hunter Novels. I suggest you read one of her books, you might be suprised how hard it will be to put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellence in customer services","review":"i had an issue with my order and it was taken care promptly and with great sensitivity. you can trust this seller"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Adventure, Couldn't put it down!!!","review":"Once again Sherrilyn Kenyon has forced me to read all night long. I couldn't put this book down. My heart went out to Valerius so strong so upright, till Tabitha enters his domain, and shakes it up a bit. You can feel the sparks immediately from these too. This book as well as all other Dark Hunter books just grabs you and keeps you reading till the very last page, which is hard to come too cause you want it to go on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm a big Kenyon fan but she seems to have lost her gift for story-telling in these last books. I find that I not interested in what is happening between the hero and heroine and more interested in information from past characters. And that is not even entertaining. Kenyon needs to focus more on her story instead of promoting her series. Lately, her books seem to be rushed out. Perhaps that is the fault of the publisher but I find that I am willing to wait 2 weeks for the library to get it to me instead of purchasing. Certainly that is not good for the Publisher.Wait and get it from your library. If you are new to the Dark-hunter series, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dislikeable Heroine","review":"So this might not be a fair review of this book because I became tired of the heroine after page 20 or so that I just put the book down and returned it to the library this morning. I'm not cool with any main characters inflicting mortal wounds on other protagonists, even and especially accidentally. If the Hero weren't a DH than he'd have been dead and when she noticed she'd stabbed a man who was not a daemon, she didn't seem particularly perturbed. I've liked Tabitha in the other books, but she didn't seem as smart-alecky in the beginning of this one. Also there was nothing really unique about Valerius. I was just bored with it and I decided this one would SO not be a good use of my evening. Anyway so I'll read the next one and hope it gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A heroine who doesn't need to be protected...well, sort of","review":"I was so hoping for a heroine who didn't need to be protected, who has a man in her life who sees her as an equal, to stand beside him, not behind him....and a hero whose male ego isn't disturbed at the idea and doesn't have to fight the urge to 'protect' her....well, close."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Writers","review":"I could not put this book down once I stared and I finished it in one sitting. It was a great read from beginning to end with twists and turns that surprise even the most devoted dark-hunter readers. More about Ash and a new dark-hunter that you would never guess. I am still trying to put it all together and I can't wait for the next in this series. Keep them coming Ms. Kenyon. They get better and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I'd hoped for","review":"I purchased these headphones to listen to my iPod nano while at my desk at work. They are open-backed which allows me to hear the phone ring or other people talking when played at moderate volume levels. The fit well and are easy to put on or take off but don't dislodge when I bend over or stoop. I hoped they might have the same speaker elements in them that Koss puts in their KTXPRO1s (a very fine, inexpensive over-the-head model) but sadly, that's not the case. These have only barely adequate bass and high frequencies that can get a bit harsh. iPod's pre-set EQs can make them listenable.Pros: light, comfortable, can fold up into a little ball (doesn't really make them any more compact but looks cool)Cons: so-so sound"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slamboring?","review":"Too many matches that we had no reason to care about.

Nearly every song just feels honest and real; as usual, Free dips deeper into his emotions than most rappers in his genre and pulls more out as a result to show for it. Suga Free's relentless enthusiasm for the lifestyle he leads is well-known in Southern California, and it and his sense of humor about it come across on every song. If some of the tracks on the album feel inconsistent, it's probably more because the singles - \\"U Know My Name\\" and \\"So Fly\\" (featuring Snoop Dogg) - are just so catchy by comparison that it leaves the listener wanting more. \\"The Ranger\\" is also amazing, featuring a backing beat with (of all things) an *alternative rock* melody as backing. It's great!On the whole, a witty, wonderful effort. Play on, playa!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Add Water is Just Run Out.","review":"Just Add Water is an average album with suga free doing what a cool west coast rapper should be doing is making the typical commercial west coast songs, although some featuring snoop dogg were good, but the rest is just over the top predictableness and overrated lyrics.Although it does have a nice premise, but the album is confusedThumbs Down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lewrie in the Adriatic as Napoleon Rises","review":"Commander Alan Lewrie continues aboard HMS Jester, this time trying to thwart the French in the Adriatic as the French armies begin to seem unstoppable under the command of the up-and-coming General Bonaparte.

I, personally, am so sick of the show it's pathetic but she loves it. It goes on the minute she wakes up until the minute she goes to sleep. I think that says a lot in itself. As much as I've grown to hate Blue's Clues, she has learned a lot from it. It is educational and entertaining at the same time. Take it from a 16 month old, she knows what she likes and Blue's Clues tops her list. It has replaced everything, even all of her toys!

While the book the represent is there, it is clearly a poorly done reprint. Pages do not line up within the text as the format is larger than the original text. There is no table of contents and in most cases when there is a list, I am left with the impression that the person working with the material has no clue how to use a word processor. It is certainly not the book they show when you look at the \\"view inside\\" option. The DeCapo introduction is not there. I have never had to return a book to Amazon before, however in this case I think I am making an exception as this is a terrible version of one of the great examples of bibliographical history.

The first several chapters where fine but when references were made about the bachelor party and the FOB attending, I was shocked. It made references to lap dances, nude women, and other things I don't care to mention. I thought it was inappropriate to suggest that those activities are expected. Not every one indulges in those kind of activities and we are proud to say our future son in law wouldn't dishonor our daughter in that way. The problem was that it just didn't mention it in one place but it was repeated in several areas. I think there could have been more pertinent information for the FOB rather than wasting pages on distasteful decriptions. I am glad I bought the book used, but it was wasted $4.

As such, the scoops were so big the cookies didn't cook evenly - undercooked in the middle, overcooked along the edges.Not only that, the little metal scraper broke off on the second or third use. Fortunately, I was able to reattach it, but a cookie or two later, it broke off again. It did this same thing for ice cream, too. What were the designers thinking?!I replaced it with Oxo's Good Grips Cookie Scoop (large size) from Amazon and couldn't be happier. It's sturdy and scoops the perfect amount of cookie dough so the cookies are cooked evenly throughout and consistently sized.I ended up tossing this Oxo Good Grips ice cream scoop in the trash.

They are, or course, equipped with a wide array of really cool guns and gadjets. They also have an arsenal of one liners and dry comments to spout when faced with combat.This book, and the others in this series, read like an ill conceived Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. If you like a good laugh, pick one up.

The Thin Man is a statement of the good life, and included are plenty of style and sexiness. Nick and Nora Charles are the greatest, most reasonably decadent couple and the final, best commentary on the American high life that was thrown into such relief by the foil of Prohibition. Sure, there's a murder mystery, but there's also raw roast beef and onions, plenty of onions, from an all-night deli, washed down with perpetual scotch and soda. ...

Most of the time the novel or story is fuller than the movie due to the short media time and the target audience. In this case, the novel does have a better-developed plot and is more cohesive. The characters are more true to form and there is a real Rosewood/Rosebrien. However, the book characters are more sinister and Dorothy is sleazy. I planed to make this the last story I would read by Dashiel Hammett. However, others tell me I just picked the wrong one to start with.The film on the other hand, was modified to give a lighter approach. It is the film that I will think of as the real \\"Thin Man\\" and Maureen O'Sullivan as the real Dorothy that was concerned about her father.

This recording is exactly the same. Unfortunately, here we are supposed to take the characters seriously. The unintentional humor lasts about five minutes, after which I turned it off and listened to Firesign.The contrast between the realistic male narrator's voice and the absurd falsetto of the females creates a jarring disconnect. Although I did finally listen to all six disks, I never really lost myself in the narrative.Next time, how about just reading the story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Asta be the best","review":"What do I love about this book?

I just wish Hammett had been a little more prolific."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cynical martini w/a spash of bitters, garnished w/ murder","review":"For those of you who allow amature reviewers to guide your reading decisions, know this: Those reviews that talk about the book as being about a \\"destructive relationship\\" and the characters of Nick and Nora Charles as the user and the willing usee have made the mistake of not reading the actual text on the page, but instead have tried to apply some late-twentieth century literaty criticism, which they don't fully know how to apply, paired with the social-moral attitides toward blatant alcoholism and frivolity, to a book that is simply what it purports to be: a detective novel with imperfect characters and a perfectly logical final twist. If they find Nick Charles to be a violent womanizer, one can only imagine what they have made of Chandler's Marlowe . . . although I wouldn't be surprised to find similarly misinformed opinions of those books by the same reviewers if I could be bothered to look for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun fun!!","review":"I imagine for people way into the detectival genre, this is not the book for them. However, the characters in this book are a hoot!! Nobody's telling anyone the whole truth, no one is sure who they can trust. The mystery, as with everything else in this novel, is a bit bizarre, but I think the important part of this book is the characterization. The Wynants/Jorgensons are all nuts. Many of the men are womanizers and boozers. And then there's Nick and Nora. They are one of the most fun couples I've read about. You get the impression that Nora doesn't know much about Nick's past (and really doesn't care). Nick is a good deal older than her, but she has money, so that's all that matters. They are probably the best part of this book. Overall, it is just a fun book to spend an evening with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the movie, instead","review":"Having come off of reading Maltese Falcon and watching the Thin Man movie, I had high expectations for the book. Unfortunately I found it extremely dull, and the characters Nick and Nora, who are so vibrant and alive on screen, are two dimensional alcoholic drips on paper.

I actually wished, while slogging through, that all of the characters would die so that I could stop reading.None of the characters feel real and the prose itself is choppy. I realize that I'm looking at this novel through modern eyes, which is unfair, but it seemed that all the women do is cry, lie, and answer the phone, which grates on my nerves.If it weren't required for school, I would have been done with this book two pages in.

It has brilliant character developement thru out. You can even see \\"the Thin man\\" even though he never makes an appearence. My habit is the listen to it initially to hear the story, plot, etc. Then immediately listen to it a couple more times to see if there are any gafts, errors, etc. There are none. The only thing I'm not sure of is why a sudden narative on a wild west cannibal even though Dash does fit it in for no apparent reason. It has nothing to do with the story.The narrative is excellent, the story is classic. And if you think, you'll justwatch the movie instead, you'll miss a lot.

Somehow this became used as a farce by Dean Martin. One can only wonder why the filmmakers would want to waste money buying rights to Matt Helm when they didn't intend to use anything from the books, or create a character even vaguely comparable. Even the James Bond series in its early incarnations had some relationships to Fleming, although it too ultimately degenerated into farce until Daniel rescued it.

Where else can you see a character get boozed up on the road and not have to pay the price.This boxset was supposed to come out on August 2, and then Sony did something weird.

I was a kid in the 60s and Matt Helm was the anti-Bond, an American spy who totally out-cooled that British guy. Definitely not to be taken seriously but a fun romp on a retro weekend of martinis and lounge music.

I've seen all of his westerns except for \\"Something Big\\" which was not yet released on VHS or DVD. His westerns are all enjoyable. Back to Helm . . . . these are very colorful spy spoofs filled with gorgeous ladies and Dean's wisecracking antics. I think anyone with a sense of humor would enjoy these films.

I cannot figure out what Elvis got pissed off about? The fact the uses the \\"lavatory\\" three times before a show? His fear of flying?

Oh, and there's that goofy chapter about letting some guy borrow a van. (???) Seriously, it gets so tedious and boring I just skimmed the last few chapters for anything relating to the band, but found nothing and closed the book. I have no idea why this book could be cited for causing problems between Bruce and Elvis.

There's no denying that Bruce Thomas is a superlative bass player...but as a writer, he just should not have bothered. I suspect this trash was induced by an overindulgence in halucinogenic dabbling. He appears to be an unappreciative and bitter soul. Such a pity for such a talented musician. But I will grant you this, I never was a big fan of the British low-brow sense of humor to begin with...I just don't get it.

There also didn't seem to be much \\"give\\" in the tongs' hinge, which made gripping food difficult. I've never had a problem with Oxo tools before, but I abandoned these in favor of my old kitchen tongs.The other tools in the set seem fine, however. Perhaps it's better to buy individually."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs tuning","review":"I would not recommend this book for \\"power tuning\\" tips.

I was looking for such information as which brakes are best for my application, or which carb is best for performance and which is best for fuel economy. The book does tell a little bit about this kind of info, just not to the extent I was looking for. It did tell a bit about what is the best exhaust system to use, so that made me happy.

The authors even walk you through several sample applications to show you \\"hands on\\" programing with the controls.Unfortunately, they don't cover all of the Windows Forms controls, and leave out a few of the basics. However, the ones they have left out seem to be the more basic controls that don't require a lot of advanced explanation.Overall, this book is good material for your bookshelf for those times when you need to verify, or learn, how a control works.

They do get a little repetitive in places, since the author can't tell if you have read any others of the series. Hence he has in every book to explain that the Baker rifle is slower to load than a musket, but more accurate; and he always has to belabor the point of the British army having officers of very mixed competence, due to their having bought their commissions instead of earning them. Perhaps the custom prevailed even later, since, in World War I it is said the German General Staff referred to the British soldiers as \\"lions, led by donkeys.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The usual twists and turns","review":"I love all of Cornwell's Sharpe stories.

I wasn't disappointed; this is a terrifically goofy, fun piece of work, that serves as marvelous entertainment if you don't take it too seriously. Sharon Stone is solid (in the one of the few roles I've seen her do where she actually acted), and Michael Douglas is surprisingly good, playing a nastier variation on all of his \\"middle-aged-white-male-who-sleeps-with-younger-women\\" roles.

The movie is a must see , and that film will not leave anyone indifferent."},{"rating":"2","title":"BASIC INSTINCT A MUST HAVE ON BLU-RAY DISC","review":"Basic Instinct has been released several times on DVD, but this is the first incarnation on High Definition disc. This BLU-RAY disc will probably be the best presentation of this film on video. Director Paul Verhoeven's raw, sexy, gory thriller is his best American film.

Composer Jerry Goldsmith contributes a magnificent score.Only available on BLU-RAY HD with great picture and sound this disc is a knockout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"miserable movie","review":"I'm sorry, but this is just a ridiculous movie.To me, the writing is stilted and feels false, for lack of a better word. The acted is consistently overdone and the direction is so calculated and false (again) that, to my mind, this movie is simply a waste of time. As a study of supposedly \\"kinky\\" sex, again, just dumb; it feels to me to be so obviously done to titilate the mainstream.So many movies have been done so much better on so many levels than this thing. Just pathetic to see attention given to junk like this.As a comparison, I happened to see The Godfather just prior to this and the feel of the two movies in comparison was so striking that this utterly paled. Granted, few films stand a chance when put against The Godfather, but this was so abrupt I was astounded at the utter badness of Basic Instinct.Again, to me this is pure junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"The directors cut Generates Heat!","review":"For the few extra minutes of footage, and the bonus features (to see Stone's real audition is worth it alone, it had to be her) take the cake.

Whew..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Badness","review":"The fact that the selling point for this movie is Stone's sex scenes, says it all. Good thing she is attractive, because she can't act. Then again, who could act with a script this predictable and at times hysterical. Dialogue is so bad here you won't believe it. And Micahel Douglas phones in his usual angry-white-guy preformance - really he has to be one of the most limited actors out there.Anyways, this movie is a dog and watch some Ginger Lynn lingere videos if you want to see some steamy scenes.

However, don't necessarily take my word for it. There seems, however inexplicably, to be a real taste among the buying public for this stuff. I just think Stone would've done better as an extra in Caligula.Anyhoo, porno aside, HAS ANYONE NOTICED THAT THIS DVD COMES COMPLETE WITH A METAL ICE-PICK!? ...

Don't let the \\"Widescreen Review\\" fool you...the picture quality is not that bad on this DVD. It's actually pretty good for a bargain bin disc.

Why?There isn't one, microparticular hint of human kindness anywhere in this production - and that's the definition of porn, which provides, at best, the cheap thrill of refined sugar. One hopes for an accidental, peripheral detail of someone waving to a friend, a dog tentatively wagging its tail once or twice; the shadow of a smile on someone's face in a bus window - but no.

Ah, now I understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This movie did more to bring back the stereotype of the \\"evil sexual woman\\" than any movie in the 20th century. Honestly, I thought that kind of narrow-mindedness went out with puritanism. This movie is even worse--sexual women are evil AND violent. When was the last time you saw a male character where his badness or goodness had anything to do with his sexuality? The message here, clearly, is that women are not to be trusted with power.

Sharon Stone's sexiness falls far short of the level of enthrallment Douglas accords it, and the bisexual psychologist is the only real sexy character (including, I'd say, Douglas). The action scenes are about average, and the plot becomes more convoluted than is justified by the payoff. Just because this raised the level of production values for erotic thrillers more commonly found on late-night Cinemax doesn't mean that it's truly escaped its tawdry roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only bad thing is the case","review":"This is a pretty good special edition and I was so excited to see this case when it first went up for preorder.

Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas were neither one convincing in their roles. The star of the show, I feel, was Jeanne Tripplehorn.

Catherine is a murder/mystery novelist, and quickly becomes the prime suspect when Curran learns the crime has been described in the latest book.

Available in an unrated director's cut, which includes explicit footage not shown in the R-rated theatrical release. MPAA Rating: R for strong sex and violence, nudity, drug use and strong language.

On second viewing it's check out the clothes and guess the killer. On the third viewing it's the dawning realization that this is a revisionist feminist revenge chick flick (whatever that means) with few redeeming features made for the tackiest of Hollywood reasons - let's give the suckers what they want - sex, ice picks wielded by braless women under forty, and lots of expensive clothes and fast cars. The greatest suspense comes from the awful overacting Mr Douglas who is trying to give up smoking - will he? Won't he? Ms Stone iks embarrassingly bad. It is redeemed somewhat by Mr Dzundza and the elegant Ms Tripplehorn.

It has been remained by people for lots of years because of Sharone Stone's nice and smooth body. It's sad but true. Basic Instinct shows us a lot of bad things. Like nudity, sex, murder, violence, and things like bad language. Some people hate this film because of these kind of bad things. But think about this film in a different way.

The ending alone should invalidate anything worthy that precedes it. Is she or isn't she? When it becomes clear that even the screenwriter (Joe the Hutt) doesn't know, and doesn't care, and only wants to leave room for a sequel, the cynicism becomes palpable. The whole thing is an unintentional joke (sort of like Stone claiming she didn't know where the camera was positioned in the interrogation scene). Everything backfires -- even Stone's presumed sexuality is undermined by Tripplehorn's vastly superior looks and talent.If you want to see a good sex-equals-death thriller, check out \\"Sea of Love.\\" Ellen Barkin makes Sharon Stone look like amateur night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thriller EVER made!","review":"Sure, there's Psycho but I am also adding the HOT FACTOR; this movie for me was the the best thriller I have ever seen and really the best movie are atleast on my top five with Thelma & Louise, Rosemary's Baby, Last Tango in Paris & Butterflies are Free. Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas were dead on; extremely believable characters and even after it was all over my sister had to explain to me that of course Katherine Tremell was the killer because of the icepick under the best. Then I rewatched and understood the whole way the other woman was set up by Catherine and the brilliance of it all tying into her bestselling novel. The movie was thrilling! And Sharon Stone never looked hotter or any woman for that matter than Catherine in this film. Michael Douglas was great as the quesionable cop; likable but with an edge and a dark side. Catherine Tremell was the DARK SIDE period. I'd give it ten stars if I could!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Defintly makes you think and squirm!","review":"This movie is very good!

The movie did keep me engaged although the dialog is mostly insipid. Reminded me a lot of commercial copy writing.

If you need the Director's Cut to understand the plot, then the movie is a failure. Looking back, the only reason I'd watch this movie again is for Sharon Stone's perfect body.

I enjoyed the \\"seabiscuit\\" story on Cd. Get that. I should have known better. Was it quaint? Maybe. Interesting or well done- no. I'd have more fun just reading a log book from an inn than listening to this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect choice for a reading group discussion!","review":"This is a charming little book that centers around twin brothers, Hector and Virgil, 50-something bachelors who run a Bed & Breakfast in a remote island location. Though word-of-mouth, they have attracted a customer base consisting entirely of fellow bibliophiles, and thus reading is a central theme throughout the novel.The book is written as a series of reflections: each chapter is narrated by either Hector, Virgil, or one of their guests, whose musings make up the B&B;'s unique guest book. The brothers relate stories of their unconventional childhood with their single mother and MIA father as well as offer present day anecdotes about their entertaining guests, neighbors, and pets. Also interspersed throughout the book are recommended reading lists such as \\"Hector's List of Favorite Authors for the Bath.\\"This quirky, whimsical novel is ideally suited to be a reading group selection and likely to be enjoyed by any book lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to know these Bachelor Brothers!","review":"I love Bill Richardson! I just caught up with the Bachelor Brothers; it is rare for me to laugh out loud while reading, but this book and one of its sequels had me roaring. All I could think was, \\"How can I start a similar bed and breakfast?\\" It is touching, funny, literate -- a real bibliophile's delight. Nuts to Kirkus Reviews for not liking the lists (bathroom reading, bathtub reading, etc.); I was very grateful for them. Hector and Virgil rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather tedious","review":"I'm a great fan of Barbara Pym, Emily Eden, Margaret Oliphant, Anthony Trollope, PG Wodehouse, and similar writers of gentle (and not-so-gentle) social humor. When I found this book, then, I was pleased to find another promising author that seemed to fit this type.The first chapter was amusing enough, written from one of the Bachelor Brother's points of view. Richardson has some very nice turns of phrase and is very good with his imagery. He's also skilled at changing the \\"voice\\" of the narrator for each chapter. The book very quickly palled for me after that first chapter, though, and it quickly became just a tedious read. I found the characters uninteresting, the setting only mildly engaging, and the overall lack of plot dull.Fortunately, it was also a very short book, which is good for anyone who has to finish whatever book they start. As light summer reading, one could do worse that this light-weight volume, but one could undoubtedly also do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you go wrong with a book about books?","review":"Picked this up at a used book store in Georgia last year and just now got around to reading it. Lovely story of book-loving bachelor brothers who run a B&B and the folks who stay there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light, lol read","review":"I admit that I am only 1/2 way through the book. I looked at the reviews on Amazon to see how this book was received. I am finding the characters very likeable. It's a light, fast read and at times laugh out loud funny. I had no preconceptions as I've never heard of this series before I found it at a book sale.It's not rocket science but enjoyable nevertheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice book","review":"A well written book by a GURU in network administration (Douglas Chick), the language used is simple to understand. I recommend this book, worth the bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldie Throat","review":"This is Goldie Hawn's only album, from 1972. It's not very good. She can carry a tune (barely), but has a small, unimpressive singing voice. The material here is performed in a few different styles. There are country songs, easy listening songs and (believe it or not) a vaudeville song. It's all rather boring, and only collectors of bad celebrity album will want to pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jones Bassoon Reed","review":"I have only been playing the bassoon for about one year, and have found the reed is very important...and sometimes it's very hard to find one that works for you. I have tried about five different brands, with Jones being one of them. I tried only one reed, and found it a bit more toward the medium than the soft, and for me at least it was difficult to play some notes and in general was not fun to play. Again, I am still fairly new to the bassoon, and what works or doesn't work for me may not be the same for others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jones = GARBAGE","review":"I am a bassoonist that has been making bassoon reeds for 17 yrs now, and I am shocked that Jones still manages to stay in business. Sure, it may be a cheap reed, but remember, you get what you pay for. The reeds are often unbalanced, the wires are loose, the blades of the reed shift very easily. If you're a beginning bassoonist and you're looking for a good reed, look elsewhere -- a bassoonist will only play as well as their reed allows them to, and Jones reeds will only hold you back.If you have no other alternatives locally, then I'd suggest finding a quality, reputable reedmaker online, because these reeds are simply poorly constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just love her songs and voice","review":"I had this album on a cassette and wanted to be able to play it on a CD player too... since tapes are fading away..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Love Songs Not Forgotten","review":"I had been looking for one of the songs in this particular CD.

It has brought hours of play. It has a lantern on the outside that plays nature sounds and camping songs. The toilet in the camper makes a flushing sound.

Excellent toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a guitar player into blues, you will want this.","review":"This is a very interesting Mayall album showcasing the talents of Eric Clapton and Mick Taylor under Mayall's mentorship. Their are a couple of tracks without any guitar leads as well.If you are a student of 60s guitar playing you will want to hear this. Clapton plays a version of \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\\" that is chilling on this CD. You would swear that he has transformed himself into Freddie King for the gig. Mick Taylor stretches out for a very long solo and explores (probably invents) sitar like blues guitar.The CD was recorded on some kind of bootleg equipment at blues clubs in the mid 60s and the sound quality suffers, but this is still one of my favorite CDs.If you are a Brit Blues fan, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only,a historical work!","review":"For me,this cd is only a historical moment,that preceeded the great days of that great group,The Cream! The recorded quality was very poor,not emotionally work!It's only!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottleneck Minstrel of the Lord","review":"This is an excellent CD that I would highly recommend to anyone who enjoys the bottleneck blues. Like the other reviewer I would compare Rev. Brown to the great Blind Willie Johnson who by the way is one of the greatest bottleneck players ever to put music on a disc. When you think of the rarity of recordings of this nature, especially in the outstanding fidelity represented on this disc you have to snatch these great recordings up before the recordings become obsolete. The bottleneck playing here is top notch and the singing is hauntingly beautiful. I only wish more recordings of this nature would be released from the Arhoolie vaults before the culture no longer desires to remember the great minstrels from the past. If you don't have this CD, Get it! You'll be glsd you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot get enough","review":"I got this movie for a long car trip. My 3 year old had never seen it and I thought she would be interested as I assumed the colors would be bright and characters cute.

It was a sanity saver for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie!","review":"I thought this was an excellent movie. I'm in the process of buying it for my little sister. She also loved it.

I took my friend's daughter's to see it a few weekends ago, and I agreed with their first reaction after it ended: \\"Holy Moses!\\" Sure, the animation is not up to Pixar standards. But there are surprisingly good jokes, lots of spine-tingling thrills (don't let the super-young ones see the evil Lord Licorice!), and basically a family-friendly good time that you will definitely want to replay over and over again. My friend's daughter's are basically teenagers, but after the movie they were inpired to break out the old board game and have a \\"Candyland\\" tournament. I would've participated but I had a nasty stye that was gumming up my eyelid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piscturesque novel","review":"Late Janie Bolitho belonged to a esteemed group of British mystery writers, who through years produced solid and enjoyable books. Her efforts didn't earn awards or the recomendations of snobby critics. What they managed to do, time after time, is to give pleasure to numerous readers.

Irresponsible and damaging to teens who are navigating through normal adolescent experiences. No good can come from the oppressed becoming the oppressor, bending all to their beliefs. Why can't a boy feel close or emotionally connected to another boy without being labeled as \\"gay\\" or \\"bi-sexual?\\" i.e., Isn't it possible that a teenage boy who likes fashion is just that: a teen-aged boy who likes fashion? Why is a \\"Gay is cool; straight is homophobic\\" agenda allowed to predominate in the media? Reprehensible tripe. Teach tolerance, not lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proofreader Died Half Way Through.....","review":"A novel based on a Robert E. Howard character? It must be horrible, you say. I would almost agree with that. The authors here are probably most well known for their Red Sonja series. This story was very predictable and the ending was one large cop-out. Like a lot of fantasy i try to read: bland. And what makes it even worse is that halfway through the novel the spelling mistakes increase until there's almost one per page! Sometimes even multiple misspellings of the same proper noun on the same page!I would recommend this novel only for completists. But please! Put the PB in it's plastic sleeve and put it on your shelf. Look at. Don't read it. Instead, read the Howard originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Reader","review":"This is rubbish. Very disappointing after the entertaining Red Sonja series. This starts off ok, after a wizard makes a sacrifice and tells Bran what he needs to do it descends through ordinary to atrocious.Bran is captured by a Roman sorcerer who then lets him go as a captive to Rome, to become, Holy Retarius, Batman! A gladiator. There he meets a Roman witch, and a wealthy shrewd gladiator runner who sees potential, yada yada.Often a minor character in his own book, there are a lot of Romans running around you couldn't give a shagging stola about.To top it off, the proofreading is rubbish, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best of the Dead","review":"In My opinion, this was the very best of all of their albums.

I would have given it 5 stars but I don't care for some of the 'bonus tracks' that have been included."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes!","review":"I love the sound of Garcia on his pre-humbucking '56-'57 Les Paul Custom. all of his specially made axes did not compare. This cd is worth it for that alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is finally rendered extremely listenable!","review":"I was never a Deadhead. In fact I was somewhat despised by some due to my love of Iggy and the Stooges. I had much fun turning deadheads on to \\"Raw Power\\" at parties and watching their extreme reactions-(incredible how mad some would become-it wasn't all Peace and Love back then)-oh those High School Days! Anyway,I always had a soft spot for \\"Morning Dew\\" and \\"New,New Minglewood Blues\\" on this album but I always found the horrible LP sound to be unlistenable.I tried the original CD release and it sounded just as bad. So I got this remastered version and I love it. The sound is great and the bonus tracks like \\"Alice D.Millionaire\\" and others are incredible. I myself is for the most part a sixties music maniac nowadays with all the excellent releases in that genre and now this one can join the other fantastic garage rock and Psychedelia remasters,finally!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This purchase was to replace an old, long-lost copy. I've always liked their studio-produced stuff, much to the chagrin of some more serious aficionados. Every once in a while it's nice to hear a nice crisp rendition than to have to pore over tons of bootlegs to find just the one. If this doesn't plant you squarely back on the Haight, at least mentally, then nothing will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite Dead yet","review":"I remember when this LP first showed up in record stores. I heard it but never bought it. The Rhino HDCD release with extra tracks makes me wonder why I didn't buy the album so many years ago. Not quite Dead yet, their signiture sound and style were not all there on this LP, but it is a nice listen nonetheless. And that's from someone who is/was not a Deadhead. All the Rhino Grateful Dead reissues have sounded refreshingly wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Zydeco Music from a Master","review":"I bought Buckwheat's Zydeco Party back in 1988 and have enjoyed listening to it on a regular basis ever since. Not really totally Zydeco in the traditional sense, Buckwheat's alblum combines the best qualities of New Orleans Zydeco, R&B,and soul music.Buckwheat is a virtuoso on the accordian, but he also has a great voice. His backup band has just the right touches of horns and drums to fill out the jams and really make them a pleasure to listen to.Great, fun and danceable alblum that features exceptional clean production touches. At times the pace of some songs becomes so frantic (\\"Zydeco Boogie\\" and \\"Tutti Frutti\\", for example) that you just start smiling and tapping your toes. It should compel even the most staid music listener to get up and dance.I wholeheartedly endorse it. Go buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this disc!","review":"This is the perfect \\"album\\" for both estalished Zydeco lovers and folks who just want to see what this music is like. The infectious beats, the instruments, the lyrics, all make this music to get you dancing (even if it is just in your chair at work). Try it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE PRICE IS RIGHT...","review":"These are strong, sturdy corn grips that are durable and extremely comfortable to hold. The two steel prongs grip the corn firmly and do not slip or slide while in use. The holders are comfortable to hold no matter how hard you grip them and are suitable for use by the smallest hands, as well as the largest ones. They wash well and look new, no matter how many times one uses them. These corn grips are a very good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big for corn dishes","review":"Yes, their chunky grips make them comfy to hold. BUT, if you use corn dishes (you know, the ones made just for corn, so you can roll your ear in the butter, etc?) these will not work - since their so big they actually hold the corn high up out of the dish! If the ear can't reach the bottom of the dish then there's no butter/salt/pepper, which for me renders these useless.We prefer the Zyliss ones that also interlock (so no poking yourself digging them out of the drawer)!ETA 12/27/09: the link to the ones we prefer -Zyliss Interlocking Corn Holders, Assorted ColorsAlso, 2.5yrs later, ours are still going strong and showing no signs of wear whatsoever (despite being run through the dishwasher all summer long, every summer!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corn Holders","review":"We have used the corn holders twice now, and so far they are holding up very well. They are easy to use and comfortable to grip. Time will tell how well they hold up washing after washing. That's the real test for me. The old yellow kind I have purchased repeatedly for the 33 years I've been married have been a waste of time and money. The little metal prongs always rust and then they fall out of the yellow plastic gripper and they get thrown out as trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blind is not great","review":"The Bamboo roll up blind arrived in decent shape. I wish the company had provided the locations of the hanger loops, and that they were adjustable. My windows have steel frames and drilling new holes requires a powerful drill with a special bit, and paying someone to come and do it. So I threaded heavyweight paper clips through the blind where the hooks are already in the window and the blind is hanging from those. I would give the measurements here, but you can order the exact size blind you want (a plus) so my measurements would not mean much.The blind itself is just OK, a little more see-through than the one I had before, and a lighter color than I expected. The cord broke on the old one and I regret giving it away, because it was a better quality than this one, and cords can be replaced from a hardware store.Not the happiest purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Stay away from this.

There's not a single composition on here that's worth hearing; hell, there's hardly anything on here that you'll remember five minutes after the CD is done. Sterile and brainless, this is perfectly representative of the albums he made up until his death. Miles, to be honest, is just going through the motions here. He didn't care about this album, and neither should you.Particular bile goes to the production, which is perfectly harsh and antiseptic, very 80s and very annoying.Overall, this is something no one should inflict on themselves, especially a Miles Davis fan. He had lost it completely by this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, about that trumpet...","review":"Miles' first studio album after a six-year retirement (though he had previously released the live double We Want Miles) is essentially an attempt to jump on the trends - this is more of an '80s funk record than a jazz album, especially displayed on the title track, with grating if smoothly delivered vocals. Which means this is mainly ponderous and trivial - take the extended \\"Back Seat Betty\\", which makes use of '80s guitar. Hide me. And too much of it is that insulting style we call jazz-pop which brought Kenny G. success- take \\"Aida\\" or \\"Shout\\". Not a stain on Miles' career, thanks to deep, lengthy grooves \\"Fat Time\\" and \\"Ursula\\". But one of his least creative."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 and a half stars actually","review":"This disc and Decoy are his two best 1980's albums. This disc was released in 1981 and has some classic riffs that dominated his music during the end of his career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat Time, followed by a lot of lean moments","review":"Also known as his 1981 \\"comeback\\" album (his first recording in 6 years), Miles shows a lot of rust in his playing, and most of the songs indicate he's uncertain as to whether to go for a vintage '70's \\"Get Up With It\\" style or widen the appeal with forgettable pop songs.Only the opening tune \\"Fat Time\\" sounds assured. On that track, Mike Stern rips loose an incredible rock guitar solo that ebbs and flows perfectly, with Miller and Foster seeming to egg him on with strong support on bass and drums. Miles' muted horn before and after sounds a little weak, but provides a nice balance to Stern's fire.If you pay full price for this CD, avoid buyer's remorse by not letting the CD player go past track 1. Miles doesn't fully come back until \\"Star People\\" a couple of years later."},{"rating":"1","title":"bitten by the 80s","review":"Sorry- I don't really like this album.

There are many excellent resources to choose from and I probably overlooked some as well. Regardless, I am happy with my choice and am enjoying this book immensely. Follows a simple format, reminiscent of the Teach Yourself series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably THE best book for the casual student","review":"If you're a Christian who wants to learn a little Greek, this would be the perfect book to use. It doesn't overwhelm the reader with rules and paradigms but gives brief, straightforward explanations followed by LOTS of exercises. Most of the exercises are in columns with the Greek on the left and the English on the right making it simple to cover the answer while you translate, then check your answer immediately. In later chapters, Greek quotes from the New Testament are used in the exercises.One of the problems with this book is that some of the exercises refer you to the Greek New Testament (GNT) which means you'll have to buy a GNT to complete those exercises. Also, some of the longer translations don't have an answer key.Finally, if you want to become a serious Greek student, you'd probably want something a little more thorough than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to practice basic vocabulary","review":"As a beginner who is studying on my own ,I've found this to be great for practicing vocabulary in short sentences , instead of just rote memorization , which I find very boring . Also he uses made up sentences in the practice exercises which is good because you can remember scriptures after getting just a couple of words in the sentence , with made up sentences you actually have to translate it all . The only real drawback is Dobson does'nt really cover grammar , so I recomend a grammar such as Mounces Basics Of Biblical Greek In addition to this , for someone who's really trying to learn the language well . I wholeheartedly reccomend this to anyone studying on their own ."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best New Testament Greek Books I've Bought","review":"Simply one of the best. Put in a steady 20-30 minutes a day, and watch how quickly your NT Greek starts to improve. No use buying the book and just sitting it down.

I believe the pronuciation presented here is not generally considered correct but is still the pedagogical standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Greek tutor text you can find","review":"I had known nothing about Greek before I picked up the book and started reading it, but within 30 mins, I had already memorized the alphabet, and was learning all kinds of words. The words you learn though are not in lists where you have to memorize them, he just puts them here and there in phrases and tells you what they mean. Within 3 days (30 mins a day) I was saying phrases and sentences, and within 15 days, I was reading paragraphs with ease. I've read many greek books, but this one tops them all with it's easy to learn style and it's fun way of learning. For learning Greek, Learn New Testament Greek was the best book I ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absence of accent marks makes learning Greek more difficult","review":"I recently bought a copy of Dobson's Learn New Testament Greek. Having studied Greek before, I was surprised to find that the Greek words in this text have no accent marks. This makes learning the language much harder because you cannot be sure you are pronouncing the words with the accents on the correct syllables. I would recommend that beginning students of Greek look elsewhere, and make sure whatever book you purchase contains accent marks so you can learn to pronounce the words properly as you study."},{"rating":"2","title":"And then there was YEllO","review":"An album so good I dropped all of their contemporaries (Residents, Snakefinger).

With electro being hot in the clubs, one can put on an early Yello song, and younger crowd would have no idea this was relaesed in the early 80s.

However, this book graphically depicts severe physical and sexual abuse of a minor (Bilal) at the hands of his brother. So, be forewarned there. Also, I am interested into what sort of research Sulayman X conducted before writing this work as to my knowledge he is not Kurdish-American and converted to Islam in his 20's.

This thing has been used a lot -- probably 50 times in the 3 years we've owned it, but that's no excuse. It shouldn't squeak a really high, really loud squeak every time it rotates, regardless of pressure, tilt or speed. It's also ungainly and heavy. Yes, it cuts well, but it's not worth the hearing loss and awakened baby that occur each time we cut pizza with it.

However, this pizza cutter is great. I have now used it on my own creation which I cook on a stone and on a pizzeria-bought pie that needed re-slicing. Cut through them both like butter. The size does not get in the way and you really don't even have to press down too hard because of the solid weight of this \\"pizza wheel\\". I am very satisfied but I removed one star due to the fact that the wheel/blade cannot be removed. It would have been fairly easy for Oxo to make this product with a removable blade for thorough cleaning and for ease of sharpening. I'm disappointed about this. If the bushing or rivet fails down the road, I will probably design my own removable replacement. Last but not least, I really appreciate the quality of Oxo products. I've got a kitchen full of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be put off by the expense!","review":"This is a brilliant device and the Daddy of pizza wheels, all pizza parlours should buy one or two they would save themselves a fortune!

In a nutshell this movie is about two boys who commit the perfect crime, but Sandra bullock who is the detective ( And has a severe trauma do to an accident she had when young)and is in charge of this case decides from the beginning the two boys were guilty. I could not believe Sandra help produce this garbage. Bad movie, do not waste your money buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bullock does it again","review":"Have got several of Ms. Bullocks previous films. This caught my eye for the story line, betrayal between friends when a murder they committed unravels as well as the underlying problems of Ms. Bullocks character having gone through an abusive relationship. Very good piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most original film","review":"\\"Murder by Numbers\\" is based on the real life Leopold-Loeb case of the 1920's and the 1948 Alfred Hitchcock movie \\"Rope' although it doesn't credit either. The plot involves 2 upper class and intelligent students planning and executing the perfect murder on a random victim for the thrill and the challenge. In the real life case and the Hitchcock movie, the murderers are college students while in this movie, they are alledgedly high school students. The word alleged is used as it is obvious that Gosling and many of his classmates are in their 20's and haven't seen a high school for a few years there.The best thing going for this movie is the lead performance from it's star Sandra Bullock. She is good as the detective in pursuit of the twisted murderers but she has very little to work with here as far as the script, the cliched characters and the weak plot twists. She's a good actress but not a magician and this would fall into her lesser movies and possibly her least."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star is Born!","review":"Murder by Numbers starring Sandra Bullock is an all-around engrossing crime drama. I wasn't expecting much from this movie before I watched it, the previews for it made this movie seem drab and less than thrilling but I was pleasantly surprised how actually good this movie is. First of all, Ryan Gosling steals every scene he is in, you could tell Gosling was on his way to bigger and better things. He is amazing as the creepy and high-school bored Richard. Bullock pulls off another solid preformance, I have been a huge fan of Bullock since While You Were Sleeping, she has great charisma in every movie she appears in. I highly recommend Murder by Numbers, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder by bad screenplay","review":"The plot was predictable and given away very early. The main characters are not well-acted and are not people you can feel ANY sympathy for. It flip-flops from day to night scenes, bad guys to good guys. It became ponderous and boring to watch. I just wanted it to be over and gave alot of thought to fast-forwarding to the ending credits. This movie isn't worth the time it takes to load the DVD player!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a reality check ?","review":"The story seemed interesting, and I expected a much better film; it just kept getting worse as the film continued.Bullock's character was just too unbelievable; the only possibly credible characters would be the two high school students.Reviewer J.D. wrote a good review, much of which reflects my own thoughts about this film: editing and lighting were not as good as they could have been; directing was lousy. And indeed this film is not as thrilling as believed: it is really stupid.A total disappointment. Hollywood needs a reality check."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie Hampered by a Bad Title","review":"The title of this movie is misleading. It leads you to expect an Agatha Christie-style whodunit, whereas in fact this story is more of a realistic, edgy take on a Leopold-and-Loeb kind of murder.As in the real Leopold and Loeb case, a lot of the detective work here revolves around establishing who was instigator of the crime and who was mere follower. There are some interesting twists on our expectations.Paralleling the often reverse relationship between the killers is the reverse relationship between the male and female detectives on the case. Sandra Bullock takes the lead and doesn't stand around merely batting her eyes in admiration of her male's partner's prowess. And most unexpected of all, her male partner is quite willing to admire and learn from her competence.This is an intelligent film that deserved a better send-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandra Bullock in trouble ...","review":"Not so much the movie, but here career apparently. Reese Witherspoon and Cameron Diaz must be scaring the hell out of Bullock and Meg Ryan cuz they stopped doing those perky comedies that they did well. Put them in something else, like this one, and whew is it tough to watch! Plus there are way too many holes in this one to really make it work. A couple of good moments, but a bargain rental at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow the crumbs","review":"Sandra Bullock does a great job of playing a detective looking for a murderer. The clues are a bit to neat to suit her and she begins to look deeper. This movie was borderline Hitchcock style murder mystery and very smoothly done. Just a little stronger acting by Ben Chaplin and Ryan Gosling and it would have been a major hit. They do a good job but they are not the caliber of Ed Norton in \\"Primal Fear\\". If they were they would have got at least oscar nominations if not awards. I still think they turn in fine performances and were not appreciated. I personally think the whole movie was underrated. I think it improves with additional viewings. You begin to truly appreciate the performances and the story. A Hitchcock air about it that makes you think of \\"The Rope\\" and \\"Vertigo\\". I bought the DVD and I recommend it. Most fans of movies like \\"Kiss the Girls\\" and \\"Along Came a Spider\\" will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The numbers don't add up","review":"Sandra Bullock as a hard-boiled homicide detective has a few hurdles to jump before the movie begins. This is one of those Leopold and lobe (spelling?) type partner thrill-kill situations to be solved by Bullock. Of course, all the other cops go with the trail of clues, while Bullock's hunches always see the truth. She has some inner-demons, but it wasn't very moving. The story has that feel of we've seen all of this before... and it was done better the last three times. This wasn't all that bad- it just wasn't all that good considering the star and the director. The criminals' story got old fast, and the believibility was strained by the end. Bullock's performance reminded me of Holly Hunter as a detective in Copycat where I never got over the mis-casting. Ok for a movie rental, but if I had seen it in the theater I might be more negative. I like the idea of Bullock trying more gritty drama, but she just doesn't cut it as a tough detective."},{"rating":"1","title":"good premise-poor execution","review":"The idea was good, two young high schoolers plot the perfect murder. Sandra Bullock plays the cop/profiler who disses shrinks and has serious issues of her own. Half the time Bullock seems slightly psycho and the other half totally confused. Her reaction in certain situations don't seem believable, like when one of the suspects catches her photographing him. She didn't act like a cop. I don't think she had a good handle on her part. Every character was a stereotype and the script worked too hard at shoving in twists and turns at every opportunity. Save your money...it will be on t.v. soon enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and depressing!","review":"This movie is so boring that I like literally found a cure for caffeine overload!

It adresses the issues of trust and makes one question if they really know who their friends are. Two teenagers think that are invisible to the world and can follow through with the perfect murder. Little do they realize that they will be each other's downfall. The cast is well suited for the film, and Sandra Bullock does a great job playing a more serious role of a cop, who herself has an unmentionable past. This drama thoroughly enthralls it's audience and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"great suspense drama movie","review":"this is a well thought out movie with good acting and a good story. it has its twists and turns and entertains nicely. this is probably my favorite sandra bullock movie and ryan gosling did a great job in this movie. highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl Power at the Expense of Society","review":"This movie tries to force the viewer to sympathize and even praise the efforts of a detective who uses criminals to satisfy her feelings of revenge for injustices in her own past.

The categories are limited and very outdated. Many modern conveniences are not listed. So you can't interpret them. The writer seems to have had a pre-occupation with young girls because almost every enttry ends by saying that : \\"If a young girl should dream of .... \\" and then goes into the most amazing complex series of what she should dream. There is no similar reference to similar meanings for older women or men of any age. I strongly recommend against buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"10,000 Dreams","review":"Seems fantastic, in some respects. Dreams are not as easy to interpret as many of the new age dreamweavers suggest.

First of all, it is poorly translated from German. Obviously translated by someone German who speaks english, and not the other way around. Its content seems out dated... as if written 200 years ago. If you are interested in dream interpretation, it helps to have sevaral books on the subject for cross referencing. I find all my other books on this subject pretty much consistant with eachother, but Gustavus's interpretations are limited to only a few...your dream means your are either going to get sick and die, someone is going to decieve you or you will be wealthy and happy. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't give your power away to a dream dictionary like this","review":"If I were in favor of burning books (which I am not) I would throw this one onto the pyre first. It is the most retrogade kind of dream dictionary. Instead of letting other people take your power away by telling you what your dream symbols mean, why not learn some fresh techniques for unfolding the messages for yourself? I recommend books like Robert Moss' \\"Conscious Dreaming\\" or Jeremy Taylor'w work, which stress the fact that YOU are the expert on your own dreams. In Moss' books, you are encouraged to go back INSIDE your dreams and gather more information, dialogue with dream characters and awaken to a larger reality.

I reasoned that this would make the opener sturdy and allow it to work as intended for a long time. IT DID NOT. This overpriced piece of trash DOES NOT open cans. There may be other uses for it but opening cans is not one of them. That's why I'm on Amazon today. I am throwing this junk out and buying 6 of the 2 dollar can openers.

And this was an eye opening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the time to read","review":"While I initially found the character names silly, I have found this book entertaining. It has allowed me to escape into a world where I can giggle because some of the character's like Sister Ima Hellraiser are completely without common sense. Reverend Knott Enough Money's antics leave me giggling as well. Any time a novel allows me to laugh at the end of a grinding day, I think it has redeeming qualities so while this novel lacks the literary chops of Toni Morrison's or Alice Walker's work, it has the funny one finds in Tina McElroy Ansa's novels. So if you want to escape your daily drudgery and get a laugh, try this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This book has all the scoop of so many churches these days.

Around this time, the first 16 track recorder arrived at Alembic. The band decided to ditch the 8 track recordings that they had been working on and head over to the 16 track. It was at this time that Jerry came up with an idea to help defrey the costs and pay off some of their bills by recording a live album. This album would be made up of three shows: Dark Star->Saint Stephen from 2-27-69 Fillmore West, The Eleven->Turn On Your Lovelight from 1-26-69 at the Avalon Ballroom and 3-2-69 Fillmore West for Death Don't Have No Mercy, Feedback and We Bid You Goodnight. This is a very good album and has become a legendary release for the band. The only problem I have with the remastered version is that Bob's voice is now missing from the end of Turn On Your Lovelight and it doesn't have the cool booklet that the original did."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong live set by the ultimate jam band","review":"this is recommended by many people as the starting point for prospective dead fans, though I can't think why. It seems better to start with American Beauty and Europe '72, but this album is definitely one of the ones you need to get. It is basically a good collection of early material played at an extremely long length, with fan favorites like \\"Dark Star\\" and \\"St. Stephen.\\" Sometimes it seems like noodling, I am ashamed to admit, but it is GOOD noodling nonetheless. You should definitely get it if you are a new fan, and get a used copy because the newer HDCD versions aren't really that worthwhile, aka they aren't massively improved over the original cd quality. Also the bonus tracks are unecessary. Get this cd only for the original live tracks. And then be swept away into the dead jams!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Punish Your Teenager","review":"After forty year's of trying to figure out how anyone listened to these guys without first ingesting illegal substances, I give up.This is the most painful 79 minutes a human could endure without a waterboard...no one in the band can sing, the lyrics are awful, and it never occurs to anyone to play in the same key or time signature as anyone else. If five drunk chimpanzees formed a rock band, this would be the result.Punish your teenager by making them listen to this album while sober. Explain that they are hearing what drugs do to the brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Deadhead","review":"Sorry I can't get into this or any other jam band for that matter. However, I did listen to this in its entirety a while back. The music meanders for a bit and then a few minutes into it Jerry Garcia decides to sing. It continues in this fashion for the rest of the album. This is signaled out as one of their best albums but still. The Dead were fans of Coltrane and admitted his influence (so did the Byrds but Eight Miles High is a classic song) but couldn't really absorb the aspects of jazz fusion in the way that say, Hendrix did. Basically you get a series of unfocused jams that wear you out. You kind of forget where the song goes and eventually the band remembers to return to the theme. The scary thing was how influential the Dead and this album were. If you're a deadhead, I doubt you will be swayed by this review but if you're not buy any 70's Miles album or Jimi Hendrix official concert albums and see that Live/Dead can't live up to its musical contemporaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of there early Best","review":"I am a big fan of Psychedelic Music of the late 60s.

CD if you are into 60s Psych music.I consider this the Deads best Album right with Aoxomoxoa then Anthem of the Sun then Live Dead in that order there best four Albums.My reaction to Workingman's Dead and American Beauty (Both great Albums if you like that type of music) is this a Rock band?

LP is gone but I just listened to the cassette for the first time again in maybe 2 decades, having put my hand on a cassette player. Absolutely wonderful, joyful and infectious dance music that will have you dance around the room. For me, more than the rythm, it's the volubile guitar playing and their constant intertwining melodies that keeps swirling from the speakers that take the cake.

A wonderful reference and resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"Prior to Mariama's (new Honeyz member, former Solid HarmoniE member) arrival, I was not a big fan of the Honeyz. Their music was a very bland mix of R&b and Pop. However, once they \\"re-tooled\\" themselves, got Mariama, and went into the studio to record two new tracks, they changed what was then bland R&B, into funky and cool Dance/Pop/R&B with flavor! \\"Won't take it lying\\" down is the second single of the \\"re-tooled\\" Honeyz, and this song is no exception to the new style they've taken. It's got a great sound, great vocals, great beat..and great message. Much better than anything female R&B groups you'd find here in the USA (including Destiny's Child and TLC). After listening to this song, you'll want to hear more from them, and hopefully we will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the prek-1st grade set","review":"I shared this with my kindergarteners to much excitement. They were familiar with the jump-rope rhyme. It is an excellent jumping-off point for beginning sound discussions.

Still an enjoyable and pedagogically sound read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute","review":"I thought the book was very well written with good characters and a strong emotional side to it.

BIY keeps you guessing on Cat's next smart move. And in the end you have to give her credit for her ingenuity, forget the weak, cry baby female character, Cat is what I want in a heroine. It's easy to laugh along. I fell in love instantly to both Sam and Cat and took pity to Sam's frustration dealing with the resourceful Cat. The secondary characters, Bobby and Kaylee - Cat's twin sister are given enough portion for us to know and like them, and a sweet love story of their own. Susan Andersen really knows how to balance the actions among the characters. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly a page turner","review":"As a general rule, I'm a big fan of \\"twin\\" or mistaken identity plots in my romance books, so I was eager to give this one a try, even though I've never read a Susan Andersen story before.Overall I was impressed - mostly because of the way she kept the plot moving along. It starts off with a bang and never slows down. I was also a huge fan of the hero. Just tough enough, but not so much that he's a ridiculous jerk the entire way through.I didn't give it five stars, mostly because I wasn't really wow-ed by the dialogue. It fell flat a couple of times because it didn't quite reflect the chemistry that the characters had. Also, the heroine fell just a bit flat in my mind. She seemed to change personalities every other chapter, and I couldn't get a read on her enough to really relate.Still, for a fun read with a fast-paced plot, this one won't let you down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby I'm yours","review":"i will read this again and again - also have a paperback copy on my bookshelf at home - -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever","review":"A clever sequence of love story mingled with action to drive the budding romance.

I saw a couple of good reviews on Amazon and decided to try this author, because somebody compared her to Susan Elizabeth Phillips, who is a far better author by the way. The characters are shallow and underdeveloped. The storyline, which could have been played up more, was insipid. And the strangest characters kept running across the tattered tapestry of a weak plot distracing you further. If that doesn't get you, maybe the tone of this story will do it. Some said it was sassy, I say it is silly and base. Find a better romance writer, some suggestions include Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Linda Howard, Judith Mcnaught. This is my last book by this lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definite Five Stars","review":"Between this book and \\"Be My Baby\\", Andersen has gone on my automatic buy list. There are very few writers who can pen a hero as well as Andersen. In fact, only Susan Elizabeth Phillips and Linda Howard come to mind.I was shocked to see some of the bad reviews this book took on this site. \\"Baby I'm Yours\\" is a fresh, innovative, sexy, hilarious, light-hearted romantic comedy. If you like to laugh, and if you enjoy reading about feisty, quirky heroines who bring strong, primal males to heel, then this is the book to purchase.There's nothing quite as nice for a reading enthusiast as finding an author who can make you smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun,fast,sexy ride","review":"This was my first book by this author.I lean toward romatic suspense, but I really enjoyed the verbal banter between the leads.

I can not respect any man who's a cop wanna-be, sorry. He's obtuse (won't listen to heroine explain he's got the wrong girl), cheap, calls his best friend Gare (short for Gary). I mean what man would call Gary Gare (a woman might).We read romance novels to escape. I just wanted to escape from this hero. My skin was crawling by the time I finished this book.In fact, I am done with this author, I bought a whole bunch of her books because of all the glowing reviews, but I just can't take it anymore.

This book had potential apart from the... title, and so could have been better. The annoying thing about books like these is when they get a little bit too excited in their drum-beating and flag-waving. The principles that the book celebrates are real and important. But one attitude displayed prominently in is the conceit of falling into the trap of thinking we are the only democratic or free nation in the world. Other very successful democracies also uphold and illustrate important values and democratic and egalitarian ideals.Read books like this, but read them with an open and enquiring mind, and try not to be isolationist (or elitist) when you celebrate our American conceptions of democracy - otherwise you are in danger of betraying those very values!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing attempt for a valid project","review":"The original American experiment with democracy was a brave and intrepid one, with amazing results. The spirit of the pioneering Moms and Dads and later waves of immigrants and the pragmatic values they contributed have built a great nation over the past several hundred years. Cataloguing these values is an important project.Sadly this book disappoints. It is overly biased and provides an uncrtical and overly romanticised version of America that is insular, proud and superior - and that is not a very American or democratic message at all!!I do not recommend this book to people trying to get in touch with their individual American spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Boring, trite, rushed.

Avoid this at all costs. It's a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"History for ...","review":"Matthews' book is for people who know absolutely NOTHING about American history. ... I consider this book a total waste of money!!He pulls books, movies, some extremely biased and simplified American \\"history\\", and certain American \\"heroes\\" from his own past and presents them as having been the KEY factors in forming what we consider to be the \\"American psyche\\".What amazed me is all that he left out -- the many historical events that truly shaped America. If Matthews has any in-depth knowledge of American history, he failed to reveal it here. Further, his simplification of the forming of the \\"American psyche\\" is laughable.Although 200+ pages in length, the book is an easy one-sitting read -- I read it all last night. Why? The pages are small in size and the print is large and widely spaced. It could have fit into a 50 page book of normal size and print.In short, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPPPPP-OFFFFF","review":"Did Chris M. need money for purchase of Christmas presents????One would expect Chrisy to posess a more meaningful depth of knowledge regarding American historical notions.Recommended reading for Chrisy is \\"A THREAD ACROSS THE OCEAN\\" from which he may gain a \\"notion\\" about American notions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the book, get the audio","review":"I enjoyed hearing Matthews on the G. Gordon Liddy show discuss this book so much that I bought it. Well, I read Stephen Ambrose's final book just before this one and found Matthews' somewhat lacking. The two books are essentially the same in their goals, short essays on important highlights in American History. Some of the same topics are covered in both books. Ambrose just did a MUCH BETTER job. Ambrose was a skilled writer and Historian by trade, Matthews is a gifted gabber. So my suggestion is to listen to Matthews on Audio, but buy Ambrose's \\"To America: Personal Reflections of An Historian\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Blame Matthews","review":"Don't blame Chris Matthews for this tripe. He has to make a living somehow, and it's become the standard m.o. for manic political cranks on television to churn out these hastily written tomes about \\"grand American themes.\\" These books have become a genre unto themselves, featuring, invariably, a big glossy photograph of the \\"handsome tv host\\" along with the words \\"liberty,\\" \\"freedom,\\" and \\"America\\" in combinations limited only by the imagination of Fox News. If one criticizes such \\"works,\\" you are, by definition, a \\"blame America first elitist.\\" So don't even start.I don't criticize them myself because they are beyond criticism.

It could be very good resource material for a civic class, American history class, and should be required reading for American's. This book is NOT negative, but delves into why we are like we are and not like anyone else in the world. Chris comes up with ten, uniquely American notions and they are very interesting.

Senator John McCain is one of his contemporary examples, but Chris goes back to before the Revolutionary War for other examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"American History Lite","review":"This book is alot like light beer. It satisfies somewhat, but after consuming it, you wonder why. I like Chris Matthews, because I think he tries to be fair to both sides on his TV show. I read to learn new things, and regretfully I learned little from this book. This book tries to tie in history, famous figures, and movies. Well, I suppose there is something to this, but history is history and not stories in movies. The other tenet in this book is the characteristics of Americans that make them different from the rest of the world. Again a long stretch. People are people, and Americans are no more unique than others in this world.I think highly of Chris Matthews and his first book Kennedy and Nixon. This just wasn't a great book.

The infernal \\"I\\" is there from the Prologue and Chapter 1 on. The whole thing is a re-hash of selected cliches in American Civilization 101 courses out there. And, sublimating his 3-years' hit-job on Al GORE here, without the \\"I\\", his slant on President GORE in the 2000 Campaign was that this was the time for a Common Man and \\"there wasn't one\\" and that \\"most people voted for him but they didn't want to hang out with him for four years.\\" At least this weak product isn't on the best seller list---yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"History for dummies","review":"I bought and read this book based on the rave reviews given to it on the Don Imus radio show. What a HUGE mistake!The book is, quite simply, \\"history for dummies\\". If you know absolutely NOTHING about American history, then you might enjoy this book. Matthews simplifies everything and accepts at face value the myths and inaccuracies of American history usually taught to grammar school students. Quite simply, the book has no depth. (And I suspect that Matthews' knowledge of American history has no depth either!)As a Civil War \\"buff\\" of some 40 years (with a keen interest in America going back to colonial times), perhaps I was expecting too much from Matthews. I did not expect a comprehensive history in so short a book, but I expected some substance -- but there was none.

And someone needs to tell Chris that Hollywood is MAKE BELIEVE,I resent this book because it is intellectually dishonest. It is jingoistic, xenophobic, and cloaks itself in empty patriotism.

Some say Damian is too breathy, but, remember, it's not just a vocal performance. He was fitting into the character. I'd like to hear your voice after being locked up in a prison cell awaiting your death! If you're going on amazing lead singer, knock yourself out, get the Canadian version.

If you want to hear a GREAT Joseph, get the Candian version with Donny Osmond. He's amazing! It's too bad Osmond and Rabke couldn't be paired on a recording together. If you're looking for a good female voice to sing to, though - a good Narrator - look no further than this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the CD","review":"After seeing the play this summer I needed the CD.

In my opinion the best the theme songs are not over emoted, Kelli Rabke is very strong as the narrator and Micheal Damian is exceptionally strong in the lead role. I have listened to this version hundreds of times and and it always my favorite. The ensemble is just that a very strong supporting cast for the principles with no one seeking a star turn. I find Michael Damian much more to my liking than Jason Donovan and a more in character performance than Donny Osmond with the Canadian Cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this version!","review":"I bought this cd because it was the only one the store had under \\"Joseph\\", so I brought it home and listened to it. It was horrible! The Narrator's voice is way too high and shrill and you can't even hear the beauty of the music. All the songs are like that, the actor's voices are terrible. if you want the best version of Joseph, buy the 1982 original BW cast. Believe me, it's worth it. Don't waste your money like I did on this version, it's the only Broadway album I've ever had to give away. Bleh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voices, but.....","review":"If you like good singing and good voices, this may be the CD for you. If, however, you like Broadway cast recordings for the acting and emotions, you might want to skip this. If this were my first introduction to this play, I'd no doubt wonder what all the excitment was about. Everything is a little too \\"bubble gum\\" for my taste.

If you are considering buying it- DEFINATELY get original cast. They (for some reason) decided to put the show to a be-bop style and rap a few lyrics here and there. It doesn't suit this wonderful work of art. The female narrator made me want to throw a tennis ball in her mouth to make her shutup! The original male narrator is very good and they should have have never changed it for recent productions. The female is like fingernails on a chalkboard in my opinion.

I noticed it is no longer in stock here, but felt the need to warn people about this item. The bottle opener piece works in such a way that if you screw in the cork all the way (like you are suppose to with this particular model) it will punch through the bottom of the cork every time and you will get cork in your wine. The only thing good about it is that it lines the corkscrew up with the center of the cork, but that doesn't really matter when you are drinking or picking cork out every time. On the side of the corkpull there is a round little sharp piece to cut the top piece of the bottle to get to the cork. Nice idea, but it doesn't work. It's not sharp enough and there is no way to sharpen it. Plus it is too close to your hands when you pull on the handle that you might even cut yourself. Stick with the old fashion cork screw. Don't waste your money on this wannabe fancy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for awhile, but...","review":"I agree with the previous review about cork-punctures... happens all the time. Worse, however, is the fact that after a relatively short period of time, the inner workings of my particular model broke, leaving it useless.

I was really impressed with King's writing skills. The story was outstanding, and I suggest you buy this book. Full of action, imagery and solid description, you'll feel like you are there in this wizarding universe with Arianna and her friends.

One day, while out in the city, she sees a strange man in a poited hat and thinks to herself \\"Does the fool think he's a wizard or something?\\" and it turns out it is a wizard she sees, only no human is supposed to be able to see wizards so she is taken to Skyhall, where the wizards live, and put on trial for being a wizard seer.

Nigel's guitar solos were so long that the rest of the band went out for sandwiches and a massage (seen on the video screens) and he finished off by propping one guitar up on a stand and shooting it with darts from across the stage, and as for \\"Stonehenge\\", well, Derek said it all when he stopped the song mid-way and shouted \\"it's not too big, your building is too f**king small!\\". Musically, they are just above competent, but this music is so much fun to listen to. They really skewered the cliches of 60's 70's and 80's rock.Final note: When I saw them at the Universal Amphitheater in L.A. in the early 90's, a mosh pit formed. A MOSH PIT!

Not that it was limited to that decade; listen to the Cult's \\"Fire Woman\\" or \\"Love Removal Machine\\" and compare it to Spinal Tap - not a lot of difference. If you grew up on Black Sabbath and BOC and have a sense of humor then this is for you. This recording has the pre-Tap Thamesmen song \\"Gimme Some Money\\". If you want to hear the pre-Thamesmen Originals song \\"All the Way Home\\" (sung acapella in the movie) look on the \\"Break Like the Wind\\" recording.

However, it does feature a song, \\"America,\\" that's not featured in the movie. And perhaps the compilers should have put the songs in chronological order, so we hear \\"Give Me Some Money\\" and \\"Listen to the Flower People\\" before we get to \\"Stonehenge.\\" \\"Christmas with the Devil\\" is a bonus track not included in the film.

The very end was a little cheesy with the roller skates and the ice capade show was wierd too.....but overall, I love this movie. And so does mostly everyone I've watched it with. (With the exception of my mother who doesn't like Jim Carey or Adam Sandler either..so I don't count her vote. Funny just doesn't work for some people)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious. And witty, too.","review":"This is another movie where Robin Williams shines. Fans of his should especially see this film. Either way, anybody who enjoys dry, satirical, witty humor will likely enjoy this movie. There's more to laugh at than to criticize. The negative reviews puzzle me... It's one thing to simply dislike a film, but to not be able to understand the plot? Perhaps some of the humor is too clever (it really isn't). Sure, it's not the best film I've ever seen, but its continuous laughter/smile value makes it worth adding to your collection, to be enjoyed again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and only mildly funny, 2 and a half stars","review":"\\"Death To Smoochy\\" is a murder comedy that has some decent preformances from both Edward Norton and Robin Williams, but failed to really keep my attention or interest. I only found it amusing during a few parts of the film. Most of the funnier parts I found were on the Additional Scenes segment of the DVD. Plus, the film wasn't as morbid as I had been lead to believe. The only thing really giving this movie its R rating was the bad language in the movie, not really the themes surrounding the movie. The whole \\"death\\" to Smoochy part of the movie really wasn't presented that well. I also found a lot of the characters in the film irritating and annoying and Catherine Keener just can't really play [an evil/cruel woman]. Her acting seemed more like faking when it came to the character she was trying to portray. Overall, the movie kind of dragged on and the climax to the movie wasn't really that exciting or interesting. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"death to smoochy","review":"robin williams fans,stay home .this film was a major disapointment and is the second movie in 40 years we walked out of. the kids might like it but mr. de vito did not deliver on this one. save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you haven't seen it already--- what are you waiting for?","review":"The movie is absolutely awesome.

Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death to this Movie...hopefully","review":"I don't see what is the deal with the high praise in some reviews that this movie is getting. This is a lame attempt at comedy at best. Profanity is not humor. Sure, I get the part about wanting to satirize the whole Barney thing, but this movie just tries too hard with little in the way of script or acting. Edward Norton and Robin Williams aren't funny at all. It was a hard movie to get through, but I was just hoping it would either be over, or get better.It did end, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why o why","review":"This movie is in the most part a discrase. shure there are a few funny parts but for the mot part this movie is stupid and poorly acted. I am still trying to figure out why williums and Norten(two actors that I like very much)did this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might have been fun","review":"Robin Williams is a comic genius, and the scenes with him on screen are worth watching (too bad he doesn't have more screen time). And Harvey Fierstein is always entertaining. Danny Woodburn does a great job as the chief \\"little person\\" on the Smoochy show. The comic premise of the movie sounded promising, but it's weighed down by a leaden script, with a silly and unfunny gangster subplot and an utterly unbelievable romantic plot thrown in. The film generates maybe half a dozen chuckles in all. The DVD includes a commentary by director Danny deVito which is largely devoted to telling how much fun the movie was to make. Too bad it's not much fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies that I have seen in a long time. I was really looking forward to this film, too. Danny DeVito is a very talented man who makes very sophisticated and funny films, such as \\"The War of the Roses\\", \\"Throw Momma from the Train\\", and \\"Matilda\\". Why he chose this film as his latest project is a mystery. It was only sporadically funny, but it was mostly crude. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good dark comedy every now and then...GOOD being the key word here. This was a long and drawn out, boring experience. It went on and on and on and went nowhere.Edward Norton does the best he can with the material that he has been given. I love Robin Williams, but he can do much better! Danny Devito can also do much, much better! A major disappointment. DO NOT BRING CHILDREN TO THIS FILM.SKIP IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midly Entertaining with a Few Funny Moments.","review":"With the bevy of talented actors in this film, perhaps I expected more. Robin Williams is a great comedian, though his movies have slipped at the box office lately, and Edward Norton is perhaps one of the best actors of our time. Danny DiVito and Jon Stewart did an admirable job as part of the supporting castas well. But I thought that Spinner was the best character, and he had brain damage.Overall This movie just lacked any real substance to it. I didn't really feel like it had any depth to it. The plot was interesting and new, but yet very thin. In fact perhaps too thin to be made into a motion picture. The sarcastic remarks and few comedic episodes kept me entertained enough to finish it though.For all of you Anti-Barney people, this film may give you an insight to the corupt world of children's television. Or it might just bore you to the point where you'll hate it just like Barney."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay but it's no THROW MAMMMA FROM THE TRAIN.","review":"Robin Williams, playing the third deranged character he's played this year(after INSOMNIA and before ONE HOUR PHOTO), stars as Rainbow Randolph, a beloved but corrupt kids TV show star in the vein of what Barney could be in real life (who's under that suit anyway?). Anyway, rainbow is fired for accepting bribes. He is replaced by the earnest Sheldon Mopes (Edward Norton; FIGHT CLUB) and his persona of Smoochy the Rhino. This doesn't bode well for Rainbow Rudolph and he plots revenge on Smoochy. Sound ridiculous? It is.But it's meant to be. This isn't a great comedy but it has its moments. However, I expected more from the talent involved. I thought Danny Devito made a great comedy with THROW MAMMA FROM THE TRAIN and I guess I just wanted this film to be a little more like that one. Not bad, worth a rental just for Norton and Williams performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"I first saw this movie in the theater when it came out. It had me laughing out loud!

It's a definite one to check out"},{"rating":"2","title":"So dark and yet so light","review":"I love quirky movies, and Death to Smoochy fits the bill. At its core the film is about being a good person and treating everyone with respect. Sound's boring and cliche, right? Wrong, in the case of this movie. The film takes so many twists and turns. It is laugh out loud funny, an amazing parody. There is no way to actually explain it, you'll just have to watch it and see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I think that this movie was great. Any one that thinks that Robin williams is funny should see this movie, And any [person] that would think that this movie is a kids show should get therapy or go to ... .

After purchasing 2 coolers within a month's time, both different brands, I decided to try my luck with the Igloo. It's terrible. The lid does not screw on, it's a pressure fit. I knew this when I bought it. The carry-handle helps to keep the lid in place. Although there is no problem with the lid coming off, it leaks everywhere around the rim when you transport it. I found this out the hard way when I filled it with Kool-Aid and ended up with a car mat soaked with red KoolAid! This is by far the worst of the 3 coolers that I have tried. The first one was a 2 gallon Rubbermaid (leaks around the rim) and the second was a 2 gallon stackable Coleman cooler (leaks around spout). If anybody can recommend a cooler that does NOT leak, I'm all ears!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome cooler","review":"Really works great and is durable. I am a soccer coach and I use this all the time. The only flaw is that the lid is not tight and it sloshes and leaks in the car. Also, almost everyone tries to pick it up by the red handle and it spills (you have to use the white handle to carry.

Each episode contains craft and recipe ideas that are easy and fun.There are great lessons on teamwork and friendship in each movie but Goddess like the Halloween episode the best!

I have used a couple times and it works great ! ! !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little zester.","review":"Great little zester, as I expected from OXO. My biggest gripe is that it is definitely biased against the right-brained among us (left-handed), but as we're also good at adapting we can still make it work. I also wish the channel knife was a little sharper, but that's easily remedied with a metal needle file. Otherwise I'd definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best zester I've ever had.","review":"My whole life, I've always used a sort of grating tool made for zesting. However, this zester completely beats that tool by a long shot! It's less messy (if at all, really) and you're less likely to get the sour white rind of oranges/limes/lemons. AND it's must faster and very practical. A must-have for any kitchen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"I find I have to *push* hard to get thru thick orange and lemon rinds.

Comfortable to hold and easy and efficient to use. Designed for those of us who have arthritis and great for everyone else! Unlike some lesser quality lemon zesters, this one's easy to clean. I own this product and it can also be used for zesting oranges, which is how I most frequently use mine. Price is an absolute bargin. I've seen the same product elsewhere at a much greater cost. You HAVE to get this lemon zester, HERE and NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Zester.","review":"If you do a lot of zesting, then this is the zester for you.

This is my first and I appreciate the price and quality. It makes the job very easy and the size of the zest depends on how big your strokes are. You can make them pretty small too.Other reviews make a good point emphasizing that it does miss some spots. I feel like it's a very minor thing though and many zester will miss pieces too, but don't get this product if you are aiming to get 100% of the zest. It's not a big deal for me personally though as I feel like it misses less than 10% so I can always get another fruit out.MAIN POINTS: Easy to use, easy to clean, great zest of varied size, but does miss some zest. Overall, a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this zester","review":"If you enjoy baking or mixology, you really must have this zester. It should be a staple of every kitchen. It's awesome for adding interest to cocktails like cosmopolitans and gimlets.I've used this zester on oranges, lemons and limes. It works excellently for creating spiral twists on oranges and lemons. Limes are tougher to work with, though I can't say I've ever tried using a different zester on limes. Limes may just be tricker because the rinds are thinner. Overall, though, an excellent value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"cuts an ugly lemon twist and is a rotton zester besides","review":"This must be the worst product I've ever purchased that sports the OXO label. And I've got a lot of the stuff, and have been generally satisfied with it. I needed a channel knife, wanted one where you could draw it sideways like a paring knife (instead of pulling it long-ways towards you--look at other channel knives, you'll know what I mean). This gadget cuts the raggediest, least-attractive lemon twists ever, and it's hard to pull through the rind as well. So I thought OK, it's still a good zester. And.....No-it's-not. Get a microplane, or maybe a different zester, but this one is a turd. Finally, the handle is not \\"comfortable,\\" it's too hard and too big for my (fairly small but not outrageously so) hand. The whole tool is poorly designed and clumsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for","review":"This product did not live up to my expectations. It did not zest properly and the zest it did produce was not as pleaseing to the eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"does Not work","review":"Feels really good in the hand but does not have the sharp cutting action to do anything, also the holes were not large enough, the angle for the pass was not made correctly, I could not get one single little bit of zest from lemons, limes, oranges ..... Had to return it and get another brand. (I had given my good zester to a friend is the only reason I needed a new one ... sure wish I knew what that other brand was)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and disappointed","review":"I believe that this is a quality control issue since a lot of people have good reviews.

I get the feeling like he's setting the stage for a joke... but the joke never gets there.

More garlic actually goes through the mincing holes and the cleaner-upper-pusher-through gizmo does a fantastic job. We have put away or thrown away so many other presses that didn't do the job that well but felt the need to hang onto it in case the next one broke...Now we can throw out the others. The OXO is made so well that I don't think we'll need the others.Oxo makes other great products too.

The pizza cutter, which has fins on the rubber handle, is particularly comfortable, and it does a great job of slicing through thick Boboli pizzas. Unlike more cheaply-made versions, this garlic press feels firm and weighty in your hands, and it does an excellent job of producing finely minced garlic. The red rubber fingers ensure that the piece cleans easily and thoroughly. I did experience a problem with the garlic press, however: recently, the red cleaning fingers would no longer line up with the holes, and after I continued to use it this way for a few more weeks, the press eventually broke in two. Luckily, when I contacted OXO via email, they told me that they stand behind their products 100%, and so I have a new garlic press on the way as we speak.

The style was changed, which I wasn't sure about, but bought one anyway. I didn't care for the feel of it as much my old one, though it seemed to work almost as well as the older style at first. But today I was using it out in the RV and I wasn't able to get hardly any garlic pressed out of it. I finally went into the house and brought my old one out and it worked perfect! I don't think much of the new style and as so many people have stated that theirs has broken, I am going to replace it with a Zyliss. My older one in the house has gotten tons of use and is still working great while my newer one, which I think I may have had for maybe 2 years give or take, has hardly been used at all (especially since the RV sits all winter) and now the press doesn't work. My old one gets 5 stars, but this newer version only 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine broke as well","review":"I was really surprised when this thing snapped.

It got so bad that I had to throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked that well, and then broke!","review":"I'm probably pretty hard on garlic presses, as we cook with garlic almost every day, but I still couldn't believe that I managed to snap the handle off of this one after only a few months of use. Luckily, I had never loved the press - the way the block fit into the bowl always seemed to result in some garlic coming out of the sides and not being pressed through the holes - so this gave me the opportunity to get one I really like (the Zyliss)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This is junk, made of cheap pot metal.

Eventually, the red platic part started to wear down (due to heat from the dishwasher, I suppose -- but these things are supposed to be dishwasher safe) and the hinge broke. I expect garlic presses to last forever -- especially if you pay upwards of $10 for one. I'm looking to buy a new one on Amazon.com now... Hopefully I find something better, but it is dependent on finding reviews, so I figure I'd give back to the community with my own review. Happy shopping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed with OXO products","review":"I really liked this garlic press, until the metal broke. It has not undergone heavy use and was not that old. I haven't fared much better with other Good Grips products - I purchased two dish scrubbers in a row and BOTH broke within a month of use. After the garlic press, I am not sure that I will purchase Good Grips products again. They feel like they should be sturdy, and the rubberized handles are comfortable, but they don't hold up. Considering their cost, it's unacceptable. I do like their measuring spoons, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent at best","review":"I used this for about 2-3 years before it broke when crushing a clove of garlic. I was squeezing down pretty tight when, bam, the metal just broke. I also have to say that it was always a pain to put in the diswasher b/c whenever I took it out, water would leak out of the handles from in between the metal and the black plastic coating. I'm not a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garlic Press Smashes No More..","review":"I bought this unit over a year ago and I loved it, it's attractive, easy to use and comfortable to grip. Unfortunately, it isn't durable, with limited use the top hinge snapped under the stress of crushing a small garlic bulb. Avoid it you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cloves don't Have a Chance","review":"The number one quality of a good garlic press is heft! and this tool has a great, heavy, professional feel. It pulps large cloves in a flash (skin on or skin off). The trademark rubberized handle of the \\"Good Grips\\" line is also a plus. It has a great built-in cleaning feature that makes clearing the holes a snap."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst garlic press - EVER!","review":"I had a Zyliss Susi Garlic Press for many years and just loved it. However, I lost mine during a move. I tried this OXO model and was very disappointed because it just did not work. More garlic comes out the sides of the press than out the front and you have to use a knife to scrap the garlic into your dish. It is just useless with garlic splattering all over everything. I have found OXO products to be cheaply made and poorly designed. I needed a garlic press in a pinch but learned a valuable lesson - you get what you pay for especially when it comes to kitchen utensils."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, until it broke...","review":"I have used this garlic press for a few years, it is too small and never really did a good job of pressing out all of the garlic. It would expel juice and a few bits of garlic. It did not work well at all with unpeeled garlic. But, it was better than anything else. I used it today for 1 clove, the mesh portion through which the garlic is pressed broke in half, and one piece of mesh fell out of the press. I had really expected it to be stronger than that. I will try something different now. Probably the KUHN model, there doesn't really seem to be a perfect garlic press out there, but the reviews for the KUHN look promising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on first use!","review":"I have a bunch of Oxo stuff (like a mixing bowl and apple slicer and such) that has served me well for many years and I like them... so when my old garlic press finally died and I saw this one, I thought, \\"Hey great! It looks durable and I like Oxo.\\" One of the handle grips snapped off on the first use, and even trying to work around that by gripping further up (and fueled by anger that it had ALREADY broken) I could still barely get any garlic to come out the holes - mostly it left a flattened garlic mush inside. SO disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Trouble!","review":"I really tried to like this garlic press but, alas, I don't. While the cleaning mechanism works well and the handles are comfortable, it never completely crushes the garlic clove. Instead it leaves a good 1/4 of the garlic clove stuck to the bottom of the press. To use the entire clove, you have to fish out the garlic remains and then mince then by hand. The problem seems to be that the two sides of the press don't meet tightly. In frustration I bought IKEA's inexpensive garlic press and it works wonders."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Italian loves it!","review":"I've had my OXO Garlic press for three or four years now and it's still like new. I use it approximately 3 or 4 times a week. As said above, this gadget is extremely easy to clean. Just scape out the residue pulp with a small knife, then run it under hot water - done! Perhaps the secret in its longevity it that I cut each garlic clove lengthwise and place each piece cut side down before squeezing. Highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the first review...","review":"The grip handles take in water and drip into other dishes. It's quite annoying. However, atleast this one doesn't rust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with it","review":"This press is ok if you don't mind throwing away the rubber handles. I hate the stagnant water that gets in there, like everyone else said. I discovered the water while pressing some garlic and it got over everything. It just gets nasty in there so I no longer use the handles. It hasn't broken on me, I've just been too lazy to get a new one. It does leak garlic back onto the handles also. Not worth your money IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks sturdy, but it's not","review":"I liked the stocky construction of this press when I bought it. It seemed solid. But, it has a few problems.1. the rubber handles slip--this is a minor problem.2. liquefied garlic oozes out the sides--this is often the part of the garlic you want, so you scrape it off--kind of annoying.3. it leaves a large part of the garlic uncrushed4. after only a few months' use, the hinges break completely, and into the trash it goesI did find this press cleans up fast and easily. That's its main strength. But, overall, I was unhappy with the longevity of this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garlic smusher, not press","review":"When my ancient garlic press finally broke, I bought this one, mistakenly thinking that all garlic presses are equal and liking this one for its design and color. However, I can't get it to actually press the garlic! It just sort of squashes it against the metal grate, rather than pushing it through. I generally have to resort to fishing the smushed garlic back out of the press with a knife and cutting it up. Although this is easier than cutting up an unsmushed piece, I would much rather have a garlic press that did the whole job itself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ours broke, too","review":"It took a couple of years of use, but ours broke at the hinge, too.

I reverted to my old Zyllis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective in design","review":"This garlic press works well and the cleaning feature is nice, until, as so many other's have found, it snaps.

Defective by design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Hinge","review":"Generally I have chosen to purchase OXO products because of their durability. I am very disappointed in OXO this time. After just one year of use, the hinge on my garlic press is broken, and I am now pounding out garlic with a mortar and pestle until I can get to the US to buy a replacement.

After 5 uses, the metal part of it snapped in half. It worked well while it lasted. Same thing happened to my mom. I guess they rather put out quantity than quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"In contrast to some of the other reviews, I find this press harder to use than others that I've owned. This is surprising given OXO's typical track record in usability. In fact, the press that I replaced with this one was also an OXO and worked much better in terms of hand strength required. The reason I replaced the other model was because its coating came off in the dishwasher and it was harder to clean. This is the one real benefit for this model as it is far easier to clean than any other one I've used. The one strange thing that happens with mine is that water will get trapped in the handle and leak in my drawer after it comes out of the dishwasher. It also leaves behind more garlic when pressing than other presses that I've used which feels like a waste. In the end, I'm going to go back to using my old press until I find one that is both easy to use AND easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may look sturdy but its FLIMSY","review":"I've had 2 of these now.

So irritating to use, I checked their \\"warranty\\" and contacted OXO to return and was given a run around - forms to fill out, copy of original receipt, mail it back. \\"Satisfaction\\" warranty is a fraud and a complete lie. Jumped through their hoops. Then a smug company rep called and told me it was \\"not their product\\" and I would have to provide a prepaid envelope if I wanted it back. No refund, nothing. I certainly don't want it back. Well, it was their product. Solution is simple. I will never, ever buy another of their products again. And my advice to everyone - pick another brand, any other brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wastes a lot of garlic","review":"There are 2 major problems with this garlic press:1) Much of the garlic gets stuck inside the hopper of the press and will not come out.2) The holes in the press seem to be too large so mince is not as fine as I would like.I owned OXO's garlic press (Item #: 97-6067011) from WS and it was perfect until the cheap coating started to flake off and within a year it completely broke. I got this garlic press as a replacement from OXO but was disappointed with these 2 problems. Still looking for an excellent replacement. From the reviews, it seems that all of them have some type of flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garlic Press","review":"I have the Kuhn Rikon garlic press and I much prefer that little gem to the OXO. For one thing, the OXO is much harder to use. I'm not a weak person, and I usually have to use both hands or have my husband help me with this one. I can use the Kuhn Rikon without peeling the garlic cloves and that is impossible with the OXO. The grippy handle on the OXO seems to retain the garlic odor where the complete stainless steel construction of the Kuhn Rikon means that there is never a residual garlic smell after washing. The Kuhn Rikon is easier to wash, too. I have not had my OXO break yet, like some others have mentioned, but I don't use it very often. I usually like OXO products, so I am very disappointed with this tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels Great---Until it Breaks","review":"I hate to bad-mouth OXO because I like the rest of their products. They cannot be beat for ergonomic comfort, and in that respect, the OXO Good Grips Garlic Press is no exception. The handles are extremely comfortable to grip, and with very small garlic cloves, minimal pressure is needed to crush them with this press. However, I have owned two of these OXO garlic presses, and both of them have broken while simply pressing a medium-sized garlic clove. The first time this happened, I though perhaps I had just gotten a defective press, and I optimistically purchased a second. Imagine my dismay when three months later, the exact same thing happened to the second press. Although this product looks big and sturdy, unfortunately, looks can be deceiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story - had two, both broke","review":"It's really sad to read all of these reviews and see the same thing I went through. The majority of my kitchen gadgets are Good Grips, and I love them. These presses worked great for a while. The first one developed a crack at the hinge and stopped working properly so I threw it out. Tonight, my second one split at the hinge. These things feel really solid, but the cast metal they are made with doesn't seem to be strong enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed for display, not use.","review":"The first time I tried to use this beautiful tool, the rubber handle slipped off.

I have now owned 2 good grips garlic presses. The first one, was an older model that broke at the hinge. The company replaced it for free with the current model.

Total frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little better than the Zusi 2, but not much","review":"This press is considerably heavier than the Zusi 2 and has a bigger capacity, but although you don't have to have super-strong hands to use it, it requires bigger hands and more hand strength than I've got. If your hands are very large and strong, you'll probably like it, but if not, forget both of these and buy the Kuhn-Rikon Easy-Squeeze instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for only three years","review":"I know I shouldn't complain too much since I used it for three years, but I just get upset when you buy a product that breaks after several years. It cracked on both sides of a handle and wouldn't put any pressure on the garlic to push through. I'm now on the market for a new one and don't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine until it breaks!","review":"Like a few others here have reported, the OXO broke right below the hinge. I would call it an average press with a better hand grip. The plastic hole clearer tended to stay lined up and worked ok. It broke while being used in normal service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked OK... for a while...","review":"As a garlic press, this one is ok but not great. It leaves a fair amount of garlic behind in the press, though what makes it through comes out in nicely even small pieces. It can't seem to handle unpeeled cloves well either. Definitely not if there's more than one.But the biggest reason for my low rating is that, like several other people here, our press tore completely in two at the hinge after just a couple of years of modest use.

Not so much. My handles never leaked, as some reviewers have mentioned, rather they suddenly fell off completely, after maybe two years of moderate use. The metal handles inside are not pretty or comfortable--I use them in a hurry, but now I chop or slice the garlic by hand.

The one thing that is inescapable is that it takes a lot of hand strength to use it. This fact is the overriding reason for my three-star rating. Admittedly, my hands are fairly arthritic, but it still takes a great deal of force to press the garlic through. For that reason alone, I would not recommend this tool for anyone experiencing ongoing pain in their hands; this press will surely aggravate it. The tool itself is sturdy and well made, although I'm also unimpressed with the cleaner feature; it still needs to be manually cleaned. The press goes through the dishwasher just fine.

The first snapped in half. Oxo replaced it no problem. Then the 2nd broke in the same way. Oxo replaced again. Now I have a 3rd. I hope this one lasts longer. The first 2 made it 6 months on average.So to sum up, its not a good press. Buy one made of metal. And if yours is broken, call OXO for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad ergonomics, inefficient pressing, and cheap construction","review":"I dislike this press for three reasons, and I don't recommend buying it. 1) The ergonomic design is poor--there's virtually no leverage on the garlic clove, and it takes quite a bit of hand strength to operate, even for my husband. 2) The plunger does not press the garlic clove all the way through, so there is significant waste left behind. I constantly find myself having to add an extra clove to a recipe to account for the unused garlic that inefficient press leaves behind. 3) Lastly, the metal material used for the hinges is poorly made. Due to #1, bad leverage, I found myself having to press both handles of the press against the counter (instead of squeezing it in my hand). The first one I bought broke the entire hinge, and the second one bent the hinge. I'm usually a big fan of OXO products, but this one is a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke!","review":"I purchased the Oxo garlic press because it looked sturdy.

Wouldn't recommend this one.."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so for Oxo","review":"As with most garlic presses much of the garlic stays in the press and even when you reverse it to push out the garlic with the little prongs you still end up scraping it out with a little knife. If you are pressing many cloves as I usually do and you don't scrape off the garlic on the outside before putting a new glove in, the handle can swing too far open grabbing all the garlic you just pressed out leaving it stuck in the prongs. This press is heavy in the hand but it takes a good amount of pressure to push the garlic through and it you have arthritis you probably would not be able to use this. The hinge part takes a lot of stress I would not put more then one clove at a time I think it would eventually snap off. Not my favorite item from a company that makes so many wonderful gadgets. I would much rather use my little grater and give it a rinse much faster and far less of a mess to clean.

It wasn't. It didn't break but I wish it had because it just took up space for months for no reason after I stopped using it because it didn't work well enough. Finally, after giving it one last chance, I threw it in the trash. I use a fair amount of garlic in cooking, and when I do, I still mince it myself with a knife because the garlic press is so inadequate to the task, which is what I recommend your doing rather than wasting your money on the Oxo Good Grips Garlic Press, at any rate. What is wrong with it is that the \\"minced\\" garlic does stick to the press and it is too much of a hassle to remove it to get the press clean, much less to actually use the minced garlic in food. Even a mortar and pestle work better. I'd try that instead if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks for the warning","review":"I collect all types of Garlic related items ,,, old and new.

I am a seasoned cook and can say that this is one of the most poorly written cookbooks I have ever cooked from. I have made 3 recipes thus far. All have had major proportion issues and have lacked flavor. Even corrections I made as I went based on previous experiences could not save these recipes.

But, like many other casserole and \\"hot dish\\" cookbooks, most of the recipes in this book require you to do a tremendous amount of cooking and prep before you put the stuff in the casserole dish -- and, since the ingredients are already cooked, why do they need an hour of baking time? Answer: so they can be called \\"casseroles\\" or \\"one-dish meals\\". Most of these things could be stirred together and served right after the stove-top cooking process (maybe with minor adjustments), without wasting another hour in the oven. I would also add that many of these casseroles are loaded with butter and are too fattening for me.

Most chapter headings indicate the views of the colonists as being very anti Aboriginal. Although the account is biased and highly subjective it lends itself to a very interesting read, one that any scholar of Australia or the far east and especially anyone interested in Indian-white relations will enjoy. The book details the original encounters with the natives as well as contemporary native issues, such as the 1988 bicentennial of the founding in which a massive wave of Aboriginal protest swept the nation to draw attention to the plight. Of course parallels with American Indians are everywhere. A very interesting book, although \`Fatal Shore' is probably a superior and less anti-European account.Seth J.
