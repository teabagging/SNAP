But fortune favors the stupid, which in this case is both sides. As it says in the openning of the show, \\"It\`s wherepaleface and redskin both turn chicken\\".

There are so very funny cameos, one by Don Rickles, that especially stands out. The first season works so well and looks great in black and white. It's a shame the the only other season changes things around so much and doesn't live up to this classic season.The only draw-back is the what seems like an extra-long beginning which the DVDs don't allow you to chapter jump through it!

I've called Apple a million times but they refuse to replace the computer or offer any type of refund.

It is also the one that has suffered most from the passage of time, as subsequent archaeological research has revealed errors in what was considered, in Norris's day, to be \\"factual\\" information about costume. The best thing about his book, in my opinion, is the meticulous line drawings of brooches and other items of period jewelry, but again, more recently published works contain excellent, full-color photographs of the same or similar specimens.

Thankfully, the 7 original plays of this collection are ingenious and hilarious enough to warrant the price of the book.

The good plays are worth it, but be warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading fun!!!","review":"Escape to world that mocks the closed mind! Even though he could delve a little deeper into his pokes at great literature, David Ives does a great job at weaving in Shakespeare and other literary works into his hilarious plays. \\"Bathroom humor\\" maybe, but raised to an art form! I enjoyed it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking the English Language to an Art Form","review":"In these days of cookie-cutter plays, where an intellectual evening is watching David Copperfield making his career disappear, it is refreshing to read anything that challenges one to think. All In The Timing succeeds, with Ives mastery of the English language and timing being the key to the cleverness of the play. These series of plays are not slap-stick, nor are they Checkov, but an intellectual medium for one who has apparently a bit ahead of his time. While some will find the read of some of the plays difficult (The Universal Language and Phillip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread). These plays, in particular, are for enjoying on stage, rather than read. But for the most part, this collection is an enjoyable evening of intellectual theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking at the script from a director's point of view","review":"I bought this script because it is on my community theatre's schedule to perform in March. I was very surprised with how I little I liked the script in its entirety. I am familiar with Sure Thing because I worked on it in college, and was expecting more of the same...quick witted, funny pieces that would easily make for a night of entertainment. Honestly, due to content and language, I don't see how we can perform many of these plays on our stage. I know that the scholars are going to bash me, but from a director's point of view, I vote to shelf this one. No audience is going to want to sit through all 14 of these plays when most won't make much sense to them. They want to be entertained and walk away with a thought other than confusion at the end of the night. This script is perfect for college theatre, but that doesn't make me like it any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well I seem to be alone","review":"As an actor involved in the production of several of the plays from all in the timing, while I've found that the plays certainly are all memorable, and very clearly written by an INCREDIBLY intelligent person, far too often these plays suffer from being flat out unfunny. No, theyre not unfunny. The jokes just, far too often, come, and simply refrain from BEing funny. It's unfortunate. The Universal Language is a play that is always FUN to do, and one that will never leave peoples brains, but it's not entertaining because of any wit. This is what tends to happen to Ives. He gets going, and write a great play, but the characters don't have much depth, are not particularly interesting to play, and don't manage to actually be comical too frequently, so it's really not worth it to want to participate in the plays.

Check the publisher of the version you're buying before you place your order.General Books LLC created this book using automated OCR scanning. There are numerous typos and there may be missing pages.

I found the plot to be fascinating and let other things go until I finished the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York's Greatest Portrayal","review":"Tom Wolfe has a magical touch for breathing life into non-fiction, as in The Right Stuff, but in Bonfire of the Vanities, his skill as a novelist and a satirist is blatantly evident. This bleak and witty portrayal of New York life in the eighties is both hilarious and dark at the same time. Wolfe's characters represent the spectrum of human behavior, while his situations are riddled with ironies and paradoxes of truth about human existence. This book is most enjoyable, I would imagine, if you have at least some knowlege of New York, because much of its humor and depth stems from New York culture, but it is also true that New york is a micrchosm of american existence on a whole, so Bonfire of the Vanities may, in fact, be a universally American Novel. Whichever, it is worth reading if not only for the reason that it is funny, brilliantly written, and makes clear the fact that Tom Wolf's name belongs on the list of satirists that includes Jonathon Swift and Oscar Wilde."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know it's cheesy to say this, but I couldn't put it down!","review":"This not only happens to be my favorite Tom Wolfe book, but my favorite book period. The plot is exciting and realistic. Readers will relate with every single character depicted here. And no one matches Wolfe's descriptive capabilities. What the rest of us would need a million words to say, Wolfe manages to express with a few key and very visual phrases. So far, there isn't a book I've enjoyed more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't put it down...","review":"...but I easily could have. Bleah. Dull and racist. I am not much of a Tom Wolfe fan at this point, having read and been bored by both \\"A Man in Full\\" and \\"Bonfire.\\" I admit laughing at and being impressed by the vivid characterizations--the prose and powerful description does keep you going, but the plot definitely does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it was Hip in the 80's .....","review":"But it falls flat in the 90's. I grew up in NYC during the 80's and I remember the fear and the bizarre crimes that took place then so I understood the climate that the book was written in but Tom Wolfe just dragged everything out to the point that I had to simply skim it to get through it.I know many people loved this book but I really felt it was dated and the writing was bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible disappointment","review":"Perhaps I expected too much after hearing so many good things about this book. But I found it one of the most dull works of fiction I've ever read. I admit that Wolfe does has a prescient insight into the 80's greed mentality. But the writing and his use of language is sophomoric at best. This is one \\"best-seller\\" that clearly plays to a mass audience, but completely will be forgotten with time."},{"rating":"1","title":"an out of towner's attempt to depict NY","review":"A poor disjointed sketch of New York.This book came to me with great recommendation.Terrible disappointment.Characters not developed fully but left up in midair.Lots of cliches.Describes Bronx like an out of towner from Utah or somewhere,typical white reaction to black abodes.If police story is what you want, read Joseph Wambaugh.Honest stories, not grandiose cocktails of Bond Millionaires and Attornies.For cynicism and society parties, watch Woody Allen.No one person ,not even Tom Wolf can sketch a true picture of New York.He has seen the tail of the elephant,the other blind men have seen the rest.New york is too big for writers to do justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, bleak, dirty and dead","review":"I have not bothered to read the last 100 pages of this book because the firtst 450 are just filled with self-serving, hypocritical, lying ogres.

Evidently there was something wrong with the printing of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing romp","review":"An amazing romp through 1980s New York, Wall Street, the court system, and the lives of the rich and aspiring to be rich. Through the downfall of wall street trader Sherman McCoy, Wolfe brings the reader into the psyches of his characters, forcing one to sympathize with even the most despicable. In the process, he helps us to understand humanity. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Relevant and Exciting","review":"I have seen so many passing references to Tom Wolfe's first novel, Bonfire of the Vanities, as a modern classic, that I thought I should finally read it (I never saw the movie either); yet, I was worried that, in the 24 years since its publication, it might have become dated and irrelevant. I had no need to worry. The New York City and Wall Street of the 1980s has not changed much and with the focus of the 2008 great recession as a new point of reference, Bonfire of the Vanities has an immediacy that belies the passing of a quarter of a century. The characters and the situations related in the novel are contemporary, and above all, the book tells a very, very good, indeed exciting, story. It is easy to predict that Bonfire of the Vanities will remain in print indefinitely and will continue to be read by readers like me, who value good and pleasurable writing, centered around plausible and relevant plots. I now plan to watch the 1990 movie adaptation starring Tom Hanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of the Universe","review":"Sherman McCoy, a 39 year-old white Wall Street bond salesman, self described \\"Master of the Universe\\" lives on Park Avenue, he is married with a daughter and is a member of high society.

It all blows up when one of the black guys turns out to be severely injured and the press, police and the mayor get involved in political issues involving race and class.

Would make a great movie.... anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great style, interesting characters, but what's the point?","review":"Wolfe's innovative descriptions of the '80s New York culture is the strength of this novel, yet is not enough to excuse the completely disappointing epilogue. Apparently pulled from another story, this ending contradicts all evidence and character development that 99% of the wordage strove to build. Attempts at making a statement about racism, politics, and justice is thrown out in leiu of a disappointing synopsis that downplays every sympathetic character while the story's villians prosper against all reason. The epilogue offers no resolution, and thus, makes no statement. Imagine sitting through every day of the O.J. Simpson trial and being deprived of a verdict. Fortunately, Wolfe's style makes the bulk of the reading easy enough to digest, but in the end you have to wonder why this book was ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"General Books LLC Version of this book is a joke","review":"I've only read the first 100 pages and the book is excellent. The publishing of the book is unbeleivably bad, however. I can't even believe they could sell such a thing. There are probably 20 types per page. ItIsVeryCommonForWordsToBeSmashedTogetherlikeThis. W often appears as \\\\V. 8 1/2 appears as 8V2. If you appreciate puzzles you may like this version, but if you actually want to know the story as Tom Wolfe intended it, you should skip this version and anything published by General Books LLC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but shallow","review":"I used to live in New York City, so I thought Tom Wolfe was right on target in describing its politics and different social scenes, and satirizing them. However, I couldn't relate to any of the characters; they were far too stereotypical and not enough like real people for my taste. You had your token Irish cops and pols, your token Italian pol/mafiosos, your token Upper West Side Jewish intellectual lawyers, and your token doofus WASP stockbrokers and socialites. I wouldn't be surprised if some people found these depictions insulting. Maybe I'm personalizing this, but it's also almost as if Wolfe is saying that if you don't fit any of these stereotypes, you can never be a true \\"hip\\" New Yorker. I would have found this book more interesting had the characters been much more complex."},{"rating":"1","title":"General Books LLC edition is a bootleg.","review":"This edition, all in italics, is full of typos because it is the result of scanning Bonfire of the Vanities and then reprinting it using OCR (optical character recognition) software.

Don't buy into this scam."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I could have SEEN the book","review":"I ordered two books (after hearing a review on NPR) for guys who travel a lot.

What could a Bronx defense attorney have to do with this guy that makes a ton of money on Wall Street?Sherman McCoy had a demanding presence throughout the book. He is the elusive millionare that everyone wants to be. He seems to have everything...what could possibly go wrong?Then there is his mistress. She is cheating on her husband, but seems otherwise harmless. It turns out she just may be the sneakiest of all.I cannot believe how the justice system was run in this book. What Kramer did was crazy. I felt it really gave me an inside look at what really happens and how people try to win over their consituants. Poor Sherman just got lost in the shuffle. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Wolfe Novel","review":"I ended up reading Bonfire after reading \\"Man in Full\\" and \\"I am Charlotte Simmons.\\" All three have a similar style and feel about them. I thoroughly enjoyed all three, including Bonfire. The difference in Bonfire is that at first I didn't care for any of the characters. In fact, all the main characters leave a bad taste in your mouth. Later, as the plot unfolds, some of those feelings change. It is a tribute to the author's excellent writing and grasp of human nature that even though I disliked the characters, I was drawn to them and their story. Its like a New York version of a Greek tragedy except it unfolds over the course of a majority of the book. The characters seem real--the story seems real and you end up rooting for the protagonist despite his many flaws. This is the Great American Novel--the kind that is rarely written these days. Bonfire is a book that will continue to be read 100 years from now--a modern classic. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful classic","review":"I loved this book from the first line to the last, it is an unparalleled, ironic and insightful foray into the New York psyche in the 80s, a page turner, a mind opener and a good laugh -- in short it is one of my favorite modern NYC classics, and I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Awesome! A realistic novel of the first order!Tom Wolfe brings to life such vibrant and engaging characters, intricately intertwining their lives with the social conscience of the American reader.As the legal drama of the century unfolds in the South Bronx I couldn't help but be sucked into the McCoy case, ripping through chapters as New Yorkers undoubtedly ripped through Peter Fallow's articles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, bad Kindle edition","review":"I already own this book, just purchased the Kindle edition and it is disappointing. It just looks like a badly scanned pdf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Succumbing to concupiscience...","review":"Tom Wolfe understands human nature. He skewers just about every character in this scathing satire, revealing their hidden motives vis a vis their outward actions. Pride seems to be at the root of everyone's shameful conduct in this novel. Tempted to forget about fallen human nature? You'll remember after reading this one; I recognzied my own sordid manipulations and rationalizations in Wolfe's well-crafted characters. The book's not preachy, though, and it's funny; I laughed out loud a number of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"One of the best books I've ever read.

The book has 30 chapters. Master them and you will put 30 top-notch management tools in your briefcase. This author clearly knows his stuff, and he knows how to explain it with no wasted words. The six appendices are worth the price of the book alone.

So when I saw that DK was putting a Marvel one together, I was looking forward to it. Well, it delivers for the most part. In my opinion, I think they left out too many characters. The DC one was more thorough. But all the impotant characters are in it. The art work is straight out of the comics.

I would expect this to be incomplete and it is: after all, there are just too many Marvel characters for one affordable volume. But in too many instances it's also inconsistent (some entries are up to date while others ignore the events of the last year or two), flat out inaccurate or incomplete. The weight that key characters are given is also arbitrary: why does Thanos (a current, key villain in many titles) get 1/6 of a page when Jarella (the Hulk's dead girlfriend from the 1970s) gets half a page. Ridiciulous. They obviously never handed this to a fan to proofread - an easy and obvious move."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks!!","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. Many facts were wrong such as first appearances of many of the characters as well as powers were entered incorrectly.

I am, however, a fan of several animated TV shows that feature Marvel characters(X-Men, Iron Man, Spiderman & His Amazing Friends, etc). I wanted to know the back story on them, so I got this book (along with the DC Encyclopedia).The characters are featured in alphabetical order. We are given a brief but detailed history along with at least one illustration. There is also a profile that lists their \\"real\\" name, occupation, height, weight, eye/hair color, & a list of their powers or talents. The more prominent the character, the larger their layout is.The hardcover is fairly large. I have looked through it several times & have learned a lot. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the DC version seemed to be a little more thorough. For instance, it includes each characters hero/villain status while the Marvel book doesn't.

There are many better convective heat transfer books out there. The only good thing about this book is the numerous references to other books.On a last note: If you're learing this subject don't believe the reviewers that gave this book five stars, they must be paying off a debt to Bejan or have 30+ years experience in convective heat transfer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very difficult text book to learn anything from","review":"I get the impression that the reader from NH is the only reviewer to have tried to solve some of the problems in this book. There is no possible way to solve these problems. They are on subjects and situations not covered in the book, and even if they were, good luck in understanding Bejan's writing. He skips massive steps, giving only solutions and equations without explanations. Not everyone like reviewer Jeff Booth was born understanding convective heat transfer, so some of us must learn from books. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one.

Better and best respectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melancholy and Cliche","review":"Come on, people, get over yourselves. You could find a hundred lovely writers out there, and while McDermott may be one of them, it doesn't mean there's anything particularly interesting about this book. It's filled with such melancholy and self-importance about subject matter that is really cliche at this point. Lovers torn apart, young children in the neighborhood wondering how babies are made, teen pregnancy. It's like something a junior high class might read.McDermott might be trying to pull off something magestic here, but it just comes off as weird. Why is this first person narrator, who isn't even a main character in the story, wandering through these people's lives like a ghost, and killing them all off? That's right, when McDermott runs into a situation that's rather dull, which is often, she gives us a little aside about someone's child dying. It's manipulative and cheap writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sketchy","review":"I was eager to read the book after watching the film on BBC2 (England). I expected the novel to be more descriptive, imaginative and more three dimensional than the film but found it to be quite sketchy and without fluidity. It jumped from past to present and from scene to scene quite disjointedly and I found it difficult to continue reading for I felt like I'd read the same paragraph over and over. As a result of this the only characters which seemed to convey themselves as three dimensional were that of Rick and Sheryls'. There didn't seem to be any revelation at the end of the story, I guess with having knowledge of that era that it would be quite obvious in the way things ended, with broken teenage love and little thought for the result of that. Quite disappointing overall, though worth watching the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing extraordinary","review":"i had to read this book in school. it's horrible. it's annoying.

All the graphs are printed in blue and uses different types of shading to show different regions. The font size is about 8 or 10.

It was published in the last few years so I'm totally confused what's the issue here. I mean come on. I can print full color pages on my laser printer for about 3 cents a page.

I think I also discovered the next 'C.S.

I've marked pages for review and have begun developing lessons for future use in sermons and Bible studies based on ideas I found in this book.My advice to the reader is this: If this book seems boring or irrelevant to you, put it back on the bookshelf and get it out again only after a few years have passed.

As he climbed in bed with this HUGE text-book sized book, he said to me, \\"Been nice knowin' ya.\\"It's neat to have all CS Lewis' books together in one place, but this thing really is huge. Too heavy to hold to read comfortably unless you're at a desk and it's laying flat. Or maybe if you're sitting up and it can lay in your lap. But for snuggly bedtime reading, no go.

While I would have liked to have The Four Loves in here as well, I think this is a great collection that I am happy to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one to start with...","review":"Here we see one of the most brilliant minds of the last century explaining his distaste with the Christian religion and how he came full circle to eventually embrace it. Lewis' stature can not be questioned; a man of seemingly limitless intellect, he found himself the lynchpin for many a Christian with questions and many a seeker with doubts. Lewis was an agnostic until mid-life when his unending search for truth and meaning brought his path alongside J.R.R. Tolkien's. Over time Lewis had gone from atheist to theist to eventually embracing the message of Christ. He could hardly believe it himself!This work is a classic. Originally compiled from a series of radio programs in Britain, it has been a best-seller ever since and impacted millions of lives. His insights into Natural and Moral law as well as virtue are mind-expanding to say the least. I will not presume to explain Lewis' arguments better than he, so just buy the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing to complain about","review":"The book was delivered within a few days in good condition.

I doubt he read it himself, first.Most of the claims he makes are based on assumptions, which makes for very frustrating reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"C.S. Lewis lost me on the first chapter","review":"This book builds up chapter by chapter as sort of an argument for Christianity. The first chapter tries to argue that all people, for all time in all cultures, all have an inante sense of Moral Law, and despite minor differences, everyone has the same Moral Law, and that therefore, there must be a God.I find it incomprehensibly narrow minded that Lewis feels the only explanation for humans having common, cross cultural behavior, is a God. I was hoping for this book to keep me interested for quite a while, but instead I'm getting a rehashing of Descartes, and no credit is even given!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectual Garbage","review":"C.S. Lewis does a diservice to Christianity in this book. His views are narrow and his explanations both condescending and banal. The statement that Jesus can be only the son of God, or one of a demon is ridiculous and serves only to keep himself feeling safe. He ignores scripture by stating this. \\"All things I have done, you can do also and more....\\" He ignores what does not fit his preconceived notions and speaks primarily to and for old women wanting the assertions that they have always believed in validated by an intellectual. He takes no risks in this. He does not stretch his mind, or the reader's imagination. It's old dogma spoken in a modern and rational language. It's dull in the extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murky Reasoning","review":"Although technically well written, Lewis' argument stumbles from one questionable assumption to the next. The result is a sad parody of logical thought.For a Christian this book is a gift, it reinforces faith that already exists. For those on the edge of faith, Lewis might be the push they are searching for. Other than that, it is unlikely to have any lasting effect on the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching to the Converted","review":"C.S. Lewis is without doubt the finest Christian apologetic who ever lived. While reading \\"Mere Christianity,\\" I could not help being impressed with his persuasive writing style and heart-felt conviction. Upon closer inspection, however, subtle ambiguities come to light. Though they are too numerous to mention here, suffice it to say that Lewis relies on emotion rather than logic and empiricism to reach his \\"logical\\" conclusions. On the positive side is his irreproachabe sincerity: C.S. Lewis is one of the few men who give Christians a GOOD name. Regardless of his faith, he was a lion of a man and scholar, and his kind is sorely missed. Too bad he, like so many others, preferred comfort to the Truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book attempts to give an analytical explanation for God","review":"This is just more of the same explanations people have been making to justify the existence of god for centuries. There is nothing new in it. It offers no new light on the question of god. I find it interesting that so many people are converted to Christianity by this book. Lewis just drove me that much further from believing in a god, whether Christian or otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and Powerful","review":"Last year, prior to the release of the film version of the \\"Chronicles of Narnia: LWW\\", I decided to share the book with my young daughters. When I bought the book for them, I also picked up a copy of \\"Mere Christianity\\" for myself. I've now reread it (not common for me) twice and have also purchased \\"The Abolition of Man\\" and \\"The Problem of Pain\\". Each reading reveals new insights into the source of C.S. Lewis' faith and, it turns out, the source of my own.Challenging, insightful, and wise. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but...","review":"I find this book exceptional for the intellectual believer, but I can't help but wonder if it's possible to reason your way into faith (the very words sound oxymoronic). Often, I hear this book referenced as a prosyletory tool, but I wonder if conversion ought to start with something else--something more along the lines of Lewis's own mind-changing experience. I recommend this book without reservation for believers, but I'm not sure all the reasoning here is completely cogent for nonbelievers, or the best place for a nonbeliever to begin looking for God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good not bad","review":"We read this book for my bible study group. There were mixed views on it...I myself wasn't a huge fan of the book for a few reasons. This book is based on radio broadcasts by Lewis a long time ago, and as a result a lot of the things Lewis discusses don't account for recent developments and modern day things that affect Christianity. Also, I felt like Lewis was a bit closed minded in his scenarios and theories about Christianity. However, I have heard people say that they converted to Christians after reading this book so maybe there is something I am missing. It isn't the best book for a discussion, its probably better for reading for yourself. The book does discuss interesting topics and like Christianity and Marriage, Faith, Hope, etc. Overall, although I didn't like it too much, i don't regret reading it either, so maybe that says something for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This made me question my own faith in Christianity","review":"I \\"read\\" this with my Sunday School Class (all over 30) to gain insight into our beliefs and found that I strongly disliked it. The man talks in circles, argues his case for atheism, attempts to sell Christianty but fails misberably. I would never recommend this book to a believer or non-believer. It is nothing short of jibberish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Screed","review":"In this \\"Classic\\" defense of religion (Christianity in particular), Apologist-in-Chief C.S. Lewis offers a stunning smorgasbord of flawed premises, tortured logic, and non-stop non sequiturs. From a master wordsmith, jabberwockey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth and lies","review":"I have been surprised just how little CS Lewis bases his theology on the Bible. He has some interesting ideas, but often writes things that are confusing or just plain untrue. He writes as though evolution is a substantiated fact, but really it is just people's ideas and it contradicts the Bible. He bases a lot of his ideas about our behavior on what seems like a good idea, with no reference to the Bible. He doesn't give the impression that he was very familiar with the Bible. He appears to have been heavily influenced by human philosophies and tries to incorporate them into a religious framework."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paperback is cheaper?","review":"The kindle edition is more expensive than the amazon.com-sold paperback!

Go buy the actual, physical text!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mere Delusion","review":"Some friends who found out that I was an atheist suggested this book. Being so highly praised in the Christian community, I decided to give it a try. It was soon apparent that the author had no deep understanding of religion, science, or logic. Mr. Lewis gives little or no justification for his beliefs. I did come away with greater understanding of how emotions can cloud one's better judgement. The only book I've read worse than this is I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FAITH TO BE AN ATHEIST."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and Last Book I'll Read by C. S. Lewis","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a Christian friend. I also read it because I've read and heard that C. S. Lewis is a great author. One more reason is that I was struggling with the concept of God. I am a Catholic.I guess I'm trying to say that I read it with an open mind, expecting to find insights and maybe some genuine knowledge.All I can say is my actual experience: This is the worst book I've ever read all the way through.

I have read good Christian apologetic books (The Case for Christ, for example) and in comparison this book fails miserably. Lewis uses silly arguments (Moral Law? Please) to try and convince his audience, but it merely solidifies the atheist's viewpoint that ninety percent of Christian arguments are far-fetched and preposterous. Most of the book is about how a Christian should live, but what good is talking about a Christian life if he can't convince the reader that Christianity is true?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every atheist should read this book...","review":"not because it contains any profound insight but because somebody's going to eventually quote it and you might as well have read it.

If you don't get anything from it, that's your own fault. I encourage everyone to consider it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mere Dogma!","review":"This is not a work for the those uninitiated into Christian dogma. Within about 50 pages, Lewis establishes the existence of the Christian God from the premise that the human being enters this world with a priori knowledge of right and wrong. Wow! The argument is weak, and proceeds through a sort of process of elimination of alternative explanations rather than through a demonstration of the necessity of the Christian God. People had told me that CS Lewis was an intelligent Christian apologist. However, it seem to me that this book is not meant to bring anyone into the Christian fold, but simply to keep them in.

He is truly a consumate writer - brilliant, understandable, witty, and humane. Even if you disagree with him, which he makes difficult to do, it is impossible to not respect his intelligence. Each of his works in this handsome volume make that very clear, and all are worth reading.My only quibble with this edition (and hence my 4 star rating of otherwise 5 star material) is the appearance of several small mistakes that should have been corrected by editors. A line of text is missing in \\"Mere Christianity;\\" there are a few other small mistypings or misspellings elsewhere as well that are not present in non-collected individual publications of Lewis' work.That said, the overall presentation is handsome, if large, and even with the failings of its editors, this is surely a volume that deserves to be owned and read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"I love C.S.

My first book in 25 years, and a great one.Having converted to Catholicism, I did have some wonder about that. No, I am secure enough not to have been sidetracked or such, I just wasn't sure... if I would be... having to revisit too many old notions. That turned out not to be the case, and from what I have read, I would have no problems suggesting these to any Christian. Some things are simply... without origin, to a degree, and common to all.

The problem with highly intelligent people, like C.S Lewis, is this: they do not know how to communicate their ideas in plain language so that \\"plain\\" people can understand what they're saying. I call that ignorance.These books are mostly filled with highfalutin, pompous, non-sensical drivel.Unless you are highly intelligent don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't recieve that product/ credit card was billed","review":"i never received that book even though my cc was charged. it might have been sent in august but i wonder if they are still printing the book for me?? and walking it to maryland.i do not recommedn this source and had i known this would happen i never would have used amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm sorry but Mr.Lewis' writing struck me as pedantic and boring. I was initially interested in his works because of my readings in grief literature. I couldn't get into any of his stories. They seemed dry to me. I like the idea behind his \\"Screwtape Letters\\" but it didnt hold my attention. I am glad he is well read but personally I am just not into his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good..","review":"i could only read half an hour of this critically aclaimed outline. its too wordy/complicated for even the very seasoned christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Perspectives","review":"This book was a suggested read by a \\"non-Christian\\" friend of mine that thought I should give it to everyone I was trying to disciple. Wow...what a read. Not only did this book strengthen my faith, but for a borderline unbeliever to suggest I read it was unbelieveable. C.S. Lewis knocked it out of the park! This book is perfect for every person not sure if God is real and if His name is Jesus. This will be an annual read for me, reminding me to think way outside the little box I have created about God. Awesome Book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Exposition on Reasonable Faith","review":"C.S. Lewis offers here the quintessential book on Christian epistemology. He helps us understand how we know what we know and why we think we know what we claim to know even if what we think we know we really don't know. ;-)Actually, Lewis is tremendously clearer and easier to understand than I am, so stop reading this review and read the book. (Aw, heck, let me finish, after all...) This is a rational, logical, and eternally classic exposition of the faith that will never outlive its usefulness. Even though atheists have managed to wriggle around Lewis's \\"liar, lunatic, Lord\\" trilemma, the arguments herein contained still offer fodder for the inquisitive brain.This book is a \\"must read\\" and is concise enough that it actually can be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read-classic","review":"If you've ever wondered or even thought about God then make it a priority to read this book.

Lewis, I kept kicking myself for not reading it earlier in life. I have known about this work for 30 years but simply did not get around to reading it until I retired. My bad!!A great book. I will purchase copies for several friends and will bring it to the attention of Bible classes in which I participate.Great responses to the great questions of this age.Gerald C. Brunworth"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's big, and bold, and beautiful","review":"Perhaps the boxed set would be a better choice for one wishing to carry around their C.S. Lewis with them everywhere they go (and who wouldn't), but I particularly enjoy having these signature classics all together in one tome. It greatly facilitates flipping around to other selections for reference. I'm not going to review the individual works, because I think if a person is considering buying this collection they already know their Lewis pretty well. I have to mention the Screwtape Letters, though. What a wonderful work of allegory and fiction, and though it is fiction it is certainly not out of place in a collection of apologist writings and social commentary. Also deserving particular notice is The Abolition of Man, proving that Eastern philosophy and Christian ideology are not mutually exclusive. I consider this volume one of the greatest in my literary collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is a classic. I would recommend it to long-time Christians as well as new Christians or those wanting to explore the basic components of the Christian faith.Lewis is humble, positive and writes a hopeful and uplifting book. There are a few comments that show some biases of the time in which it was written, but looking at the big picture this book is excellent.Of course, there will always be those who criticize the logic of Lewis' book and I just do not understand the obsession with trying to prove to people of faith that they are wrong, unenlightened, uninformed. On the contrary, I think Lewis book shows that Christianity is not for blind followers but for people who are ready to be challenged each day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book which changed my life.","review":"In this book, Lewis tells it as it is, no frills no false promises, just the bare facts. Starting as Lewis often does, from essentially nothing and building on simple day-to-day examples he explains from the ground up the what and why of Christianity. Later he delves into more complicated and tricky philosphical questions which have held many back from believing. While not proving christianity (an impossibility in my opinion), he makes a very strong case and this is truly the book which changed my life.If you like it, check out \\"The Pilgrims Regress\\" also by Lewis, easily the best book I have ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-changing book.","review":"'Mere Christianity' is an informal discussion of what is at the heartof Christianity. This book literally changed my life. Lewis brought downmany of the prejudices I had against the Church and religion in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Thought-Out","review":"Since Lewis began as an unbeliever and gradually worked his way into Christian belief, we felt it would be a good read for someone who is converting from the Muslim faith to Christianity. We have found the book to be a very valuable tool for this purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"C.S. Lewis, besides being a great fiction writer and a fair poet, is a briliant mind. His theology, well, his theology is the theology that you want to read. When you read this book you can really see one of the greatest minds at work. For the faithful as well as the unfaithful intellect, this is a book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"One of the best books on Christanity I have ever read!\\"","review":"Lewis's descriptions and illustrations of the basics of the Christian life are very practical for the one investigating the tenents of Christianity. I have read and re-read \\"Mere Chistianity\\" several times and each time gaining new insight. Next to the Holy Bible it holds a place of regular usage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read book guaranteed not to leave you neutral","review":"Lewis was a Cambridge don highly educated in the classics, which shows in his books. This is not an easy read, but worth every minute you spend with it. To Lewis, and to me, history has moved Christianity beyond the need to prove itself (if one knows even a little history), so he sets out to explain it. And does so magnificently. And if you need a simple, honest book about dealing with grief, read his book, A Grief Observed, about the death of his wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book...ignore the miniscule differences","review":"lewis had a definite gift for tackling a subject, almost scientifically, step by step. i was considering Budhism as a possible alignment to Christianity when i read this book. thank God, He used it as a goad in my life. that was two years ago. i just finished reading it again, and i retain my opinion. read it with an open mind, though, and overlook the insignificant dogma that contradicts with statments in the Bible that you interpret differently. there aren't more than a handful, but they deal with some issues like purgatory and alchohol use. i really enjoy this book and think that it's a significant addition to any philosopher or apologist's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"I read this book and was amazed at how good it was. I bought it for my friend and it came in very quickly and was in perfect condition. She absolutly loves it as well! Amazing book that I would reccomend to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life","review":"A confirmed agnostic of many years, I believed Christianity was illogical and no reasoning person could believe in it. C. S. Lewis's Mere Christianity proved me wrong. Lewis uses reason and logic to convince readers that Christianity not only makes sense, it is TRUE. A wonderful book for the intellectual seeker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended Reading For The \\"Not Sure\\"","review":"This book is one of only a few books I have ever read, and re-read, and re-read, and read again. C.S. Lewis uses simple, yet comprehensive, arguments that lead the reader to the inarguable conclusion that Jesus was in fact God. The way in which the argument unfolds is simply masterful; almost like a well written murder mystery where the villian was visible all along, but you just couldn't quite figure it out. Then all at once the answer hits you!Lewis goes on to explain how the Christian faith interacts with the individual and with society in general. C.S. Lewis does this without any bias to a particular Christian dogma, instead opting to address the common beliefs of all Christian religions.This book will be enjoyed by anyone who is unsure of the existence of God or unsure of who Jesus is. It will also be enjoyed by firm believers for its simple style. A must read in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"C.S.

The book is an excellant description on Chistrian theology. In fact, I think I am going to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding description and explanation of Christianity","review":"As the title implies, this book is about what all Christians hold true; i.e., the commonly agreed upon aspects of faith held by all Christian churches, regardless of denomination or doctrine. For anyone wanting to understand the basic tenets of Christianity, or anyone wanting an introduction to Christianity, this is the book to read. I've already read it four times. I love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would purchase from this seller the next time","review":"The book arrived very soon after I ordered it. Its description was accurate and the price was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbfounding gaps in logic","review":"I am a believer who loves the Lewis of the Narnia books, but his more argumentative books, including this one, Mere Christianity, are often rather lacking in basic coherence. The gaps in logic are often dumbfounding.My favorite example is Lewis's argument that you cannot accept Jesus as a wise man unless you accept that he is God, because anyone who claims to be God, and isn't God, is barking mad. Putting aside the issue of whether \\"the hisorical Jesus\\" actually made such a claim, alas, anyone who has ever taken a even a cursory look at the great writers and sages throughout history knows that one minute they can be the fount of wisdom and the next can be absolutely off their rocker. Dostoevsky springs most immediately to mind.And thats not the worst gap in logic in the book.So, those looking for a reasoned defense of Christianity are strongly advised to go straight to G.K. Chesterton's The Everlasting Man and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was lucky to get the one star.","review":"CS Lewis managed in the Chronicles of Narnia to prove his mastery of the clumsy religious allegory. And, with Mere Christianity, he tries to approach the thorny topic of God's existence and the divinity of Jesus using \\"logic\\" and \\"reason.\\" It's as subtle a piece of elegant design and craftsmanship as any tractor factory in Rostok.Facile arguments are bolted together using bold assumptions and the Krazee-Glue of faith. It's amazing that anyone could send such a clunky contraption to plough furrows in logic and reason and sow the seeds of unconditional belief. I read that book and I think think the only thing he got right was the title, which is bang-on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mere Assumption","review":"Mere Assumptions is a more appropriate title. I have never seen such an array of circular reasoning and assuming in my life. Hardly one fact is referred too.My ex-pastor gave me this book to straighten my thinking out. What a confusing bunch of bologna. I was glad I read it, it confirmed my doubts."},{"rating":"1","title":"it insults your intellegence","review":"A friend lent me this book while I was reading Bible for my class at UC Berkeley. I told him that I did not understand Christianity so he thought this book may help me. However, this book really makes me feel that Christianity is not an intellegent religion. It insults my intellegence by presenting arguments as a matter of fact. Although the book itself is not philisophical, it tries to convince readers that conservative Christian belief is the only possible explanation of the world. To achieve this goal, it showcases other philosophies and beliefs in a simplified and biased way and mocks them as nonsense while his whole viewpoint just sound stupid. The only value I see from this book is that it shows you what conservative Christians are thinking. You can get a sense of where they are coming from. However, if you are interested in Christianity with some depth, you should check out books like St Augustine's Confessions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Though Lewis is often described as one of Christianity's best thinkers and writers, this book (actually three books combined) does not support any such description. While easy to read, this book contains nothing but overly simple reasoning, faulty logic, double-speak, and unsupported--and unsupportable--conclusions. This is a book to avoid unless you want a lesson in how to write an easy to read, but intellectually dishonest, book on religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not a Christian and...","review":"...I think C.S. Lewis is brilliant. His defence of theism in general and Christianity in particular is impassioned, thorough, and philosophically sound. It takes some concentration, and it may just change your life. If you're already a Christian, your faith will be strengthened, uplifted, and challenged. If you're looking to become one, this book is a great place to start understanding how to live it, and if you aren't one and have no intention of being one, you can still find tons of wisdom and great philosophy in this book. I was, and I am, challenged by Lewis' words and the knowledge and feeling behind them. I do not agree with him on several major points, and my greatest criticism is that he is far too narrow minded at times. Objections aside, however, his work is astounding and deserves wide readership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book about Christianity I have ever read","review":"Mere Christianity is the best explanation of the main points of Christianity that I have ever read. It cleared up some misconceptions I had about the three person God, becoming one with God, and what being a Christian was all about. I like its straight forward manner and accessible language, just deep enough to get to the meat of the idea, but not over the head of the average reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a thinker","review":"It is rare to find a Religious writer who also uses their head in a self responsible way and to this extent.An enlightening & eye opening text: not just another book for the sake of having one's book out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality publication - Harper One","review":"I just received the set.

The edge of the books are not cut properly.I'm returning it and never buy Harper One publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Appeal","review":"I read this when I was first becoming interested in Christianity. It isn't heavy-handed. It actually doesn't really go into much theological argument at all. It basically sets a stage of \\"why\\" one should believe. There was a great chapter on \\"Pride\\"- a non-believer would probably even enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Collection","review":"What a fantastic collection of books this is! This collection has some of Lewis' best theology as well as some fantastic fiction. My personal favorite is \\"The Screwtape Letters\\" which really makes you think as Lewis explores the way a demon may think. Lewis is one of the greatest minds of his time and arguably one of the best fantasy writers ever.

The intention of Jack was to write about Christianity taking out the typical religious sting. This is not a small fit given the exclusive nature of religion. And Jack achieves his task marvelously.When Jack writes is like an old loved friend explaining to us things that until this moment where elusive to our understanding.

An excellent resource for group study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn or Re-Learn Christianity","review":"\\"Mere Christianity\\" is a great book for those who want to know why people believe in the Christian faith. It is also a great book to remind believers (who may have strayed, or been burned out by big churches and confused denominations) why they believed, and why they should still believe. This book is simple to read, but it's message is not simplistic. It calls us to either believe totally, or to choose not to believe... either way, get off the fence and practice what you say you believe, because there is no middle ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"\\"Mere Christianity\\" is undeniable. Lewis' infallible arguments and persuasive words will teach anyone and everyone. C.S. Lewis takes you step by step, argument by argument, logic by logic into Spiritual truths that, although you may have known, you'll now see in a new light. Truly, this book has changed my walk and my thought.Lewis' logic is food for thought and replenishment for the mind. Inside this awesome book you'll find the logic behind our existance, the truth about \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\", the definition of morality, how Christianity compares to other major world religions and so much, much more. Truly, C.S. Lewis is pivotal in modern Christian thinking... this book is merely the proof.This book is a must have for any new-Christian, anyone wanting to be a better Christian or anyone looking for logic in Christianity.\\"I believe in Christianity in the same way I believe in the sun; not because I can see it, but because, by it, I can see everything.\\"-- C.S. Lewis"},{"rating":"2","title":"A profound look at the logic behind Christianity.","review":"C.S. Lewis explores the common beliefs of all Christian denominations by appealing to his readers logic. Beginning with observations about human nature, he builds a case for the existance of a higher power, that higher power being like the Christian view of God, and how Christianity fulfils the expectations of such a god. He searches into many of the questions that humanity has grappled with for all of time: the existance of God and an explanation of sin and evil, and also discusses the mystery of the Trinity and human redemption through Christ. Any one who reads this book will walk away at least realizing how much time and energy must be devoted to religious questioning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well known Christian writer","review":"I have always enjoyed the writings of C.S. Lewis and had not read this book. I was eager to see how as an atheist, he had converted to Christianity and his eagerness to spread the gospel as he now is a follower of Jesus. I purchased this on my Kindle very economically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful volume","review":"I was more than pleased with this book. I've been meaning to get more C.S.

Lewis is at his rhetorical and biblical finest. If you cannot admire his mastery of the form at the least, you ought get therapy for self-deception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took me by surprise, a real surprise","review":"I was pretty happy and satisfy with all my past purchases with Amazon.All the used books I bought were pretty decent and in good condition.Until, Bellwether Books shipped me the C.S. Lewis Classics: Mere Christianity, The Screwtape...I am astonished by the very poor quality of the books: the paper, tailoring and binding are so inferior which I never experienced. The pages are so insecurely bind that they might fall off in matter of time; the paper is so coarse like commercial paper towel that is used in the public restroom. The pages are so unevenly cut and are mostly larger than the book cover.All I can only hope that C.S. Lewis' ideas and his writing will give me the pleasure in reading.Frankly, I never have such bad experience with used book purchase until now with Bellwether Books.Surprisingly, the seller stated the book as good or very good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intellectual but never Haughty","review":"A literate, well thought-out argument for the existence of God and the validity of Christianity. Yet the author is never condescending toward his reader. Don't be fooled by the small size of this book. There are a lot of ideas here. Is there a flaw in Mr. Lewis' logic? I couldn't find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes you to the very heart of Christianity.","review":"Outside of the Bible, Mere Christianity presents the most irrefutable of arguments for Christianity. Appealing for those of an \\"intellectual\\" bent, Lewis lays down a very rigid, but delightful, chain of logical morsels, eventually tying them all together to present the bigger picture that is Christ's divinity, His death and His resurrection. This book is very helpful to those who, like myself, sometimes get caught up in peripheral issues, ignoring the very elementals that make up the faith of Christianity. Don't just read this book, take notes and study it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mere Christianity","review":"C. S. Lewis the foremost apologist of the 20th Century.

She is a college student and does a lot of reading! So I helped her collection of books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent compilation","review":"This book brings seven of the works of C. S. Lewis together under one hard-bound cover which measures 9\\" x 11\\" x 1 and 1/2\\" thick. The type is attractive and easily read although not \\"large print\\". One very appreciated feature is a topical index that includes page references to all seven included works. This book will be a keepsake for my family for many future generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eminently Logical Case for the Christian Faith","review":"Mere Christianity is one of the two best logical logical cases for the Christian faith I have read. Lewis first brilliantly lays a foundation, logically showing that the universe (external and internal) demands logically that some form of God exists. He then compares various theories of God with what we find in reality, and finds that only the Christian one honestly stands. At this point, he continues into details of the Christian faith. Any one honestly seeking to understand Christianity, and/or trying to decide if it is true, will find a powerful, rational case here for \\"yes.\\" The other book I mentioned is Charles Colson's How Now Shall We Live, whose conlusions are based on real-life studies and experiences, rather the more pure logical base of Lewis' writing. They are two halves of a whole perspective, the theory and the application, and I would especially suggest both to any Christian reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Very enlighting. Loved his frankness and his opinions actually were excellently expressed. I am very happy to own the book and I want to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Quality","review":"This is not a review of Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis was a genius.This is on the quality or better yet the lack of quality of the manufacture of this book; the paper is the cheapest grade imagineable,the binding is also very low grade, and to top it off the publisher didn't cut the pages evenly.I thought for the price they were charging the paper and binding would be of good quality, needless to say I was greatly mistaken.Buy a paperpack edition from another publisher, you'll get a much better made book and save money at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, I'm not impressed","review":"As an atheist, I thought that maybe reading \\"Mere Christianity\\" would give me some insight into why intelligent Christians can believe what they do. Unfortunately, it did not. The book's logic is often (usually!) shoddy and I learned more by visiting a church one day and speaking to the pastor for 15 minutes than from reading this entire book.I don't know, I didn't care for this book. It is well written in an easy to read fashion, but don't let that fool you: behind its pretty exterior lies a whole lot of gobbledy-gook and nonsense. If you want intelligent Christian thought, go talk to an educated member of the clergy because you won't find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Lewis fails to support any of this major claims and fails to take seriously any argument other than his own. I was very disappointed as many have spoken well of this book.His \\"argument\\" would only appeal to someone who is already a Christian; non-Christians who are looking for a good logical argument supporting Christianity will be disappointed.The book's version of a water-down version of Plato's theory of forms--spiced up with a touch of Aristotle--represents, at best, middle-brow religious theorizing."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in rationalization","review":"C.S. Lewis builds foundations of logic based on faulty black or white situations, and then expounds his theories upon the trembling base beneath. The further an objective human being gets, the less steady the footing becomes. It is inconceivable to me that such a book can occupy a revered position to otherwise objective people. Of course, objective individuals are not the target audience. If you are a Christian, then this book will most likely confirm that you are indeed the best, the smartest, and the only truly righteous in the only way such a thing can be confirmed: Through rationalization, circular logic, and outright self-delusion. The misogyny and blatant hatred imbued in this dogma-filled tripe is offensive. It is interesting to an objective person only as an examination of self-delusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Define your terms!","review":"Metaphors preferred over definitions, equivocations, unsupported premises, logical fallacies... And this is only in chapter one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a God?","review":"I'm atheist and read this based on a friend's recommendation. I had just finished 'Godless' by Dan Barker, a former evangelist turned atheist and I was told to read this from a former atheist turned Christian. It was presented as 'here's some facts that led this atheist to believe in God' when in fact it's just a feel-good book with no real relevant facts or revelation. Certainly it isn't on par with the arguments made by Barker in his book. I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this it?","review":"I had high expectations for this book, but it seems that C.S. Lewis is just saying the same things over and over again to justify his own transformation from an atheist into a Christian. Interesting historically, as a Christian response to WWII, but not very useful in a modern quest for Answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"rated 1 star because that's as low as I could go.","review":"This book is a collection of absolutely subjective platitudes that serves nothing more then to lead impressionable (to put it lightly)...dare I say...hungry seekers of an explanation and reconciliation of their own mortality and the ever after.And for the obvious \\"fan\\" base. It's just a little more brick 'n mortar to fortify their own (________)...insert your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"You cannot fathom C.S. Lewis; he has no depth.","review":"I'm not a Neitsche fan, but I paraphrase him above since it certainly applies here. C.S. Lewis gives a prosaic overview of why he chose to be a Christian. In lieu of honest inquiry he proffers flowery postulates with barely a hint of evidence. This is not a bad book if you're looking for a plausible excuse to be religious; but if you're not afraid to take a closer look at Christianity, read something like Dan Barker's \\"Losing Faith in Faith\\". Or, for a closer look at religion in general, read Campbell's four-book series entitled \\"The Masks of God\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please... is it something in the water?","review":"The title shoud be changed to \\"I'm now a Christian and here's why....\\" I won't even bother to discuss the silly analogies and ridiculous attempts at logic to be found in this \\"masterpeice\\" of his. This book is great to Christians merely because it is a written example of one who has \\"chosen the light\\" and had a PhD, hooray! Also, the mere idea that there's still a war between science and religion in 2001 should baffle everyone and those responsible should find better, more constructive things to do with their life. If you are seeking the Truth, look to those whom you trust and ask them. Or look inside yourself for the answers, most are already there. Good luck to everyone and may God have mercy on your souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of \\"Mere Christianity\\"","review":"Perhaps I'm confused, but by Book II: Part 3 'The Shocking Alternative', it seems to me that with the sentence \\"God created things which had free will\\", C.S. Lewis had decided that the concept of \\"god\\" is a given, and the Christian view that \\"this is a good world that has gone wrong, but still retains the memory of what it ought to have been\\" becomes the basis upon which the remained of the book is built.Maybe I misunderstood, but it is at this point he lost my interest.

He is concise and brilliant and an all around master of his craft. Please read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Apologist Extraordinaire!","review":"Perhaps the clearest and most logically argued defense of Christian faith ever written. An excellent introduction to Christianity for new converts to the faith or those who have questions about why Christians believe as they do. Lewis came to faith by a logical path. A novelist of some renown, he writes really, really good prose!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rationale For Righteousness","review":"If 'because the Bible says so!' is not enough of a motivation for you then Mere Christianity is the book for you.Mere Christianity proposes a reasonable and rational argument on behalf ofBiblical principles. Lewis' grasp of morality and human nature support the sovereignty of Godly ideals by showing how they apply outside of a purely Christian context into everyones everyday life and character.If you wish to understand the nature of goodness and the many 'whys' behind it Lewis pieces answers together with supreme simplicity, reason and logic. It will equip you to defend the Gospel, deepen your understanding of morality and familiarize you with Jesus teachings without the fire-breathing rhetoric of dogma.Get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a timeless text","review":"The novel contains some unkosher stereotypes that detract from the sincerity of Isadora Zelda's enlightenment. Isadora seeks to create an unmolded definition of herself -- a non-suicidal, female artist free of male obsession. However, she mocks her African-American brother-in-law for being white because he is a wealthy doctor who enjoys golf (as if he is not allowed to define himself outside of typical views). Isadora wants others to value her poetry but mocks all greasy (her words) Arabs for writing poems. She wants a lover who will understand her complexity. Nonetheless, she takes the close-minded attitude that all Germans loved Hitler. Stereotypes and racial bias litter the novel (even her second husband is an inscrutable -her words again- Chinese man). I could not enjoy Isadora's rise to empowerment because her accent seemed dependent upon the lowering and dismissing of other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"**Hooray**For the Symbolism...**Boo**For the Plot","review":"A very trippy novel filled with Freudian imagery! The explicit erotic fantasies and \\"bitchiness\\" of the main character, Isadora Wing, were entertaining. However, I found it to be very depressing in general. Although it is refreshing to see a female author write with such sexual inhibition....the plot seems to be lacking realism. Isadora actually made me nauseous at times with her bad selection of boy toys! I think a visit from the personal hygeine fairy would have been nice. She was definitely a woman who was playing with a few cards short of a full deck! In my opinion the first few chapters were the best...and the conclusion was disappointing and left me wanting more closure between Isadora & her husband!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yup, it's LIT","review":"I was searching for the words to review this book for you, so I was scanning through other reviews to see if anyone else had the same feel for it I did. Then I read this: \\"Every woman, every man should read this book it gives great insight on the insecurities of women. From sentence one I felt like Isadora Zelda White Wing spoke to me of my own doubts and emotional struggles. All of a sudden I was not alone...I was not lost, her journey was mine and mine hers.\\"And I realized that this was IT. THIS paragraph was exactly why I can NOT recommend this book. Wish I had read this before I bought it. Oh, boy does it ever \\"gives great insight\\"!! You will hear over and over again about how tormented Isadora's life is, how confused she is. So tormenting of me that I had to put this book down. Tried to pick it up again and again, just couldn't get through it.For those that enjoy this style - enjoy in good health with all your emotional struggles!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Doesn't?","review":"This is a very adult book. Glad I read it late in life, I might have missed its beauty. Should be required reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me turning the pages....","review":"It was interesting and empowering because it echoed what goes through women's minds. Maybe we wouldn't have made the same choices that this woman did but it was refreshing to read a book where a woman made exotic choices, lived through them and became strengthened in the end.This book is a worthwhile read for those who are interested in seeing a woman lose herself in order to find herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I picked this book as it was a big hit.

Of course, I'm not sure she was MEANT to be likable in the first place, but still, she turned me off. Plus, I had the constant thought running through my head throughout the book, \\"So just go get laid already, who really cares?\\" I suppose it was a big deal when it was originally written, but nowadays? Totally irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for Amazon.com censors......","review":"Fear of Flying (FOF) upset me, a male reader. Protagonist Isidora likes to sleep around, and since 'effing' was so critical to her, she should have become a hooker. My sympathies lie with the poor husband(s) who are apparently clueless and/or insane. Women's lib as depicted in this book is a phony exercise where women attempt 'equal' status with men 'plus' their usual treachery and guile. BTW, this is a redone review after PC amazon censors blocked the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what?","review":"Here we have a woman who didn't know if she loves or not her husband and want an affair, if you tell me that that is the way that all the women think I really don't agree with that, I don't really think that this book could save any marriage or even any relation, having an affair is against all the laws, but many people do that (I said many not all) and I think that if one is having an affair he or she will not tell the New York Times, this things are secretes always or almost always.This book has to many pages that doesn't say anything or what it says is out of range of any book, but why she has to returned to her husband? I thing that Isadora really needs help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Of My List","review":"A very witty, funny, insightful and honest book that had surely passed the test of time. With her brilliant writing, Erica Jong had candidly and courageously voiced the hope, the fear, the joy, the anxiety, the desire, and the frustration of being a woman. She did all this with a wonderful sense of humor.I've enjoyed this book very much and more than one time. It has a permanent place on my nightstand. Every time, I want something good to read, I just simply pull this book out, randomly open at any page and start reading. Works every time. Thank you Erica Jong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Protofeminist Psychobabble--Not Worth Your Time","review":"I tried giving it a shot but the book is (1) not sexy, as it is marketed, (2) about a lurid main character/narrator whom I can't follow, (3) filled with 1970s-style Freudian psycho-bull that attempts, amateurishly, to explain gender roles and relations, and (4) very solipsistic. It doesn't seem at all like fiction but the bickerings of a sexually frustrated woman who thinks too much about herself and who doesn't seem to be all that bright but manages to parade under some kind of feministic pseudo-intellectual banner. I just found the narrator despicable and didn't finish the book. I can't believe it has such a high review on Amazon, which means, I guess, that the majority of people reading it in 2011 are people who are already sympathetic to the book or author.Don't bother. If you want sex pick up Anais Nin or Zane or Philip Roth--anything else that has a story or good prose style, just not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish it --- just too filthy.","review":"This author's lack of mastery of the English language is apparent by the number of times she feels compelled to use the \\"F\\" word. For some reason, I had never read this popular book when it came out --- now I know why!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all the feminist work I'd imagined","review":"Seemed to be an experiment in stream of consciousness with a storyline. The constant thoughts of the character seem to interfere with the book. There is odd sexual situations and thoughts which I assume was very provocative at the time but now are just like amateur literotica. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please quit leaving out pages, Nabu Press","review":"Bancroft and Zumpt did a great job with the content. Nabu Press's print job is blurry, but the free Google ebook also has blurry printing. Maybe no clearly-printed exemplars exist. Nabu Press says on an end-paper: \\"This book may have occasional imperfections such as missing or blurred pages, poor pictures, errant marks, etc. that were either part of the original artifact, or were introduced by the scanning process.\\" Nabu did indeed leave pages 136 and 137 out of this book. I got this book on a sale for something like 7 or 8 dollars. I am not going to pay full price for Nabu Press books until they give up their right to omit pages. The paper and ink are fine. If Nabu has worked from a clearly-printed exemplar, the book would probably be an excellent print-on-demand. Until Nabu Press quits excusing itself for bad workmanship on its books, I will only be tempted to buy their books when they are at a 2/3 discount."},{"rating":"1","title":"The magnet in the lid killed my iPod's hard drive!","review":"I thought this was going to be a great tool to have so I could watch and work.

I am researching to open a Residential Care Service and I would say of the 106 short pages in this book I found maybe 10 of them useful or interesting.

Her brilliant, interlocking models are highlighted here in excellent black and white photos, with a color section of many completed works that is simply breathtaking. Although some of the models are geared more for the origami sophisticate (I'm thinking of certain 96-piece models at this point), even the 'folding neophyte will have much to learn from and enjoy in this classic work. This book is definitely the pride and joy of my origami literature collection, and is a must have for anyone who has any interest in the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beginner's guide to Modular Origami","review":"This is a great introduction to modular origami. There are a lot of examples of different ways to put the modules together, creating a different look with the same parts. But just as a warning, if you don't enjoy repetition and get bored easily, modular origami is probably not for you. Getting all the units folded is pretty boring, but putting the end product together is extremely gratifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definetly Fuse's best english book","review":"Tomoko Fuse is popular for her amazing origami figures that she creates with unique units (over 50 books in print). This book is no exeption. Possibly her best book ever, this book is a combination of all her most interesting items taken from her other books in Japanese and Korean. I own a few of the forgein language books and I find many things in the book that I enjoy folding, and many that I hate. This book has MOST of the cooler items from her most famous books. If you are a fan of unit origami or just like geometry, then buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very hard, yet fun and addicting","review":"This game has one of the steepest learning curves to ever meet the Playstation. It is unbelieveably realistic and can be a very fun game if you have the skills for it. The training mode is very helpful and must be used in order to play the game. RC Stunt Copter may cause frustration at first, but given time, can be a very fun and realistic simulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great surprise!","review":"This game really surprised me in a couple of ways.I kept hearing it was really hard and frustrating, but I just went through the training first, and it helped me get my skills up high enough to manage just fine. Then I slowly made my way up to harder and harder copters. Great sense of progression!Something I didn't expect at all was the humor. There is a voice giving surprisingly intelligent feedback to just about everything you do, and he's really funny. And there's a 'virtual' hand you can throw up to block the screen when you're playing against someone else in the 2-player mode.And the whole time you're learning to fly a real r/c helicopter! I've never flown one myself, but now that I can manage the Ace copter in this game, I can't wait to give it a try with a real one, and maybe even buy one myself if I can afford it.Very unique...a great breath of fresh air!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkably touch tale of a spirited youth","review":"Garden's Corner is a remarkably touching tale of a spirited youth, Little Speedy Copeland who embarks on a mission to make peace with a friend.

You should look forward instead of dwelling in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Urban Tale","review":"Garden's Corner catches the flavor of growing up in New York City, without trying to have flava. It is the tale of Little Speedy Copeland, a young Black man trying to understand life in the aftermath of a terrible incident.

I wanted to buy one for each family with kids because it was really helpful in teaching them to catch & throw because the throton is rubbery soft and they are not afraid of it. It is also the favorite throwing toy among all of the adults - men & women alike - and we can play with it for hours whether on land or in the lake.

Everyone can benefit from quiet reflection, from reading scripture, from singing hymns, and from praying. We all have the freedom to worship God in different ways. Kathleen Norris was curious about the catholic faith, although she remains a protestant. Her experience within the monastery is beneficial to her soul and she describes how, as a poet and writer, the rituals, liturgy, and hospitality within the monastic setting further her own understanding of spirituality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Walk Away","review":"Beneath its beautiful cover this book started well then rapidly became a modernist exercise in denunciation of matters, beliefs, situations that find Kathleen Norris' disfavor. She hides her complaints well at first with her pretense of praise for the ancient Benedictine traditions, but like M. Scott Peck's In Search of Stones, which this work reminds me of so much, it soon becomes clear the topics within have varying degrees of subject matter in common with what this misleadingly marketed book is about. I wanted a book about modern Benedictines and the experience of residing among them and instead got a bellicose, self-obsessed, self-congratulatory account of times selectively spent brushing up against a semi-monastic existence. A boring, frustrating, sometimes almost unfathomable letdown because in description The Cloister Walk sounded so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Blessings","review":"Norris' book was so highly praised that some disappointment was inevitable. There are some good insights, but they're mixed in with pompous, snobblish, quirky, cranky, and deliberately obtuse comments. Her language is frequently adolescent, with pointless vulgarity or slang. She is remarkably self-centered. Her model for this is Thomas Merton, but it's a pity she imitates all his worst habits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disappointment","review":"This was not at all what I expected. It was just nostalgic rhetoric, didn't have any real depth to it. I stopped reading it after maybe 30 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"I was pretty disappointed with this book. I tried to stay with it, thinking it might get better but ended up putting it down after about half way.The author focuses more on her personal, anecdotal stories then her actual time spent in the monastery living among the vowed. Absent was any insights or conversion gained by her experiences with the religious, which was more what I was looking for.Anyone wanting to understand more about the depths of faith gained from religious life should spend their time and money reading some of the saints instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange and Beautiful","review":"As a lapsed Catholic and a searching person for the meaning of organized religion in my life, I found this book rich with bursts of insight. The various personalities in religion; aspects of life within the Benedictine church; and a variety of small, beautiful critical thinking essays on the meanings of icons and values are some of the topics Norris explores in her chapters.Overall, they are thought-provoking and reveal a person who is more than a visitor to the ways of the Benedictine.I only gave four stars, since I found her writing style a bit distracting and the organization of the book not exactly conducive to easy reading. It's true that each chapter is a handful, but the editor might have done Norris a favor by facilitating the outline of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring (rjoc@aol.com)","review":"Kathleen Norris takes her readers on a splendid journey into the monastic life and hence into the self. Her deeply reflective prose quotes some of the desert fathers and mothers on prayer, monastic living, celibacy, psychology, etc. I especially appreciated her critique of virginity and virgin martyrs of the Church. Norris' experience of monastic living combined with the wisdom of that tradition makes her book a fine read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the . . . ?","review":"After reading this book, a very supernatural thing happened to me. . .I started praying non-stop! And this pray basically went, \\"Lord, forget all about that other crap I asked for, just help me get my money back from buying that aweful book, \\"The Cloister Walk\\". It was a rambling, uninsightful book which talked at great length about being a poet and surprisingly little about the process involved in choosing the cloistered walk, which was more of what I was expecting. I love writing and poetry, but it should not dominate the discussion in such a book. I almost cried as I forced myself to finish the book, with my Grandma's words \\"Waste not, want not\\" at the forefront of my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saddened","review":"Although Ms. Norris book describes much of the beauty of the Catholic faith, it ultimately is spoiled by conceit and self-promotion. I was dismayed that someone who does not embrace the Catholic faith would have no qualms receiving the Holy Eucharist. Kathleen Norris should stick with describing the Protestant Faith she espouses."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated, and a gem for Danny Kirwan fans","review":"I completely disagree with the previous review on this album , especially the part of Purple Dancer being the worst song Kirwan ever wrote. Purple Dancer is one of the most sought after songs of the early FM era,and even though it is not the original release,it's available only on this set. And maybe it's not perfect,but this release is solid and raw and it captures fleetwood Mac during the Kiln house tour which was short lived , due to Jeremy Spencer's dissapearance from the band to join the children of god. Also I would like to add that it is rare to find any fleetwood mac live recordings between the eras of the band that was after the Peter Green days, and Before the Buckingham , Nicks era. So in my opinion if you are a FM fan of all the eras, you will be glad this is available. Let's just hope it stays available , and maybe there will so some recordings released during the \\"Future Games\\" or \\"Bare Trees\\" era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound quality","review":"This import sounds like a poor bootleg tape.

But, something about the book ties it all together. It makes you think. At least for me it did. It helps me keep the importance of sleep on my mind. I did skip some sections that did not apply to me or that I did not think I needed helped with. I don't think it is a book for someone who has major sleep issues that require medical attention. But as a person who is busy, sucked in by internet or late night TV, or just being a night owl, this book helps me. Even after I finished it I have thought about important points in the book. Thinking of it has made me turn off the TV and get in bed when before I probably would not even have thought about it. I have not been getting 7-8 hours in as much as I should but since reading the book about a month ago, I have not had any nights of less than 6 hours of sleep. That's saying a lot for a 4 hour a night sleeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"pls note that the author is not a psychiatrist or neorologist, the book is a big promotion for his own consulting business, you read about how good he is rather than how you could have a good night, 'no more sleepless night', though a bit dated, is better by far"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Practical Advice","review":"I thought I'd heard every statistic and help tip that existed re: sleep problems and sleep hygiene -- keep your room cold and dark, wear earplugs, etc. But refreshingly, this book had a few tips I hadn't seen or heard elsewhere -- including descriptions of several yoga-like relaxation and meditation exercises to help you unwind.I'm particularly fond of the concept of a \\"power down hour\\" where you spend a full, committed hour to unwinding before bed. Though it sounds unrealistic in the modern world, that anyone would take a full hour to do this, the cool thing is that 1/2 of this wind-down hour is meant to be devoted to doing what the author calls \\"mindless chores\\" like folding laundry. Makes a lot of sense to me, to save these chores for late night, when doing them may actually help put you to sleep!There are a lot of tips like this in the book. Highly recommended overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stay FOr The Credits!","review":"As ben stiller says staying for the credits is always a good thing.

I like films like this, but it really had a slow beginning. But after the first fifteen minutes, it really picks up and is very entertaining. The jokes are funny and what I like most about the film is all the people in it and who make the cameos. William Shatner, Chuck Norris, and even Alan Tudyk who played Wash on Firefly, one of my favorite TV series, is in this film. Overall, I ended up liking this better than I thought I would have judging from the beginning of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie that tries too hard to be funny, and falls flat.","review":"Dodgball has the formula to be a classic. What can be funnier than seeing a bunch of people get pelted with red rubber balls? But somewhere during execution, the film lost whatever magic it may have had. Ben Stiller's character is like a lame version of Zoolander, that tries to be funny, but fails horribly. Vince Vaughn is also not funny and not a likeable character along with his crew of strange outcasts of life. When they got Ben and Vince against each other, I could care less who won.Simple movie goers may like this film, but people looking for a comedy that's more than just stupid one liners (that aren't even good.) Dodgeball does not deliver. When I went to see this movie I expected nothing from it, and I got less. I'm only giving this 2 stars because of a few cheap laughs it had that actualy were successful, other than that, it was a complete failure. One of the worst movies of 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, where's my dignity?!","review":"OKay, Ben, not even guys getting hit in the face with [dodge]balls is gonna save you this time.

The concept of a movie based on the game of dodgeball is brilliant, it just wasn't executed right. This could have been a marriage made in heaven with Ben Stiller and a 'Rocky'-type ending. But there's no emotion here and the jokes are stale 90's retro. How many times do you have to throw in a 'lesbian' joke or mock Asian people? I would be ashamed to even be associated with a movie that puts down people who are in the minority.Yes, the film did great at the boxoffice, but so what? The crowd went to see Ben Stiller and the concept of dodgeball. I think this film brought the American comedy to yet another low. Will someone please bring back the great American comedy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - TERRIBLE","review":"I'm not sure how many crappy movies Stiller can put out in a given year, but as far as crappy (no pun intended for Envy movie), this tops the heap.Just Bloody Awful!!!!!!!

It's not so stupid that it's funny, it's so stupid that you want to vomit.I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it came out. Luckily, I never had the chance, because Ben Stiller's (...).

The film looks like it was filmed in someone's garage. The lack of any real plot, the lame hokey formulaic sentimentality and the atrocious and overdone (so-called) acting of Ben Stiller (quickly sinking his career into oblivion) leaves one in a stupor or was it nausea? I enjoy a no-brainer as much as anyone but this one requires a lobotomy to derive a feeble laugh.

I can't stop watching it. When it came out in theatres, I thought \\"A movie about Dodgeball? How stupid is that?\\" I was very wrong.If you like Ben Stiller (which I do) I don't have to say anything. He is extremely funny and plays his role perfectly.To me; however, Vince Vaughn steals the show. I don't know exactly what it is, but I could swear that he ad-libs half of his lines. The character is almost \\"too real\\".The supporting cast (especially the lovely Christine Taylor) is absolutely perfect. I am not going to babble on about how great the movie is because a long review is boring. I will simply say that when I watch this movie, I feel like I am \\"in it.\\" By the way...the cameo appearances are priceless. Ben Stiller seems to be able to talk anyone into doing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the funniest movie of 2004","review":"Vince Vaughn (Old School) and Ben Stiller (There's Something About Mary) have fun here in Dodgeball. I always loved playing it as a kid in gym class and have wished it was a real sport because it's the funnest. However this movie has fun making fun of it and shows how easy it is to make fun of it. Besides Stiller and Vaughn having fun in there roles. Rip Torn is great as the manager of Vaugn's team. He has a few screws loose and tells the players if they can dodge a wrench or...on-going traffic they can dodge a dodgeball..lol. Jason Bateman (Arrested Development) also has fun as a dorky commentator. Chuck Norris and David Hasslehoff \\"or however u spell it\\" also show up in funny cameos.

I like the concept behind Dodgeball -- the lowbrow comedy that actual works a couple of times during this otherwise woefully mediocre film. The writing is the worst part. The actors make much of a lot of really unfunny lines -- the dialogue is so off-the-mark that it rarely brings even a smile to the lips. Add to this a male lead who is about as bland and uninteresting as you can imagine -- playing a sort of everyman that you can't even begin to root for -- and Dodgeball becomes a rather bland mess that doesn't live up to the potential of some of its funnier stars (Stephen Root and Ben Stiller at the top of the list).These writers must be related to major Hollywood hitters.

I have been a big fan of his ever since \\"Swingers\\". I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I was pleasantly surprised. Christine Taylor does a good job, and the supporting cast was surprisingly good. Ben Stiller gets old after awhile with his way, way over-the-top performance (which is a reprise of a very similar part he played in the movie \\"Heavyweights\\"). This isn't Vaughn's best performance, but it was still enjoyable. There isn't a great deal of plot, and what plot there is is pretty predictable, but hey, this isn't that kind of movie. It's not great stuff, but it's good enough to warrant a recommendation from me. Plus, there are a lot of extras plus a commentary track by Vaughn, Stiller, and the director, so this DVD has that going for it. Overall, a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Combination of Casting and Writing","review":"To be honest, I resisted watching DODGEBALL because I didn't care much for recent comedies. I also avoided anything with Ben Stiller after several of his unfunny stinkbombs. He really needs to be more picky with his scripts because he is a genuinely funny guy (check out \\"The Ben Stiller Show\\" to see that).But Stiller is very funny in DODGEBALL, along with everyone else. I wish there had been more Stephen Root and Rip Torn. I also loved Hank Azaria's spoof of old educational films on the history of Dodgeball.

This comedy is a good-hearted fable about the average guy respecting himself and maintaining his integrity in the face of a culture rendered grotesque by its extreme vanity and naricissism, the embodiment of which is seen in the Ben Stiller character.

I would have given it 3 stars for being a pleasant way to survive a 10-hour, cramped and crowded flight.But Stiller was so boring, so pointless, so NON-funny, that I knocked the movie down to 1 star.I sense all his movies are like that: overblown, stupid, not funny.Which is too bad, because the supporting cast did OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedies suck, some might be funny, but...","review":"one thing that is gauronteed with any comedy is that they are poorly made, poorly scripted, poorly acted, stupid wastes of money. This movie is funny, so i guess you can say it does what is supposed to (make you laugh), but there is more to entertainment then stupid sex jokes, and the pain of others (funny but can carry a movie only so far), how about changing things up and making a comedy with a good script, good performances, different forms of humor(not just people getting hit in the face with a ball, it was funny but only after the first few times). 3 out of a 10, it made me laugh, but could have done more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dodge These","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Literally, I could not get through it. It's juevenile, stupid, obvious humor, that treats the audience like idiots. It's sad to see Ben Stiller become an overacting film destroyer, but you can't blame this one on him. Even Vince Vaughn seemed awkward in this terrible movie, like he knew each line he delivered was worse than the previous one. Awful and horrible. I knew someone who was on a plane that showed this movie and she cimbed into the overhead compartment for the rest of the ride.If you liked this movie, I have some great footage of a dog chasing its tail for three hours that I'm sure you would enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"I review this movie not despite the fact that I fell asleep while watching it, but because of that fact.I watched the movie with my a group of my friends. We were at my best friend's place. When somebody suggested that we watched this film I wasn't crazy about the idea, but I was overruled.It was okay. I laughed once, one of about twenty-three times I've laughed during a movie. But for the most part it was dull and unfunny. The acting was trash and the characters were easy to detest, especially the stupid bad guy.I drifted off about the time the guy got hit by the car. And I've got no regrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"I gave it one star because two hot girls kissed at the end. Just kidding. This is a movie made for young teenage boys like me who want to see that sort of thing and also have a low intelligence level so that they will laugh when somebody gets hit in the head with a wrench. Forget the fact that they've seen it 20 times in previews on TV. Wow, maybe I took the movie too seriously. I guess it's all just a matter of opinion. Speaking of which, see Napoleon Dynamite! My friend loved Dodgeball and hated Napoleon, and I was the other way around. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Balls","review":"There is nothing I like more than a movie about balls. I like it when the whole plot is based around big hairy balls. Would you believe that in this movie they are throwing their balls at each other while Ben Stiller tries to act like he knows how to act. Oh sure, Stiller is the villan in the movie. But he is about as convincing as a stick of butter is tough in the microwave. The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because I like balls."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TV Event","review":"Ramona has received international attention. The Mexican TV has taken the book to the TV screen. Currently, the production is being presented in a local Hispanic TV channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Majella!","review":"I must admit I read this novel only to get the background on my girlfriend Majel's name. I initially held no respect for its \\"Great American Love Story\\" subtitle, but this book really hit me right in the chest. I liked that I was able to extract the characters' personalities from their words and tones rather than from paragraphs of third-person description. I liked that it piqued my interest in nineteenth century Californian history, especially the upsetting struggle of the Mexicans and Native Americans living there. And lastly, I liked experiencing the boundless love that flowed from the simple, strong and beautiful Ramona. A quick, colorful, emotionally satisfying novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my typical book, but enjoyed it","review":"I heard about the book while hiking at Seven Falls near Colorado Springs. HHJ was suppose to have gone to the overlook there to write, including parts of Ramona. This intrigued me and so I checked it out. I don't read much non-fiction, so I enjoyed the idea of a history based novel. It was enough of a love story for me to earn points with female friends, but enough of an adventure to keep me interested. One part of the book that I found distracting was the attempt at phonetic spelling of the Tennessee drawl of a few characters. I had the hardest time reading that, which perhaps is an excellent way of HHJ to capture the difficulty of listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ramona Large Print","review":"This book is so much easier to read due to the large print. I purchased it for my 95 year-old mother and she expressed her joy at being able to read the print without getting headaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story You Will Never Forget","review":"I loved Ramona. It was the most beautiful story I have ever read. A wonderful look at California right after it came under the control of Americans. A story that has history, romance, prejudice, love, loss, and everything in between . Please read this book. I only regret that I never read it until I was in my thirties. This is Helen Hunt Jacksons masterpiece and the attention that it gave to the treatment of Indians is remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another TENCHI Hit!","review":"If there's one part of the Tenchi Music that stands out the most, it's the original scores.

Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"2003 prius sun shade","review":"Product works very well and fits very better than any sun shade product, however the shade is very stiff and hard to move, fold or unfold. difficult to roll up. i wish they would have explained how un flexible the shade was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! A Sun Shade That Fits My Window.","review":"After searching the auto parts section in every store I could find I finally did what I should have done in the first place and shopped the web. Finding a sun shade for the Prius, a car with a front windshield as big as city bus, is not easy, but this one 'fits the bill'. It is the first sun shade I've ever had that fits the window EXACTLY. Not only that, but it's sturdy and has a dependable Velcro closure device. If I had to say anything bad, it would be that it's big (it has to be to cover the window) so it can be a pain to store when not in use. That's not a criticism of the shade, just a side effect of the Prius' big window. From now on, I'll buy all my sunshades from this company...worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"toyota prius sunshield","review":"You will NOT find a sunshade that fits the Prius unless you get one specifically designed for it (speaking from the experience of visiting four auto parts stores). IF you take the time to make this one really fit the window(plan on about three or four minutes getting it into place, positioning the visors, etc) to get it in place and then another two to three removing it, readjusting the rear view mirror, it works. The temperature inside the car is considerably lower (have not measured)--but with this sunshield in place, I can get into the car immediately on really hot days. Without it, I have to open all the windows to let the hot air out first so I think it probably delivers what it promises. If however, you can easily park in the shade or are just going to the grocery store and back, it is NOT worth the effort and it does have to fit precisely as they describe for it to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"no Good","review":"I thought that this shade was too expensive, and was just like the cheap version that is also no good. I would also look into an accordion type shadetree retractable windshield shade. the shade is the name of the type that I had for my dodge avenger and it was great. I will go back to shadetree for my prius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Does not fit the window in our 2008 Prius at all. In fact the left side of the shade is considerable taller than the right. Not sure who was in charge of quality control the day they made ours, but they must have been drunk.It does seem to be made of quality materials, but what does that matter when it can't be used due to the incorrect size?The shade is also far too bulky when rolled up. Not a problem if you don't ever plan on having people ride in your back seat or if you don't mind storing it in the hatch and getting it out of there whenever you park or don't mind taking it down and storing it back there when you leave.All in all this thing gets an F from me. I honestly can't get over how poorly it fits."},{"rating":"1","title":"not cool","review":"The new version of this shade fits poorly. The \\"ears\\" that cover the little side windows make it very difficult to install, remove and roll up. Not a good design. Look at an accordian type for the best fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's cumbersome","review":"So for the price, I expected something less cumbersome. Do not purchase this if you cannot spare the room in your car for this thing to be a passenger in- it's huge, does not roll up easily, it's stiff and all-around does not invite me to use it...which is not the point of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad to have found this","review":"As you'll know if you're already driving a Prius, it has a very large windshield. This is great for visibility, but the \\"old and shiny\\" sunshade that I had in my previous car didn't work well, because it was too small. Got this one and it works great. Does a nice job cooling things down a lot, which is really nice on the hot and humid days we've been having lately.Since getting this, I've talked to a lot of other Prius owners that have have luck with \\"truck\\" shades, which are larger and will cover the oversized windshield. That is also another option, if you're looking to save money. This one is custom made though, so it fits perfectly and looks great. I would recommend it if that is important to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"So interesting it's worth a novel.","review":"When I saw the book Clipperton in the display window of a New York book store I had already been planning to write a novel about this strange island.

So I took it outside, and shot off a few rounds. This thing packs a punch, it easily shoots 270+ fps. Its extremely accurate and a great gun overall. My only qualms is that the safetly broke after a week of heavy use (my friends and I were having 3-4 matches a day) and when I tried to remove the silencer after I put it on I accidentally pulled the orange Plug in the front off. Its easy to fix, and after i glued it it looked just like new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow down there....","review":"I don't know who generated the previous reviews but, if and when it shoots, you got a 50/50 chance of hitting your target.

Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money! You can find much better!","review":"I was very disappointed in the quality and supposed insight in this book! All it is a collection of some poems from Mt. Berkowitz. Although the poems are good, there is no good reason to pay [amt] for them. It seems there is a definite attempt to discredit all that Mr. Berkowitz is doing now to make up for all the pain he has caused. It has been almost 25 years since this crime took place and if I am going to spend my money on a book about Mr. Berkowitz I would expect it to be more worthwhile. It seems the writer has a vendetta or something against Mr. Berkowitz. I found much better info on Mr. Berkowitz on his own personal website.... They have there his daily journal which is much more interesting to read than this book! I would give it ZERO STARS if possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could get a refund!","review":"This book has to be the worst book I have ever purchased! I was so disappointed in it!

Note: recently Farberware reduced its quality, in that older Farberware pots & pans had their thick aluminum base completely encased within a stainless steel shell. The newer pots & pans have the aluminum base attached to the bottom, but not encased within a stainless steel bottom. So, their quality is less than it was; most people who \\"grew up with Farberware\\" may not realize this. Farberware used to hold the patent on the technique of having the aluminum base CURVE up the side of the pan -- they no longer do this, and are the same as many other manufacturers. Also note: if you are buying a 12\\" pan, this is a HUGE pan, since it has a squareish cross-section. I found it to be so absolutely huge -- you could fry a dozen onions in this monster -- that I simply never use it. The 10\\" and 8\\" sizes may be what you're looking for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pan on the planet...","review":"How many products do you know when you buy it that it will last 30 or 40 years? This is one of them. My mom has had hers for 35 years, I've had mine for 5. It's simply the best pan out there. It cooks evenly, it goes in the dishwasher, the handles stay cool, and you don't have to use plastic spatulas. The only problem that somebody might have is that it is not nonstick. For that reason my wife usually uses a Calphalon nonstick professional pan, even though it can't be cleaned in the dishwasher and you have to treat it carefully. So if you must have nonstick, buy something else.

Will she follow her heart or her head? Will she rediscover love? This is a great film. Kathleen Turner is great in it as the too- mature- for- her- age- because- she- has- already- lived- it-teenager and Nicholas Cage is great at playing the brainless, funny and just about confused teenager and adult.

This album makes her releases on my watch list. She just makes enjoyable music. A little folk, a little jazz, a really nice voice, a way of phrasing that is very enjoyable. (Listen to some very early Diana Krall, and she doesn't phrase songs well at all, however later she learned to do it better then most.) I hear that her live performances are excellent. This album, while not her own songs except for one, I believe, is very accessible to a wide range of listeners.

Everyone knew she could sing beautifully, but this film proved that she was an actress, and a great one! Streisand proves that she is a true star, she is hilarious in the film's uproarious opening and she's absolutely heart-breaking in the dramitic end. She picked up a well-deserved Oscar for her work here.The rest of the cast is also good (Omar Sharif is especially suave in the role of Nicky Arnstein), the production values are high, the music is great, the direction is lively, and the story is touching.But above all else, it is Streisand's versatile and extremely likeable performance that holds the whole film together. Watch to laugh, watch to cry, watch to be entertained. A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old favorite","review":"This was my introduction to Barbra in the 1960s and it holds its' own today. Just a great film, wonderful music and terrific costumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ugly Duckling And The Con Man","review":"I recently rewatched FUNNY GIRL for the first time in perhaps twenty years. And though I still think it is a fine film I was not as charmed by it as I was in my earlier days. Maybe I've read too much about the real Fanny Brice and Nick Arnstein and found out how very sanitized Arnstein's life story was for the Broadway musical and this film that is quite closely adapted from it. For whatever reason I did not find Omar Sharif's portrayal of the handsome gambler Nick as breathtaking in this viewing and I actually found his accent annoying. At any rate the film is still a must see for musical lovers and those like me with an interest in entertainment history though the viewer should be very aware of the great deal of license taken in retelling this bittersweet love story. And Streisand of course was young and at her full powers in her star making role as Fanny that still seems positively tailor made for her voice, looks and screen presence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songs!","review":"Funny Girl is an old fashioned musical telling an old fashioned story. The real life star was Fanny Brice, played by Barbra Streisand. The songs are fantastic ( especially My Man and Don?t Rain on my Parade) and the costumes are full of life and color. Omar Shariff is dashing as Nick Arnstein, the gambler husband. Walter Pidgeon is good as Folrenz Ziegfeld. Anne Francis has a small part as Fanny?s showgirl friend. Personally, I would have wanted her role to be a little larger."},{"rating":"2","title":"BARBRA\`S BEST MUSICAL","review":"They weren\`t sure they wanted her for the movie(\\"She\`s so odd looking... even ugly at times\\") and the story tells that Barb had to submit herself to an extensive test on film in front of the Columbia executives...It really is a vehicle for Barbra! She dominates the film completely and no other in the cast challanges her a bit. Even so, it is a good-looking film directed by Master William Wyler(but musical scenes directed by Herbert Ross) and though Barbra\`s Fanny Brice is abnormally ambitous; she still manages us to feel for her, like her, admire her and above all... care for her...It really is a must for drama-musical-lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing Barbra Sing....","review":"By the time Barbra made Funny Girl (her movie debut) , she was already a Broadway singing diva. Thankfully, she is forever immortalized on cellioud as Fanny Brice, the funny girl in Funny Girl. With Funny Girl she got to belt out (as only Barbra can belt) multiple show stopping numbers including \\"People\\", \\"Don't Rain on My Parade\\" and the exhilerating \\"My Man\\". She sang, she acted and she charmed 1968 movie goers who lined up to make Funny Girl a box office smash. Then she won a well-deserved Oscar for Best Actress in 1968. WAY to go girl! You deserved all the praise you got for Funny Girl. What a performance!

I have seen it 8 times and never miss it when it is on TV. Omar is so gorgeous to look at and makes a perfect Nick. Barbra shows off her voice in many dimensions and proves what a great singer she is. Most of us did not grow up with Fanny Brice except on the radio so her life was a mystery.

Who wouldn\\"t LOVE to hear Lemmy belt out \\"Cinnamon Girl\\", \\"Summertime Blues\\" or \\"Somthin' Else\\"?.... Well guess what, you won't here.

I couldn't pass up 100 Christian songs for my little baby! However, upon listening to the CD's, I have realized that I would have been better off getting a CD with fewer songs. In order to scrounge up 100 Christian songs, they have included traditional hymns that have been ruined by setting them to a rap-style beat. My toddler has no taste in rap music yet, and neither do I. It wouldn't have been so bad if they had lumped all the rap songs together on one CD which I could then ignore, but each CD includes some of these offending songs. It really ruined the whole set for me and six months later I realize I haven't listened to those CD's since the first month I purchased them. Therefore, I am offering this product review to warn off other parents who may not like rap music mixed in with Christian songs for their children."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS EDITITION, OVERPRICED/POOR QUALITY","review":"Hello all.First off, this work is an important work of Dewey, someone I deeply respect; HOWEVER....Whatever you do, do not buy this hardcover edition of Democracy and Education.

I wouldn't recommend it unless a person was really into Victorian literature. The story is depressing and morbid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jude the Obscure","review":"Jude the Obscure is an interesting book, but it is, like most classics, depressing. That is one of the things that makes Jude the Obscure so rich. If it had been a happy love romance it wouldn't be considered a classic. It instead challenges the readers to question the them which is on marriage. Hardy attacks marriage from every angle making the reader feel that there is no hope.Jude the Obscure has a rich plot that pulls you into the story. You feel for the characters in the book. You want Jude to be able to obtain his goals. You feel frustrated when he once again gets sidetracked from his goal because of his one weakness-women. If you like the classics, especially tragedies, than you will appreciate Jude the Obscure. It is good literature, has great symbolism, and the ending scenes will leave a poignant impression that won't be easily forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Masterpiece!","review":"Thomas Hardy has accomplished a miracle with this novel. He has written a novel equal in the strength of the ideas, the beauty of the writing, and the compelling nature of the story. If he had only done one of the three well, the book would be worth reading, but having done all three so beautifully has resulted in a masterpiece.I first read Jude about 10 years ago and recently re-read it. I was even more delighted after reading it again, and plan to read it a third time.Some of my literary compatriots have been put-off by what they characterize as stiff language in Hardy in general and Jude in particular, but I would encourage anyone to persevere...after a few chapters, it wears-off and then you will thoroughly enjoy the reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling and excellent novel of human nature","review":"The issues of marriage, children, passions and revelations of the ordinary dominate this detailed and gripping novel.Hardy's tragic novel leads the reader along the lives of the main character, Jude, and his lover, Sue so well that it's a small wonder that this book hadn't been made into a feature film before this year. This is a book of longing for dreams, but finding only stark reality again and again. Though this point may not be a happy one, Hardy's concern for his characters and their settings make this book impossible for the reader to set down for any length of time. A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absoulutely Horrible","review":"Being an English AP student, I was given this book to read over the summer. I was hoping for a book with at least something enlightening or interesting in it, but I found this book to be nothing more than useless. Nothing can save this book from being what it is: overdramatic and overpraised. Jude is a pathetic loser, Sue has no control over her emotions, and they are both idiots. I was glad when the children hung themselves, as it was the single most entertaining part of the book. Who the hell names a kid \\"Father Time\\" anyway???? A tale of incest and stupidity..... forget it. read this book if you want to punish yourself.

That said, \\"Jude the Obscure\\" is an extremely challenging novel. But, the tragedy of Jude can be appreciated by anyone that possesses the capacity to think rather than the ability to regurgitate sentiments that can be read in any commentary on the novel. I want to encourage every student out there who wishes to read \\"Jude the Obscure\\" for what it really is - an enlightening and engrossing story. These are the people who will understand the meaning of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jude: The Emotional Rollercoaster","review":"I never thought something could upset me this much. Jude the Obscure, in my opinion, was Hardy's greatest reguardless of what anyone says. You never know what to expect in this story. One minute everything's perfect, the next tragedy. Read the book. See the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardy's Last Novel","review":"Ah, the novel that made Thomas Hardy stop writing. When this novel was first published, it was so controversial it is said that the Bishop of Wakefield publicly burned it. I can definitely see why. This novel questions not only marriage and the laws of the time, but also religion, the class system, and society in general. Add suicide to that and you have yourself quite a book for 1895. Although shocking at times and still relevant today, it doesn't quite have the impact now that it did then. It would be too hard to give a brief summary without giving away some major plot points, so I won't even try. I will say that I'm not always fond of the classics that I've read, but I think this one is a really good book. The old writing style gets a little annoying at times, but the storyline makes up for it. This is a not a book for the faint of heart. It's sad, depressing, and tragic. If you're looking for something light and happy, don't choose this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"unrequited love","review":"This is a harrowing story about one man's utter helplessness against the winds of destiny. Jude is an orphan boy with a vision and a passion for life that is cruelly challenged and ultimately thwarted by forces beyond his control. His is a tale of fortune and fate, of desire and despair.But what struck me most was what I took to be the novel's sub-theme: unrequited love. I wonder if this is what Hardy sought to convey through his subtheme: that love, though it seeks to transcend the loneliness of life, is itself always a lonely endeavor--never fully mutual because it is inherently unequal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!","review":"Simply awesome.

The central character is almost too sensitive for this world, but he struggles on, as we all do.

I saw in his work the same recylcing of elements in other works (particularly \\"Tess\\" and \\"Return of the Native\\"). If Hardy wanted to come out and condemn religion, he should have done so, instead of his little forays and hasty retreats.

I hate to hear anything bad about his music but I find this album a bit of a let down, especially after waiting such a long time for it's release. The tracks are too keyboard orientated and this spoils it for me. The single 'True love' is exceptional as is the wonderful 'Stone Cold'(with it's great vocal arrangements). The album showcases Palmer's splendid vocal, however the songs just don't cut it. Take my advice, buy 'Honey' or 'Heavy Nova' instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not true R&B, but not Pop either","review":"First off, this is not true R&B by any stretch by the imagination but rather true 'blue eye soul' which isn't bad. I too stumbled upon this CD at a store and decided to take a chance and bought it. I was very surprised at how good this CD is. Robert really searched deep inside and pulled out some of his best vocal work in years. While other reviewers felt this album was soulless I say it was the quite the opposite. On such songs as 'Stone Cold', Wise guy, I Choose You, and the title track screams of sensuality that is especially true of Marvin Gaye's 'Let's get it on'. It's a shame that this CD didn't get the radio play it deserved. But his tour '99 to support it was the coolest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Palmer blew it BIG STYLE!","review":"Throughout the 80's Robert Palmer released some great albums and thus built himself a reputation for high levels of musicianship and an air of suave sophistication. But if you ask me on this album Palmer blew it big style. The problem is he has taken on too much himself playing most of the instruments himself and masterminding the production. As David Lloyd so rightly says in his review the album has too much keyboard on it and ends up sounding to clean and clynical even on the more soulful tracks. The whole album left me 'Stone Cold.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is a disaster...","review":"Am I being to harsh? Maybe. But I have come to know Robert for his sly wit and the way he says what you think he's saying but he said something else. This cd has none of the qualities I like in Robert Palmer. I love Don't Explain, Honey, and his 1st album was great. I'm well versed in Palmer, and this cd has few great verses. It does contain 2 must haves: the opening and closing tracks.Nab these 2 tracks then ship this off to die.

This book would be a good gift for a person who is just becoming interested in Shelley (who, by the way, is NOT by any means an obscure author) but is not comprehensive enough for even an undergraduate student.

Although abundant and conspicuous in its scholarship, this work is energetic, clear, and easy in style, and White is sensitive and optimistic in his handling of what could easily have been a \\"bashing\\" session.

It is one of those rare, mind-expanding experiences that true free thinkers relish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wretched Production","review":"This reprint is so ugly in its typography and layout that I sent it back and bought a used copy of the 1970 edition.

However, after only a couple of weeks of mild use, it started misfiring some times: the child would press together 2 halves of a doggy, and a kitty cat would sound off instead... The doggy would too, eventually, but very confusing for a child who's learning.A couple of other minor things include the fact that the pictures are simply glued to the cubes, and on one of them the corner already started coming off and the fact that the toy does not come with batteries (perhaps my fault for not checking, but I thought I'd mention it specifically for the others)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly drawn animals and cumbersome design","review":"With some effort, these blocks do the job of producing animal sounds, but they look awkward, and there is little fun in playing with them.The animals are drawn poorly, in a sketchy style, and with strange proportions: for instance, the elephant looks as if it was fathered by a badger-dog. Even more annoying are large metal bolts protruding from all sides of the blocks. They are not shown on the picture, but they make the surface look uneven and ugly. These bolts need to be aligned precisely and touch the ones on the other block for it to make sounds. The kid is not rewarded with sounds for putting the blocks in the right position unless these bolts touch, which is not good for learning and makes it less fun.I am keeping these blocks because sending them back is not worth shipping charges, but otherwise I wouldn't buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"Whatever happened to them?

Of course, this can be easily remedied with the use of aluminum foil at the base of the steamer. Perfect for steaming veggies. Farberware continues to be an excellent manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for","review":"We steam a lot of vegetables and the metal blanching trays that fit inside other pans are extremely difficult to clean. We were exploring other steamer options such as the bamboo trays, the non-metal blanching trays, electric steamers (already have a rice cooker which does this function but we don't like it for steaming.) This steamer unit solves that problem and provided a small steep pot that we use for cooking noodles. It makes a perfect size for our downsized household of two. The much larger pots are now stored away in the cupboard and this little unit is in use almost daily. It gets more and more difficult to find reasonably priced cookware without the nonstick coatings. The large handles make this easy to grasp. Good product. Have always liked Farberware."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good choice, but be attention of its size","review":"The quality of the pot is really satisfactory. But it is smaller than I thought.

I just bought one to prepare a second variety of veggies for the same meal and I like it. The overall quality seems better than my original; however, the only drawback is that the bottom half requires using both hands to carry and empty it as opposed to the original long handle version. It's obviously made to give a lifetime of use and given the price, it's an outstanding value."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"It's described as \\"stainless steel\\", but brand new, the bottom had marks that looked like hard water stains. I managed to get them out with vinegar and water, but it has been picking up stains ever since, including fingerprints on the outside, which soap and water won't remove, more hard water stains, and heavy marks at the water line. The pot has always been hand washed and dried.Worse, the plastic handles melt and bubble, giving off that nauseating burning plastic smell. As a steamer, one would think it would be designed to withstand high heat. One handle came loose after a few uses. It is easily screwed back on, but I think it's just more evidence of shoddy workmanship.Overall this is a very cheap pot in feel and construction. Pot is made in China. Perhaps there are quality control issues, and I just got a bad one, though I am guessing the handles are the same on all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small flaw in an otherwise nice product","review":"My friend, who is a chef, helped me pick out this product. Since I have an electric stove, the extra weight and thickness of the pot was reocmmended over a cheaper alternative. The extra weight/thickness helps prevent food from sticking (does not stick or burn from uneven/too much heat) and it washes easily.The only drawback to the pot is the handles. Other pots and pans have heavier plastic than this particular model, and the heat does transfer slightly more into the handles because of it. It won't lead to a burn like a metla handle, but this is the only weak point of its custruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect steamer","review":"Love, love, love this little steamer! had one before that I left on stove and got busy so fried it so this is a replacement for one I had and loved for years.

Who wouldn't buy it? I only gave it 4 stars because my gold tip on the cable was slightly bent and it caused it to crackle a bit when I first plugged it in.

I spent almost $4 on the same thing I'd have had to pay $50 for if GameStop was the only option. But thanks to this I paid what a TV cable is really worth.One occasional problem that happens approximately once a week is that the screen and the sound go away for about 2 seconds but very very rarely.

Don't buy this horrible version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome animation","review":"I really enojoy this movie. I watched it all the time when I was younger, and it always made me cry, and still does. Even though I watched it as a kid, it doesn't geared towards children to me for some reason. Mainly b/c it's somewhat dark and I didn't really understand it as a child, but I still liked it. I definitely appreciate it more now, and it still makes me sad. Almost like a drama more than a cartoon I would say. I also really like the animation. I've never seen another cartoon like this one. It seems almost like a gothic style cartoon. I can't really describe it, but I like it! I would reccomend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Studio Managed To Destroy A Classic Tale","review":"This dvd release is so horrible. This movie should have been restored to the level it deserved to be. They made it full screen with lousy, awful, distorted sound and I guess the bonus features are the extra grainy picture and ugly cover art. All of us fans of the movie deserve a re-release of the dvd complete with bonus features, 5.1 sound, complete digital restoration and more of a mystical,magical, beautiful cover to the dvd. They should know by now that they can sell more if they give us more.Studio people please rescue this film from complete destruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Note: Most Reviews listed are for the first DVD release...","review":"People take note: most of the negative reviews about the picture and sound quality are for the original DVD release - not the Blu-ray release! The new, Blu-ray release quality is fantastic. So take heart! Not all is as it seems..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have bought this...","review":"I loved this movie as a child - and came here as an adult to buy it. It's great to hear it's been restored, but if it was at the price of the integrity of the film, I absolutely refuse to purchase an edited copy. Restoration should mean returning to the original state, not censoring to snare a overprotected, overly sanitized new audience. I will certainly buy a copy when they fix this issue (and intend to find a way to complain to the company responsible as well)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this movie.","review":"I REALLY want to watch this movie amain. I would give anything. But in my town it is not at the video-stores or at any stores I have been to. I liked the unicorn the best. The red bull was scary and so was the harpy. The prince was handsome. It was so touching and the animation and the music was beautiful. I haven't seen it since I was 8 and I would LOVE to see it again. I would strongly recommend buying this movie. It is one you will want to see over and over again. P.S. I think this movie should get an award."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Masterpiece","review":"This movie ranks among my all-time favorites. Sure, the animation may not be perfect, and the DVD release could be better, and there are just a couple of thematic elements here and there that I could do without, but nonetheless, this movie is a classic.It's a wonderful movie about unicorns and love and destiny, and discovering who you are. The music is brilliant, and the actors are superb. If I could be any character in this movie, I'd like to be the butterfly, or the cat, or the talking skull, or even Mommy Fortuna!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, A Competent Release!","review":"Don't be confused by the negative reviews. Nearly all refer to the earlier full screen, Artisan, DVD which I would call miserable except I don't want to give miserable a bad name. For some reason Amazon simply transfered the reviews from the vastly inferior Artisan release. This is a new release in wide screen, fully remastered and superior in every way.The sound & colors are all fresh and nearly flawless. Gone are the scratches, dirt specks, faded colors and muddy sound. I find the artwork appealing in it's simplicity in a day of photo-realistic animated movies and I love the story and music.In a few cases the remastered colors seem a little too intense and sometimes odd but overall it's an outstanding release of a wonderful film.Whatever you do, don't buy the Artisan full-screen version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deep messages","review":"I loved it! I felt like a kid again. This is what we need in these times, a little bit of innocence and hope. No matter how old we are, we can still be children again. I enjoyed watching it with my nieces and nephews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"We were amazed at the poor quality of the DVD. I think the 25th anniversary edition is supposed to have a better quality that doesn't look like they taped it off an old VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"My daughter loves this movie. We saved the blue ray for when she gets older and nows how to take care of the disc. She is 3 and watches this over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film for all ages.","review":"I have always loved \\"The Last Unicorn\\" since I was a kid. When it finally came out in a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack - I was ecstatic! The quality is amazing and brings the movie I love so much to a whole new life of color and sound. Also, in re-watching I realized that I still love this movie and it is a decent enough adaptation of Peter S. Beagle's Book of the same name, which is one of my favorite books! I recommend this item to anyone who has a childlike curiosity - likes magic, animation, and especially JEFF BRIDGES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The last Unicorn","review":"The last unicorn video was fantastic, it's about this unicorn that gets captured, needs to leave her animal friends, and she even gets turned into a human. I think there is more than one movie about the last unicorn, but I am talking about a boy that is a wizard (not a very good one), a circus that has lozy animals and a very mean person that image of the animals look like the animals are powerful. If you are a person that enjoys movies about fantasy then READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I Must Take the A Train\\"","review":"Don't you love the butterfly at the beginning. This is the best movie I've ever seen. As a child I loved it & now as a grown up even more. I encouraged my boyfriend to watch it, but he thought I was crazy until he read all the wonderful reviews. This movie stays near and dear to your heart. For all those who belive in magic, fantasy,love and adventure, get this movie. Parents & kids both will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest movie I've ever seen!","review":"I LOVE this movie! My parent's taped it for me when I was little, but they ended up taping over it again. I'm so glad that it's out for video. Now I can buy it myself! I have always been interested in fairytale-like movies.Now I add yet another to my HUGE collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No offense!","review":"Despite the enthusiastic comments of the artists involved (watch the making of) and the hardly less enthusiastic reviews on this site this film has a rather banal story line with rather banal dialogue. Moreover the design of the title character (unicorn and girl) looks like a combination of a Barbie doll and your customary anime girlie. Apparently the layouts of the US artists had to be oversimplified by Japanese animators. Though I like the witch and the Red Bull. And then there are the awful songs by folk rock group America which are only topped by the ones sung by the characters themselves. The best thing to mention is the background design which occasionally follows medieval art and reminds you of Disney's Sleeping Beauty. Yes, and I don't mind the sometimes grainy picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Unicorn","review":"In very good condition after \\"flying\\" from another side of the world to Asia - Singpore. Good job! Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"only if you're a childhood fan","review":"I hadn't seen this movie since I was four, and I was curious to watch it as a twentysomething. Verdict: if you loved it as a child, you will probably adore it for sentimental reasons. But as someone who had no attachment to it, I felt the story was loosely woven and the songs grating and dated--in fact, I skipped through them. Young children will probably enjoy it, but it is degrading to expect older children to be captivated by a story so lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Release to DVD is Shameful","review":"This is my ALL TIME FAVORITE Animated film. I'm eagerly awaiting the LIVE ACTION film. And I was anticipated this US release to see if it would be as good or better than the UK one. Sadly.. that is not the case. The Quality is horrible not to mention the kiddie targeted artwork from the vsh release is still used. Shameful. I shall be picking up the UK version with all its glorious extras, widescreen format, and beautiful artwork. This US release should make every animation and Last Unicorn love sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"UK Version 1000 times better","review":"I'm waiting anxiously for the Live action version of this classic. This is my ALL TIME FAVORIE Animated Movie EVER!!! I was so dissapointed at what a horrible release to DVD this was. Not only was the packaging the same crappy kiddie fare artwork as the old VHS.. but the Quality was just horrible. I shall surely be buying the UK release with all its glorious extras and and widescreen format and beautiul artwork. This US release should be an embarasment for all animation and Last Unicorn fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing -- not like I remember","review":"I'm pretty upset by the DVD. For some 20 years I've watched the VHS version that my mom taped off the TV, and being a 27 year-old woman I'm still obsessed with this movie and watch it every time I go home. I couldn't believe that I could get this wonderful film on DVD now, considering the fact that only my parents own a VCR these days. But, it was weird to watch -- there are different sounds either I don't notice on the VHS version, or that are new. And there are parts in it that must have been edited from the version I grew up with; props to adding them back in, but it ruins the movie for me. It's just not exactly right. I think I'll just have to keep watching my parents tape, because after 20 years I don't think I can handle these mini changes. *sigh*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears, Not Ratings","review":"It deeply upsets me as a teenager that modern movies, though entertaining, are meaningless. They are written for the purpose of being either PG13 or R or PG or G and parts are given to stars. The Last Unicorn isn't a \\"kid's movie\\" as some unwise adults put it. It is a movie that brings tears to the eyes of those who look for magic and perhaps even brings the unwilling eyes to tears as they realize they've never looked. To find true meaning I look to anime and movies such as this. They enrich the lives of the viewers and leave you with the feeling that there is more to life than sex and violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised this video is available to children","review":"My two daughters watched this video. My husband and myself took turns watching it with the girls because it was so long. During my time watching it I noticed some adult words that shouldn't be in there and also female nudity on a bird that was a bit outrageous. Also my husband observed some female anatomy on a tree that was not for children. Parents, please watch this video with your children if you do buy it. As it is such a long movie I imagine many parents just let the kids watch it and go fix dinner or do other things...not in the same room. I got bored and left after a while. I don't think this is a cartoon for children. I may be the only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"long and weird","review":"This movie is very long, and very weird and a little too scary for my 6 year old girl who likes unicorns. It's quite dark and depressing for a kids movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"CUSS Words for children!!!! Give me a break!","review":"If you monitor what your children watch, don't buy this as it has several incidences of foul adult language! It has the word \\"damn\\" in it twice and other situations that are for adults. I gave it a one star because the graphic animation is nicely done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney - animation - story - acting = The Last Unicorn","review":"To everyone over the age of ten who likes this movie:The next time you're talking to someone, observe how they move when you're talking to them. Are they constantly swaying back and forth, making dramatic swings of the head and body? If they're not, then I can't see a possible reason for you to be praising the animation of film.I mean, it could be the obnoxious \\"humor\\" spouted out by our \\"comedian\\" butterfly in the second scene that makes our heroine dance around like a drunken clown, and sing like she has strep throat, and speak as though the actress is being forced into the job. But I doubt it.It could be the three-breasted harpie, or the cliched \\"pretty creature turned into pretty naked girl\\", or the fact that the unicorn makes Mrs. Elton sound modest, but I can't stand this movie. Why are you subjecting your children to this movie? Watch some Disney, or at least some Ghibli."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful classic with a terrible dvd release","review":"The last Unicorn is a true cartoon classic, its magical story telling at its best, great for kids of all ages and most adults will enjoy it as well. The reason I deduced a star was simpally because of the dvd release. Being a student in the DVD field I can tell that they simpally took an old vhs master and boosted the resolution in hopes that it would imitate DVD quality but it failed miserably. However that doesnt work, boosting the resolution on an old master like that brings out its flaws. I bought the DVD and recorded the cartoon off television onto a DVD-R. I compaired them side by side and can honestly say the television recording holds out better overall. Its sad that classics like this are neglected, but then again business is business."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible dvd of such a great movie!","review":"I adore this movie. the animation is wonderful, the story poignant, but the dvd was terrible! They obviously hadn't touched up the old VHS at all. The picture has lots of holes and spots. I like the fullscreen format personally, but I know many people would have liked the option of widescreen. If their are bonus features like the box claims I can't find them. Overall, you will probably be better off with the VHS, which had a better picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is wonderful movie, but an awful release of it","review":"Let me start by saying that The Last Unicorn is my favorite movie of all time. I have loved it since I was very, very young. However, I truly wish I had never bought this DVD.First off, the movie is full screen and not widescreen--this could easily be forgiven if the DVD didn't have numerous other problems. The picture quality is awful and looks as though they ripped the movie from the old VHS master. There are also some scenes where the contrast seems to be up too high. I know that these are not simply issues with the original movie because I have the German release and its picture is flawless (not to mention widescreen) and beautiful. This release also has one of the worst menus I have ever seen. The DVD says it has special features, but I can't find them!If you're a hardcore Last Unicorn fan, don't buy this DVD. Your old VHS version is just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this dvd!!!","review":"The reason you should not buy this dvd is not because it is a bad movie. The company releasing it has taken all profits due to the author of the story. The websites www.conlanpress.com\\\\youcanhelp, and www.unicorntears.com have all the pertinent info, don't support these thieves. I put my vhs version onto dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful movie, but terrible DVD","review":"\\"The Last Unicorn\\" is one of my favorite childhood movies, and the movie itself certainly deserves 5 stars. However, the DVD version is so poor, quality-wise, that I cannot recommend it. I read the reviews here at Amazon before purchasing it, but I thought surely it couldn't be as bad as everyone was making out. I'm no DVD expert, so I thought perhaps it was only DVD aficionados who were upset. However, I was mistaken. It really is terrible. All I care about is having a nice, clear picture, and this print is dark, dirty, and flickers strangely throughout the film. It's a shameful way to treat a wonderful movie. I only hope that it will be re-released properly at some point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD deceit","review":"The last unicorn is a beautiful story with memorable characters and a bittersweet ending. I saw the original on VHS as a child and it became burned into my memory even into adulthood. Last year I met Peter S. Beagle, the author of the book, at a convention and learned an unfortunate truth. Peter S. Beagle does not receive any compensation for the use of his material in the DVD format as sold by most vendors! As much as I love this story, I want to encourage people not to buy the DVD unless they purchase it through Peter's representative, conlanpress.com. You can even have him sign and personalize your DVD there! Believe me, it was a dream come true to receive my personalized copy for my birthday and it felt good to know he was getting the compensation he deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Unicorn","review":"This movie is wonderful.

While the animation is not what some kids might be used to, it will still hold their attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent video for all ages!","review":"I love this video! It has great music, a great storyline, and great characters. It really made me believe that there are such things as unicorns. It's a very touching film for children and adults alike.

It has everything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quest Every Child Should Take Before Imagination Is Lost.","review":"This is one of the first movies I saw as a child, and the one I most vividly remember. Even though I am all grown up now, fragments of this beautiful film--especially the vision of the lovely Lady Amalthea--have lived in the back of my mind the whole time. Seeing this film again nearly 17 years later was like being swept back in time. When all the lost unicorns are brought back from the sea on the crest of a wave, and when the Last Unicorn, at the end of her quest, returns to the forest she left, and the credits start to roll, and the music plays, and the scenery turns into that medieval tapestry, I was crying like I was 5 again. My only complaint was the picture on the video box. It looks cheap & corny and really doesn't capture the wealth of beauty, fantasy, and imagination that's locked inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful movie with a beautiful song","review":"I heard Kenny Loggins version of \\"The Last Unicorn\\" a few years ago and couldn't figure out why it sounded so familiar.

Through the years I have grown, matured, and have moved off to colllege, but still find this to be one of the best stories I have had the pleasure to watch. The morals presented along with the well developed story line make even a student of theatre appreciate the basic root of entertainment that The Last Unicorn has to offer. If you ever need to just sit back, unwind, and let go of reality for a world of fantasy for a little while, The Last Unicorn will indeed make you smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"Just adding my two cents to the mounting disgruntlement over this release. The picture quality is terrible, the music is so loud that you often can't hear what characters are saying, it's fullscreen, and it looks to be a bad transfer from video. All in all, this DVD is the pits. The folks who released it should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Disturbing","review":"The Last Unicorn is, regretfully, profoundly disturbing for the balance of its length. The plot is horrifying for a young person -- it is, in reality, a bizzare, confusing, animated nightmare. And, watching the animation is a headache-inducing experience. A child under 10 expecting a Disney-esque fairy tale about unicorns will be in for an extremely rude awakening. The \\"insights\\" in the film regarding the human condition, such as they are, will be utterly lost on a young person."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Unicorn","review":"My youngest daughter and I used to watch this movie when she was little and this is the first time I've been able to find it for her. It's her 17th birthday soon and she will be tickled to pieces. Thanks for having it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for children under 12","review":"I picked up this video at my local library for my school-aged children. It was in the juvenile section and had a G rating so I thought it was safe. Thank goodness I stayed in the room to watch it with them. While there is a meaningful story and superb fantasy element, this movie is not for younger children. It scared the pants off me, a thirtysomething viewer who made it through The Ring and The Exorcist. The animation is frightening; the language is inappropriate; the themes are too adult. Please be warned. If you're interested in showing this video to your children, watch it on you own first. Better yet, get the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for small kids","review":"I was shocked thatthis had a G rating with the language used. Not for small kids who are impressionable and repeat what they hear. Other than that a good fanatsy story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A children's movie which could have been edited to 45 min.","review":"My family found this movie to be long and tedious. Even my three year old daughter does not want to see it again. Overall, the dialog is monotone and the songs are more of the plot than the characters. Unfortunately these songs are all done in the same whiny tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, stunningly disappointing DVD release","review":"I have no idea what they did to the soundtrack of this release - it is horrible! There is inappropriate background music that almost drowns out the dialog in some scenes. Most of the actual songs seem normal, but the mixing levels between the voices, sound effects, and \\"ambiance\\" music is way, way off.The color transfer also seems very shoddy in places - too dark in several scenes, such as at the outlaws' camp.Altogether, it is horribly disappointing to see such a wonderful movie treated in this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very faithful to the book","review":"One of the best things about this movie is how faithful an adaptation it is from the book. And no wonder. It was scripted by Peter S. Beagle the man who wrote the fantasty classic. So many phrases and happenings mirorr exactly the book that it's a good idea to have a copy while you're watching the movie. The animation isn't great here but the voices suit the characters well and it ends up being a great movie. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY!?","review":"Why did they have to ruin such a great movie with such a TERRIBLE DVD treatment??? I waited so long for this movie to be released. I grew up with it; to me it is way better than many of the Disney movies around(specially the most recent ones). Like many other reviewers wrote on here, the picture quality is TERRIBLE, contrasts are over done, the image doesn't even look sharp and for some reason it keeps jumping on my tv screen!I have also the VHS version of this film, and sadly enough I find NO DIFFERENCE with the dvd version. I hope someday a kind studio will rerelease this fantasy gem improved as it deserves, just like Disney did with the new version of Alice in Wonderland. But let's face it, this might take years, it it ever happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"I saw this on T.V. as a kid and have loved it since then. The animation is beautiful (and it's GREAT to have an alternative to Disney's corporate pap). The story has all the power and interest of true mythology, and best of all, the tale is told with a healthy dose of humour. See it, buy it, introduce it to more children. The Last Unicorn is a movie that endures."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a classic!","review":"The Last Unicorn belongs in the homes of a collector or one simply looking for a good movie. The movie is also great for children with supervision. It is perfect for a family collection or to watch with children while babysitting. I have grown up with the thoughts of Unicorns prancing in my head; this movie dares to take those fanatasies to a new level. The Last Unicorn deals with many issues that can be used today, about self worth. The movie has humor, witt, and the capability of a universal story-line. The graphics are pleasing to the eye without beign overly complicated. I recommend it as a true classic that belongs in the homes of almost everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful fantasy","review":"This is a magical movie. The basic plot is that the last unicorn must rescue the other unicorns from the red bull. It's very similar to the more-detailed book.The characters are varied and rich and far from being stereotypical and one-dimensional. We even sympathize a little with the villains as we understand why they do what they do.I really enjoyed the songs, which were performed by America.The movie is generally clean, although some of the frightening scenes may be too intense for young children. The violence is without gore and usually happens away from view. There is a small part with a nude woman, but her long hair covers the essentials. I can't tell you why she's clotheless without giving away some of the plot, but that small part is tastefully done.The film could have used a little restoration. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Schmendrick, you!","review":"I grew up with this movie. I had a tape and totally wore it out watching this movie so much. I make everyone I know watch this movie, whether they want to or not. So many great things about this: Alan Arkin, America, Jules Bass, Jealous Magical trees, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"I saw this move once when I was very young, and for the longest time I couldn't find anyone else who had seen it. I almost wasn't sure I really had seen a movie called \\"The Last Unicorn.\\" Then, joy of joys, several years later I happened upon the tape, and watched it again. It was twice as good as I'd remembered. This is the type of movie you can't get out of your head. It's just absolutely stunning. The only reason I can't give it the 5 stars is because no movie could ever equal Peter s. Beagle's heart-breakingly beautiful, yet hilarious book. Nothing could come closer than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you Artisan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Artisan Entertainment has put out some beautiful DVDs in the past. The new T2 Extreme and Stargate Director's Cut are just a couple. This pan and scan release of The Last Unicorn is a true travesty. I have never seen a worse picture in my life on a DVD. Yes, it's that bad. Shame on you Artisan, F.H.E., Carlton, and whoever else had anything to do with this DVD. This is a classic, beloved movie and it deserves so much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love the last Unicorn, I watched it all the time when I was younger.

Hey im 23 now and i still watch it! It is really worth watching. the music is really pretty too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Chose the Cover Art???","review":"This film truly is one of the greatest fantasy features of all time, and it should be represented as such. The packaging, though, looks like it was designed for children. This movie reaches far beyond the scope of childhood. Has anyone looked at Amazon.uk to see the cover art for the European DVD release? Its really great if you haven't looked. The American release of the video did the same thing: it produced this fine film with really cheesy cover art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare Animation, too many pop ballads...","review":"A delicate white unicorn (voiced by Mia Farrow) who believes herself to be the last of her kind sets out on a search for other mythological creatures. Along the trek she meets a bumbling wizard named Schmendrick (Alan Arkin) who accidentally transforms her from equine to human. She finds herself on the, er, horn of a dilemma. Somewhere between Mommy Fortuna's (Angela Lansbury) traveling curiosity show and the castle of the evil King Haggard (Christopher Lee), the unicorn meets Prince Lir (Jeff Bridges) and has to decide whether or not to tell him the truth about herself. Based on the novel by Peter S. Beagle, music by soft-pop group \\"America\\". A great sotry that doesn't quite work in this awkard animation style -- I'm curious to see how the live action version (currently in production) will fare.Staci Layne Wilson"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID","review":"This is a very good film that has yet had a decent video release here in the US. This DVD release is a disaster.This particular print has several major defects. First this movie suffers more than most when cutting it from widescreen to full screen. But the pan-and-scan job (the technique used to make a widescreen film fit on a regular television) was also totally botched leaving many scenes showing only half a face or character.There is also many color problems. The print is biased to red. Dark scenes, of which there are many, show a red tint. Related to this is that the greens are subdued. Many objects that should be green show as blue.The print is also grainy showing more video noise than normal.The soundtrack is extremely harsh sounding making it dificult to listen to.I'd recommend you seek out the widescreen version which has none of these problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-made film, but terrible DVD!","review":"Rankin-Bass' The Last Unicorn has held up surprisingly well as a film, but the DVD treatment it's received is just insulting. With jittery grain, scratches, and dirt marring every scene, a dark and muddy look, out-of-focus transfer, scratchy audio, and insulting pan-and-scan (yes, there are scenes where two people are speaking and NOBODY's in the frame!), it's barely watchable. Add to that the complete lack of extras and you're better off buying this one on VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Poor Quality Release","review":"I remember seeing this movie at the Drive-In when I was a child. I used to have it on VHS until it was destroyed. I couldn't wait till it came out on DVD. However, once I got my copy I became rather disappointed with the quality. The colors look faded, It's Full-Screen only, It even seems to be slightly crooked and there are distortions at the very top of the screen..... What a horrible way to release such a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Unicorn","review":"I used to watch this movie all the time when i was little. It is a great movie about a unicorn that discovers that she is the last one. She goes on a journey to find the others. There is a king that keeps all the other unicorns in the sea so he can watch them whenever he likes and the unicorn has to face the red bull that keeps the unicorns in the sea. The unicorn gets turned into a human by her magician friend and she forgets who she is, and falls in love with the prince. It is a great movie and little girls love to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Childhood Dreams Come TRUE!!","review":"I've always loved unicorns and from the moment I first watched this movie when I was 6 I was hooked.

Every child's dream come true on the screen. A must see!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Just The Best","review":"When I was little, this is the first movie I remember seeing. Again and again. Every time I saw it, I would laugh, cry, and swear that someday I would own a copy. I finally do, and it has not changed. I have every line memorized, every song (and they are wonderful, to whoever wrote that top review), every little nuance . . . it is so much a part of me that I cannot imagine what I would be like if I had never seen it. Different, and probably worse. Believe it or not, this wonderful child's tale of magick and monsters and True Love does have a moral and lessons. If you have children and haven't shown them The Last Unicorn yet, be sure to soon. It's too good to pass up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie!","review":"This is such a fantastic animated film. I've loved it since childhood, however, i would love to see a new DVD version of this film.

Believe it.","review":"Well, unlike the people that read the reviews about \\"horrible quality\\" and bought it anyways, I'm here because of the horrible quality lol. I got this DVD in through netflix and it did indeed look awful. However, the DVD was quite scratched so I thought maybe... just maybe... because it was such consistent scratching over the whole DVD, it was just that and I'd get a newer copy. So, here I am after a google search for \\"last unicorn\\" AND \\"poor quality\\" AND DVD. So, apparantly it just does suck that bad lol. Oh well.Anyways, believe it.

Not only is this movie fullscreen but it looks like a bad VHS transfer. unexcusable! This dvd should have never been released like this. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last but not Least","review":"Since childhood I have enjoyed most animated movies. I saw this one as a man in my late twenties and I thought it a joy. Several years ago I showed it to my mothers godsons and they loved it as well. It helped them to appreciate good animated movies. The voices of the characters are great. Many you should recognize. Anyone that likes animated stories and anime movies will probably enjoy this movie. Fans of movies like \\"Legend\\", \\"Labrynth\\" and \\"Dark Crystal\\" should enjoy it. I have had the video for about twenty years so I am looking forward to getting the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words cannot express","review":"This is a beautiful, moving story that captures our desire to keep magic in the world even as we outgrow it. As a child this story moved me to tears, and as an adult it still does. Magic, adventure, imagination, romance, deep internal struggles to find oneself--it has it all. Those who liked the movie might also want to encourage their children to read the book written by Peter S. Beagle. The movie parallels it beautifully. Music is performed by the group America, and the poetry of the words is just beautiful! Kudos to Mia Farrow for bringing this beautiful unicorn to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical, spiritual, spellbinding, love unconquered.","review":"This movie is absolutely the \\"BEST\\" NON-DISNEY films I've seen since I was a little girl. It has captivated my imagination and my love for unicorns. As much I love Disney, I believe Disney may learn a lot from this animated classic for the animation is superb and way ahead of it's time. The animation of this film is Japanese Anime no doubt, because if you look closely at the character's eyes they're emphasized. I give the studio the credit they trully deserve! 4 Thumbs up! A must see for the animator wanna-be within. You can't afford to miss seeing this film or your childhood would be incomplete without it. Older children intended of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Cartoon Ever","review":"\\"The Last Unicorn\\" is so wonderful! I am actually watching it this second. The animation is so beatiful. Although I am fourteen years old, I have always loved this movie. It has and will be my favorite animated movie for all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY","review":"This DVD has the worst picture quality of any DVD I have ever seen. It looks like VHS, in fact it appears to be a transfer directly from VHS. The sound is decent but it's hard for me to get past the terrible picture quality but my daughter seemed to like it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie, but for the older kids","review":"The Last Unicorn is an excellent movie. I watched it when I was about 5 or 6 years old, and it scared the crud out of me. Eventually, I grew to love it in a frightening way. The menagerie of animals, the Red Bull, and the old guy in the castle (sorry, I forget his name!) was enough to creep any kid under the age of 10 out. I definitely recommend this movie to kids 11+ because it sends the imagination soaring and takes you back to fantasy land. Plus, for it's time, the cartoon effects are very good. The flaming Red Bull, amongst other characters, makes you believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animations and Fantasy classic","review":"I loved this movie as a child, and still love it today. It is perfect for adults and children...excellent story and unique animation that transcends its time. Now if only they'd release it on DVD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie, hate this cut of it.","review":"I can see I am not alone in my dislike of this DVD. As mentioned, this edition only comes in fullscreen, which I find annoying. The worst part has to due with the almost complete lack of cleaning the film; it looks like it was copied from the VHS.The sound was also sub-par, and obviously not mixed well. Considering I only paid nine bucks for it, I consider it a worthwhile purchase... My VHS is so worn that about half the movie is unwatchable. There are a couple of problems with the audio warping that was also not fixed in this edition.If you're like me (in the sense that you have a VHS in poor condition) and simply want a watchable version of this movie, then this cut shouldn't give you any problems. If you're a die-hard fan and want a bit more, go for the special edition. I hear good things, but have not seen it myself as of yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's Animation Fan","review":"I grew up with this movie, and I absolutely love it. It is very fantasy based, and NOT girly in my opinion. I bought the movie to show my Husband and although he's typically open minded, he was opening complaining about NOT wanting to see it. He ultimately humored me, and we watched it, and I remembered all the awesome imagery and the interesting story.When it was over he said h liked it, but it was more of a \\"meh\\" reaction. As for me, I suppose I am still a fan because I have such fond memories of it from when I was a kid, so buy it for your kids! You may find your self loving it to. HEY! Here's a thought, did the company \\"Red Bull\\" get their name from this movie? Think about it. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A all time classic our whole family loves.","review":"This is a all time family classic with beautiful animation and music. The best part is the storyline.

The edits mentioned are very annoying (and not edited out of the earlier DVD edition) but the widescreen presentation is much nicer to watch. The extra features are somewhat interesting but do not reveal anything very interesting about the movie itself (story-writing, making of, casting, etc.). Worth getting, but I am also keeping my earlier DVD for posterity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Live action Release set for Dec. 04!!!","review":"I have loved this movie since my mother first brougt it home form the video rental store (in the original cover) and rented it many times over.

This is a wonderful movie that IS a classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids will love it - parents will hate it","review":"My three year old adores this movie. It does have a good plot and interesting characters, and there are some pretty funny scenes, so I can understand her feelings on that level. However... the soundtrack is DEPLORABLE. The music is mostly done by America, in their typical depressing, 70's-awful style. The lowlights are numbers sung by Jeff Bridges (who voices Lear) and Mia Farrow (who voices the unicorn). These two just can't sing. It's wonder they didn't die of shame when this movie was released. Worst of all, the songs have a tendancy to stick in your head until you wish you were dead - they're really that bad. In fact, my audiophile college-age nephew who lives with us refuses to stay in the house while my daughter is watching this movie. His ears just can't take it, I suppose. If you want to introduce your kids to this story, spare your ears and get Peter Beagle's classic book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and a Treasure","review":"This movie was a childhood favorite of mine!

I have also read the book, and the movie follows it quite well. The music is spectacular, and sends chills down my spine every time I hear it. It is the story of a unicorn who is in search of the other unicorns, to find out what happened to them.

There was an option for my class, to either visit a gladiator and get an autograph, or stay and watch this video called the last unicorn. I stayed, and i've never regretted it. There was only about 8 of us, and as soon as it started we were fasinated by it. I can only vagualy[can't spell] remember parts, but the rest of the class came in about 20 minutes before the end, and guess what? We weren't allowed to watch the rest. The bull completely hypnotised me! I love fantasy and scary things and the bull terrified me!

Watched it so often that I wore out our first VHS copy and we had to buy a second one decades ago.I finally bought the DVD version, excited to at last see it in widescreen, but was shocked when I put it in the DVD player! They went through and censored out all the \\"curse words.\\" It's not as if this was particularly filthy language, just a few stray instances of \\"damn\\" and \\"hell.\\" These words are heard everyday, even on daytime television--not exactly something you are going to be able to shield anyone from anyway.Knowing the film nearly word for word after all these years, I was horrified that they would put out such a sanitized version. Sickened, really.I'm holding out in the hopes that they will re-release it with the proper, unedited version. Until then, don't waste your money on this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the story, but the DVD looks *horrible*","review":"This is possibly the worst DVD transfer of a movie I've seen since the orignal release of \\"Hunt for Red October\\". It's dark, solid colors exhibit shimmer, there's motion blur everywhere and it's *fuzzy*. The VHS version has higher picture quality! The sound is muddy and seems to be mono, though it claims to be 2.0 stereo.I loved this movie as a kid, and I'd recommend this DVD if it didn't look awful. If you can find it, get the German import version - it's region 2, meaning you'll have to have a region-free player, and all the menus are in German. However, it's been fully remastered - sound is 5.1 surround, video is clear and bright. And it's widescreen as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Poor Quality Release","review":"I cannot believe this movie was released in such poor condition. it's fully screen only.

Or if you want to pay extra you can get a signed copy. Why? Because otherwise the writer of the film will get no proceeds, because the company that orignally made this film (Granada) has been refusing to pay him any royalties for the past 20+ years since the movie came out, and generally treating him horribly. Lionsgate, however, worked out a deal to let him sell some copies through Conlan Press online, so if you buy from there, he'll get a cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still love it at 21","review":"I first watched this movie around the age of 5, and it wasn't just once or twice, I watched it so often my mom eventually told me that we had lost the video, it was a very devastating day.

Thanks to the internet my search is over. I can once again discover that little girl feeling that I felt every time I watched it, and I still know all the words to every song, but how could I forget the words to the songs that I sang 24-7 growing up. This is one of those movies that I'm sure my children will be able to fall in love as hard as I did, but I promise not to \\"lose\\" it on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wondrous movie.","review":"Though I can't quite figure out why, I loved the movie. The music was strange, poignant, even, and it gives you the feeling for the scene. The only flaw was when Amalthea sang; she should stick to speaking. And the story was wonderful, a thoughtful line that showed how life would sometimes go one way and you could not help but let it go that way. And the characters! The harpy's \\"We are sisters\\" and Amalthea's \\"This body is dying!\\" and all the lines and personalities and appearances . . . It's too much! Gotta go cry now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Unicorn?","review":"Not many people have heard about this beautiful movie. With original songs by America and huge stars as voice actors, the movie is great and charming. The animation is that of Japanese creators but the story is understandable and beautiful. I love watching this at least every other month!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical!","review":"This movie is as charming as it was the first time I saw it. The animation leaves a bit to be desired (it looks terribly similar to the animation in \\"The Hobbit\\"), but thanks to the beauty of the story, I was quickly able to overlook the \\"rustic\\" animation. An enchanting tale of a unicorn, afraid she is the last in the world, on a quest to find more of her kind and set them free from King Haggard and the Red Bull. This captivating movie is enough to rekindle even the hardest cynic's childhood belief in magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply aweful","review":"The storyline is well constructed, but the audio acting is terrible --- makes an adult cringe. For the musically challenged, the singing can be tolerable otherwise prepare for projectile vomiting.

I really wish they would redo this story with actors that have talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautfiul","review":"I loved this movie when I was a kid, and used to press 'pause' on the screen so I could drawn the Unicorn :) I think it has been re-mastered wonderfully, and I am glad it's on DVD now.

I don't think the people that are releasing the movie understand the devotion of the fans. I've bought the pirated version and it's better than this crap. Artisan. Please step up and give this movie the treatment it needs. Americans have only been waiting years for the release. The audio is unbearably bad as well. It must be a VHS copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The loveliest story, movie, book ever...","review":"I happened to bump into a site with the Last Unicorn today. It immediately brought back memories of my not too distant childhood (I'm 17 now), and how much I treasured this movie...how I watch it over and over, sobbing through, and loving the ending. Despite its age, it remains my favorite animated movie to this day...somehow, this movie seems more \\"real\\" than any other animation I've seen.I wasn't aware there was a book until now, and I will rush to get a copy of it ASAP!\\"That cannot be. Why would I be the last? What do men know? Because men have not seen unicorns for a while does not mean we have all vanished. We do not vanish. There has never been a time without unicorns. We live forever. We're as old as the sky, old as the moon...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing journey into artist development","review":"Down Thunder Road is presented on the back cover as somehow contreversial and anti-Springsteen. Well, as a Springsteen fan, I did not found this book outrageous at all, but on the contrary fascinating. It is an amazing journey in the development of a new artist that will eventually become a popular music icon. Down Thunder Road is not only the recount of an adventure, it is also a music business case, full with a copy of the contracts, record company memos and court orders. Fascinating !"},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless junk","review":"Read the Library Journal review above. They've got it right. This is junk, pure and simple - a hack job designed to let Mike Appel, one of the vilest men in the music business, whine about Bruce.

A must have for any aficianado of the blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Buy this one, \\"A present for the future\\" and \\"Live!\\" These are the best albums from Frank's catalogue. The freshness and creativity of these albums are uncommon and really exeptional. The music of BNG is light and entertaining and could easily be appreciated by the Jazz neophit. But don't consider this an easy listening album. It is challenging and adventurous, simply Frank could make the most difficult progressions sound very easy and acceptable. His playing here is absolutly marvellous. I treasure this disc because of the enjoyment it gave me from the day I bought it (more or less 15 years ago) since today. I can't get enough of these three albums. With these three Frank definitly entered on my map firmly!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats batteries and min. to start","review":"I owned this CD-player for 2 days and then returned it.

The last time it was \\"fixed\\", it came back in worse shape than when it left.Attempts to resolve this matter have been frustrating.

I could burn my collection to about 4 CD's, and then I could go wherever I wanted, and be able to call up any song I wanted. I was especially impressed with the T-Digit function...That was 9 months ago. Things have since grown progressively worse. Now, I find that it doesn't play MP3 CD's anymore...It only plays Audio CD's now. I tried to contact the D-Link support people, and got a prompt, but unfruitful response. They told me to return it to them, and to do so by contacting the RMA department...so i cantacted the RMA department, and recieved no response...It's been over a week, and still no response!

What I would like to comment on is this absolutely shameful DVD release by Image. They have used one of the worst public domain copies, without a hint of restoration and charge over $20 for this. It's a robbery! The only redeaming quality of this release are great but short documentaries by Eddie Muleer. The best print of Too Late for Tears (aka. Killer Bait) that I have seen so far is included in the terrific 5 Film Noir Killer Classics 6-DVD set (where one entire DVD is entirely devoted to great special features) and it costs less than this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think i'll pass........","review":"For the price, Image should have put out a better quality print than what was used in this disc. You can see this same print on a dvd called \\"Film Noir Triple Feature Vol. 1\\".

I'm so glad that i was able to rent this disc through the mail FIRST. The movie is good as far as content goes. I think i'll pass on this transfer of it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Film, Terrible DVD","review":"Too Late For Tears is a decent film and for fans of Film Noir, it is a real kick. Lizabeth Scott leaves a trail of dead bodies, lies and deceit that is classic noir. She could have used better direction, but the film still holds up.That said, this new release from the Image \\"Dark City\\" collection is so technically awfull, it is an example of outright fraud. At this price, to release such a poor transfer with sound like this constitues \\"Grand Theft Video\\". No effort has been made to clean-up any part of the film. You might expect this from a $2.00 Garage Sale purchase, but not from a new release. It looks like a simple copy of the horrid Alpha release.If you like Film Noir, please join me in wrting Image Entertainment to let them know how offended you are by this flim-flam tactic. Enough Said."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too late for tears","review":"This is the worst quality DVD we have ever received and have already sent it back for a refund.

Too bad the transfer is horrid - key dialogue fades in and out, skips like a bad record, and over-contrasted picture settings that leave little, if anything, to be seen in the important opening sequences. One plus about this release is the knowledgable special features on Dangerous Dan and Lizabeth....these are great!

It is a classic and if you love animals you will love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elsa the lion in \\"Born Free.\\"","review":"I had watched this movie a lot when I first saw it. I fell in love with it. I thought Elsa was so cute! She is a very cute baby cub, at least when she was a cub.Let me tell you a little about it:The cub was first found when George Adamson, which is Bill Travers, goes on a hunting trip. He finds three lion cubs and takes them home for his wife Joy Adamson, which is Virginia Mckenna. They name the cubs Big One, Lastica, and Elsa. They had to sell two cubs, and Elsa gets kept.About two years later, Elsa shows an interest in going off on her own. The Adamsons train her how to hunt and get along with other lions. A year later, she has three cubs of her own, and she lives happily for ever.I loved lions ever since I watched this movie, and I hope you would enjoy this movie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific family movie","review":"I have two young boys and they both enjoyed this movie, and want to watch it again--always a good endorsement. The animals are adorable, and you also get a true lesson about wildlife and what it takes to survive. Only one truly scary scene at the beginning was tolerated by the youngest--it was not as graphic as it could have been. It is truly a cute, funny and instructional film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY POWERFUL STORY AND FILM","review":"I used to watch this movie all the time when I was little and love it. It has remained one of my favorite movies through out my life and always well be. It is a very powerful true story, the acting is excellent and it has a lot of emotion. It is a film that I recommend highly. A very beautiful story that will cause to fall in love with Elsa, the lioness. Definitely a film to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"The video is great-excellently made.","review":"It shows the beauty and wildlife of African bush,shows the deep love that the Adamsons had for Elsa.The end was lovely too. A touching story made into a lovely video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome.","review":"Just recently received this item and I am overly pleased.

The journey and the writing are well worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know what all the good reviews are about","review":"This book was required for my university-level elementary japanese class. I really disliked it. I found it extremely unclear. The explanations for grammar were minimal and not nearly as extensive as they should have been for an english speaker trying to learn a language as unfamiliar as japanese. The book isn't engaging at all and actually made me lose my excitement for the language. It makes Japanese more of a struggle than it actually is. Don't but it if you don't have to."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING-Only if you already know the writen language","review":"The book reviews don't tell you, or at least don't make it clear, so I will. I am fairly new to Japanese and know nothing of the writen language and that is what this book is for. If you can not read Japanese this book will do you no good, and I'm not talking about the romanized version, that I can read, I'm talking the Japanese alphabet and kanji. Other than that I can make no review, I think it should just be made clear what this book offers and it offers almost no English readable Japanese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Japanese Learning Book on the Market","review":"The most comprehensive book available. It teaches you to read Japanese script, a cruial step no other book incorporates well. Two drawbacks: the occasional inclusion of new vocabulary without explanation, and the unavailability of the accompanying tapes. Fair warning, though -- it is a rigorous course, and one best done with a tutor -- and a classmate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly exceptional","review":"A truly exceptional introduction to the Japanese language. The clear, straightforward explanations, useful example sentences for each grammatical structure, and varied excercises (with answer keys in the back so individuals studying on their own can check their work) make this an enjoyable and effective text. I would highly recommend it to those just starting out as well as to more experienced students who are looking to thoroughly review the fundamentals of the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice package!","review":"Postcards From The Edge is a wonderful, edgy comedy with a tightly written script, wonderful lead performances, and it is littered with cameos and small roles that give a industry-insider feel without detracting from the story. If you love State & Main...you need to watch this as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and bittersweet; actors are pros!","review":"This is a great story based on Carrie Fisher and her mother and their relationship. Of course Shirley MacLaine is exceptional as always but Meryl Streep surprised me with her talent for singing (this was long before Prairie Home Companion!) Really entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a riot!","review":"Hilarious! Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine are right on the mark with this sharp and clever story by Carrie Fisher. Both hand in performances that are close to comic perfection. With a star-studded supporting cast, a story we can somehow all relate too despite its Hollywood overtones and low-key hysterics throughout, this is a DVD you'll want for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sassy, funny and smart!","review":"This is Meryl at her funny best. What more can you say when the screenplay is based on the best selling book by Carrie Fisher! And Carrie wrote the screenplay too! Ms. Fisher is well known in Hollywood as THE person to call if your script needs \\"pumping up\\". She calls herself a \\"Script Nurse\\"!! Too funny! And yes, she is very well paid for her services! By the way, Annette Benning got her big break in this film! She played the actress playing the hooker on the movie set. She only had a few lines, but everyone said \\"WHO WAS THAT?\\"!!. Hollywood took notice..the rest is history! Shirley M.'s caracter IS the fading Hollywood star. She is so full of life..and herself!! Anyway, this is an excellent, entertaining movie. A Mike Nichols directed film, so you can bet it's top notch!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film & still holds up","review":"If you never read Carrie's 1987 book with the same name then you would not be spoiled by the film.The book was good & so is the film.A lot of names in the cast. Meryl & Shirley are great as Suzanne & Doris. Several of the cast are friends of Carrie's.COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT QUAID. I am NOT a fan of his.Of course this is an older DVD. I would have thought they would have released it December 2008 when Carrie's book \\"Wishful Drinking\\" was released.Good to have the option of widescreen or not.I am HOWEVER, DISAPPOINTED IN THE EXTRAS. Only 1 of note is Carrie's commentary. No deleted scenes or mistakes.Ha ha Bonus trailers YOU GET TO SEE TRAILER FOR OTHER FILM NOT INTERESTEDTalent files on some of the cast-WAS NOT COMPLETE OR CURRENT.As I said, extras were a disappointment.But, you will not be disappointed in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was defected & I could not watch it.","review":"I ordered several movies when i ordered this one, but apparantly this one was defected and i could not watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Defected and Other Issues","review":"First problem was that I was sent 2 copies and charged for both when I only ordered one. I decided to keep both only because I liked the movie and thought the second would make a great gift. I finally opened MY copy last night to watch it for the first time (it was \\"factory sealed,\\" mind you) and the DVD was totally screwed up: The lighting kept changing from bright to dark and in several spots the DVD just went totally black! What a waste of money! Wish I hadn't kept both copies now...That's a wasted $25 down our already anemic economic drain...I'm thinking twice about buying DVD's from Amazon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Inside View Of Hollywood","review":"This movie, along with her other collaberation with director Mike Nichols, \\"Silkwood\\", are Meryl Streep's two best movies in my opinion. Fully relatable characters, well acted, witty script, and a behind-the-scenes look at Hollywood, and its relationships that is very realistic. This film is very underrated, in my opinion. This film would make a great addition to anyone's collection, for those who like films of a certain standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is amazing how Meryl and Shirley can be so believable.","review":"Very real story of Carrie Fisher and her relationship with her mother Debbie Reynolds.

Of course, you throw in Gene Hackman and Shirley Maclaine and you have pure greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT MOVIE - EXCEPTIONALLY BAD DVD!!!","review":"Whoever authored this crappy DVD ought to be taken out and shot. I love this film and bought the DVD. The DVD froze a half hour into the film. It was a used copy, so I thought that there might be a tiny nick in the surface of the DVD. A year later I bought another copy - same thing. What a shame that a great film was released as an unwatchable DVD! Don't waste your money on this Koch Lorber piece of crap.

Faith Assembly continues their traditions in making a rich new romantic album. Plenty of great songs here; however, you need to listen to this album a few times before you finally captured it's whole essence. \\"Shades of Blue\\" is still my favorite FA's album. If you wanna start exploring FA; I suggest you pick up their first album (Shades of Blue) first. Peace !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing here that hasn't been done better elsewhere , , ,","review":"Cause and Effect isn't that great of a band, but they seem to be a strong influence on Faith Assembly. Think droning male lead vocals, with synth lines straight from the bedroom studio. This would not be so bad in itself, but some of the lyrics either swim through so much cliche and/or are such cheesy groaners that I personally can't keep myself from poking for the track advance button on my player.If you are stuck in a circa 1990's synth pop rut and do not have terribly discerning tastes, this album is for you. For the rest of you, may I suggest something along the lines of C&E;'s The Sunrise E.P. instead for contemporary synth pop of a similiarly mellow style.Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Puffy Wall Art","review":"I am quite pleased with this wall art that coordinates with the bubbles and fish bedding set. The wall art is puffy (think stuffed toy) with a small white ribbon on the top of each piece for hanging. All pieces are machine washable. The size of the fish range from 8 1/2 - 10 inches from tip to tail. The bubbles are about 3 - 3 1/2 inches wide and 7 1/2 inches long. I do wish, however, that there were more color options than just green, blue and orange."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Voice From the Past","review":"Professor Rogin explains much about our country and our national mind-set although this book is not for the casual reader. The simplistic, politial tract of Ann Coulter, for instance, is to this seriously written HISTORY as a supermarket tabloid is to a play by Maxwell Anderson. Professor Rogin presents Senator McCarthy as a rational outgrowth of the fear of change that gripped the conservative mind just following WW2.Even today, some of the same fear is used by those who wish to USE the easily led. \\"Socialist!\\" \\"Communist!\\" are often lables attenpted to be tied to those who simply think as liberals. If there were a charming McCarthy who knows how far such movements would go?As always, I am thamkful for Amazon. I can find and buy VERY extraordinary books at very reasonable prices and have them delivered to my door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, terrible quality materials","review":"The story is sweet and has a nice message. However the joy of reading it was difficult. This was a brand new book, but the quality of paper and book binding was the worst I have ever experienced. The pages immediately broke away from the binding just by opening the book gently by me (an adult) to read. My son has never even seen the book and would be frustrated to read it....since its all just brittle pages ready to crumble and the pages are all loose and separate. I paid $5.95 for this paperback book NEW and feel that cost is substantial enough to provide a good paperback book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling apart","review":"Book is good but the binding is falling apart.

But he falls victim to the charms of three redheaded waifs--newly on the streets (or in this case, under the bridge of the River Seine) whom he discovers camping out in His spot, no less! This is more than any gentleman of the road should have to endure! Then too, the children's prideful, bitter mother is no prize. But with the aid of friendly gypsies and their generous cart, plus a pal who recreates Father Christmas, Armand struggles to keep the children warm, fed and sheltered. But how can he deliver the real house which he boasted about for them to live in? This short tale of human kindness in adversity reminds jaded adults of the simple trust of children. A Good read-aloud for the elementary level."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rocky Tale","review":"Armand is a hobo and hates children. One day, he arrives back under the bridge (his home) only to find kids and their mother. He becomes attached to them and gives them life experiences but can he give them there Christmas wish?I thought this book had a great meaning but it wasn't that good. The book wasn't an addicting story, and the story wasn't well written. Also it seemed to change course throughout the story. It was a rocky book and the author didn't do a good job of keeping the story in one style. I wouldn't recommend this book even if it sounds intresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not find this book interesting at all.","review":"Armand (a hobo) is trying to find a way to give three kids a home.

Right from the start A gypsy tells Armand that he would have an adventure that day. That day he meet the Calcet family and his life was not the same. Even though he tried to guard his heart, the kids got through to him. It is a great book to read with your family because it offers hope and takes you though on an adventure through Paris, including Notre Dame Cathedral, and The Court of Miracles. Armand said \\"you should never give up hope,\\" when the fisherman wound up the fishing pole and found the missing pair of his shoe. It it a great book for families that are homeless or having a hard time in life and for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Family Under The Bridge","review":"Once there was an old hobo named.

I give this book 5 stars. I really enjoyed this book. I recommend this book to be read to young children. The End..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing binding","review":"The story is great, quite enjoyable to read with our son. I am disappointed with the binding, it's basically a paperback book with hard covers. Not good quality paper for the text block at all, not sure it's worth it buying the hardcover if the inside pages will yellow and turn brittle over time like paperbacks do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming Book","review":"I have just finished reading The Family Under the Bridge with my fourth grade class. It is such a beautiful story, expecially around the Christmas holidays. It is a story of hope and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santa doesn't recommend this book for younger kids.","review":"Santa would not like this book as it makes it sound like he's not real and that he travels by donkey when he's in France and then ends up really just being a paid homeless man who can't grant wishes. It might even make some children think he isn't real. Not for kids under 11. If only the author didn't take that road, this is actually a good book, that part didn't need to be in it at all. As a mother, I enjoyed it, and am thankful I read it as I can now put it away for a few years and my child can remain a child for awhile. Sadly, this is a good chapter book for 7 to 10 year olds, the exact age that should NOT read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to quit","review":"Plodding, disappointing writing that lacks the character development and depth of the earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water damage not mentioned","review":"This is the way the book condition was described: \\"This is a very clean copy with tight pages, no spine crease and some minor shelf/edge wear.\\" When I received my order, I noticed that the last 75 pages or so appear to have water damage. The lower outside quarter of each page is rippled. If I had ordered the book as a gift, I would have returned it immediately. I would not order from this seller again.I ordered (and received) the book months ago, and I made notes about its condition when I got it - it just took me a long time to get around to this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Jan Karon's other Mitford books, but I liked this one even better. I checked the CDs out of my local library and enjoyed them so much that I bought my own. Looks like Karon's really hitting her stride with this book--brava! I can't wait for her new Father Tim series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied with this Final Mitford Book","review":"I join others who said this book left them wanting. It was quite disappointing. I had hoped with this last book, all the \\"ends tied up\\" would be with the characters we have known for the whole series. I couldn't keep all the new people straight. I was hoping for more of Dooley as a young man. Nope. Puny has a new set of twins, and it was barely mentioned. Edith Mallory found God? Why? We don't know. BIG SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!! And after searching all over for Kenny, he just happens to show up at Fr Tim's door!?! I just shook my head at that. It seems Ms. Karon wanted to get this book out of the way, so she could get on with the new Father Tim novels. I hope they will be like the first 5 books of the Mitford series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light from Heaven","review":"Nine may be an unlucky number for Jan Karon. The first eight Mitford novels were delightful. Somehow in writing the ninth, she forgot to put in a plot. The book jumps from vignette to vignette, some only a few sentences long. The repetition of pet words and phrases, from \\"buddyroe\\" to \\"consider it done,\\" are wearing in this book. She should have stopped at book number eight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jan Karon doesn't disappoint","review":"Once again, Jan Karon brings to life the trials and joys of Father Tim and his beloved, Cynthia. Dooley is growing into a fine young man and life is changing for the residents of Mitford. As with the other books in the Mitford series, it's easy to pick up this book and immediately feel at home with the characters. Hopefully, this won't be the end of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Jan Karon's writings are among the best I've read - that's why this last book I found disappointing - very slow and I couldn't identify/relate to Agnes or with Father Tim's relationship with her. Maybe the author was trying to replace or reinvent Miss Sadie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Ending to a Wonderful Series","review":"Like the other reviewers who were disappointed in this final Mitford book, I was looking for a final visit with the Mitford characters we have come to know and love. Introducing a whole new list of characters was not appropriate for this final book of the series. I found it hard to keep my interest engaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Disappointing","review":"The first few books of the Mitford series were wonderful, but the last two have been such disappointments. I love the Mitford story line, but Light from Heaven was so dis-jointed, it felt like JK got tired of writing and just haphazardly jotted down some disconnected thoughts. I really expected more -a gread deal more - from an author who clearly can touch the hearts of her readers, but really missed the mark this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could cry.","review":"This last book in the series was so boring and dull I could cry because I had looked forward with such anticipation to it. I think Ms. Karon was bored with this series and it showed. It appeared this book was just an obligation to her contract."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Jan","review":"As I expected another great book from this author! it is a little dry in spots, but overall very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light from heaven","review":"I enjoyed this one almost as much as I did the one about the beach. Life is so real in these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"mitford years are the best","review":"All of Jan Karon's Mitford books are great! I have read all of them - in order :) They are feel good books with a good message and story backing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Mitford book","review":"I love all the Mitford books and have them all on my Kindle. Periodically I re-read the series from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"I very rarely buy hardback editions because of the cost but couldn't wait for a paperback version. I was not dissapointed! This finally episode of The Mitford Years wraps up every loose end up beautifully and gives the reader even more insight into the lives of a group that now feels like my own family. Have kleenex handy; I started sniffling on page nine and and didn't stop for the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried","review":"For someone who is reading the whole series at one time, this book might be great. But when I read this book, it had been over two years since I'd read the one before it, and I could not even finish it. I tried to stick with it, but I eventually put it down and could not pick it up again. Is this not the conclusion to the MITFORD series? So why can't a poor reader read about MITFORD instead about a bunch of characters we know nothing about, who we won't get to know very well seeing as this is the last book. I am a big fan of the whole series, but this book was simply painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Believer","review":"I skipped thru a friend's edition and can't wait to get my own. I'm not Christian (in fact, Jewish) but I have loved and treasured every one of Karon's books: for her writing style, carefully drawn characters and heart-felt stories. These are people you get to know and love-- like neighbors, friends and family. I truly believe her books are for everyone, all faiths, across the board. I guess Mitford can't go on forever and like all things, must come to a logical end, but.......just one more piece of that orange cake, please!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"I, too, have read all the books in the series, and this one was a big disappointment. I decided to come here to read the other reviews to see if I was missing something. I still don't get it. Don't care about the new characters. Do enjoy Tim and his wife - especially finding each other so \\"late\\" in life. But generally, the book was a disappointment. I don't think I \\"got\\" the last chapter.One more thing - does it bug anyone else that Jan Karon's favorite word seems to be \\"thumped\\" as in, he \\"thumped\\" onto the chair. I found myself cringing each time I read that. She also used it constantly in previous books.If you have the whole series, buy it, but otherwise, don't bother. Doesn't live up to expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!!","review":"Like others, I had to force myself to read this book to the end as it was about characters I didn't really care about. The constant use of hymns, prayers and poetry was boring and perhaps a way to stretch the book to fufill a publishing contract. It would have been far better to address readers' questions about Dooley, Kenny and Lace in the previous book and ended the series at that point. This was a hugely disappointing book as the characters loved in Mitford made essentially brief and shallow appearances. Jan Karon herself appears to have been bored with Mitford and this lazy effort cheats the loyal reader of a satisfying end to the series. I will not be reading the Father Tim novels and believe Jan Karon's reputation is lessened by her milking the series this way. Don't waste your money. Check this one out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better....","review":"I was so disappointed. Too many characters, big print, no resolution, just...disappointing. Good thing she is on to another series, but this one deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karon should have stopped with the last book","review":"If this book was all the author had to offer faithful readers as a finale for the Mitford stories, she should have left us wondering. Poorly written, with confusing and unfinished storylines, this book was a great disappointment. After all the build up about telling Dooley about his inheritance, one page with nothing to offer ended the suspense. If you have enjoyed this series, I suggest you imagine your own endings and take a pass on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointing","review":"I agree with all of the reviewers who were disappointed in this book. What I had hoped for was a final visit to Mitford with stories about all my favorite characters and a nice tying up of loose ends. Instead we are introduced to a myriad of new characters who aren't very interesting especially as this is the final book in the series and their stories will go no further. What was Ms. Karon thinking? I wanted so much for the final book in the Mitford series to be about Mitford! Definitely wait and get this book from the library - its not worth adding to your Mitford collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"ligh from heaven","review":"Last in a series. Each book wonderful! Jan Karon's writing is down to earth, develops characters well, describes places of events. I am happy to have read & given as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want more Mitford!","review":"I have read all of this series except #9 which was missing. I am having withdrawal and feel sad about the series ending. I want more from Mitford, because I have enjoyed them immensly!! I've never read a series from which I got this much pleasure. I highly recommend these books to everyone. I give them 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Eating an Entire Box of Chocolates","review":"...too much of a good thing. As much as I loved each of the Mitford books, and as much as I wanted to love this one, I just couldn't. I think maybe Jan Karon overreached. Instead of sticking to Mitford as one might expect in the series closer, Father Tim and Cynthia go off to a new/old church that happens to be just close enough to Mitford for the old characters we've grown so familiar with to pop up regularly. She introduced a score of new characters to go with the new church, and it all became too much to keep straight and, quite frankly, too much to swallow. Too many country-isms, too many perfect endings, too many...you name it. It was just overstuffed. And for all that, there were too many things left unfinished! What happened to Miss Rose, for instance? Did Father Tim and Cynthia make it to Ireland? Did Dooley and Lace marry?I would much rather have ended in Mitford."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was a real stinker","review":"Like everyone else, I am very disappointed with the last book...Way too many characters, poorly developed plot lines, what happens to Ms. Rose? What happens to Esther Bolick? Kenny just shows up on the doorstep miraculously??? What a cop out of a novel, I'm sorry! Fthr. Tim and Cynthia could not be any more nauseating, I loved them so much more when they had a fight or two! One thing I need to say, is that Karon did write a very fabulous series with very lovable characters. I wonder if she was on a deadline and was forced to send it in to the publishers? I just can't understand what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not better the second time","review":"I have been a real fan of Jan Karon and Father Tim, even reading both Father Tim novels, although this is not the place to review them.Mitford is a comforting place to visit, and I have been forced to be immobile, so I re-read the Mitford books for escape.I remembered Light from Heaven as being Light-weight and disappointing, and upon reading it again suffered the same disappointment. It was not really a Mitford book - although some of the people from the earlier books were mentioned but not really part of the story.Just too many neat coincidences. I agree with some of the earlier reviewers that it seemed like the author just strung together some episodes and then just gave up. Sigh!Ps: I am a Christian very active in my church, but I like good people better when there is a little spice to them. Sometimes Father Tim just seems a little tooooo good to be true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This book was a real disappointment. It just quits and does not tie up the story. The reader is left hanging. I was reading it on the airplane and thought that I had misplaced my bookmark and missed the completion of the story, but no I hadn't - it isn't completed. I felt the author just became tired of writing the book and quit. The previous book was also not as well written as the others and I won't buy another by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divinely Inspired!!!","review":"This book came from the heart and soul of the divine. How can an author write with such intensity that it totally transports the reader into the town of Mitford, into the lives of the characters to such a degree that when you finish and look up you are so disappointed in your own surroundings that you want to plunge back into Mitford and reside there?

This is a set of books to treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Unsatisfactory","review":"So disappointing! Karon ends a wonderful series with a book introducing about a hundreds new characters and spends little or no time on the characters I have come to love. The resolution of many story lines that spanned several (if not all) the books were flat and felt like an after thought - like the obligitory endings were only included so that readers couldn't claim we were let down. Well it didn't work. I feel very let down by this conclusion to what was an amazing series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Book","review":"HEALING THROUGH LOVE is a must read for anyone interested in understanding the mind-body connection. The author, Marilyn Innerfeld, has written a first hand account of the cause and cure of illness. She has done so in a very fascinating way. The reader will find he/she will not want to put the book down. It is beautifully written with interesting stories to serve as example including the author's own personal experience. An excellent book for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and overpriced","review":"This lipgloss was too pale, unflattering, and all nars lipglosses are way too sticky, make my lips peel, smell and taste bad.

I expect a LOT from gloss this expensive and high end.I ordered a tube of \\"Orgasm\\" and expected the perfect nude lip. Nope! There just isn't anything about this gloss that impressed me. It was sticky. It wasn't very opaque. There was so little color payoff! I have had comparable (or dare I say, better!) glosses for 1/5th the price. I can't believe I'm about to type this, but L'Oreal makes a gloss a million times better than this at 1/4th the price! Try NYX's glosses at 1/6th the price (and I like them better than the L'Oreal). Please don't buy into the hype of the Orgasm gloss. You won't have an orgasm when you use it, you'll be saying, \\"That's it..?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad taste and smell","review":"This lipgloss tasted and smelled terrible...like melted plastic.

However, this particular tube leaks and gets everything in my purse all sticky. Yuck. I think the wand is loose or something. Somethings are better just picked up in store I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"No stickiness here!","review":"Great consistency; it doesn't get sticky after application and has a really nice creamy quality to it. It provides a subtle shine, but isn't as punchy as I'd like it to be. I prefer something that nourishes the lips more, as well. I think I'd like to try it in \\"Turkish Delight\\" (my first was \\"Sweet Dreams\\"). Good product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells and tastes HORRIBLE","review":"This lipgloss is a nice color, but it smells and tastes absolutely HORRIBLE!!! And no, I don't purposely ingest lipgloss, but any woman knows that if it's on your lips, some of it is inevitably going to get in your mouth. Yuck. This is DEFINITELY not worth $24. I will never buy this again. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China! Sending it back!","review":"I am so disappointed that this tote carries Lodge's name and is made in China that I will be sending it back. First of all the Lodge tripod does not come with a tote, so you have to order it separately. I bought the Bayou Classic tripod and it came with a tote bag. I buy Lodge cast iron because it is American made. If the add for the tote clearly stated that the tote was made in China I would not have bought it. Now that I have received it I am sending it back.

No doubt, this is the best tripod tote bag that Chinese child prison labor can produce, but I'll buy American."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching story","review":"We have a granddaughter who has cerebral palsy. Her mind is sharp as a tack but she lacks motor skills to do many things other children can do. Her dream is to run and play like other kids. We always tell her God has a special plan for her life.

Yet it is those imperfections that God uses best.This is not only a wonderful Christmas story to cherish, but a story to read to children, who are disappointed because they did not make the cut for a sports team, or who feel unpopular, or don't have the best grades even though they try hard.

From an author who can take the simplest of simple and expose the deepest of meaning. This childrens book is a must for a childs nightstand to be requested and rerequested night after night. A story on how the least likely of canidates can play the most important rolls in God's creation. How, no matter what seems our position in life, God can use each of us in His kingdom. This book parallels many stories in the bible but mostly reminds me of how He took the least of 7 brothers and used him as a King(David). It is a comfort and joy and should be read by every parent to their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is simply beautiful.","review":"I love this book! It is absolutely precious.

First, the title is offensive. I'm in a wheelchair and I hate the term \\"crippled\\". It's demeaning and insensitive. I thought Max Lucado was supposed to be a compassionate Christian? By naming the book this title, it not only teaches a new generation another \\"hateful\\" term it promotes treating people different because of their abilities or lack thereof.Furthermore, I found this to have the message of \\"pity the disabled\\" not treat them as normal and productive parts of society, which many of us are. If you truly want to educate your children about differences DON'T buy this book. It's \\"well meaning\\" but inaccurate books like this one that further alienate those of us with disabilities and perpetuate ignorance and misunderstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Crippled\\" Has to Go; New Title Needed","review":"While this book may be helpful to children who are seen as \\"special\\" or \\"crippled,\\" I would never recommend it, because of the title, which is bad as \\"The Nig**er Lamb\\" would be. Get it? I'm an advocate for people with disabilities, the preferred term, and can assure you that a book called \\"crippled\\" and terms like \\"special\\" will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause children to be perceived even more as \\"special\\" instead of different but equal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Have\\"","review":"A good book...I like the lesson that no matter what kind of hand life has dealt us, we can be confident that there is a greater plan for our lives and a reason for everything.

The stories about Jesus focus on wholeness and wonderfulness. In this fable, the crippled lamb is left behind when the others go out to pasture. He feels lost and left behind until a special couple shows up. It is then that he has the chance to do the one thing the other sheep could not, he curls up to the infant and warms him in the cold stable.This is written in a style that even the youngest can understand. Highly recommended, particularly to families and Sunday school classes with children who are \\"different.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor packaging and documentation","review":"This is a regretfully mismanaged product.

They couldn't cope with the stress of standing in those shoes for hours. A slight bunion got much worse after that day so I bought this splint to fix it.It did help. Wore it overnight and my foot was realigned in the morning. I hate having foot troubles but until I can afford better care, splints and other OTC remedies help.

I've just received the product today and have had it on for quite some time, like more than an hour. Well the instructions did say to put it on for at max 30 minutes initially but it's really comfortable on me. So far I've no pain problems with it. They don't exactly straighten my big toes back to its original state but they help brace them to a better and more comfortable position. If there's one thing I don't like it would be the way they space my big toes far off from my other toes. But for a price like this I'm really happy with it. Getting a bunion splint isn't exactly cheap nor fairly available here in my country and buying it here is like a steal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable and easy","review":"This is easy to put on and comfortable.

You can feel it helping and i would put it on every night. I didnt get it for pain or anything of the sort...just to help minimize my bunion. Unfortunately after 2 weeks of daily use I noticed that the velcro part that tightens or loosens the regulator is beginning to come apart at the seams....Now there are a lot of tiny strings everywhere. I wish it would have lasted longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable. Look for another splint","review":"PediFix Nighttime Bunion Regulator, Left, MediumI have what one would consider a 'moderate' type bunion. My toe is not out of alignment that much and the 'bump' is noticeable (5 on a scale of 1-10). I bought this product b/c the pain has increased to the point it will sometimes hurt to walk. (I'm already wearing shoes with a wide toebox and have for 20+ years). This splint seemed to work well the first couple nights but shortly thereafter it wouldn't stay on comfortably. The plastic separator began to uncomfortably dig into the area between my toes.If the point is to leave it on overnight to get good results, the item needs to be comfortable. This was not and I have since thrown it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pedifix Nighttime Bunion Regulator Review","review":"This does not completely correct the problem, but after each night's use, my toes are straighter and my bunion does not hurt so much in the morning....very worth the money and time to put on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I was hopeful that this would be the affordable answer to the bunion problem (as opposed to surgery), but this product made my foot more painful than it was already.

I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have feet again!!!!!","review":"These regulators do more than just ease bunion pain. I have the left and the right foot ons. If you haven't let them get out of hand yet, get these IMMEDIATELY!!!!! My feet are aligned again, and without surgery - which is what I had been told I would need! I'm wearing shoes that used to hurt, but without complaint now. and I walk straighter because of it. The first two times or so that you wear it, it does make the joint a bit sore, but that's to be expected. After all it is stretching cramped muscle and tissue and realigning bones. But after a while you can pull it a bit tighter as the bunion responds to treatment.. I can wiggle my big toe which wouldn't move much before. All around excellent invention!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"Unlike its biggest competitor, the FootSmart bunion regulator that looks similar, but is white and blue, this only adjusts in one place. Other than that this is a far superior item. The plastic is thicker and more study. The other dug into my foot with the edge. I can only wear these for a few hours, I put it on fairly tight, but it makes a huge difference in my foot pain the next day and for a couple of days after if I forget to put it on the next night or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great-","review":"I am very happy with this product.

This is not cooking as entertainment but for sustenance; not a fancy appliance or utensil in sight. Good food is prepared from the heart with ingredients at hand.It is Christmas time. I stumbled on this show while shopping on Amazon for another new kitchen gadget.

Even with all your bad news, you could still feel good that you were not the producer or director of this movie. This movie is a triple threat: bad script, bad acting, and bad directing. Even having Tom Cruise doesn't save this flick. I wish Amazon's rating system allowed me to add negative stars rather than just give it one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SAD BUT GOOD ROMANCE FLICK!","review":"I was recently flipping the channels when I first saw this and I came on the scene where Brooke Shields is walking up the stairs to meet up with Martin Hewitt at a party. I was so fascinated by the movie, that I continued to watch it many times after that. Even though it's not out for release right now, it's still good (if you have cable or satellite dish) to look for it on The Love Stories Channel, which frequently shows it. I love this movie and the song. I don't understand why some critics have said it was a bad movie, because it's the best love story I've ever seen. I'm reading the book right now, and they're quite different, but both give a lot of depth and show David's endless love for Jade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreaming of You","review":"The main reason to get this CD is because it contains that \\"other\\" Diana Ross / Lionel Richie duet -- \\"Dreaming of You.\\" It's a fun Motown song and only for that reason I give the whole soundtrack 4 stars. Okay, it's fun to hear KISS sing Disco (around this time Gene Simons & Diana Ross were an item), but the soundtrack could have been a bit more exciting. Ross makes it worthwhile though (if you like the song Endless Love, check out Ross's solo version of the song on Why Do Fools Fall In Love)."},{"rating":"2","title":"how love leads to madness","review":"i saw this movie when i was about six years old and i rememberedover the years because it impressed me very much. when i was a teenager i saw again in local television and i recorded. after seeing a lot of time and after reading a book called \\"EL NIÑO QUE ENLOQUECIO DE AMOR\\"(THE BOY WHO WENT CRAZY FROM LOVE) i understand many things about the movie. maybe it wasn't good directed or had great escenography but the message was very clear. love, a great love specially teenagers can went crazy if their love isn't understand by other people or most of it by adults. this movie shows that a person can do anything to get his love, a love that can leads to madness."},{"rating":"1","title":"endless love","review":"i bought this dvd and now cant play it because its an import united kingdom and will not play on any of my players it will not recognize us format"},{"rating":"1","title":"dvd that don't work in any dvd player or computer","review":"This dvd would not work- When I tried to play it(I tried in 2 different dvd players and a computer) and the screen would say:copied dvd not licensed to play(or something like that).

Boy was he wrong. I'll admit that after I started to become aware of what type of movie this was and how much it stunk, I \\"flipped\\" through the chapters.

She is entirely passive. Everything happens to her - she really doesn't take an active roll. She lets her stepmother take everything away from her. She lets herself be bossed by the stepsisters. She lets herself be talked out of marrying the prince. This Cinderella NEVER stands up for herself.The music drags and is often inappropriate. There's a whole song and dance number in a mausoleum - the prince and his man at arms dance around the crypts of dead kings.The only good point in this is Richard Chamberlain. The one star is for him.Save your money - buy A Tale of Cinderella or Ever After instead - better music, and the Cinderella characters don't just let themselves get pushed around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really terrible - save your money!","review":"Don't believe the glowing reviews that fooled me as well --this is a really terrible musical version of Cinderella.Despite wonderful photography, locations, and RichardChamberlain, the songs are dreadful and tuneless, and theplotting and direction extraordinarily dull. After thefirst two musical numbers (there must be dozens) even my7 year old daughter was complaining -- \\"The songs just goon and on and on!\\" The only redeeming feature is that you won'tfind the tunes stuck in your head - they are instantlyforgettable. Get either of the Rodger's &Hammerstein's Cinderella's instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the slipper and the rose the most boring version with dumb songs","review":"i had been wanting to see this movie for like forever because of everyone's opinion of it. i finally saw it on megavideo and I'd have to say this is the worst version I've ever seen. Sure the costumes are beautiful and Richard Chamberlain makes for a very handsome prince. But the story reeks with boredom,the characters are unimpressive especially Cinderella herself even though she does have a beautiful voice. And the songs! oh my god! they suck! they are not catchy or entertaining! What could have been a 5 star epic tale went terribly wrong and turned out to be a big snooze fest! I would not recommend this to anyone. What I would recommend however is the Disney animated version and all 3 versions of Rogers and Hammerstein instead. Better story! Better songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"After winning an autographed copy several years ago, I had to wait a long time to unite this DVD with a DVD player. I have always enjoyed the Sherman Brothers' work, from Mary Poppins to 1776, even the Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Tiki Room. I was also looking forward to finally watching Michael Hordern onscreen, after falling in love with his voice in the BBC's radio version of The Lord of the Rings (he was a spectacular Gandalf). Now, after all that buildup, what a tremendous letdown. I'm about 40 minutes in and bored out of my skull. The jokes are flat, the lyrics monosyllabic and predictable, the melodies are entirely forgettable, and the acting is entirely two-dimensional.Not recommended for anyone over the age of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Fairy Godmother!","review":"Certainly Richard Chamberlain is the consummate Prince, and Gemma Craven is a delightful Cinderella. However, the deliciously comical Fairy Godmother warmed my heart and made me smile. This isn't a belly-laughing version of Cinderella. It is more period correct, like Drew Barrymore's \\"Ever After\\", but having been made in 1976, it makes me think the producers of Drew's movie stole some ideas from this pleasing movie. It is less cartoonish than Rogers & Hammerstein, which definitely appeals to children, especially little girls. Overall, I'd say this is the best musical version of Cinderella you'd ever lay eyes on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Daughters' Favorite","review":"This came out when my daughters were 10 and 12 and they thoroughly loved it. The music is first rate and the story is classic, obviously. I found myself watching it with them and still find myself humming the tunes 22 years later. Six months ago I tried to find it in video and was disappointed that it wasn't available. I recommend it to anyone with small children, an ear for music, and an appreciation of classic fairy tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best DVD version out there!","review":"Price wise....ya its cheaper than the 2000 issueBUT!this one is only Full Screen 1:33and127 min run timethe 2000 issue is now up to $25.00 +but is Wide Screen 2:35and143 min run timeyes their really are reasons to know what movie versions are out there to know what one really is the best to buy!this one isn't it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When, when and when? will the CD come out????","review":"This is my all-time favorite movie/musical. I love it! I know all the songs by heart. When I was ten, I danced around our family room to the vinyl record until it was all scratched up until every song skipped (you now have to be a certain age to get that). Anyway, it was my favorite movie and still is. Everyone in your family will enjoy this movie, but if you have a little girl-this is the movie she must have because it's the best version of Cinderella she'll ever hear and funny too! And, if you're lucky, this movie may become one of those perfect childhood memories- it sure is one of mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"an adult fairy tale","review":"This is a wonderful musical version of \\"Cinderella\\", which i may add is not a Children's fairy tale, it has only been reduced down so that children will get the gist of the tale.

I am not overly senimental but the poignancy and Ms. Craven's lovely voice make that scene superb. But that is how the whole movie is. Though overshadowed by Rogers and Hammerstein's version and Disney's animated, this is just as good if not better then either of them. I strongly recommend this for anyone who believes that while true love does exist, it is not as easy as the fairy tales make it seem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know and love the movie---the disc didn't work regardless of the device in which it was placed.","review":"I've loved this movie for years and was really excited at finally finding a CD, only to be bitterly disappointed that the disc didn't work.

Would much rather have the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a little too slow paced","review":"If you like musical, you'll like this movie. For me this movie is a little too slow paced. I do like the drama part though. My five-yr-old daughter and four-yr-old son like the story too. I first watched this movie when it just came out at the theatre. I was too young to undertsand and slept through most part of the movie. Watching it again was fun. Wish someone will remake the Cinderella story with real people."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie has stuck with me for 20 years!","review":"I first saw this when I was just a little girl, and this was my favorite movie for years and years. And now, seeing it as an adult, I have a whole new perspective on it - but it's as charming as ever!The costumes are really beautiful and striking - the combination of choreography, costumes and music of the ball scene is quite something!The characters are endeering - I loved this Cinderella, and of course, Richard Chamberlain makes a very Charming Prince. The fairy godmother was really funny and one of my favorite scenes was the preparation of Cinderella for the ball.With more story to it than the average Cinderella movie, I find this one to be really heart-rending and passionate, yet clever and funny at times, too.I recommend this one to every romantic heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slipper and the Rose","review":"I collect movies that deal with Cinderella and this addition is well liked.

The actors did a great job presenting the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliving History","review":"I remember watching this movie when I was a little girl and fell in love with musicals. It was one of the best Cinderella stories ever. I have always wanted to purchase the movie but could never find it anywhere. I am happy to see that it is finally available on DVD. Any little girl can watch and dream about being Cinderella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality transfer, but don't buy it for the extras!!","review":"Look, it's a gift from the heavens that this is a clean, letterboxed transfer with good sound. It's very much like having obstructions moved from both your sight and hearing. I've never seen the film looking this nice, having only seen it on tv in that other (worse) alternative to Pan'n'Scan--where everybody's 10' tall and very very thin. The restored footage is also fun for fans, but does slow the pace of the film. The extras are nothing to write home about. The commentary suffers from old-duffer syndrome: \\"dubbing\\" is defined for you and a running obituary list of actors no longer with us are elements, and the rare anecdotal gems are, well, rare. The documentary is period from the film, and while it's nice to have it archived, is nothing really special. Chapter stops are good, but a little too infrequent for my taste. Overall, get it if you want to see the movie in the clear (finally!), but not if you're intent solely on the extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Slipper and the Rose","review":"I waited for a long time for this movie to come out on video. It is the most beautiful production of the classic story of Cinderella I have seen. The music is wonderfully uplifting, the characters beleivable, and the costumes are gorgeous. A great way for adults to dream away an afternoon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Collection of Intros","review":"I hate to say this, but the cover art is the best part, by far, of this CD. I own EVERYTHING Mannheim Steamroller has ever produced, and I know what to expect from Chip Davis' eclectic arrangements. That being said, I was very underwhelmed by this offering. What it seems to be is a collection of intros that end before getting to the \\"meat\\" of the songs.If you are looking for something that will leave you whistling familiar Disney tunes, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative arrangements of Disney favorites","review":"This album put together two of my favorites--Mannheim Steamroller and Disney. The arrangements are creative and quite surprising. I imagined myself inside the \\"Haunted Mansion\\" when I first heard \\"Chim-chim-chiree\\" and \\"Davy Crockett\\" was done so naturally that I could envision \\"Frontierland\\" vistas. All in all, a really fun listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the RA samples make it seem, but room to improve","review":"Having heard the samples online, I was a little concerned, but I really enjoy the album. I find it quite \\"sleepy\\", not exactly the typical excitement found in many Mannheim Steamroller stuff. I hope that in future albums, the variations follow the emotion of the original. Under the Sea, for example, in the movie is the show-stopping big production number, but on this album, it's really quite slow and peaceful. The album is a must for a Disney music collector like myself, and definitely something to look at for those who like Mannheim Steamroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good!","review":"This is \\"happy music\\". I play this more than all the other Mannheim C.D.s that I've collected. Great sound!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A novelty and nothing else","review":"Okay, it's cute. Listening to this with all the trademark MS sounds and rhythm patterns makes one wish that Chip Davis would go back to composing his own material. Was this necessary for any reason other than to make some big bucks? Disney music has been done to death and one more take on it seems a creative waste of time. Come on, Chip, tap the well of inspiration that gave us Fresh Aire V, VI, and VII. We don't need any more warmed over Christmas or toy store Disney music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um excuse me...","review":"Uh I think this is probably just me do please don't be offended, but I just listened to the samples and I think that unless I knew the titles, I wouldn't know what the it was from...Under the Sea sounded like just a bunch of bubbles and all you heard in Hakuna Matata was this guy saying Hakuna Matata. Supercalifragicious was the only song that I gould tell what it was..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty interesting listening for Disney fans","review":"This album was better than I thought it would be after listening to the samples...The only real disappointment was \\"Hakuna Matata,\\" which didn't seem to have any of the real melody in it.

I expect to buy newly recorded CDs with at least 60 minutes worth of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"It all sounds the same!

It almost seems as though this book was written simply to fill the hands of his readers until he could come up with something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"LESS OF THE SAME","review":"Higgins doesn't break a sweat with this one. If you have read Higgins' other books with Sean Dillon as the protagonist there's is no need to read this one. Same story elements, same set piece action scenes and so on. Maybe I have read one too many of his books but they are all very much blending together now. Even the name of the book is unoriginal, note his earlier \\"Touch the Devil.\\" Harmless enough few hours of reading but not much is new."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT THE BEST BUT IT'S CLOSE","review":"The first book by Jack Higgins that I read, since then I have read many more.

However, as an elementary school teacher and mom I have had plenty of experience with the genre. I am a firm believer that children deserve the same (or better) quality as adults do (in music and all other things).That said, this recording is very inferior. The recordings are of a quality that makes them unpleasant (almost downright irritating) to listen too. The nice melody, rhythm and careful arranging that goes into other recordings is missing here. The end result is considerably less enjoyable, than say a Raffi or even a Barney CD, and there is a whole lot more of it to endure."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrid","review":"I read all the great reviews for this CD and bought it. I HATE it! I can not stand to listen to the children on the CD singing off tune. The quality of the singing is so poor. The CD does have many familiar songs (I didn't listen to all 4 disks, I gave up after 3) but I just can't bear this one. My toddler didn't seem so fond of this collection either. I laid all of his CD's out for him, and he has not once chosen to listen to this one after I initially played it for him. He does have many other favorites though. This one really is torture if you care for good music at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Stuff Out There","review":"With rinky tinky synthesizer backgrounds and annoyingly over-fast tempos, this is a waste of money.

However, most of them are [weak]. So I didn't expect too much from this set of CDs. What a nice surprise, the Ultimate Kids Song Collection is by far my favorite as well as my 1 year old's. Baby loves it and starts bouncing whenever I play the CDs. The set contains 3 CDs with 101 songs (over 3 hours of music).

I was wrong. Lucinda had so much going for her in the West Texas hardened by encounters with Christobel and Mrs. Sully that I thought her character would continue to grow. Instead, the book was a grandiose setup for the time displaced rehash of a race riot. The ribald humor was misplaced and characters are killed off haphazardly. I knew not to expect plot resolution, but some motivation would have been appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fab song!!!","review":"It's a shame that this didn't really hit it big in the States, because this song is great!

I agree with the review below....The Neo-soul genre is experiencing some kind of drought. And when your favorite artists come with something new, you are excited and expecting to play it 24/7 like when Lauryn Hill came out with Miseducation......The first cut \\"Trouble\\" sounds like a song made for my infant daughter.

In addition to the vocals, I really enjoy the production on the album, as every track seems to complement the next. \\"Unanswered Questions\\", \\"No One Else\\", \\"Morning\\" and \\"Gills & Tails\\" are standout songs, but the whole album works.

She is an awesome artist, a seemingly humble person and an incredible performer!

I'd been awaiting this album, though I wasn't in love with either of her previous solo albums. But I caught her vh1 soul \\"Listening Party\\" and I have to say after hearing how Amel speaks about music, I feel her soul was captured on Morning.

The plot is very confusing and takes more than one read-through to understand, but I found the book too boring to re-read, so while reading the book my thoughts were, \\"When am I going to get to another funny part?\\" and upon finishing it, \\"Oh.

They are hilarious. Tea Time is good for a chuckle here and there but that is about it. I suppose those who have a bit more upstairs than I may find all the social commentary or what ever makes up for the lack of silliness and humor. In my case it did not.Glad I bought it. Glad I read it twice. Not really worth the third read. Wish it was as great as all the others. As some one once said the lack may lie with me and not the book.A great loss that there will be no more.

He writes jokes that you have to be pretty smart to get, but not a genius. British jokes. But jokes, nonetheless. He writes strange, off-the-wall, science fiction humor. Sometimes the book can get a little too strange and make you go, \\"what?\\" and reread that page, but its still good. I liked it, and I hope you'll like it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as great as the rest of his books","review":"Adams once again brings his whimsical writing style to an absurd series of events, making for a hilarious ride. I heard someone say once that Adams works are usually classified as \\"young adult\\", but any age can enjoy his books. Also he mentions alcohol quite a lot for young adult books. Aside from some alcohol references (I'm sure his other books mention alcohol more than this one), the book is very family friendly (no gratuitous sex/violence). If you enjoyed the Hitchhiker's Trilogy than you'll love this book. It is the sequel to \\"Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency\\" so you'll be more familiar with Gently's character if you read that book first, but it's not imperative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weak attempt","review":"The Douglas Adams I remember from the first Dirk Gently novel is not present in this one. The storyline feels thrown together, the ending is forced, and the ability of the text to hold an audience is poor. Though there were a few bright spots, this book was a large disappointment. However, the Hitchhikers Guide five book trilogy and the first Dirk Gently novels are wonderful. Don't read this, it just disappoints. At best, it's a B-."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Confusing but Humorous Book","review":"A long dark tea-time of the soul. Only the title makes you aware of Adam's genious way of writing. The dark time of our souls... It is written with a British humor which I love, being áboring Swede'. Sometimes it really confuses me and I have to read a few parts twice, but it is generally a great novel with a silly sense of humor. He geniously connects to his other books, i.e. by having a sofa from \`The hitchhiker's...\` (I think) appear. There are lots of encounters with Gods, especially Thor and Oden (Odin in Eng.)

It's the part of Chapter 26 where Thor and Kate meet Tsuliwaensis. Each track is not identical, but the part of the book that is read, is. Needless to say, you never get to the thrilling conclusion of the book.Amazon quickly replaced the CD set (thank you!), but the replacement set has THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM.

The book starts out with a big explosion, which brings us to the main characters Kate, Dirk, Thor, and Odin. Kate was brought into the story by the explosion because almost seconds before she was trying to help Thor buy a ticket to Oslo. Thor is the son of Odin who acts like a child. Dirk is a private detective working on a case that deals with the gods. The book was hilariously funny, the deranged eagle, the street light thing, and Thor being glued to the floor were some of the more amusing things. Adams is a great author, who has a great vocabulary and an imaginative mind, but he writes kind of confusing so you have to read it more than once to get every detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Hitchhiker's Guide instead","review":"It pains me to write it, but this book was bad. I thoroughly enjoy most of Douglas Adams' work especially the Hitchhiker's series. Unfortunately, he missed the mark with this book. I personally believe Adams wanted this book to be very funny, ala, the Hitchhiker books (others disagree), since it was: strike one. The storyline was quite complex, which would be fine, but I'm not 100% certain this is what Adams was trying to do: strike two. Finally, Dirk Gentry just is not equal to Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect (Hitchhiker's main characters) in terms of full, colorful characters, the final strike. Maybe it was my high expectations after reading the Hitchhiker series, which I found incredibly entertaining at 14, 24 and 34 years of age (for different reasons)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy the CD set!","review":"I love Douglas Adams, and I love to hear his recordings of his books.I like The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul well enough to have worn out my audio tapes.I bought the CD version, but disk 6 is a messed up recording.

There is a problem with CD 6 - something went wrong with the mastering process and some of the passages are repeated 2 or 3 times (the bit where Thor & Kate meet the old lady in a shack) - which means that you end up missing the last couple of chapters of the original book!This is a terrible mistake by the publisher and ruins the ending, because the whole of it is missing thanks to an error which should have been spotted.I have 2 copies of this set, and they both have the same mastering problem, which leads me to assume that it is not an isolated case.Buyer beware!Hopefully, a new version will appear eventually which sorts this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant reading ruined by bad mastering","review":"Douglas Adams' reading of The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul is truly engaging.

Yeah, the dubbing was awful, but it only added on to what was already a bad, bad movie. Even my roommate, who normally hates watching scary movies because she thinks they're too scary, laughed all the way through this one. And, uh, what kind of police officer would discuss a rape with people OTHER than the immediate family? <-- Just one of the many truly stupid scenes in the movie.

It has nothing compared to the quality of Lady of the Lake, or Slashers. The dubbing is terrible. Now, I know that this was a german movie dubbed into english, but come on! It just doesn't look right. I've seen skin flicks with better dubbing! The script must have been written by a twelve year old. It's bad, even for a horror movie. After awhile, I watched it in fast forward mode and found nothing remotely interesting to put it back in regular play mode. Avoid this at all costs.

I'm very glad I did! The Man with a Load of Mischief is a clever, funny little detective novel. It moves at a brisk pace and is packed with interesting clues and red herrings. Most of the characters in the novel are interesting and well sketched. My only complaint is with the character Lady Ardry. I know that she was written to be the most infuriating, annoying character in the story, but I found her to be SO incredibly abrasive that I hated (HATED!) having to read any scenes that involved her. She drove me absolutely batty with her vindictiveness.

It is far better than his last 4 or 5 films (which are very bad: Desert heat, Universal soldiers: The return, Double Team, Knock off).The story about cloning but director Ringo Lam made this movie highly entertaining. Van Damme plays double role, one is the serial killer, the other role as his clone which created so the police can catch the serial killer.

His last movies didn't do so well, and they weren't really great either. But this movie suprised me, ok, the storyline is a bit thin, (van damme plays the torch, and to catch him they make a clone of the torch, but the clone must learn about life to, pretty funny), but there's pretty good acting in it, a few action scenes which are really great.

You know what the movie is about. But what you don't know is that Van Dam became an actor. He is totally convincing in the dual roles. As the serial killer he shows us a dark side to his personality which works on all accounts. Focused and confident. As the Clone (Replica) he shows his more sensitive side. He even get's to do a little bit of the Tom Hanks in \\"Big\\" routine. Though I will admit I like him in the villan role. In all, the movie moves very well by the sure hands of it's director Ringo Lam. It has some very violent and realistic scenes that will frighten younger viewers so parents please be responsible and do not let them watch it at all. It is rated R. Thanks Van Dam for a excellent film.Some other Van Damm Films I recommend:TimecopSudden DeathMaximum Risk (Ringo Lam, Dir)Hard Target (John Woo, Dir)Nowhere to HideDeath Warrent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Tale","review":"I originally wanted to read the Last of the Mohicans because of the very enjoyable movie but I picked up this book and chose to read it first. I do not regret my decision. I was unaware when I began reading this book in the Leatherstocking series that it was not the first book in the series. A reader who has not read other books in the series can feel confident that they won't feel lost if they start reading this book. The book portrays very detailed images of the forests, lakes, rivers, and people of the French and Indian War time period during the 18th century. The character development and plot are very well done. The book also gives a glimpse of the harsh realities of war during this time period. The writing style of the book is also fascinating and reminds me, at times, of epic poetry. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good adventure","review":"In this, the third Leatherstocking tale chronologically (after Deerslayer and Last of the Mohicans), James Fenimore Cooper takes us, once again, to his vision of pure, unadultered, nature. Once again he weaves a tale around his ideas of morality, race, and religion. This time around Leatherstocking (known here as Pathfinder) is the pursuer of love, whereas before (in Deerslayer) he was the pursued.These three books are the only ones that I have read to this point, and it is true that both this and the Deerslayer are more of romances than the Last of the Mohicans, which is an adventure.Alot of people give the other books in the series flack because they are expecting the same as what they read in Last of the Mohicans. However, if you begin reading the book without those preconcived notions leading to disappointment, I think you will find that the other books are equally entertainingAll three are great books and I highly recommend them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooper?","review":"This book was as boring as clipping my dog's toenails. It has no invention, no creativity, and it's crass stupidities are passed on as \\"the delicate art of the forest.\\" Delicate art of the forest my Aunt Fanny! The book's style is set forth in an implausible way. For example, when the males are all shooting at a stupid tree-more specifically, a nail head in the tree-Cooper sets the nail about a 100 yards away! And yet everyone seems to see this nail and shoot at it. That's about the size of a house fly. Now this pathfinder-natty bumpo-deerslayer person is able to shoot at a hundred yards and hit the thing dead on! This man is able to see a housefly at a hundred hards and confidently say that he did so. Can YOU do it?The style of the writer is tremedously tedious. It seems to add things not needed and omit things that are necessary.I would recommend this book to those who do not value time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set","review":"This set is my first now that I am living on my own and has been great for the past year.

The 13 piece set arrived and although I am pleased, one handle had a 'chip' on it and Farberware wants me to send the entire set back. Not cost effective...all I need is a handle. I ordered the 12\\" fry pan too, and it came with the pan caved in. Luckily, amazon will take care of this. And there are no visible marks on the box or item. Poor inspection? I have reminded Farberware that a 'name' is not 18/10 stainless steel.The handles on all the items are not as 'smooth' as with the old set, some polishing could be used to eliminate sharpness.Still, a good value *if* you can get a set without flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"great brand, now cheap junk","review":"I was given one of these sets as a gift.

Unfortunately, on the first use itself, the 2 qt sauce pans were permanently tainted so that the inside and outside walls have a warped look as though the steel is burnt and the metal has lost its shape. Very difficult to describe unless I post a picture of the pan along with this review. Overall, I feel very disapponted with the quality of this cookware.

The company no longer exists, and its successor makes cheap knockoffs of the original.

The mirror polish is still intact, I think this is a wonderful thing that a newly wed should have. Its worth the price.Positive points: Food doesn't stick to the pots/pansYou get varieties of sizes.Easy to clean.Looks smart.Negative points: I feel the handles are little delicate, so we have to give support if the stockpot is completely filledThe mixing bowls are quite thin.

The pans themselves also don't look nearly as good as they do in the photo. The lesson here is to not buy items like this online.

I was right.The show, which focuses on the lives, careers, and THC levels of three stoner imbeciles whose makeshift fraternity is filled with enough juvenile hijinks to put Beavis and Butthead to shame, is lurid, offensive, and pretty tasteless. Nevertheless, it's pretty damn funny stuff.The acting is tight; the writing is clever (albeit in a sophomoric way), and the gags are memorable.If you're into \\"It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia,\\" \\"Archer,\\" and \\"The League,\\" then \\"Workaholics\\" may be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show Ever!","review":"For those who have not had the privilege of watching this show I highly recommend this DVD!

Big Oil has a dangerous degree of influence over the US and its policies. The Republican Party is in the sway of the religious right and the fundamentalists. There is a corresponding degree of clout in the southern states--reversing the reults of the Civil War. We have too much debt, in government, in families, in American businesses. All of this makes the future scary and could lead to the downfall of American preeminence, influence, etc. It happened before with Spain, the Netherlands and Great Britain. Dynastic leadership is bad for America. (OK, that was Phillips' last book, but he continues the drumbeat.) That's it, for this very pessimistic and depressing book. To me it seemed to be a literary fillibuster. Lots of data. Lots of redundency. There may be enough insight here to justify a couple of extended magazine articles. But a book? No way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent analysis of America today.","review":"Kevin Phillips writes a very detailed explanation of how different special interests have brought about the current American crisis. The book is roughly divided into thirds: oil, religion, and credit. Phillips starts very slowly, but picks up when he gets past oil. His anger at the religious right is palpable, and he makes his case against their excesses clearly and with great rigor. The third section on credit moved along more quickly than I expected. The book is well researched, the examples plainly described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opener","review":"This book will change what you thought you knew about gov't and special interests.

Dependence on oil, religious right, and debt, we all know that. The problem is not if they are dangerous, the problem is how all these will lead to the conclusions that the author attempts to make. We keep on asking HOW, HOW, HOW; and the author just keeps on polluting with well-taken data, unrelated stories, and un-analytical information. Too many similar authors out there simply believe they can manage a political-economic topic with common sense, as long as they can overcrowd their book pages with enough data."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precise, balanced and well-researched","review":"Kevin Phillips is a Republican who puts voice to what concerns many American citizens, (both Republican and Democrat, secular and Christian): 1) that our nation is being taken over by extreme radical right-wing Christian clerics, 2) that our budget deficit is becoming more and more dangerous and 3) that our dependence on a dwindling oil supply will eventually permanently cripple us.This is a gripping piece of non-fiction that presents a balanced and well-researched view of a growing problem many people seem to prefer to ignore rather than address head-on, as Mr. Phillips courageously does in this book.I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who feels that our country is becoming more and more unrecognizable to what it was even 6-8 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"enlightening","review":"The broad scope of Phillips' latest work is stunning. The manner in which he draws on historical parallels of earlier global hegemons to the contemporary US is enlightening and even a bit disturbing.

This is the sort of book which will keep you awake at night thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accurate depiction of what's happening to the US","review":"I've read this book twice (from the library) and bought my own copy so I would have access to the information that Kevin Phillips presents. This well-written book is a must read if you want to understand what's going on in the US today.

K Philips brillantly explains(and foresees the current 2007-9 Real Estate bubble and recession)a lot of the troubles America is in now by going back to the past religious,political, and mercantil history of Europe and America. He weaves his facts with statistics,quotes and clever analysis.The recent rise of the religious right,its links to Oil and politics, the rise of the Financial milieux take-over of the US economy, the monstous debt weighing the average American consumer and the merger of the Republican Party with religious fondamentalists and creationists is troubling for a multitude of reasons.

I found that funny because you can tell it was poorly manipulated, LOL. Basically the reviews are spot on with how negative they are about the picture, I'm being nice giving it two stars since it's mainly a B-movie or TV movie quality. Thankfully this movie did not kill Drew's career as she was finally getting her career back on track after years of drug abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, they don't makes these movies anymore","review":"This movie dosne't make any sense.

It's interesting enough to make you wonder what exactly is going on, but cheesey enough towards the end to make you understand exactly why it's played at 3 in the morning. George Newbern is the best feature of the movie, fine acting and seems to be too good for the movie itself. Drew Barrymore,(we all know how much she has improved since \\"Doppelganger\\",and I personally think she is a great actress. That having been said-)leaves so very much to be desired. She has an awkward deliverence of her lines, but most of the fault I suspect lies in the story itself. The movie appears to be getting good by the middle by falls short at the end. Almost as if it was given to two different writers to finish and neither ending was cut.

Don't dispose a precious cent on this movie unless you are a gigantic Drew Barrymore fan and you are merely viewing the movie for the raw sex scenes and constant,random nudity. The storyline could have worked, yet the movie is pathetically low budget, the acting is horrid and the movie falls desperately flat. It is impossible to like this movie unless you are obsessively in love with Drew Barrymore and you want to watch her at her lowest point. It's so bad that I had to come here to vent about it online.

Hmmm, kind of like Pope John Paul II was not a good ally of President Reagan ? John Paul II and his support of Solidarirty was not at all helpful ?

If you believe that fundamentalists are right and Catholics are sadly misguided and bound for Hell, I dare you to read Keating's book, cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"insults your intelligence","review":"I bought this book in hard cover at a Protestant book store and was surprised at the low price. Apparently, they print them cheap in order to get them in the hands of as many people as possible? I started reading it and had to stop--it was so full of lies and inaccuracies--it insulted my intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Polemic","review":"I bought this book because it was given either one or five stars. So I thought it must be very (!) controveral. If you are looking for a scholary insight in catholic theology, you will be at the wrong place. You can get better books on this subject by evanglical scholars. I highly recommend the book of John Armstrong (ed.)\\"Roman Catholicism etc\\". To get catholic theology right read catholic sources and compare it with the evangelical view. If you do this you get some new ideas and possibillities to interpret scripture. Especally if you compare the modern evangelical thoughts with the Early Fathers. There you can see protestant errors, but also catholic errors. For an honest seeker of information this book is too polemical, but it is not as bad as some of the (fundamentalist) catholic rewiewers said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter trash; a look into the heart of Ant-Catholic bigotry","review":"As a biblical scholar of sorts, I thought that I would find some interesting arguments in this book. However, what I actually found was a book FULL of claims with virtually no referencing to sources. This book is such a farse of intellectual trash that it does not warrant reading.The sad fact is that this book tells you less about Roman Catholicism and more about fundamentalist bigotry. His list of Catholic inventions is a ridiculous attempt at scholarly insight and he actually has factual errors in the list. Some dates are totally wrong and other \\"inventions\\" can be seen in practice long before the \\"invention\\" date, even in non-Catholic writing! Mr. Boettner, thank you for retiring. When you eventually pass on, I hope the anti-Catholic sentiment of your work passes with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better name would have been ...","review":"This documentary is actually pretty good, but the title of the piece should probably have been Hubris.com. It focused on a couple of very egocentric guys and how they blew through a lot of money in a very short period of time. This is a good unintential morality play."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want all of my hot shot friends to see this!","review":"This should be required viewing for all business school graduates.

A little narration would have gone a LONG way.I gave it two stars because I thought it made a good dark comedy. These guys are living characatures.Let's be honest about this: $60M ... 18 months. That's $3.33M per MONTH. To go through that kind of money without producing anything of any value takes serious (bad) talent.The co-founder who bailed early was the only smart one in this travesty. The rest of it is just ego-stroking and \\"poor me\\" when things fall apart.Now they are saying that they don't receive any money from this movie. That they're using it as a promo piece for their new business. After seeing THIS ... what idiot would trust these two?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Documentary","review":"This documentary rocks.

Problem is, the two chuckleheads, Kaleil (this guy is self-inflated throughout the whole movie) and Tom couldn't run a toaster let alone a business. Not surprisingly, the whole 'empire' comes crashing down on the both of them. The most work I think they ever did in the movie was film themselves and show everyone how important they thought they were.This is a typical case study of how not to run a business. It is a great behind the scenes of who was running the \\"new economy\\". It will be no surprise to you after watching this movie why the bubble burst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was a big fan of \\"War Room\\" from the same creative team, but this effort is not a worthy sequel. The guys that start the company (govworks.com) seem to be a couple of dopes out of their element from the word go, and all the \\"we aren't a business, we are a family\\" BS was just flat out stupid - no wonder they failed. That aside, what is really lacking in the movie is a narrative that gives the viewer more info on how the company is really doing when the spaghetti hits the fan at various points. We know the business is running into problems, but no real details are provided - just the two guys screaming into their cell phones. Too bad - better organization and background narrative to go along with the human element would have made this a much better documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"You go girl!","review":"I really didn't learn why this company failed or even exactly what they were trying to sell, but with over five scenes of him working out in the gym, I sure got to know how really buff Kaleil is.

I read a few non fiction books on the dot.com bust and thought I knew a thing or two, but when I watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more, I found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from.

This movie sucked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Im sorry","review":"I really don't like to leave bad reviews but this has got to be the worst piece of trash I have ever had the misfortune to listen to.

I have read Shulgins' books and many others. I was really looking forward to this movie when I bought it.This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen.The editing is bizarre and disorienting. The movie does not flow. The movie is basically a collection of video clips, randomly cut and mixed together with no sense of proper timing or coherence. The result is a jarring experience that is hard to watch. I felt it was giving me a headache.Making matters worse, there was no narration or story flow. Some of the clips had no apparent connection to the subject matter.We made it through about half the film before turning it off.Its a shame that such fascinating subject matter was treated with such carelessness.Seriously, this is the worst documentary ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Documentary","review":"Really great film for anyone interested in the Shulgin's work.

Indeed, his writings on the age old complexity of eye dominance for the shotgun user is the most concise I have ever read.As a Brittany owner I found this book especially joyful in that the author really does know the breed...the wonderful little French hunting dog to whom the author refers to as God's Bird Dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy addition to a bird hunters library.","review":"This book is easy reading and brings back memories of years past for an upland game hunter.

For once, I could not put a book (other than a novel!) down! The author kept my interest alive with the excellent use of the language and the ability to keep even sub-sub-sections organized and to the point.I turned to this book because I'm writing an evaluation of Washington State's substance abuse prevention efforts during the last few years, and my boss requested that I analyze it from the perspective of the public health model. I needed a review, and this book provided exactly what I needed.I especially enjoyed the open, honest statements in the preface about how difficult it was to define public health during the author's involvement in establishing the School of Public Health in the University at Albany.

The teacher tells me that the class was much kinder and more understanding of my son's behaviors afterwards.

The plot, or what little there is, is the story of a retarded boy who was burnt to death two years ago at Camp Paradise and has been summoned up from the dead by his sister to kill all her friends, who she felt were responsible for her brother's death. Sound familiar? This film is so incredibly bad that when I watched it with two of my cousins, we cried laughing so hard. This is one of the cheapest (if the not the cheapest) slasher flick of all time. It's the first movie that I've ever seen that has a full grown man screaming like a small toddler girl! Also, why is this movie so incredibly 80's as compared to other slasher movies? Everyone has a mullet or some kind of bad hair, and they all drive the same, beat-up car! Excellent for a stomach-contracting laugh, but terrible for a decent scare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Series","review":"Love this whole series almost as much the Hater trilogy, this one is a little toned down.

The first one was strangely compelling, and I found the second one on sale cheap, but I should have honestly stopped there.There is nothing really scary about these \\"bodies.\\" They are weak and decaying. A few well-placed molotov cocktails applied regularly would have finished this series at book two (or sooner). Presumably the bodies are not reproducing. Eventually, efforts at getting rid of them would pay off.There is nothing scary about this book, that is, except the hypnotic repetitiveness of the narration. If I read one more time the long, drawn-out explanation of why the bodies were amassing near the survivors, I think perhaps I might have turned into a zombie-like creature myself.I remain flabbergasted that so many people appear to have thought this book was worth 4+ stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time!","review":"I just finished the third volume of David Moody's zombie series \\"AUTUMN\\". I must admit to being somewhat excited after reading the 1st book in the series, but ultimately this entire series was a complete disappoinment. Here's why: Somewhere about 3/4 of the way through the 1st book the author makes the disasterous decision to concentrate his book on character development of his \\"still-living\\" characters. That is fine, but unfortunately Moody totally abandons his \\"bread and butter\\" in the book: ZOMBIES! They are completely NON-threatening and really nothing more than topics of conversations for his characters. Can you say: BORING!!!Don't waste your time on this series of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"All over the road on acid","review":"I had a problem with this film. The film is based on short stories by Denis Johnson. The movie should have been more shorts with different characters. The flow of it makes you lose characters you grow accustomed to, the drugged out hospital orderly, the AA woman etc, even the Amish women he is involved with in his own way doesn't really evolve the way it should. There are many classic and memorable scenes to enjoy. The ER scene where the two characters get wacked on hospital drugs then have to deal with an emergency is extremely well done. The rest is a mixed bag, shaken not stirred of drug abuse, death and perhaps redumption. I'm sure the book of the same name is a much more valuable purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concert, Terrible Print","review":"Take a look at the product artwork on the cover - they've even packaged this in a color that will detract attention from the RED wash that is evident in the still pics & that permeates this footage with virtually all other colors missing.I think this might've even been better in B&W.; They've remastered the the sound, but done nothing with the depessing dark RED picture.

They don't appear to take themselve too serious although the music is right on the mark. I have always been more of a fan of the late 70's ELP, but this DVD has swayed me toward their early years. In any event, buy the DVD while you can. The ELP Digest indicates that the DVD was not authorized by ELP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny! (No, really)","review":"No. Really. Most \\"funny\\" books I read, just aren't. David Sedaris is the real thing. This is a deeply pleasurable book about family, life, homosexuality, cultural difference, and the incidental details that pass most of us by but in Sedaris' hands are grist to his humor mill.The finest parts of this memoir/cultural investigation concern his family. And Sedaris is cursed/blessed with a family that is stranger than most. His understated prose is delightful and his self-deprecating humor (he visits Ann Frank's house, suffers real-estate envy, and finds another stick with which to beat himself) saves him from accusations of fatuousness.This book made me laugh out loud and envy the lightness of touch that Sedaris brings to everyday tales of family dysfunction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sedaris","review":"Some of the stories in this book were a bit out of line. For example \\"Blood Work\\" was when a guy calls the wrong cleaning service, mistaking Sedaris's services for an erotic cleaning service. It is disgusting to even think about this obese sweaty man pleasuring himself in the company of Sedaris. My personal favorite story is \\"Six to Eight Black Men\\", basically a collection of interesting facts from all the places Sedaris has visited. For some of their traditions he sees no point in them, and recognizes the opportunity to poke fun. If you're looking for a humorous book, then this would be a good buy. It doesn't get too boring, and has a lot of variety since it has 22 different stories. This is a book that you can pick up 3 months after your first read and still laugh out loud at. Although I may have to warn you; the Sedaris family is far from normal."},{"rating":"2","title":"LoL Comedy","review":"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim was an amazing novel written by David Sedaris. I enjoyed reading this book from cover to cover. The humor was never ending. He took real life stories and told them bluntly with a humor that not many authors can match. The randomness of the novel was what made the novel unique. He talked about the little things in life rather than the big. He told about his family relationships, finding his sexuality, and growing up. The continuous culture shock that is David Sedaris's life was intriguing and hilarious. If you like roll on the floor comedy you will love Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim by David Sedaris.By: Kassie Forman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better","review":"I loved all of his earlier books, but this one struck a particular chord with me. It's not that it was funny -- it was. Hilarious, as usual. It's not that it was personal. Again, as always. It's that an already wonderful writer is improving -- before our very eyes. The ending scene in the parrot-sister story is about the best thing he's ever done. Funny and personal and, dare say, literary. Can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sedaris does it again","review":"Another excellent collection of stories from David Sedaris. Every collection of his reminds me of how funny everyday life can be. Highly recomended for anyone with siblings, travels and has worked a minimum wage job. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining, at best","review":"Not funny. Mildly entertaining, at best. I found myself just wanting to be done with the book already. Sedaris was a genius with \\"Naked.\\" Nothing else he has done compares--and \\"Corduroy and Denim\\" just takes him further away."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no Me Talk Pretty","review":"I loved most of Me Talk Pretty One Day, so after reading that, this has been a disappointment. I actually agree with one reviewer that a lot of the stories are \\"icky.\\" Maybe he's running out of subject matter, and so is straining to find humor in some unpleasant and/or bizarre memories. To call Anne Franks' family's hiding place \\"adorable\\"? Oh, please. I think the only LOL essay in the whole collection is \\"Six to Eight Black Men.\\" Sedaris has been very prolific, so maybe he just needs a long break to refill his creative well."},{"rating":"1","title":"First stories were great but I wound up wishing I hadn't bought the book.","review":"Some excellent stories near the beginning of the book, but there was creepy/questionablecontent toward the end of the book that I guess we were supposed to think was funny?I was left wishing I hadn't bought the book and would not buy from this writer again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Funny","review":"This book made me laugh and laugh. It is short stories primarily about David's life/family. It is a million times better than his other book \\"Holidays on Ice\\". I highly recommend Dress Your Family but stay away from Holidays on Ice. It is aweful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, this one is as good as all the others.","review":"David Sedaris can be heard on NPR pretty often. It's not necessary to hear him in order to enjoy his books. But if you do hear him, you can read his stuff with the sound of his delivery echoing inside your head and laugh even more. A little 'rude' for sensitive folks, but certainly he is one of the best resources of humor in the last century--at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"porn","review":"I do not read porn. I do not want to read porn. The sample provided was of a lovely book. The book has explicit sexual acts graphically explained. I deleted the book off my kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"E>R>","review":"The book is fine. Just a little disappointed with the condition. Seller said it was in good condition, book came and looked like a dog chewed on it. Teeth marks everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the laughs I was expecting","review":"Most of the stories are well written, but most are introspective and not all that funny. I wanted to laugh like I did reading me talk pretty one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Choice","review":"Why is this book on a best-sellers list? I had to literally force myself to finish it, and was gravely disappointed. The writing is poor, filled with metaphors that just don't work. The reviews on the back cover also claim that it is \\"hilarious\\"? I'm sure they didn't actually read the book. So for anyone who wants a good autobiographical book, read Augusten Burroughs, Running With Scissors, Dry, and Magical Thinking; David Sedaris doesn't even compare to Burroughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read if only for the Rooster","review":"Again David Sedaris has written a book that is charming, funny, wry, and points out the frailty of the human condition. That aside, get this book to read about his brother, Paul. Who doesn't want to have a beer with the Rooster? I read to my boyfriend the story about the rooster getting married, and he couldn't stop laughing, and this morning asked the name of the \\"disease\\" Paul acquired when he gained weight, and then proceeded to laugh himself silly as he went to the car. My only disappointment is that I've seen David Sedaris read twice, and some of the stories I had already heard, so it wasn't all new material. Also, the 6-8 black men story is on the Carnegie Hall CD. I was hoping for all new material, because I enjoy it so much! Definitely worth getting. I'd bet a dollar the town near Manchester, NH, he went to is Plymouth, NH, but if I'm wrong, I'd love to be corrected!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weird","review":"I guess I expected humor. Instead, it was a downer. I made it thru about a third of the book and gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing...","review":"How very deceiving the other reviews have been! I wonder if the author or his friends posted them. I read them and bought the book thinking it might offer a humorous side on the everyday life of Americans...I was very disappointed. I could not even smile. Grotesque, in some parts ourtight disgusting...miserly low class American life...at its worst. No wonder the author moved to Paris, although I do not doubt that \\"the city will always follow him\\"... If he has read the Greeks, he will know whom I am referring to....Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the vulgar content","review":"After reading an essay by David Sedaris online and liking it, I checked out this book from the library. I was eagerly anticipating an enjoyable read. Unfortunately, while going through a few of the essays I found them to be-as I see others have pointed out-very vulgar; so I stopped. If it weren't for his inclusion of such lurid sexual and profane content-content that detracts from the author's talent-it's possible I would enjoy his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each better than the other...","review":"My first experience with David Sedaris was \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\" I read it as a part of my book club. I loved it immediately. So next I bought \\"Naked,\\" which somehow surpassed \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" in hilarity! I was at the grocery store when I noticed a copy of \\"Dress Your Family in Denim and Corduroy\\" which I immediately bought. I loved it, loved it, loved it. It's every bit as funny as the others, but with a little bit of poignancy too. It was a fantastic read and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess a lot of people think he's funny... I think he's disturbing!","review":"This book has been on my stack of \\"to read\\" books for ages, and I finally got around to it. He's quirky and sarcastic, but overall I found the essays depressing and disturbing. I didn't find him or his family all that interesting. When he moved toward the more outwardly comedic, he also became more crude. It's certainly not at all flattering to his family or others who find their way into his stories. I'm sorry I bought it - wish I'd just borrowed it from the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time - the well is dry!","review":"Unfortunately, I am one of those readers who feels compelled to finish every book they start. I say unfortunately because I picked up \\"Dress Your Family...\\" and started reading it based on my experience with Mr. Sedaris' other novels. His wanderings through his childhood were less than engaging - possibly because they were no more or less interesting than most of my own. In fact I have a couple of friends with truly exciting childhoods whom I can recommend before he writes his next book. I believe Mr. Sedaris may have squeezed the last ounce of interest out of his family history in previous books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"An honest confession of quirks, neuroses and the little humors of life. I found this book refreshing for the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done Mr. Sedaris","review":"He's a very talented satirist with a bright mind and mastery of the language. He is deserving of his fame. I look forward to more of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I'd love this, but...","review":"Hated it!Sedaris shows us his dark side and his family's dark side and it just isn't funny.The new stuff is a scream for help from a very depressed man. The old stuff is a scream, but I've heard it all before. That's what old means.Finally, it's a hodge-podge.I was so disappointed. Love Sedaris, but hated it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"David Sedaris was a huge disappointment this time around (I quite liked his others). I found nothing remotely amusing. He seemed to ramble on most of his subjects without ever coming to a point. Just senseless babble. His whole family is clearly dysfunctional to the point that it's NOT funny. He needs Prozac the size of a grapefruit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly a Sedaris Best","review":"I absolutely LOVE Sedaris and his latest book did not dissapoint! I've heard a couple of these stories before on his Carnegie Hall CD (which I also recommend) and the other stories accompanying them were just as hilarious and wonderful.Sedaris writes the way every contemporary essayist should. He's hilarious, thought-provoking, clever, honest, and extremely talented.This book is a must-have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of paper.....","review":"I have read Sedaris in Esquire and GQ, specifically, The Rooster at the Hitchin' Post and \\"Put a Lid on It\\", both of which I thought, and still do, to be quite well written and very funny....and this was the reason for purchasing the book. \\"Baby Einstein\\" and \\"Nuit of the Living Dead\\" were really good as well.That said, what the book did for me was make me feel fairly good about myself, even on a bad day. If I was half this ineffective in life, venal and flat out soft, I would have killed myself before reaching puberty. It isn't so much that Sedaris is pitiful, or that one wants to hate him, it is just that his existence seems like a waste....one that is recorded and categorized for history."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEBUNKING THE MYTH","review":"I don't know if Sedaris realized it at the time or not, but just below the surface of his humorous collection of essays in \\"Dress Your Family...\\" is a peek into a disturbing and wholly disfunctional family life. Absent father-figure, over-bearing mother and other elements mentioned within are exactly the sort of things some researchers say is behind homosexuality. It seems as if David himself gives credence to bebunking the widely-accepted myth that homosexuals are \\"born that way\\" rather than being raised that way.Regardless, \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim\\" was a quirky and quick summer read. I found myself laughing out-loud several times. No doubt about it, Sedaris is a gifted wordsmith and I may pick up more of his writings. Still, I can't help but wonder if he isn't trying to use his humorous self-expression as a way of dealing with an inner torment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torturing An Animal Is Not Comedic Material !!!","review":"The final chapter in this book tells a story about Sedaris torturing an animal. Regardless of the circumstances involved, including such material in a comedic work is brutally stupid and insensitive to readers. This alone has turned me from a Sedaris fan to a non-Sedaris fan.Besides that, the rest of the book was rather dull, rambling, often mean-spirited and completely unremarkable. What a let down after reading his previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sedaris is better than this.","review":"I am unequivocally a Sedaris fan, but this book left me wondering if he really has much material left that worthy of being published. The strength of his first 2 or 3 books certainly earned him notoriety and a reputation for tongue-in-cheek prose, but the stories in \\"Corduroy\\" were simply dull and boring.I certainly can't recommend this book. Get \\"Me Talk Pretty..\\" or \\"Naked\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I had to read this book for a book club and it was very difficult to get through. The story was all over the place and it just didn't have a flow and continuity to it. I enjoy Sedaris' work and was shocked that I had such a hard with this book. Try it for yourself and let's discuss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sedaris can be more than merely \\"funny\\"","review":"I found this book to be nothing like Sedaris's previous work. There are funny essays, and I often laughed out loud. The usual crowd will chat about it and list it as \\"one of my all-time favorite books.\\" Beyond that, essays like \\"Who's the Chef\\" and \\"The Girl Next Door\\" seem to me to be the real heavy-hitting ones in the book. I think Sedaris is getting a lot more interesting and complex. I look forward to his next book but am confident that if he continues to be more than just \\"funny\\" his rank on the sales list will drop rapidly. Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance - something many of us can relate to!","review":"As I read \\"Dress Your Family in Cuordoroy and Denim,\\" I found that over and over I was relating to what Sedaris was saying. I could tell that had I been in similar situations, I would be thinking the same things, as bizarre as some of his thoughts are.His writing is superb. His wit is razor-sharp. His anecdotes are wildly entertaining. It wasn't as laugh-out-loud funny as previous works, but I enjoyed it just as much. I feel like I got a better sense of the person David Sedaris instead of the extremely clever comedian David Sedaris."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Heartfelt, Okay, Not Really...","review":"Yeah, this book is a bit more sensitive. In fact, I found myself \\"sighing\\" after a couple of the chapters and thinking, wow that was a really tender moment or the people had some profound self revelations on that one. But most of the chapters are in the same wacky tradition of David Sedaris's earlier work. Secretly, I wanted more insanity though... The poker story with his childhood friends make up for this--it's my favorite one, I fell out of bed laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best Sedaris essays ever, even touching","review":"I first discovered Sedaris with a recommendation here at Amazon(Naked). It was a great book, one of my all time favorites. I've read all of his books and listened to most of the audio CDs, and while they were all solid, \\"Dress Your Family...\\" is his second-best work. Others have commented on the increased \\"ick\\" factor, but I think Sedaris is actually more involving here than in some of his funnier stories. The story of his brother Rooster's wedding is one the best, most hilarious works I've ever read. But he also get serious talking about the strained relationship he has with his most-unconventional sister (and that's pretty out there). I could really relate to what he, and his sister, were going through. He also gets a bit heavy talking about being an openly gay man and how he's always paranoid of molestation accusations. Funny, serious, whatever. No one can write like DS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute hilarity and humility!","review":"David Sedaris' account of various situations and scenarios will have you laughing throughout the entire book! The book is filled with poignant and humorous essays that relay the joy and pain of growing up and living in middle America with family. Filled with great stories, I HIGHLY recommend this read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"This was totally funny, and it was typical Sedaris. \\"Dress Your Family...\\" was all about his family, including entire chapters devoted to each of his siblings and his parents. On one hand, he points out all of his family's quirks with humor, but on the other hand, he sweetly sums it up by saying that is why he loves them. If I were his sister, I don't know how I would react to his totally honest observations. However, I am just a grateful reader that loves his humor. This is definately worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very clever...","review":"I totally enjoyed this Sedaris book than Me Talk Pretty One Day. I felt that as a writer he became more mature and addressed his humor and sarcasm at the right moment, drawing laugh out loud conclusions and hilarious observations. It is so clever to be able to acknowledge your mistakes and way of life and make fun of yourself and Sedaris does amazingly well!The book is a collection of stories from his childhood and his life as a writer. Each story has its own glow and message, reading along you wonder if his family is the reason behind this comedian or that he sees life from a different prospect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Afraid This Might Happen....(2.5 stars)","review":"From great anticipation comes greater disappointment. I don't even think that Sedaris was trying to pull together another set of unbearably funny stories. The settings and characters are certainly familiar, but here they are morbid, tepid, and even a bit contrived. His snaggletoothed humor is almost entirely absent; I didn't even crack a smile. In fact, I found myself cringing a few times. Oy.Will I unhesitatingly read David Sedaris again? Absolutely. I just won't suffer from the wait this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm getting sleepy. . . very sleepy.","review":"Me Talk Pretty One Day was much more interesting. This was a little dry and drawn out. Had to retire it halfway through do to boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing instead of funny","review":"A huge fan has been let down. I found most of the stories sad - pathetic - depressing - and kept getting the creeping feeling that Mr. Sedaris is mining for gold in a place where all the nuggets have already been removed. One HUGE laugh in the chapter about snow in the Carolinas (his name for muddy snowmen); the chapter on his brother's wedding was also hilarious. The rest were odd, creepy, and left me feeling somewhat dirty."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like this kind of crap....","review":"If you think this book is good then \\"Microwave Dreams\\" should have won the Pulitzer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"only got half way thru...","review":"...but couldn't bear to read another word. I've neverread any other Sedaris work, and was a bit disapointedby this book. Too much talk about his sexuality for itto be funny (unless he's trying to use his sexuality ashumor; are we supposed to think the fact that he's gayis funny?? I think not).I left my copy in a hotel room, perhaps the maidthere will see the humor in David's cleaning servicestory - I sure didn't (utterly gross!)I will try Me Talk Pretty...since most people herespeak highly of it. I have heard from other folksthis guy is hilarious...that remains to be seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn it off....PLEASE","review":"This book is simply awful. With the exception of a funny bit about his redneck brother that shows up on disc 4, this is just a sad story of a twisted individual. He goes on about his dyfunctional family, how he has urges to touch little boys on the head, playing strip poker with his naked and unsuspecting pre-pubescent friends, lying to his family, and all sorts of other wierdness. I thought this was supposed to be funny.... instead it just made me sick. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay Man vs. Crazy World-This Book is Bizarre, Disturbing & Not At All Funny!","review":"The only good thing I can say about this book is that it gave me a lot of strange and scary things to ponder. The author rambles for several chapters, then takes the reader along for his silly interpretation of 'family' life. If only the world were like him, he imagines that everything would be okay. Sedaris is flagrantly self-absorbed and immature. A truly disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be an alien","review":"I and my friends have never got this type of writing. Maybe we are aliens, or maybe you have to be from New York or something. It alls seems very unconvincing from a human perspective. No one we know acts or feels this way. It's like a Hollywood movie script where there are no parameters in reality. Surely humor is funny because it is based on actual human experience. Sedaris seems like he made the whole thing up. No one could have a family with this much dysfunction. I don't understand the adulation and even Carnegie Hall readings. As I say, maybe it's a New York thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Sedaris' Funniest Work, but still worth a read","review":"The author's latest work is not his funniest to date(that honor still goes to \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\"), it is however a wry, absurd, laugh out loud look at the bizarre world that is the life of David Sedaris. My favorite by far was \\"Put a Lid on It\\". David's description of his sister's apartment was so funny it left me howling, and the book is worth reading for this story alone. \\"Baby Einstein\\" and \\"Repeat After Me\\" are also priceless in their hilarity. If you love David Sedaris, this work will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great works of nonfiction this year","review":"What more can be said - this was a great read. Sedaris is such a talent"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is disappointing","review":"I had my idependent bookstore rush an order of Dress Your Family. I couldn't wait until I got a copy..NOW, I wish I had waited. It simply doesn't pack the punch of David's other books. Its routine. Its been done before. David is in danger of taking advantage of his many readers. He is clearly talented, but this book simply doesn't take chances. I know he can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like this, but Sedaris might not be likeable.","review":"I have heard David Sedaris on National Public Radio and always really liked his stuff. He's funny and clever, and I was really looking forward reading one of his books.But Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is terrible. Most of the time it feels like he is confessing things he knows are reprehensible, but with a contemptuous adolescent, remorseless tone. It is perverse, really. As the narrator of the book, he says cruel, racist, petty things about just about everyone else he mentions in the book with no trace of humor or irony. I hate to say it, but he seems like just an ugly person.The book made me uncomfortable to read, and at the second reference to how surprised he was at seeing \\"white servants\\", I took it back to the store. There are too many inspiring, challenging books in the world to waste time reading something like this. I can't speak for his other books, and I still like him on NPR, but pass on this one, friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"also disappointed","review":"Received the book as a gift from my mother. I echo the concerns of other disappointed readers. Only \\"6 to 8 Black Men\\" made me laugh out loud. He paints his family in an unusually unflattering light - I grew weary of reading about how much coffee and wine his mother drank. The story about Anne Frank's apartment seemed out of place.Still, I recognize and respect what went into the book, and, like another reviewer, find it provocative. I'm not willing to abandon Sedaris based on one book. And I hope to experience the audio version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Short Story Collection","review":"This is the first book I've read by David Sedaris, and I am stupid for that. He is hilarious. This collection of short stories detail small moments in his life, ranging from childhood to present, all engaging and funny. Watch as his redneck brother applies bacon to his face (the grease holds it on there) in order to fake having huge sideburns shortly before his wedding. Read as his mother gives a dead-on but sometimes brutal running commentary on David's early 20's apartment life, and his dad drags 11 year old David to the most popular guy in school's house to demand payment on dental work done after the popular guy threw rocks at David and messed up his teeth. David always feels like he doesn't belong, doesn't feel comfortable, doesn't know what to say, but really he does all three. Witty, secretly insightful, and amazingly able to zing you with tiny, short sentences and segments that add up to a greater whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, depressing, sometimes funny","review":"I am open minded enough to see where some people would enjoy this. I'm a fan of dark comedy, but I need a little more kindness and a little less indifference and a little more depth and humanity than the Sedaris family exhibits. Fans of the movies \\"Happiness\\"and \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse,\\" would probably enjoy Sedaris. I find him interesting, but depressing. I did laugh hysterically at the 6-8 black men story. That was a big relief after the selfish, sad lives I kept reading about before that story came up about 2/3 of the way into the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"Rehash. A few fun moments, but we've been here before. I wish Sedaris would apply his wit to new material. This just seems like a scheme by publishers to squeeze a few more dollars out of a very profitable franchise. Damn shame. We fans deserved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Sedaris Lost His Touch?","review":"I see that there are some mixed reviews of this new book - 'Corduroy and Denim' and I come down on the critical side. I must qualify this by saying that David Sedaris' other books are the funniest that I have ever read. 'Me Talk Pretty' had me in stitches, belly-laughing the whole time. The new book is more depressing than funny. Also, it seems to me that David has gone from integrating his homosexuality (and sexuality in general) into the stories as a contextual element to using it as graphic focus that is not particularly funny. With that said, I wonder if gay readers find more humor in the more explicit style - maybe I am just not the target audience for this book...Anyhow, I love Sedaris and hope that his next book goes back to the laugh-out-loud style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living in Sedaris' Clothes","review":"Another winner by David Sedaris. I am so enjoying getting to know this writer. In this book, we learn a bit more about his family. His mother sounds like an absolutely fabulous woman, someone I probably would have gotten along with very well. (In the hilarious \\"Let it Snow\\" essay, she efficiently kicks the children out of her house during a snow day, desperate for some peace and quiet. And in \\"The Girl Next Door,\\" she casually mocks her son's correction of her own Chinese menu interpretations. \\"Oh, he speaks Chinese now! Tell me, Charlie Chan, what's the word for six straight hours of vomiting and diarrhea?\\") The details of his siblings' lives are also recounted, and Sedaris guiltily acknowledges his own vulture-like tendencies to turn private family moments into public reading material. Funny, funny, funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just reread and laughed again","review":"I just reread this at my dad's over the holidays and laughed all over again. I think I enjoyed it more the second time around. As many have mentioned, not as many belly laughs in this one compared to his earlier books, but still plenty to smile about."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first time reading Sedaris' work","review":"I didn't know anything about the author or the subject matter for this book when I began reading it. I liked the writing but didn't really laugh for the first third of the book. I guess that's because I identified with his family and the time period he grew up in. Although his family is not normal (whose is?) I didn't think they were outlandish. But as the book progressed I found it very funny and at the end, I was howling. I was reading in bed and was laughing so hard I couldn't even tell my husband what was so funny. I'm now looking forward to reading his other books, it is rare to find someone who can write humor in this way, it's substantial, touching, and funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was under the impression from just about every review of this book, that it was humorous in many ways, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I was WAY off. Its not funny at all, and its more like an autobiography of the difficulties the author had growing up as a homosexual. There were few instances where I could even chuckle at the writting and although I will admit the author has some talent, the book should not be marketed as a funny bunch of essays, it is a straightforward, somewhat depressing, look at a difficult life."},{"rating":"1","title":"a huge disappointment to this fan","review":"I have waited anxiously for any new work from this usually-hilarious author and made the mistake of buying his newest book as soon as it came out. It seems Mr. Sedaris may be going through a midlife crisis as the majority of the stories were very introspective and not at all funny. I was left with a feeling of sadness instead of the usual uplifting I recieve from the view of his unusual family and love lives. I would NOT recommend this to anyone looking for an amusement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical and very very very unique","review":"I had never read something like this before.In my opinion, David Sedaris is a very talented man, he has such a creativity and imagination to narrate things and events in such a brutal, honest and unique way that just make it hilarious.It suprised me how peculiar his family is, and how different they all are from one another. But again, the way he tells the stories are just funny.I do recommend it if you want to get a few laughs out of it. ^_^"},{"rating":"1","title":"You read it in the New Yorker or in a different book.","review":"One of the things I just don't get about David Sedaris is his uncanny ability to recycle. Must be a greek thing.You will have definately read at least half of these stories somewhere else if you are at all familiar with Sedaris.It's resissued, repackaged Sedaris.Me Talk Pretty One Day, is a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"stop smoking and get to work","review":"I am a huge Sedaris fan but was very disappointed in this book. First off, as a fan, I had already read half the stories put together here in magazines. Secondly, they just aren't as funny as his earlier works. Sedaris needs to broaden his horizons or if he insists on sticking to the same subjects over and over, work harder to make the stories funny. It's sad when you see great writers getting lazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here!","review":"I am a HUGE Sedaris fan. Can say he is my favorite author. Have paid to see him speak any chance I can get. This book disappointed me. Not as funny as the others and the only \\"laugh out loud\\" moments I had were reading the two chapters I had already read. \\"The Ship Shape\\" I heard him read over a year ago in Redwood City, CA, and another chapter - Paul's wedding chapter - I had also read somewhere but can't remember where. I was very disappointed. Looks like he's lost his touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, poignant, sweet, bitter...","review":"This latest collection of essays about David Sedaris' life has many laugh-out-loud funny moments, as Me Talk Pretty does. But it also seems to delve deeper. He eloquently relates how he feels about the love of a good man, the way society judges people, the way he judges himself, and the fact that he exposes his family's dark secrets every time he pulls out his notebook.Sedaris' writing is wickedly on-target, all the time. You'll laugh, you'll join with him in making fun of his various targets, but you'll also feel his pain and his joy and the love he has for all the flawed but decent people in his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"Another excellent book by David Sedaris. I couldn't put it down until I finished. Anyone who truly understands his humor could in no way be dissapointed by this book. The hilarious stories of his family give you a more personal look into his life. While the stories are amusing, at the same time you're able to see how much he truly cares for his family--despite all their visible flaws. The humor in his writing is matched by few. Definitely an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest Man In America?","review":"Before heading off to America I wanted to read something entertaining and not so heavy , so I picked up David Sedaris' Dress Your Family In Denim and Corduroy. I think as many as 12 stories had been published n Esquire, GQ, and The New Yorker-so I had read several of them before. However, that did not make them any less funny or enjoyable the second time around. In fact, I enjoyed the collection so much that I basically finished reading it in one day, forcing me to pick another book for the journey. Sedaris never fails to come through with biting, savage, satirical, accurate, and uproariously funny stories. There's a lot to relate to since he writes about families and the petty concerns of the human condition: greed, jealous, envy, pride, vanity, etc...I think there's something that everyone can relate to or at least laugh at."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book had me literally laughing out loud!","review":"I took this book with me to work to read between customers and it had me laughing so hard people passing by were giving me odd looks. This is a great book. I would NOT say it characterizes \\"normal American life\\" -- but what is normal, anyway? (Who knows?)Sedaris is brilliant. I can't wait to read the other books he's written."},{"rating":"2","title":"More craziness from one of today's best autobiographers","review":"I'm a huge fan of David Sedaris. Any writer who makes me almost pee my pants every ten minutes always holds a special place in my heart. So when I saw he was coming out with a new book, I was totally excited.Although he doesn't disappoint when describing his extremely weird idiosyncracies, I found it wasn't as rolling on the floor funny as his previous books. There are moments though. My particular favorite is when he tries to stick his sister in the middle of the road to exact revenge on his mother. You just can't find stuff like this normally!If you have read Sedaris before, definetely buy this (at least to support his smoking habit). If you haven't, then try picking up one of his other books first. Sedaris is borderline insane, and his bluntness is refreshing to say the least. And you thought your family was nuts..."},{"rating":"1","title":"too boring:a bit like watching a family vacation slide show","review":"of people you might not even find so intersting. Maybe I just overdosed on his family stories in the much funnier first two books. I feel his well has run dry. I would classify Sedaris as a writer of Books for people who dont really like reading...Or only like easy stuff but are too hip or think they are too hip to read Bridget Jones type of books. Even Alain de Botton is much more creative..Time would be better and more satisfingly spent by reading Julian Barnes, Michael Cunningham, Anne Tyler, Jane Smiley, and Chekhov's, John Cheever's or John Updikes stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe I expected too much....","review":"Let me start out by saying David Sedaris is one of my favourite writers. I had been anticipating this new book for quite some time, and sadly to say, I was terribly disappointed. Previous efforts ('Naked', 'Me Talk Pretty..' et al) have caused me to laugh out loud in inappropriate places. Often. Even on repeated readings. With the exception of \\"six to eight black men\\" (about christmas in another country) which is very funny, the most I could muster was a smile for about half the essays. Several stories were downright unappealing, Especially \\"chicken in the henhouse\\" and \\"the girl next door\\". Both had an underlying theme relating to fear of being accused of pedophila. Both left me feeling kind of creepy. If this was a first effort, perhaps I would be more forgiving. All in all it's not a bad book. I just expected better. I'm still a fan, for now...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth it!","review":"I was very impressed with this book. Overall, I didn't find it as funny as \\"Me Talk...\\", however, I found that it was more solid. The stories overall seemed tighter. Sedaris has a talent for being blatantly honest and portraying himself with a harsh honesty that would make some people wince. He often portrays himself in a negative way which makes the reader feel an underdog sense of loyalty. My favorite essay in \\"Me Talk...\\" was \\"You Can't Kill The Rooster\\". His \\"Rooster\\" essays in this book did not disappoint! This book really gave you a strong sense of his family. His writing is so relatable that you feel his family could be your own with all the idiosyncrises, drama and humor. You will most definitely enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious garbage","review":"i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages. i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign. i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something. the impression i instantly got was \\"BEEP BEEP! PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY.\\" guess what, mr. sedaris? i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood. millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card. check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh.","review":"I didn't find this book too interesting. It felt like I was reading a random stranger's blog. If that's the type of thing you enjoy, then read *real* blogs - they're free. It's hard to connect with Sedaris, even after reading the short stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Usual David Sedaris","review":"Clearly, he is out of material. The essays in this book can be only a few pages long; that would be forgivable if they were funny. He's lost his edge, I guess. Maybe he should've waited a little longer before he came out with this one. However, all his other books so far are hysterical - especially Holidays on Ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's bland and offensive","review":"I despised the essay/story called \\"Possession\\" and felt that Sedaris has dropped to a disgraceful level of insensitivity. I can't find anything even remotely humorous about the Holocaust. I'm not at all saying he thinks the Holocaust is funny but I don't joke about it like I don't joke about slavery, wars or other examples of man's ability to become sadisic monsters. Who knows, maybe Anne Frank finds it funny from somewhere beyond the grave but I can't. I, too, have been to Anne's secret annex in Amsterdam. It was a place to mourn and a reminder to not be hateful in our own lives. I loved \\"me talk pretty\\" and even liked the quirky, selfish character he portrays himself to be but the stories in this book are bland and that single story made me feel immensely sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"He thinks he's funnier than he is","review":"I used to wonder what all the hype was about. Now I know. Not much. David Sedaris has had a not atypical suburban kid life - he grew up alienated from his parents and family, he went to college and didn't do as well as he might have hoped, he started using and then recreationally selling drugs, he cleaned up his act, and he moved on to bigger things. He's got family members with quirks, and he's gay. And he tells you about them.Before you get this book or any of his others, go get David Rakoff's Fraud. I think Rakoff is superior to Sedaris here - Rakoff is a journalist so his subject matter is intrinsically interesting. Sedaris, if you don't want to hear about his family, or you think he just sounds whiny, you're out of luck. I wasn't bored out of my mind so 2 stars seems appropriate, but that's still 5 hours of my life I'm never getting back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but not quite hilarious","review":"I've never read anything by David Sedaris, but this book was getting a huge amount of play on tv (saw him on David Letterman last night!) and in a lot of magazines. So I bought the book and I wasn't disappointed. The stories of his childhood and life are very funny and brought back memories of my own experiences growing up in the burbs (though my life had nothing on his!). I guess I just expected hilarity due to all the exposure he has been getting. Give it a few hours and it will give you a few laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasingly Funny","review":"This was the first book of David's which I read. It came as a recommendation from a friend. I found myself unable to put it down. Most people will easily relate to the stories of his childhood. I highly recommend this as a first book if you have never had the privilege of experiencing David Sedaris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skillet","review":"Not as heavy as the one it replaced and the diameter is 1/2 is shorter. It is deeper though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size not accurate","review":"Like the others have said, we bought this in hopes of replacing my mom's old Farberware frying pan (loose handle) but when we received it, it was smaller. Deeper but smaller. Had to return it, wish Farberware would not call this their \\"classic\\" since it's obviously not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 10 Inches - Like They Say","review":"I owned a Farberware 10\\" skillet already. It was made years ago and I needed to replace it because of a loose handle that constantly needed tightening. I was very happy to find this product on the internet, with a lid. I could not find a 10\\" skillet with a lid in any store.After my husband opened this present for Christmas, he said it was smaller than our older skillet. I asked, \\"How could that be? I ordered a 10 \\" skillet?\\"We took out the tape measure. This skillet is a full 1/2\\" less in diameter than our older Farberware 10\\" skillet. I guess you cannot trust what is written on the box? Farberware must not care that their quality control (as the merchandise is made overseas), is non-existant?I gave it two stars because I do not like deceptive advertising of a product. It seems well made, but it is NOT 10\\".I've lost faith in what is claimed on packaging. Bummer. I'll probably let Farberware know what I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best frying pan I've ever used!","review":"This pan was part of a set I received when I married 20 years ago. Three kids, multiple moves and thousands of washings later it is still my favorite. Cooks evenly, washes easily without losing the shine. Finally the handle gave out. The pan is in great condition so I'll probably scout around for a replacement handle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"forget calphalon","review":"I purchased calphalon just five years ago and have had enough. It is heavy and must be treated like china. This pan is much better. It cooks fast and is light weight. Best of all, it goes right into the dishwasher. Clean up is SO EASY!! Best purchased of pans I have ever made!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' It!","review":"I can't get enough of these farberware skillets. I love the way they ensure that all food is evenly cooked, and the taste is so much better than food cooked with a non-stick skillet. I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid Size Not Accurately Described!!","review":"The lid on the Farberware Classic 10 inch Frypan does NOT interchange with the lid on the Farberware Vintage 10 inch Frypan. I was planning on being able to interchange the lids on the new Classic Series and the old Vintage Series Frypan because they are both listed as 10 inch, but, it does not interchange--since when is \\"10 inch\\" not really \\"10 Inch\\". The new classic series lid is a smaller diameter than the old vintage series lid. Extremely unhappy about this. Will probably not buy any Farberware products from Amazon again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stainless Steel 10 inch Covered Fry Pan","review":"I have a larger fry pan but, this 10 inch is a perfect size for smaller dishes. I have been so pleased with this pan. It is one beautiful stainless fry pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Availability","review":"I was delighted to find the exact frying pan I was looking for, but couldn't find in the stores. All the Farberware products in stores are covered with teflon or are treated in some other way.

I was expecting some complex sequencing, a little glitch core with drawn out guitars, with perhaps a somber or delicate mood. What I got was one original song surrounded by very poor reduxes of Explosions in the Sky, who also sound like poor reduxes of other bands, who sound like other bands etc. Sorry, but the melodies on this album are already outdated, as much as I appreciate the production value here [it does SOUND great], this album bored me with its seeming complexity once it was revealed to be startlingly simplistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small world Toys Preschool Multiplyer Tables","review":"I thought there would be more light behind the buttons you press for the answers.

Can't even see the correct answers when you push the buttons...My kids haven't touched! Go for the twist and shout instead...They loved that one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to return it.","review":"It is poorly designed. The answer is not clear to see when the button is pushed. Even you can read the answer, it can be easily hidden by the finger. The question (A x B) are painted on top of the button, and it can be easily worn out. I can't believe a product of such a poor design can be put for sale. It is already 2011! I have to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARD TO SEE!!!!","review":"Bought this for my 6yr old for Christmas but never actually gave it to her cause its really hard to see the answer numbers when you push down on one of the buttons.

Anything to give the confidence to excel.

I hope it works. It will if they actually use it. It shows a problem and when you press the key it will give you the answer. The idea is to guess the answer before you push the button. I'm crossing my fingers that it will help and that they will have fun using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Answers are unreadable","review":"I was very disappointed in this toy. I had something like this as a child, but I found that the answers were unreadable on this product. The answers were off center so the numbers appeared behind the equation. Also, they were difficult to read because the plastic was almost TOO opaque. Really, I wish I could get my money back for this, but the return process is a pain when I'm so busy already.I gave this product two stars because although the execution was terrible, the over all durability of the product was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design..Don't buy it","review":"Very poor design..The results are difficult to read as the box is semi transparent.

I had real problems putting the book down because of the drama that was Scotland.This book is a must for history lovers everywhere with romance, murder,wars,backstabbing and man's greed for money above their country.The bruce shows what live was like in Scotland in the early 13th centuary as brutal and short. It is a reminder of what a major achevement Scotland had against hugely overwhelming odds.This man put up with every indignities imagineable, including his sister and wife being caged outside for many years.This is a great read for me as I live near many of places in the book, Melrose Abbey being the main one.I highly reccomend this book to anyone intrested in war and romance novels.

(And as to vocals, Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan and Van Morrison were never exactly considered to be Placido Domingo, either.)Point is that the newbies have to look beyond the American Idolitry gloss they've been brainwashed by in recent years, and just appreciate Neil's genius at writing songs, and his awesome skill at putting them across.As to the spoiled oldsters, no - there will never be another album the same as Harvest - so get over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TOUCHING TRIBUTE TO HIS FATHER","review":"I've only listened to this recording twice so far.

His father had a terminal disease; Neil had planned to take his dad on a trip back to their family homestead in Manitoba before he passed. These songs were written with those thoughts and plans in mind. The album was recorded before they were to leave. Sadly, Neil's dad died before they could do the trip.

Of course there are those that think differently but Neil does what he does and THAT is what makes him who he is. Sure, he's run the gamut of weirdness: TRANS comes to mind, but to me that was really pretty good altho the concert itself was strange. Does one want to relax and reflect on ones life? Then this is the album for you. His voice does crack just a little, but again, he's NEIL YOUNG. Yes I am a HUGE fan 35 plus years I have listened to Neil. Have ALL of his albums/CDs. This one rates at the, if not the, very top of his music. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Reminds me of Silver and Gold and a few other recent releases that some people think are \\"Timeless Classics\\". Greendale was the only worthwhile project from Neil in the last 10 years. It must have sapped his creative juices.Maye we'll never hear the \\"old\\" Neil again, a depressing thought, but if he's going to keep churning out Wal Mart background music, I wish he'd change his name so I won't be tempted again.Didn't some great musician once say \\"Its better to burn out than to fade away?\\" My my, hey hey.My love of Neil Young's music goes back to the early 70's in college and my admiration of him personally will never diminish. But his music has taken a change in direction that I no longer enjoy. Boring, tedious, mind-numbing, sing-song, chose your adjective.

Here, Praire Wind consists of lyrics a 10-year old would write for a school project. Nothing like Neil Young is capable of, and despite the hype that this album has, eventually Praire Wind will settle as one of his worst efforts.Why the album has such hype I can't say. But my guess is that at first blush many of Neil's songs sound the same. And it isn't till multiple listens that the wheat is separated from the chaffe. So, even though Prairie Wind may sound like a classic at first to reviewers, it isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold on just a minute...","review":"This is his softer stuff...and so so so beautiful.Who has the right to put Neil Young down anyway?

Neil recorded all of this shortly after discovering he had an anyeurism and prior to his surgery. So there is also a sense of immortality that weaves it self through the cd. There is not one single bad song.I listened to the whole cd on his web site for weeks before it was released and bought it instantly when it came out.If you liked Comes A Time,Silver&Gold or any of the previous cds mention, you will love this one It simply beats them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prairie Wind Blows","review":"Boy, was I excited for the new Neil Young album, Prairie Wind. I'm a long time Neil fan, and even through rough patches (by which I mean insanity like Trans and Neil and the Shocking Pinks) he's always bounced back with something good.Well, not this time. Coming off his latest rough patch (the Broadway show wanna-be Greendale) he moves right to another.I had high hopes for this album. I love Harvest and Harvest Moon! I bought Prairie Moon as soon as it was released. Damn, what a disappointment. You can hear some good songs in there, struggling to get out - but they're buried under unnecessary strings, horns, and choruses.Produced by Ben Keith, (who also produced Harvest Moon, Comes a Time, American Stars & Bars, and Old Ways). In my opinion he ruined an album that had tons of potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"average filler Album","review":"Neil Young is a Talented Songwriter&Musician,but he has a tendency to release alot of so-so Projects from time to time&this is no exception. the lyrical Content&the overall Musical Feel here is very much on the safe territory that Eric Clapton long ago settled for.it can work for some artists,but it makes some others seem in need of trying to just release whatever as soon as Possible.very run of the mill Album here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Bad","review":"When I bought this Cd I was hoping to hear Neil Young doing what he does best - the liquid, thin voice along with dramatic background music.Unfortunately, the CD is full of loser sounds, the ones you skip over on other CDs. They all sound like \\"filler\\" songs and to me were more irritating that anything. The musicians sound cheap and poorly shosen, and bad. Sorry, but Neil has much more talent than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Neil's Worst","review":"What happened to the Neil we know and love? The one-man, one-guitar, one-harmonica Neil singing intense yet simple lyrics in that shaky yet appropriate voice? Where is the Neil of After the Gold Rush or Tonight's the Night or even Silver and Gold? Where did all the polish come from and why is it necessary? Does this record HAVE to do well at Wal Mart? This might be Neil's worst album ever. It is over produced, over dubbed and over done in almost every regard and in a way contrary to everything Neil has ever said about his music. There's not an interesting or redeeming song in the entire mix, not a tune worth humming, or a riff worth learning. As unbelievable as it might be, this album may be a sign that Neil is done, out of ideas, and no longer relevant. I am a HUGE Neil Young fan and it hurts me to listen to this record. This is not the Neil we know and love and I do not recommend Prairie Wind to anyone not riding in an elevator."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Hash, Less Rehash","review":"This album is lifeless and trite and all the more so when compared to the rest of the albums in his catalog. The hype surrounding this album smacks of the same fawning attempts to honor Dylan now that he has entered his washed-up phase. Like so many other reviewers have stated, buy the old stuff instead, its grittier, more powerful and more substantial-everything that Prairie Wind is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Startling","review":"I am being generous with my two stars, in deference to the man who wrote Harvest.Simply put, Neil needs a lyricist, and perhaps a muse. Listening to this, it seemed Neil looked around at what was clearly in view from his chair-his daughter, his guitar, his memory of the guy who sold him his ranch-came up with a tune and a hook, and then stuck with his first draft. In acting, they call this mailing it in, and Neil mailed these lyrics in-or at least that's the better view to the one that suggests he has become lyric-deaf after all his years.This could've been a four. It just needed some words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil Young Prairie Wind","review":"I was expecting more out of this CD.

The overall impression is of mellow, relaxing music with Neil's pleasant-sounding voice--that is, he's not sounding raunchy, nor screaming, etc., on this CD. Read other reviews for analysis of the lyrics, but if you want a good CD to mellow out with, this is a good pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil scores big, with this masterpiece- Prarie Wind","review":"Mr. Young does a nice job this time with the 10 selections.

Great listening, and the quality of the recording on the dvd is outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Average singer - Great songs","review":"Neil Young has a nasal, sometimes annoying voice. His saving grace is that he writes great songs. This album has several, centred firmly on the Canadian prairie. The style is country rock - tending to the softer end of the spectrum but the lyrics are perceptive, sometimes whimsical and longing, often biting. For example, he describes the joyous scene of a wedding in a church he's previously described as \\"the fallen soldier bell\\". There are elements of nostalgia and undercurrents of bitterness (\\"Somewhere a senator sits in a leather chair ... He takes his money just like all the rest.\\"). There's sweetness and love for both people present and those past. There are many lovely pictures in words.The more I've played this, the more I like it. I have a few albums that I simply can't put away. This is one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre stuff from a great artist","review":"As a huge fan of NY since the late 60s this is a very mediocre album..The painter and This Old Guitar are very fine songs but the balance is sappy stuff with cornball lyrics...now I am a sucker for sentimental songs but all of Neil's imagery is childish and actually boring....he has sustained a brilliant and creative career for nearly 40 years,and his recent Greendale CD was fabulous...but Prairie Wind blows through your ears without leaving much behind....can't help but wonder if this was rushed out for personal reasons....a real downer from my favorite song writer/guitarist/and singer..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writing Set to Tepid Music","review":"I stock Neil Young records in the \\"Must Have\\" category. When I need the right words or the right crank, I put Neil on. That's not to say he puts both of these elements in the same song. He's got enough material to fertilize a cow pasture. Unfortunately musically, that's where most of this album belongs. Also unfortunately this record is being grouped in the Folk Rock genre along with Harvest, Harvest Moon and Comes a Time. This is realy Silver & Gold PtII. There's no semblance of country rock here that other publications are calling it. It just isn't. Tepid Folk music is more like it. The tempos drag as Neil tells his stories. And that's very unfortunate because the writing is superb. Whether it's due to him viewing his own mortality with his brush with death or the passing of his father last year, it doesn't matter. The word smithing is strong. It's too bad the vehicle the words ride on is only firing on a couple of cylinders"},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful, awful album","review":"If Neil had cranked out album's like this throughout his career his name would be linked with lesser singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Jackson Browne instead of Bob Dylan. I know what you are thinking, \\"But he has done albums like this before! What about Harvest, Harvest Moon and Silver and Gold?!?!\\". Sorry, but Prairie Wind is a pale imitation of those albums.The songwriting is weak and the arrangements are often saccharine and overbearing. I can honestly say that I enjoy \\"Landing on Water\\", \\"Arc\\" and \\"Are You Passionate?\\" much more than this album. At least LOW had \\"Hippie Dream\\", Arc took guts and AYP? had a great guitar tone. Prairie Wind just mocks all the good work Neil did wiith an acoustic guitar.If you are a collector it is a must but if you like good Neil Young music pass on this one and get the other acoustic albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a big Neil fan and was disappointed by this album.

The album is one excellent performance followed by another.The music is symphony-like and captivating.I purchased the CD and the \\"Heart of Gold\\" DVD the same day. Subsequent to listening to \\"Prairie Wind\\", I said, \\"Wow!\\". I like the inclusion of the lyrics on the CD jacket. After viewing the DVD, I said, \\"Spectacular!\\".

The addition of walk-on parts for Bob Dylan and Gerald Ford only makes it more unreal. Nor to I need an unbelievable series of disasters, from sink holes to collapsing houses to freeway kidnaps to a Los Angeles firestorm to try to inject some plot into this unfocused story.

I knew it was a made for TV movie, so I wasn't expecting Oscar quality. I realize this is only \\"based on\\" a true story, so they have some artistic license, but they definitely did not capture the mood of the real-life events. It is much more like a mash up of the real event and a 12 year old's pizza party, which I found insulting. We did crack jokes and try to lighten the mood, but that is something you have to do in order to deal with having a gun pointed at you all the time. I blame the direction. All of that aside, the movie was interesting to watch, even as a watered-down version of the events and I think it would be a good conversation starter for parents and their children.

As dead bodies begin to pile up, it appears that a killer is lose amongst them. There are so many plot twists and turns that it's virtually impossible to guess who-done-it until the surprise ending reveals who the killer is, and why they have been gouging out the left eye of the victims. This movie is a rare find.

It plays with your mind and has less \\"shock\\" factor, as normal in films of the horror genere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring movie don't waste your time","review":"Don't bother watching this one unless you are really bored. The movie starts off good and then falls into a very tried formula and doesn't come close to a strong finish. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Tried","review":"TRIANGLE is one of those movies I can take or leave. It tries very hard to be original in plot but ultimately fails to really impress me. The \\"time paradox\\" or \\"time loop\\" is decent enough, but the film really does not scare or move me. I have to lump it into that group of films which I'm not sure I'm glad to have seen or not. I will give the film credit for all the reflection shots of the main character. Seeing her as double or even triple images really foreshadows the film. The acting was reasonably solid for the most part, but the story itself seemed to hopelessly grind on to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This film's only virtue is the cute main character with the shorty shorts. Uninspired story. The only clever thing about it is they were able to make it cheaply by running the same footage, same scenes, over and over as if it's a mind-bender when, in fact, it is an ineffective gimmick for anything other than making a film cheaply. Save your time and don't watch this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"I stuck it out for the entire movie hoping something in how it ended would make it worth watching the same scene play over and over again too many times. This was one of the most boring and meaningless movies I have ever seen. The last part is slightly more informative than the earlier repeats, so if you decide to watch this movie, save yourself and fast forward when the same events start happening a 2nd time, and go to about 10 or 15 minutes from the end and watch from there. You will miss nothing important and maybe you can make sense of it -- I couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"If you are the type of person that wants to feel good about yourself by making up some kind of meaning to this useless movie so that you feel smart, then you might like it. If you are the type of person who enjoys a movie because the writers actually wrote something worthwhile, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of 2009","review":"One of the best films of 2009. Behind AVATAR, STAR TREK and MOON. This is a rare breed of film, almost unlike any other where I had to immediately re-watch the film to fully appreciate and savor all the unexpected twists and turns. Also, the film is a gem for the fact that only at the end does one realize that what you think you have been watching has in fact been a 'trick' and that the story was telling you something else all along. One of the recent reviewers on Amazon stated that he didn't understand what the film was really about. But the clues are all there. The name of the 'ocean liner' that the characters hitch a ride on is worth paying attention to. It ties in directly with the reveal at the end of who or rather 'what' kind of person 'Jess' really is. A work of genius. Must be seen in Widescreen. Blu-ray if possible. I would say more but that would spoil it. Enter the Triangle to see for yourself and be changed forever..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A while","review":"Haven't seen a movie this good in a while. Loved the whole movie.

The acting is good and it does keep you trying to figure out what will ultimately happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Triangle, but Hell","review":"It took me a while to figure out what the movie was about. First of all I found it was too slow and needed more editing. I finally realized that she was in hell and doomed to live the same day over and over again. Still didn't make the movie great and wish it had been a real Bermuda Triangle movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Timecrimes instead","review":"This movie tries to do the same thing that Timecrimes did, by showing what would happen if you got stuck in a time paradox but it doesn't do it as well. If you want to see it done right, see Timecrimes instead. That's a five star film."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WATCH!!!","review":"this is my first amazon review, and i am writing because this movie is horrible!!! i tried to believe all the the positive reviews, but it was awful. i love psychological movies.....but this was just groundhog day with a horrible plot and no ending and leaves you wishing you had watched dora the explorer instead. seriously. i have never reviewed an item and i am telling you i threw aside my laziness just to save you from this movie. everyone who thought it was good has never seen a real film or is crazy!! DO NOT WATCH IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to have no point. Don't waste your time.","review":"Allowing for the possibility that I am just too dense to understand it, this seems as pointless as it is boring. With the same repetitive scenes that make little if any point the first time, any more than the rest. Certainly not plausible, even for fiction, this is bizarre film of a crew that takes a cruise on a small boat, capsizes in the Bermuda Triangle, its passengers rescued by a passenger ship without passengers or crew. One of the woman keeps reappearing, after being killed over and over again, frequently by herself (a double, triple, etc.) I watched this my wife who agreed with this. Even the genre is not clear -- not exactly a horror film; certainly not a mystery, except for the mystery of why it was even made. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked","review":"This movie was so bad. Despite any lack of credibility on my part, take it or leave it, I can't in any form of the word consider this movie the slightest bit original, and at no point riveting. My compatriot and life partner both highly agree that any money spent in purchasing/renting this movie as well as time is very much wasted as if someone stared at a box of quaker oatmeal all day.

It does have a bit of the feeling of \\"The Shining\\" and was creepy yet....well watch it and find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern day Greek tragedy.","review":"Great film. A working knowledge of Sisyphus, Aeolus, and the Odyssey in Greek mythology helps a great deal when watching this film. It's clever. Extremely clever. Perhaps one of the most clever films I've come across.If you are familiar with the mythology, ask yourself if the main character is Odysseus or Sisyphus. It becomes obvious by the end of the film, but the journey is pretty spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaking awesome movie and bluray","review":"This movie is totally awesome.

The movie itself was okay. I don't know if its just me, but I didn't get the ending. I don't wanna spoil it. I had to think about it, but it just didn't make any sense. The peices don't fall together as they should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I found this movie most frustrating and irritating like Groundhog Day - that must be the most awful way to go on and on and on and on... in a bizarre way the movie makers accomplished the task of getting the point across!

The best part of the film was the 30 seconds of CG weather. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and unbelieviable","review":"The plot for this film is completely contrived. The entire plot relies on itself for advancement and framework, and doesn't follow any sort of universal logic or boundaries.If you're a fan of mindless suspense, then you might enjoy this film, but if you expect your movies to provide you with a believable framework, don't bother.The plot to this film is so outlandish and so poorly explained that it made it completely unenjoyable for me.You basically figure out the entire scope of the movie within the first 30 minutes and then just watch what you predict unfold before your eyes in it's painfully contrived and cliche form.Save your time and watch a different movie. This one is not worthy of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie.....if your a \\"Rest Stop\\" fan","review":"While i'm sure this movie has some appeal to a certain crowd it is in the end a frustrating repetition of morbid irony...So enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was the most agonizingly boring movie I've ever seen.

And actually I thought it was an excellent mind twisting plot, very well acted, and very well directed. But that was the problem. Just when I was ready for the 'cycle' to be broken and for the movie to come to conclusion, there wasn't a conclusion! It just started over again. Many folks can overlook the ending and rate this movie highly, but I can't forgive the ending and how unfullfilled I felt after watching the movie. The ending was such a let down and completely ruined the enjoyment of the first part of the movie for me and I felt like I had just wasted an hour and a half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I like the actress and the movie, it slowly revealed what was happening.

Dont let these other reviews ruin the movie. It is genius. Dont ask details about it before hand and dont expect a horror flick and you will love it. Trust me. It is the best movie to come out in a long time and very well bugeted. Please give this film a chance. If you dont like it let me know if thats possible. but like i said i didnt put any details of the actual movie because its best not to know anything about it before you watch Triangle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I was really expecting this to be a dud. But I was pleasantly surprised that this movie turned out to be fairly good. I really wouldn't label it as a horror film though since I associate \\"horror films\\" as slashing graphic violence and excessive amounts of blood. This movie is more of a \\"Twilight Zone\\" than horror. In my opinion this film gets you thinking about the whole loop thing and does the main character ever break the loop. Even though there are plot holes I think that this film is worth a look. I love that the Taxi driver asks the main character \\"You will come back won't you?\\" I think that this is a reference to Sisyphus the son of Aeolus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy as hell","review":"This is a movie that starts off one kind of way with a bog standard cast and a bog standard \\"creepy ship\\" and then goes on to a very different place. Part of the accomplishment of this movie is that it's not based on shock value or on high production. It's based on psychology, and the lead actress carries off the emotional beats perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not watch, this is 2hrs you will never get back","review":"This movie was horrible. If you enjoy crossword puzzles you make like this movie if your intoxicated. But if you just want straight entertainment select something else. I have no problem with a movie challenging me as a viewer, but it repeated the same scenes several times and still did not provide a solution to the main character's problem.

I agree with several other reviewers in that I noticed that the infamous Elizabeth Bathory had her name mutilated by the author as Bathroy and not just a typo! Even though the Bathory issue was NOT a typo, I found several of those as well. Another thing that was in error was with the Susan Smith excerpt...the author states that she drove her children into a river. I live in SC and know for a fact that Susan Smith drove her children into a lake. Horribly written with a lot of the word \\"um\\" in the pages (which I find very irritating) and what appears to be a lot of \\"fluff\\" that just isn't necessary. I am currently reading the book from the prospective that these are just stories and looking at the book that way makes it almost entertaining.....but still not factual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poor execution...","review":"Great concept for a book, but not well executed. Too many typos (Countesss Elizabeth Bathory, the \\"Blood Countess,\\" is listed as having the last name of \\"Bathroy,\\" just as one example), showing that the book was not proofread very well . The author also uses web sites and magazines for sources, many of which have erroneous information about these women.Better research techniques, and a decent editor would have helped immensely. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not factual at all","review":"I read this book and was sorely disappointed. As an avid true crime fan, I was very disappointed. This author had witnesses's names wrong as well as pertinent facts about the case. I knew more than she did about most of the women she wrote about.

Well, it wasn't a page-turner, and the historical backdrop was so far from believable that I had no interest. It was trashy and truly juvenile. Frankly, I'm shocked that so many people have rated this novel highly. If you want a fun, trashy, historical page-turner, try Anne Rice's \\"Cry To Heaven.\\" That was a guilty pleasure which I loved. \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" falls miles short."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst of Historical Novels","review":"This book was the biggest crock of terrible historical fiction I've even had the misfortune to read. A friend lent it to me, knowing of my love for all things Tudor. A waste of paper and time--with each terrible page my blood pressure increased notch by notch. It wasn't even well written! By weaving her mis-information into this story, Ms. Gregory will only keep people whom are unfamiliar with Anne Boleyn's life even more ignorant of the facts. Historical fiction doesn't mean \\"change the story around to whatever you want.\\" I've read some really great historical fiction where the author RESEARCHES the FACTS to try and tell a possible version of the truth. Not so here. So don't waste your money. Why do authors find it necessary to write for the lowest common denominator? It should have no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"No zero stars?","review":"I love books! I buy them, I read them, I have difficulty loaning them out let alone giving them away. This book I will burn, if for no other reason than to spare another who might be tempted by the title (as I was) to expect a readable, historical, novel. I could forgive the historical inaccuracies if Ms Gregory had given some thought as to how they could propel the story, or if the characters were more than cardboard.Too bad there is not a rating below one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst historical fiction I've ever read","review":"I am astonished that this was published...it's truly awful, historically inaccurate. It reads like the author read a couple of books about the period, took notes and then forgot all the facts on record. Anne was the younger sister, for example. There is no record that she ever committed incest with her brother George. The early years at the French court are omitted, which provide an insite as to why the Boleyns began their rise to power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne or Mary?","review":"Who doesn't love a good drama? I mean really? When you're flipping channels and stop on a soap opera, you get sucked in. Even though you say to yourself \\"this is stupid why am I watching this?\\" you keep watching it anyway until the shows over. Thats what this book is like, without the \\"this is stupid why am I reading this?\\" part. Fans of the movie (which sucked by the way) beware the book is about Mary, not the \\"other\\" in the title. I am a giant fan of that time period anyway-history geek- but the book will appeal to none history geeks. The book is Anne Boleyn's story told through Mary-who was the much smarter sister- Anne's best friend and rival. King Henry VIII is married to Katherine a princess of Spain, but he wants the Boleyns. It was fabulous, a page turner. You know those rare books where the story is unique and there's never been anything like it? This is one of them. Instant classic.

It was hard to make myself finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Airplane Read - not for serious readers","review":"There is an unfortunate trend towards the quasi-historical in popular novels today, and some rather terrible books get written in order to cash in on it. The Other Bolyn Girl is one of these books - it could have been better, it could have been *great* - but it was damaged by lack of research, childish writing, and the author's obvious purpose to cater to bored housewives and sex-crazed sorority sisters. If you're looking for serious fictionalized history, this is not the place to get it. You'll be disappointed. But if you need something to read on an 8-hour trans-Atlantic flight, then perhaps it's almost readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"I won't go into detail about what the book is about you will just have to read it.

It was my first experience with Philippa Gregory's work, and now I'm reading *all* of her novels. This is a fantastic transporting in time to an amazing period in history with all the intrigue of the Tudor court, and unforgettable characters. It takes an amazing level of talent to dive into the past, research real historical figures, then bring them to life on the page. Best of all, Gregory's plot twists and turns create real intrigue.

I felt as though I reveling in the King's court."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious book","review":"A friend lent me this book to ready and I couldn't put it down. I am not a historian by any means, I just love to read. I found this fascinating and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. You find yourself being so drawn back in time. I highly recommend it for pure enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a joke","review":"This is just sloppy historical research. Gregory is a good author, I won't deny that but the fact that she sells this tripe as \\"historical fiction\\" is an insult to anyone who even does a surface amount of historical research."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very interesting","review":"This book reads like a romance novel and doesn't have much depth. The characters aren't very well defined and they seem two dimensional. I've read other much better historical novels than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest Book Ever","review":"This book is so bad it's virtually unreadable. Historical inaccuracies aside, this is simply a poorly written book. Please don't waste your money; hire any neighborhood 12 year old and they'll write a better book for you than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic read!","review":"I got this book for Christmas, I wanted it to read more about the Boleyns and King Henry after seeing the movie, 'The Other Boleyn Girl, which I loved. I was NOT disappointed! It is SO well written and you just completely lose yourself into the life of Mary Boleyn, her family, and the King Henry. I could hardly put this book down. It's fascinating how the lives of ladies in the court were in those times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best novel of 2004 (in my opinion)","review":"This book was very good. It told you all about the passion and rivalry between Mary and Anne Boleyn as they fought to bed the king and become queen. This book doesn't have a lot of grusome events described in it, considering its subject. If you like history, you'll want to read this book.But,it has lots of English Lituature, which can take a while to read. It has a lot of passionate and sexy scenes, so it might confuse young readers. I give it 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thanks","review":"For over a year this book has appeared on my screen as a recommendation and no amount of correspondence can get rid of it. I finally decided to buy it and donate it to Goodwill. Then, I thought maybe an honest review would get the thing off my screen. I found a used copy and hated it at less cost. It is not an historical novel, it is a romance in an historical setting - like a Disney cartoon treatment of Pocahontas."},{"rating":"2","title":"History for the Masses","review":"I have long been fascinated by English history and have read various books about monarchs by assorted authors. This was definitely the easiest, and most entertaining read. But be warned..if you're looking for accurate history, this is not the place to turn. Basically, The Other Boleyn Girl is a NOVEL based on a handful of facts on Mary Boleyn. It was written to entertain, not educate. No one knows a whole lot about Mary, but the story is a wonderful tale of finding oneself and true love. My main complaint is the sexual content. Of course, a story about the king's mistress is not going to be completely innocent, but there was a lot of dialogue and descriptions that could have been left out. It's a good story, but a dirty one so be careful who you give this to."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"This is a book to escape into and enjoy until the very last page. When you put it down, you will experience that familiar sense of loss that you get when a great story is finished. It is full of complex characters and family intrigue. The characters are well-crafted and defined; their inner conflict is believable. This is historic romance at its best, and I urge you to spend a few dollars to experience the pleasure of escaping into the inner landscape of a jilted woman in King Henry's court. I give this 4 stars rather than 5 stars because it does not contain the absolute accuracy of that era- but being in the historic romance genre, such authenticity would probably impair the page-turning quality of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a grip people","review":"It is my understanding that this is a work of fiction, based on historical events. As such, it is a wonderful book that left me thinking about the characters and the era for days.It also left me with questions about the historical record such as 'How did the Church of England really form?' and 'Is Mary a historical figure and if so, were two of her children Henry's?' 'What happened to them?' 'How did Elizabeth become Queen?'I will grant you that I am completely ignorant of the subject. However, it is my opinion that this genre should leave you wondering what the truth really is so that you can investigate the history in a non-fiction environment. I fully intend to follow up to learn the facts as they are currently known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"I haven't enjoyed a Henry V III storyline this much since Anne of the Thousand Days! One of Gregory's best in my opinion. Not as much of the mystical as is her norm and I think the book is better for it. Pretty accurate historically too, for a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"I wish I'd read the bad reviews first, because they're all correct. This is a dreadful book, the kind you keep reading because you hope it'll get better. It never did, and now I have lost too much time to Ms. Gregory's desperate attempt at telling a story. Inaccurate, tedious, padded, silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Admittedly, clearly in the minority","review":"I did not like this book at all. In fact, I left it behind in a hotel in Britain hoping that someone else might find it more entertaining than I."},{"rating":"1","title":"soft-core porn masquerading as historical fiction","review":"I see from the other reviews here that I will be in the minority, but this may be the most moronic book I have ever read. If you care anything about history, avoid this book at all costs. Frankly, if you have any self-respect at all, avoid this book. I doubt my opinion will change the Cult of Philippa Gregory, but I feel compelled, by the very awfulness of this book, to speak my mind. It's no more than a jazzed-up Harlequin Romance with a few historical references thrown in for kicks. Absurdity on every page and an insult to anyone of intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to stop reading this trite . . .","review":"Terrible book. The inaccuracies of the book that other reviewers point out don't bother me so much. It is fiction. I am bothered by how the author writes and I felt zero interest in any of the characters. I read about 225 pages and had to stop. I just felt myself getting stupid with every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"I truly enjoyed this book and grieved when I was finished.","review":"This book had the perfect combination of true facts and fiction to keep me interested and excited with every page. It is a TERRIFIC book for a book club. Everyone I know who read it LOVED it. I even gave up napping while my son was sleeping to read!! ENJOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Lost It!!","review":"I lost this book after about the first 50 pages. I think that I did it on purpose. If I want to read fairy tales I will go back to the Brothers Grimm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review Based on the First Few Pages","review":"Maybe I know too much about Tudor England. The author's placing Anne as the eldest sibling bugged me right off the bat, as I'm almost positive most historians see her as the younger sister. Or, maybe I'm too big a fan of the fascinating Anne to buy anything from boring cow Mary's perspective, I don't know. All I know is, I've only read the first few pages and I'm bored and turned off by this book. I should want to read it. I bought it. But somehow, I just can't be bothered. I recently read a book about Frida Khalo written from her jealous sister's perspective, and it was [junk], so maybe it's bad vibes. Either way, this book isn't nearly as interseting as it's title would suggest."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Having Studied History in College and recently watched the film of \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\", i was very impressed with the book and found it hard to put it down, it had very vivid images and one could almost imagine themselves in each scene looking on as the story unfolded. Very enjoyable read and gave a great insight into the the Boleyn's as a family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put it down","review":"This book was picked for our book club to read. First sight of this book and I was thinking \\"Are they crazy?\\" 650+ pages? I work full time, raise a child . .when am I going to have time to read a book like this? I could not put this book down . . I truly ejoyed this book. This was not one of the usual type books I read . . . I wanted the story to continue (yes, after 650+ pages . . ). Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A consuming read","review":"If you love intrigue, romance, and 16th century court, this is a wonderful book to read. I read it using all of my free time for three days (until I was done) and I am planning to read the books that come after. The best thing about this book is that it is not a meaningless tale of romance or mystery - it is based on solid facts in history, and yet is so personal and detailed that it is hard not to become attached to the characters. The story highlights all of the most basic human drives and emotions - lust, love, hunger for power and fortune, hate, jealousy, fear, and loneliness. It is a tale of two women, two sisters, one who will do anything to obtain a place of power, and another who struggles but learns to stay true to her self. It is a tale of many men, some driven by desire for power, some by lust, some by love. It is a tale of one king - Henry VIII - and his development from a selfish child into a tyrant."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est excellent","review":"I picked this book up at random and immediately it appealed to me, cosidering I like reading about the wives of kings in Europe, and Henry VIII's wives are no exceptions. I have read many novels dealing with his wives, and this one, The Other Boleyn Girl is one of the best. It was, for me, a quick read and intriguing. I find it well-written for the most part. Though primarily fiction, much of it is truth and conincides with the facts that I know.I highly reccomend this to anyone who is a fan of the author, Philippa Gregory, with this being one of her better novels and of historical fiction as well. Highly reccomended to anyone else who has an intrest in the wives of the kings of Europe and Henry VIII especially."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Lately I've read/watched so much about the lives of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn that I almost convinced myself that I lived in that time. But more about the book....I LOVED IT! Historical fiction has never been this great. It is entertaining to the core. I read it and couldn't put it down...and more than that I wanted more. It is a long book but I never felt overwhelmed by it...it goes by smoothly. Unlike a lot of historical fiction books that weigh you down with way too much history...Gregory puts in a good mixture of history, facts and exciting fiction.As from what I've read of the movie script ...the book is a million times better. So read this first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Queen's Fool.","review":"My friend at work had read this book and loved it so I read it even though I didn't like Queens Fool. I'm real glad I did because this book was absolutely wonderful! I've always been interested in history but I find historical fictions hard to read because they are either too overloaded with facts or are so completely modernized that you almost forget that you are reading a historical fiction. This novel is a fast and easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling!","review":"I don't usually read historical fiction, but this book has inspired me to give the genre another try! It is like a romantic thriller but more fascinating because it is based on historical events. The book is hard to put down and I got very little else accomplished once I started it. It was a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience and I am recommending it to all of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boleyns - Better than any Prime Time Drama Story Line!","review":"I have never read historical fiction so I borrowed The Other Boleyn Girl when it came recommended by a good friend. I was a little wary at first but, wow! You will not be able to put this down! Phillipa Gregory embraces Mary's character (the other Boleyn sister) and brings her to life. Gregory brings emotion and details to the story that are better than any prime time story line.I am very curious to read more from Gregory. If you are a frequent reader of historical fiction or Phillipa Gregory, I would love any recommendations. Please comment.The Other Boleyn Girl is a great book to curl up in bed with. You will be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"OOoo La La!","review":"This book reminded me of a cross between a Danielle Steele novel and a Harlequin romance. I didn't want to like it, but must admit I did. I am not sure how historically accurate it is, but I AM sure that it is entertaining. Seduction, innocence, dark secrets, chastity, evilness and even incest all in one book."},{"rating":"1","title":"With so many BETTER books about the Tudor court...","review":"With so many BETTER books about the Tudor court available, why bother to read this flighty one that reads more like a cheap romance novel than historical fiction? The dialog is insipid; I don't need the characters to speak in authentic period dialog, but I do need them to sound like the intelligent and well educated courtiers they were. I haven't read any of Gregory's other work, but after starting with this book I won't be back. The best thing about the book is that it reads quickly and is over fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at first, but then.....","review":"Like many others who have read this book, I've been fascinated by the Tudor era and have read quite a lot about it. I enjoyed the idea of a story written from the perspective of the sister and it was interesting up to a point, but then....Anne Boleyn is portrayed as such a hideous harridan that it's almost unbelievable that Henry VIII would have put up with her. Philippa Gregory has also taken every single accusation and rumor thrown at Anne during her trial (when her enemies were hell bent on character assassination) and uses them all as fact. (brief spoiler), When Anne essentially gives birth to Rosemary's Baby/Eraserhead I actually laughed out loud.A good attempt, but ultimately this book disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buff King Hal","review":"There is nothing like being able to tell oneself how virtuous and intellectual one is being by reading historical fiction, whilst enjoying a mildly pornographic novel. Or not enjoying it. This reader prefers historical fiction to concentrate more on the politics and society, and less on graphic descriptions of king Henry VIII's sexual preferences. Or at least to include a warning that a period of great religious change and debate will be happening outside the bedroom door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased Customer","review":"Book came in great condition--as advertised.

I highly reccommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored Out of My Gourd","review":"This was all plots and plans and no action. While it might have pictured what life was actually like in the Boleyn/Howard family, there was no action to it -- and I know that \\"plots and plans\\" can actually make a decent book, because \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" proves it!Thankfully, I didn't buy this book alone (I bought it at the same time I bought \\"The Queen's Fool\\"), or I would've discounted Ms. Gregory as a truly boring author altogether. Hopefully, this book was just a fluke and her others (like \\"The Constant Princess\\" and \\"The Virgin's Lover\\") are just as good as \\"The Queen's Fool\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book is a NOVEL and none of it is factual. I am British and brought up / educated in Britain and spent years on English history and believe me this is fantasy masquerading as fact. It will make the author pleny money and leave American readers believing this drivel. If you really want to know the facts then read a history book.The Other Boleyn Girl (Movie Tie-In)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"This book was a disappointing read. I found it to be historically inaccurate- The Duke of Buckingham was not a close relative to the Boleyns, Mary spent time in The French Court and was a minor mistress to Francis I. She married Carey while she was Henry's mistress. Anne was the younger sister, but was not fifteen when she came to the English court; she was probably closer to 20 and was a maid of honor tho Henry's siter Mary, the Dowager Queen of France. It's almost like reading the People or Us version of Tudor history. I've tried to read a few of Ms. Gregory's novels and I have not enjoyed them. If you want a good read about Anne Boleyn, read Eric Ives'wonderful biography or some of Alison Weir's works.(Even though she is not very sympathetic to Anne.) The truth is much more interesting than the fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little accurate, less historical","review":"\\"This book has little historical fact other than there was a Henry VIII and and Anne Boleyn. They didn't even get the Boleyn children in the right order. It worries me that so many people will have such an inaccurate opinion of history because of this novel that pretends to be historical\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful Historical Romance","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl is overlong, filled with tedious and unnecessary descriptions of Henry VIII-era women's clothing, barely touches on the genuine religious background for the novel (indeed makes it seem that the principal reason for the break between England and the Church of Rome was because of the machinations of the Boleyns) and despite the title is more about Anne Boleyn and Henry than the Mary of the title. The narrative is simply heavy-handed. Mary seems to be everywhere anything important is happening or manages by chance to overhear important information or picks it up via weakly developed exposition. It's supposed to be a historical romance, but there's precious little genuine history and and not a lot of romance. Oh . . . and the ending takes 700-plus pages to get to, but it's all telegraphed by page 350 or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"What more can I say?","review":"Everything I feel about this book has already been said. It is slow moving and riddled with historical inaccuracies. I can forgive the boring writing style, because it is not my type of book. The incorrect facts, however, are harder to ignore. There are very few facts known about Mary Bolyen it shouldn't be too hard to keep them straight. That being said, if the story interests you, read it merely as a work of fiction. Then, get some Alison Weir for the history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Storyline","review":"The Other Boleyn Girl was a favorite of mine to read because it not only provided me with rich historical references, it was a great storyline told from the point of view of a woman who was not held in the limelight. Rather, Mary Boleyn was an unassuming girl, trying to find her way in the courts of high society, used as a pawn by her parents. It was remarkable seeing the story through the eyes of a bystander.I enjoyed the rich themes of love and loyalty, the contrast between deceit and honor. It made for a thorough read, an interesting tale. The love between the siblings is juxtaposed with their simultaneous violent rivalry. Amidst the brutality, this tale is a story about ambition. Ambition for the Boleyn family in the time of King Henry's court.Read if you love historical fiction. The story gets lengthy and somewhat repetitive towards the middle, but is still an amazing novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I found this book so entertaining. It had the perfect mix of intrigue and historical details. Some historical fiction I've read tends to weigh you down with so many facts and names that the story is lost, but not so here. I felt the writer did a wonderful job of giving the events while sit keeping me totally engrossed in the story. It was one of those that keeps you turning pages into the wee hours of the night - definitely a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Load of Royal Rubbish!","review":"It wasn't the historical background that irritated me, that was quite well researched and believable in its rendering of daily life in Tudor England. What bugged the crap out of me was the characters and their motivations. The overall tone of this book was that of a particularly bad romance novel. Henry VIII's most dominant trait was selfishness, both as a King and a man, and yet here we see him portrayed as a tender and devoted lover. I was near to gagging before I was half way through this book. It takes an awfully bad book to make me not finish it, but I came close to launching this one out the window. It went to the book exchange so fast that Phillippa Gregory's head is probably still spinning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much bedroom descriptions","review":"I've read other books by Phillipa Gregory and like them, but I was very disappointed in this one. I love British history but this one contained too much focus on the sexual explorations of the main characters. Okay, I know Mary Boleyn had affairs, but I honestly don't need to read about how the king excites her nor about she and William sneak off every chance they can to have sex all night long. I don't need to hear descriptions of sexual intimacy that includes everything but \\"doing the deed.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave a complete new meaning to the term literary license.","review":"I read this book at the behest of a friend. She said it was wonderful, and how she could not put it down. I could not put it down either, but that is just because I wanted to finish it as fast as I could to end up the torture. I found the fictional part all over, but in it's 672 pages the only historical part I was able to find were some names of people and places. I have read several books about Tudor England, and I would love to know where she got her sources, since she seems to be the only person to have come up with this theory. I wonder why!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, not necessarily educational","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" - I thought it was fast-paced and interesting, I enjoyed the plot line and the characters, and I like Gregory's writing style. That being said - I liked this book for its entertainment value, not for its historical accuracy. While it's not that the book is wildly inaccurate, its also just not the most reliable fiction book out there in terms of what happened to Anne Boleyn and what kind of person Mary Boleyn was. Read this book if you want something to entertain, interest and amuse you, if you want to learn about Henry VIII and his court, read Alison Weir."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Twist on the Boleyn Legacy","review":"This book is the opposite of what is usually told about Mary Boleyn.

I have never before experienced an abridgement that left out so much important information and that was this choppy. Although the reader is quite good, I can't recommend this form of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"The other Boleyn girl is a wonderful book because of the glimpse it gives you of history you never thought about. when you look at the known history afterwards, it is indeed an interesting question: why didn't henry marry the girl who had already proven fertile? Mary had already given him a son, because writings of the time tell us of little Henry Carey who bore such a strong resemblance to King Henry when he grew up.It's an interesting book with many layers in it, there are so many beautifully described feelings and emotions in all the characters, you can read it again and again and always find something new in it. the rivalry of the two sisters is portrayed in an exciting way, all the time you know they must love each other and it's interesting to see how ambition can drive people so far apart from each other and from themselves.in the end, it's just a lovely story, really a book to read in one go."},{"rating":"2","title":"English History is So Appealing","review":"There is nothing quite like a true inside look into the chambers of British Monarchy.I found myself getting swept in the dark, dank castles where Phillipa Gregory sat,watched and wrote her novel while Anne Boleyn made her manipulative moves to ensnare the infamous King Henry VIII.I became so totally engrossed in this authentically written piece of literature that I often lost track of the fact that I really lived in 21st Century America.Phillipa Gregory is a master of her craft, may she continue to write so beautifully.-Yvonne Bornstein, Author, Eleven Days of Hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't say more than what has already been said...","review":"Suffice it to say this was a great book, a captivating read.

I love any story of King Henry VIII of England, and find the book very interesting. I decided to buy a used one since I prefer to save environment and this book is pretty fat. The quality of the second hand book satisfied me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this one it is great!!","review":"I read a lot and was looking for something a little different when I picked this up at the bookstore. I do not usually read historical fiction. But I thought I should try something different and I am so glad I did. This book is well written and the characters are developed very well. I began to identify with the Characters and became very involved in the story. It is true that historically it may not be the most acurate but to those who are so critical of that let me remind you this is FICTION. YOu may want to try something nonficiton or biographical if you are looking for straight history.This book is a big book and may seem intimidating but it is not, I found it to be an easy read and I found myself up late at night trying to finish it. When I did finish it I was sorry it was over but so glad I had read it. I am now a huge Philippa Gregory fan and have already started another Of her books \\"Wildacre\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in a long time!","review":"This is a wonderful book revealing the way of life in England in the Middle Ages. The little known Mary Boleyn telling the story of her family and her sister Anne as queen of England gives insite previously unknown. This is actually as romance novel, but it gives a real feel for the subordination of women during the time of Henry VIII. It made me want to learn more about Henry's other wives. A great quick read even though it's over 600 pages. I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprises with every turn of the page!","review":"I was captivated by this book. Philipa Gregory created an amazing picture of Anne Boleyn. I was shocked and surprised by so many of the events in the story. I loved it and can't wait to read another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Fun","review":"I read this book as a sort of break from the 'heavier' reading I usually gravitate toward, and I found it immensely enjoyable. There is nothing particularly poetic or soul-stirring about the writing itself, but the storyline is fast-paced and intriguing; it took me less than 24 hours to get through these 600 pages.From a woman's perspective, it is truly startling to see the role that women were forced to play at this point in history; even the so-called 'fortunate' women of society were nothing more than pawns for power, or the playthings of men. Anne Boleyn is absolutely tyrannical in her own ambition, lacking any sense of inner morality, which makes her repulsive. Yet she and Mary each have the strength, in their own ways, to take charge of their own destinies.The book's conclusion definitely left me with a haunted feeling. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone looking for an interesting, quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"This book was a real page turner. Historically accurate. And entertaining at the same time. I have become a fan of P. Gregory's as a result. Can't wait to read \\"The Virgin's Lover\\".It opens up the world of the English court of Henry VIII, and lets us experience the day to day dealings of being a courtier.

The books are thick but the pages turn very quickly, a wonderful historic fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a historically based pleasure-read","review":"This is one of those fastpaced \\"can't put it down\\" novels. I have heard several people complain about the historical inaccuracies within the novel.

It's a great read and you find yourself so caught up in it that you won't want to put it down or do anything else until it's finished. Then, you'll find yourself thinking about it day and night and wishing that the author would write a sequel, exploring the generations to come!The Other Boleyn Girl gives an entirely new and surprising peek into the lives of the Tudors in England. Anglophiles will love the book for it's modern-day slant on the historical record, and history-phobics will also love it because of the author's ability to convey fantastic visual images without bogging the reader down into unnecessary details. The 600+ pages will fly by so quickly that it feels like reading a book half it's size."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, so very bad","review":"I had just finished reading \\"The Autobiography of Henry VIII: With Notes By His Fool, Will Somers\\" by Margaret George and was interested in learning more about about that time. A group of acquaintances heartily & gushingly recommended \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\".Fortunately, my copy came from a thrift store, because I cannot finish it. I'm not even at page 75 yet and I'm seriously hating it. The most eye-rolling passage for me was Mary's description of her stay at her family's country estate all by herself (with the exception of the servants), and her discussions with local farmers, plus the story about how she secured seed for a crop for some of them. Please.If Ms. Gregory is the feminist she claims to be, she would do well to write more accurately about history and and less sensationally. The truth is usually much more interesting anyway.I'll be combing these 1 and 2 star reviews for recommendations of better accounts of the time and of Anne Boleyn."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding look into history","review":"\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is a fascinating and enthrawling book.

This book not only gave you a look into the life of Anne Boleyn and her family, but a look at Henry VIII and the people of the court, amazingly filled with beauty, laughter, love and manipulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL","review":"Marvelous, fresh version of the Anne Boleyn episode of history, narrated by her younger sister, Mary. I found myself totally caught up in the story, even though I've read and seen many versions of the tale of Mary's sister Anne, Henry the VIII's second wife. I had a difficult time putting the book down and could not wait to get back to it. The times and lifestyles are so clearly dileneated that I felt part of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a GREAT book!!","review":"After being sooooo disappointed by \\"The Fiery Cross\\" by Gabaldon, I was looking for a new author to try out. And I must say that this is what I was looking for. It does have some historical inaccuracies, but it is FICTION. The plot was great and the characters were really well done. It read so fast that I was done with the book in 4 days, SIGH. My best compliment that I can give the author is that I am now looking at the library for her older books...."},{"rating":"1","title":"CODSWALLOP","review":"There's only one thing worse than this book - and that's the television programme that was made from it. Don't know if it's been screened in the US yet but believe me, it was truly terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Although the author uses overused descriptions of sexual desire and at times the novel is suggestive of a tabloid romance, this is a fascinating fictionalized history. It graphically portrays the repressed role of women during the reign of Henry VIII, and brings that entire era into colorful 3-D. I read all 660 pages in one week and could barely put it down to go to work. This was my first book by this author and it has spurred me on to read others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get lost in the past......","review":"I LOVED this book! I don't really like reading historical novels, but this book was amazing. I could not put it down and would read well into the night because I could not get enough. The author does such a wonderful job with the characters, you feel sorry for Mary and how horrible her family was to her, but at the same time, you quickly begin to despise Anne and how awful a woman she was, especially to her sister. I found myself surfing the internet reading up on Henry VIII because I didnt know much about that time in history. Before reading this book, I would never have been that interested in the English monarchy. If I could rate this book a 10 I would. I would rank this up there with \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\". Buy this book, you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable","review":"\\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is a delightful and entertaining historical romance, that explores the life of Mary Boleyn as well as her more famous sister, Anne. It does not seem like Philippa Gregory did extensive research, as the book was rather short on description of life in the Tudor era. But the characters and their relationships were interesting, and kept me turning the pages until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME book! could not put it down","review":"For starters I am legally blind, so if I read for to long I get aweful head aches. But while was on a trip I saw this book ,and the cover attracted me to it. I read the jacket, and had to buy it. I really could not put it down. When I finished last night I wished the story would have continued. Have since bought \\"The Queens Fool\\" and \\"The Virgins Lover\\" I hope they are as good. I have not been so into a book since \\" Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\\" by Gregory Maguire"},{"rating":"1","title":"not your feel-good romance, prepare for some disturbing behavior","review":"I devoured this book in two days. The author's writing style compels you to keep turning pages...you have to find out what (usually awful) It is kind of like seeing roadkill, you want to look away, but you just have to find out what the heck that thing was... I found the book to be somewhat disturbing in several parts. When I got done, I felt satisfaction at being finished with it, but unable to really recommend it to anyone in that it really was depressing to follow all the characters through bad choices and the farce of their lives. I think the author is a very talented writer - but I didn't care for the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Read!","review":"I never had much interest in historical fiction, the Boleyns, or royalty for that matter, until I read The Other Boleyn Girl. I was engrossed from the beginning. Philippa Gregory made me feel like the third Boleyn sister living at court with them. I liked that some of her prose were 21st century because it added spice to the book. It may not be historically accurate, but who cares? This is fiction, afterall. There are plenty of history books out there if you want to read accurate accounts. Overall, this book was hefty and satisfying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We are sisters, and therefore born to be rivals.","review":"Very long, but I finished it in a day because it was so enthralling. Can't wait to see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"Thought I have never read much historical fiction, I found this book to be absolutley engrossing. I find myself absolutley fascinated by the scandalous monarchy in a way I never knew. I finished this book within days of picking it up - it's a good read, through and through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary at Anne's expense","review":"Judging from other reviews, this book seems to fall into either the \\"love it or hate it\\" category. As an ardent Anne fan I was naturally disappointed in it but I can understand why others were not. It is a good plot read and gives a new spin on what is ultimately the story of Anne rather than Mary Boleyn. However, I also noted a lot of historical mistakes - the least of which was a complete omission of Mary's scandalous past in France - and the writing style was just left of bad romance novel. I recommend a much earlier Anne book called \\"Brief Gaudy Hour\\" by Margaret Campbell Barnes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised by other positive reviews","review":"I must say that I am really surprised with the overwhelming positive reviews of this book. I am an avid reader, particularly of historical fiction. This novel felt like a Harlequin Romance novel to me. While I did not learn much about the time period in which it was set, I did learn quite a bit about how to seduce my husband! So, depending on your interests..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustingly Inaccurate","review":"Gregory does admittedly have a wonderful writing style, which is what first attracted me to the book. The topic: Queen Elizabeth's mother. As I'm an avid reader of anything relating to Queen Elizabeht, I thought this book was a perfect find. Alas, the enchanting writing style of the first few pages falls flat when the historical inaccuracies can no longer be ignored. If you don't care what really happened FINE, but remember that this book and all the events are NOT what happened. If you enjoy historical novel at all, this book is not for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly sleep inducing.","review":"I just don't see what the big deal is. I received this book as a gift and sat down to read it one night. It nearly put me to sleep so I set it aside and decided to come back to it the next day. Same thing happened. The story is slow moving and I found myself skipping ahead to see if it got better. It didn't. I would not suggest this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really fell short","review":"I read this book several months after reading Pillars Of The Earth by Ken Follett. I usually do not read books of this period but decided to because I Ken's book was so wonderful from the first page to the last.The Other Boelyn Girl added some baser realities of that era, but I found most of it to be mostly raw rather than rich with history and colorful characters that you could connect with."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring...","review":"i found this book disappointing... after reading a comment about it being historically inaccurate, i realize that i agree-but not for the reason you might think....when i wasnt even halfway done with the book i read a cool fact ruining the story... the fact stated that Anne was Henrys wife. it also stated that Anne had an extra finger on her left hand, something not mentioned in the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle price higher than paperback?","review":"I'd love to read the book but I'm not paying $7.99 for delivery to my $300 Kindle when it's available in paperback for $6.40."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hahhhaaa!","review":"Yay! I have never read this book, but I'm reading the Queen's Fool. And guess what? I just found out that Mary Boleyn is my great-grandmother. YAY!!! Excitement for my boring life! I actually look like her (no, it's actually hard to tell from the sketchy portraits). Anybody that says Mary is stupid is stupid (okay so maybe she was I don't know but who cares?) I'm related to her! I just had to write this!!!!! This also means that I have some of the Boleyn blood, which means I have some blood of Anne (boo!hiss!), and some blood of Queen Elizabeth (hmmm, yay! boo!) but sadly none of Mary Tudors \\"Bloody Mary\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing is an Understatement","review":"If you're looking for well developed characters, thoughtful dialogue, or intellectual stimulation, don't pick up this book. The Tudor period is fascinating and offers all you need for a gripping plot. The story itself is quite intriguing when written about by others. Despite hearing rave reviews, I found Philippa Gregory's prose to be poorly constructed and incredibly irritating. I wasn't bothered by the historical inaccuracies; after all, it is a \\"novel\\" and many of the facts are debatable.If you want a long read on par with a Harlequin Romance (actually, those are better), then this would be a perfect fit. I would have given \\"0\\" stars if I could have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it despite the inaccuracies","review":"This is the first book I read from Gregory. I liked it very much, it is definetely a page-turner.It left me wanting to read more about the Boleyns.Despite that, the next book I choose will be from someone who's more accurate in the facts.As so many of you have pointed out, the book has many inaccuracies. I know this is a \\"historical-fiction\\" book and gives the author liberty but I think she took a lot of it.Why did Gregory said Mary was younger than Anne? I don't see why she did not left this as it was.I could keep on with inaccuracies but then again, so many people have already did it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Phillippa Gregory is one of my favourite authors when it comes to historical fiction, and she lived up to my expectations in this book too, I didnt know much about Henry VIII and the tudor period before I read this book, and I feel like I got a bigger knowledge now about that time. I like when books can make me feel something like happiness, anger, sadness etc. and this book managed to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Club Picks","review":"I would put this novel up there in my top two or three picks. If you really want an interesting view of King Henry the Eighth and his wives from a new perspective, read this book. It hooks you right away and never lets up. I didn't want to do anything but read till I finished the story, and the details are still so fresh in my head even though I read the book two years ago.The movie was surprisingly well done, though, understandably, much was left out. The character of the mother was also different.I highly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical fiction novel","review":"A real page turner! I had a hard time putting it down. One never knows what to expect. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Page Turner","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It was very in depth and made me question the bonds of loyalty and family and the choices we must make in our lives. Shows how different things used to be. Kept my attention the whole time and I loved all the surprises along the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"Another great novel by Philippa Gregory. She tells the story of Ann Boleyn with a different perspective and includes english history with knowledge and interest. I had just recently purchased one of her books at the bookstore and was hooked. I now have ordered 9 of her books from Amazon.com. Great stuff if you like historical novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"The books was wonderful. I read the book in two sittings, and did not want the book to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gregory book!!!","review":"I was engrossed page by page with the story, King Henry and his relationships with Mary Bolyn, then Anne, then Jane Seymore. I was totally fascinated by the lifestyle of the courts, and how the boleyn family probably lived...Totally fascinating and best book of her series!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Read!","review":"This was one of those stay up late to read type books. I picked this book because the description on the back flap sounded interesting, not because I wanted learn about Tudor England or any other historical facts related to this period. I read this as I would read any other fiction, which by the way is a class of literature comprising works of \\"imaginative narration\\". After some reviews on this site, did I realize that not everything in this book is accounted for and can be proven, such as birth order of Boleyn girls, etc. Those quetsions didn't bother me only because I was reading this book for entertainment purposes, not for historical accuracy. I do have a newfound interest in this period of time in England and will look into more non-fiction works to get more factual information.I would recommend this if you want to a read an intruiging historical FICTION."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"I could not put this book down! Since I read this book, I have purchased several other of Philippa Gregory's Tudor books, The Constant Princess, The Boleyn Inheritance and now The Queen's Fool. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history with a twist. Read it before the movie comes out in Feb.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical fiction with a new twist","review":"This book kept me riveted even though it is a long book; I didn't want to stop reading it. It certainly made the reign of King Henry VIII interesting! It also points out the sad fate of women in those days. But the main character, Mary Bolyn overcomes her fate by following her heart. This has been my favorite book this year, full of love, sex and ambition., and it is based on a true story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"This book was on the lists for must read for summer, I was not sure about it and I am not into historical fiction until I read this book. I picked that for my book club and I read it in a week, my copy is 820 pages. I loved it, so did my partner at my book club. I learned about Tudors era and enjoyed the Mary and Anne's story.Excellent book, looking forward to read another book of the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping!","review":"I was enthralled immediately and absorbed through out the book. It's a fascinating, well told story which was even more interesting because it's historically accurate. I read a lot and haven't read a book I liked this much in a long time. It's just a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this RUBBISH get published?","review":"Was Gregory on drugs when she wrote this novel? Because thats what it seems like! This book was a big let-down. I bought it expecting a book about Anne and Mary Boleyn, not some evil witch and a snivveling brat. How can someone give this trash FIVE STARS?! Save yourself some money and leave this book on the shelf. Buy the Weekly World News instead. It's more accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"a cheap trashy romance novel","review":"My friend gave me this book since she knew I liked historical novels. Let's get one thing straight. This is a fictional account on some historical and empirical facts. So with that in mind, this book is nothing else but a harlequin romance novel. If you enjoy this genre, then you will like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does everyone blame Anne Boleyn?","review":"Creating Anne Boleyn as the caricature of a mean spirited, ambitious and conniving woman perpetuates the myth that women are the downfall of men. It shows how Anne Boleyn is the temptation and how Henry VIII took the bait. In order to marry Anne, the King decides to renounce the Papacy and form his own Church.This book also doesn't do much in terms of any feminist interpretation of the Boleyn sisters. Gregory reinforces how the good and virtuous Mary ends up well taken care of and lives the life she always wanted by being patient, caring and loyal. On the other hand, Anne ends up beheaded because of her ambitions to be in a position of power. Is Gregory saying that all women who strive to be in a position of power are evil and conniving?I found this book to be in very poor taste. It was historically inaccurate and degrades women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't history be somewhat correct?","review":"I only have to say this, historical facts can be correct, and still have good or even better fiction. Anya Seton proved that, with Katherine. Fact it seems, as in Elizabeth 1, if studied, is far far more interesting than any fiction made to soup up a book or even film. Philipa Gregory blurs truth and makes it sad, for I rate the book as well as the movie next to nothing.J. Schossow"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap romance posing as historical fiction","review":"Clearly, I'm in the minority here, and I did only read 112 pages, or the first two chapters.Abominable. Painful in its lack of subtlety or craft.The language of the book does nothing to evoke the 16th century. At one point, the main character practically says \\"Whatever!\\" (I forget her actual comment, and I'm not going to torture myself by turning on my Sony PRS to search for one line in a crummy book.)It should be a good movie. It clearly goes for the gusto with sex and intrigue, but that's all it has: enough to float a movie for 90 minutes, but I've already wasted one afternoon on the book, which is more than it deserves. I enjoy a sexy film as much as the next girl, but I'm not going to spend hours reading this vapid tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy","review":"This book may be fine as a fantasy, but I feel it is ridiculous to rewrite actual people's lives and rewrite history just for a buck. Much of this book is a complete fabrication, and I am afraid many will take this book as factual. Now it's a movie so even more people can be misguided."},{"rating":"1","title":"lower your IQ","review":"The book reads like it was written for a fifth grade reading level. If this doesn't bother you, then maybe the immature character development will. The characters are all so wooden. Anne is the conniving, overly ambitious coquette and her sister Mary is the unwilling courtier who longs for the country. To the author: I get it already! How many more pages are you going to repeat this theme? Dialogue and plot are so repetitive and there is virtually no character development. I was just looking for an entertaining historical fiction piece written with some sophistication for adult readers. If you're really desperate, stuck in a hotel room on your vacation, then this book may do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent enough fiction -- don't mistake it for history","review":"This is a light read -- two dimensional characters and a heavy dose of anachronism -- and it's easy to get sucked into believing this is \\"as it was.\\" But this is NOT an accurate portrayal of Anne Boleyn. In fact, I couldn't help but feel a little depressed at how such an educated, passionate, courageous, ahead-of-her-time woman was treated in this novel. Gregory's portrait is of little more than a pathological sadist bent on achieving her goals at all costs. Talk about subtle characterization -- the author practically slaps you in the face every other page with the sibling rivalry theme! Anyone wishing to learn the truth about Anne after should check out Eric Ive's biography -- and in the meantime take this for what it is: Fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining read","review":"This is an engaging book to read...hard to put down. It will be interesting to see how the movie holds up against the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary and Anne","review":"\\"Mary and Anne\\" or \\"The Boleyn Sisters\\" might have been a better title for this book. It is a very good book as long as the reader keeps in mind that it is a blend of fact and fiction. Mary was not one of Queen Katherine's ladies-in-waiting. Very little is known about Mary's life in England."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never thought I l'd like historical fiction...","review":"but I loved this book. I could not get enough of it. I was eager to turn each page and am actually a little sad that I've finished it. I will not be excited to see what other historical fiction I can get my hands on. Definitely one of my new favorites!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy Romance Historical Novel","review":"It seems most housewives liked this poorly written book. I did not! If you liked it, I'm sure you'll like Harem, another work of hysterical (\\"historical\\") fiction. Serious readers beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Philippa Gregory!","review":"By far the best book of all 20 of her books! Riveting in every way... The characters are very well developed and played out. I felt like it was fairly historically accurate, however I don't believe both of her children were Henry's and I don't think there was even much dispute about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written historical fiction","review":"After becoming a fan of the Tudors, I couldn't help but become more interested in this period in history. Philippa Gregory tells these stories well and keeps the reader interested!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does Amazon have this listed for girls 11-13?","review":"I loved this book; however, I am a mature adult. It should not recommended for Girls 11-13 as Amazon has done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting picture of the times","review":"I have enjoyed some of Gregory's other books, and found this one good as well. Even though you know Anne is doomed from the start, it is hard to put down. Although I realize there are some fictional liberties taken, I learned some things I never knew about the period and the history of the Bolyens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love,love,love","review":"I first fell in love with this book several years ago and actually keep it as my fall-back re-read at least once a year. The movie in no way did the book justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"So sad when it ended......","review":"I loved this book. I like most of Philippa Gregory's books but this is, by far, my favorite. You really feel like you know every character. She does a good job of making you feel for each of them and see their side of things. A lot of people critizing for historical inaccuracies but this is a historical FICTION book, not everything in it is said to be true. It is loosely based on a true historical event. I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Boelyn Girl","review":"I really enjoyed this audio. I had first come across the book and was having trouble reading it because of time constraints. It was my first history reading of King Henry the VII. I really loved the authors style and the person reading it made the story come to life. I was most enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"so much better than I expected!","review":"I didn't expect this book to be so well written and clever! This and The Boleyn Inheritance are the two most enjoyable historical fiction novels I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Historical Novel","review":"Am looking forward to reading another of Ms. Gregory's good historical novels. She does in-depth research on the history of the times and gives exciting details on the characters, real and fictitional."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!","review":"Okay, so while you may not use this novel as a reference while writing a paper on English history, if you need a book that will keep you enthralled you have most certainly found it.The Boelyn family wants nothing more than to elevate themselves within the English social hierarchy. As players in the court of Henry VIII from a very young age, siblings Anne, George and Mary know how to play the game well. When young Mary catches the eye of the King while at court, the family, under the guidance of their ruthless uncle, meet to determine how to best use Mary to further the family's social agenda. What follows is a thrilling tale of love, murder, betrayal and sibling rivalry. Descriptions of the English court and the actions within will keep readers immersed and interested. The horrific exploitation of women and children and the social acceptance of it all is both riveting and nauseating. An excellent piece of historical fiction, not to be missed.DYB"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fiction, Entertaining","review":"This was an interesting novel about a time period that I enjoy to read about. It is fluffier than some other great authors who have touched on the period. The story was nicely woven with artistic license and entertaining.There were parts that droned on... and parts that surprisingly wrapped up quickly. It was a good read, but your expectations of the author and historical time period may sway you to LOVE the novel or ABHOR the style.Keep in mind that it is historical fiction and it is a good read. And if this is the first you've read of the era... keep reading.I really enjoyed Eleanor of Aquitaine by Weir- a more serious style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Characters were so alive, I thought I was a part of it all!","review":"I have always been a big fan of English history so I immediately saw the movie based upon the book. Always wanting to find out more I bought the book myself and from the first page I was hypnotized. The characters are so vividly brought alive that I felt their fear, joy, love, and pain. I grieved with Mary and felt her sorrow for the death of her brother and sister regardless of the acts they did to get to the \\"chopping block\\". I am pleased to read the book from Mary's point of view; despite her being the \\"loser\\" you can't help but to cheer for her every step of the way. This is the first time I have been introduced to Philippa Gregory, and I am looking forward reading her other historical fiction novels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I dont care...I LOVED IT","review":"The facts were horribly skewed, Anne's character was evil, Mary was dumb, and there was lots of soap opera drama, but I don't care because I loved it! I loved that Anne was a scheming shrew, George was gay, and that they allegedly had an incestuous child that died in utero, but most of all I love that it was such a fun story to read. It was almost trailer trash, but so unabashed in it's telling that you've got to admit that Gregory has balls. As for the fact that it wasn't true to fact...who cares? It's a story and a great one at that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping & entertaining novel","review":"A very enjoyable book. It spans the years 1521-1536 and brings to light the high handedness of King Henry VIII as well as the plight of women. The sisters Mary and Anne Boleyn and their brother George are front and centre in this story serving up a brew of corruption, rivalry, greed and incest.Servants were used to accentuate the feelings of importance in the upper classes, where everyone aspired to be. Cruelty to animals was common - bear baiting was among the king's favorite past times.The plague was rampant at that period and to escape it King Henry would take off to the countryside away from the crowds of beggars and supplicants.Interesting to note that at age 45, he was fat and aging with a stinking wound on his leg, thwarted by what he most desired - a male heir to succeed him.Has society improved much since that period? I sure hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging - more Boleyn, please","review":"First off, I'm not a history buff. As much as I enjoy studying many subjects, I've never enjoyed studying history. And I've rarely read historical fiction. Yet on the recommendation of a friend, I picked this one up. I could hardly put it down. Told through the voice of Mary, \\"the other Boleyn girl,\\" this story is a fictionalized interpretation of the story of Mary & Anne Boleyn during the time of their involvement in the court of Henry VIII. I found the storytelling to be enthralling, and the descriptions of the splendor and at times viciousness of the English court to be intriguing. And I may have even picked up a little history along the way. Other reviews I've read here state that there are a number of historical inaccuracies in this book. I'll take their word on that. However, this book has not only entertained me, but has also piqued my interest. I now find myself wanting to find a good nonfiction account of this historical period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, light beach reading","review":"This is a great book to pick up if you have a free afternoon, or more likely, a weekend to burn.Definetly a novel to keep you intrigued, the perspective of that of Mary Boleyn is a unique and thought provoking view of the retold to death story of Queen Anne Boleyn's rise and fall.Overall a worthy buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"For anyone that loves to read books about Henry VIII and his many wives, this is a must read!! Once you begin reading it is difficult to put down! I read the whole book in just a few days! This book comes from a different perspective than other books about this topic--from Anne's sister. Mary's store is an interesting one indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"great read! If you enjoy historical fiction, and have any interest at all in getting behind the scenes of the pomp and venality of the British court in pre-Elizabethan England, then this is a must. The book rounds out some curious aspects of Henry's six marriages not found in most history texts. It gives a sense of the gossip that was the currency of the court, among the men and women - which she of course is imagining - but which provides context and a fuller view of the mores of the time. Also, I had no idea that another Boleyn daughter existed beyond Anne, and never grasped the position her family (the Howards) held at court, or the effects their rivalry with the Seymours had on their choices. Adjunct reading: Lady Antonia Fraser's \\"The Wives of Henry VIII.\\" Also check web for more info and pictures of these women."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"My book club picked this book and I was not excited about reading anything from that era in history and since it was over 600 pages I figured I would never get it read in time for our meeting. After starting the book I couldn't put it down. I really, really enjoyed it and so did 10 of our 12 members."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Fiction","review":"A Pleasant read against a wonderful background of history, all the romance and intrigue one would expect in the Court of King Henry, as well as the realistic drama of the underhanded plots of families trying to catch the eye of the King by peddling their young daughters. A wonderful read for those who love the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Oleyn a Pleasant Accident","review":"I love docudramas and this was a good one. I was at the hospital where my mother-in-law was recovering from a hear attack. There were long periods with nothing to do so I looked around in the sparse waiting room for something to read. I found this book and became enslaved and had to read it. Others have done an excellent job of describing the book. I loved knowing history and then getting a sense how the people of that time lived it. Not only was it a good read about Henry V111 court, but there was plot involving France, Spain and the Vatican. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to get a good feel of the times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Engrossing Page-Turner!","review":"This is one of the most amazing books I've read in a while. The \\"other\\" girl in the title is the sister of Anne Boleyn, Mary, King Henry VIII's mistress right before his marriage to Anne. The story captures the scheming of the Howard family and how, without regard for Mary's feelings, they pushed her into the king's bed, and so quickly shooed her out when his eyes turned to Anne. Weaved throughout Mary's story is a great depiction of Mary's brother George and his power-hungry wife, Jane Parker (who later testifies against George and Anne, sending them to the Tower of London).Overall, Gregory's novel is a must-read for anyone interested in British historical fiction - this book totally turned me on to learning about Tudor history and the workings of the English court."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Other Boleyn Girl","review":"The Other Bolyen Girl was okay. But it had a lot of historical problems. First of all it has Anne as being Mary's older sister, but really its the other way around. It also has Anne as this horrible person, when she wasn't. It has Anne stealing Henry from Mary and wanting to be Queen, but Anne never wanted this. All Anne wanted was to marry Harry Persy. Also it has an actual affair between Anne and George which NEVER happened. Also the sexual scenes are too much in the book. Tell me they had sex, but don't tell me every little detail! Other than all the wrong stuff about Anne this book was okay. WARNING! Do not read this book if you don't want to hear all about other peoples problems and how they made themselves the victim!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring...","review":"Yes the inaccuracies bothered me, but besides that this book was so incredibly boring. I began reading it and quit at about chapter two, then i decided to give it another try, but it was so boring I just gave up. Was it ever going to get good or even interesting? I just could not force myself to stick with it long enough to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"My favorite book is Gone with the Wind, and I would say that this is in the same vein. I am always trying to find good historical fiction, and Gregory is fantastic. I have been reading the King Henry books in order, and this is still my favorite. I feel like Gregory gets a little stale after the 3rd book about Henry, so I might switch it up after The Boleyn inheritance and read her new series of books.These books are a little bit of history and whole lot of fun, but not for girls under 16, in my opinion. There are some \\"adult situations.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle eBook more expensive than print copy","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It's a real page turner and kept me up til 3 am trying to finish it before I had to go to sleep. Full love/drama which is what I love about this one.While I found this book to be an excellent read, I am disappointed in the pricing. The Kindle eBook edition is $12.99 while the print version is only $10.88. eBooks cost essentially nothing to distribute, so why the eBook version costs more baffles me. This price difference made me so angry I refused to purchase this eBook or the print version and give the publishers money for ripping me off. I borrowed the print version of this book from a friend instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful! Gripping!","review":"This was a delightful and gripping read for a poor student of world history. Slowly I am putting together the pieces of the past and this book helped. It is vivid, compelling and hard to put down. As a mother of four, it was a wonderful escape. I would recommend it highly to anyone who enjoys the intrigue of human relationships and life's protocols during the Elizabethean era."},{"rating":"1","title":"History Ignored","review":"This book was awful. I like historical fiction but I expect the author to do the homework and keep it realistic for the time. She has the female character go riding off alone on the road to find her lover. Imagine that a lady would do that in those dangerous times - I don't think so! She doesn't do anything with the final romance with the servant. It was boring. The only thing this book did was make me look up the real history to see what really happened. There was no way that Henry sired a son with this girl - he was desparate for sons and would have claimed the child even if it was a illegitimate. I won't read anything else by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story! Anne & Mary Boleyn are the best!","review":"I loved this book & actually finished it in less than a week! I understand that people feel very strongly about Anne Boleyn, but I just want to stress that this book is NOT supposed a history book! I think we can imagine that certain conversations may have gone the way that Gregory described, and others, of course, were different. I loved the story, and Gregory's writing was mature, but also, easy to get through (with maximum comprehension). I can't get over how ruthless Anne was, but the love between sisters (and family) was so strong - I just loved this story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Tudor Porn","review":"If OK magazine and Penthouse had been writing in the 1500's this is what they would have come up with.First, it is a badly written book. It is essentially bad Tudor porn. No characters are well written, and they are all insufferable. Honestly they couldn't behead Anne fast enough for me. Even Mary, who should have been the heroine/likeable one was a winy, annoying character.Second, if you're going to make it up just call it fiction and don't try to pass it off as history. Do some basic research. If I can refute the basic \\"facts\\" of your book in 5 minutes with Google, it's not history in any sense of the word.This book does not deserve to be a best seller, she does not deserve to be identified as an historical fiction writer. I look at author recommendations on books, and if she recommends it I put it down and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment !","review":"Such a dissapointment , a true waste of money, it was clearly not a historic novel , nothing, nothing, nothing worth reading.

I did not know much about the history of the Tudors nor Anne Boleyn. But I could tell right away by reading this book that the author, Philippa Gregory is extremely biased towards Anne Boleyn. She's turned her book into a critique of how women, such as Anne, who are struck by ambition into some kind of incestuous monster who is ready to push anyone out of her way. To me, there are two types of books: page turners and books that move very slowly but have a lot of substance. The Other Boleyn Girl is the latter. I kept reading this book because I have this unwavering commitment to finish a book, hoping that the end will somehow redeem this craptastic fest of trash. This book really teeters on the border of a trashy romance novel. I will never read anything by Gregory again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"I never read historical fiction but the book was recommended by a valued friend who is a voracious reader so I reluctantly decided to give it a try.

If you're like me and hate this junk-filled genre, it ain't for you.Bad acting (especially Shelly Winters and the ubiquitous Antonio Fargas), overdone story (main character getting revenge for framing by the (of course) racist crooked cops), ad nauseum. Good for laughs, but not much else.However, there are some redeeming features that raise this from one starts to two for me. Bernie Casey comes off as a very sincere and redeeming character who tries to rid th eneighborhood of drug abuse. Cleo Jones herself shows that women can be smart as well as sexy (though she's not quite as charasmatic as Pam Grier's characters and Pam's a better actress). But in either case, this is one of those films best watched with a bunch of your friends over and a cooler filled with beers nearby."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is great fun","review":"Sure it's over the top. Sure Shelley Winters' character is absurd. But this one is a lot of fun. In the genre of blaxploitation movies, this movie is closer to \\"Shaft\\" in quality than it is to \\"Foxy Brown\\". \\"Foxy\\", while enjoyable, is a very amateurish production. \\"Cleopatra\\", on the other hand, is very well done. The car chase rates as one of the best of the era.As for the transfer, it also is very well done. My only complaint about the DVD is the lack of any additional features. In fact, it is so bare that the menu is a generic Warner Bros. logo instead of related to the movie.Regardless, even if you aren't a big fan of the blaxploitation genre, this one is great entertainment....exciting and funny at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Film","review":"My husband wanted to collect a copy of this film.

Unfortunately, that particular relative liked to collect ghosts...and they all come with the house.There are several scenes which still hold up well by today standards (the Ouija board among them) and the sound effects are excellently suited for the surroundings.Unfortunately, the transfer from the original effects of the theatrical release leave the ghosts extremely transparent and somewhat hard to make out. Also, the characters in the movie have to put on goofy looking goggles in order to see the spirits.Oh well, you'll still find this film fun.

Some look shocking, but others are cheesy. Oh well.The story centers around a family that inherits a house and find out that it is haunted, much to the son's excitement. They enter the house and discover that it really is haunted. But watch out for the laywer that handled the estate before the uncle's death.

If you start seeing your printouts looking faded (the signs of an empty cartridge), stop printing and refill immediately.

It seems that novices who've only seen one or two quantum physics texts in their lives fall for the smooth talking style of Griffiths. Don't fall for it! For example, the section on angular momentum and spin is one of the worst I've ever read. Griffiths gets the reader lost in a heap of math without taking the time to describe the picture behind it. (I'm not complaining about the level of math in the book, but his failure in communicating the physical insight or feeling of quantum phenomena.)Even the small book by Paul Davies is better written and more insightful than Griffiths.My personal recommendations are the Feynman Lectures on Physics (volume III) and Introduction to the Quantum Theory by David Park (even Griffiths acknowledges in his own text that Park is an excellent book). After these two you may want to hit Shankar or Sakurai. (As I said above, the book by Davies is pretty good too.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Primer to Quantum Mechanics","review":"Although this book is not very comprehensive, it is extremely good in preparing students for a more advanced course in quantum mechanics.

Griffths does not avoid the controversial issues on the physical interpretation of the theory ( a part of the book that should have appeal even to the non-technical reader ). His treatment of the topics is always illuminating and gives the reader a sensation of understanding what he/she is being told.Maybe Professor Griffths would consider next an up-to-date and extended edition of his Elementary Particle book and/or a new text on Quantum Field Theory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brevity a serious problem.","review":"There a several things I have come to dislike about this book. The first is in the overall treatment of the subject matter. The explanations are incomplete and sometimes you can be left wondering how one equation follows from another. Griffiths also introduces symbols or notations without giving a formal definition of what it is. As a result of this, reading the actual text is usually of no help when it comes to solving the more difficult problems. It is infuriating to look at a problem for over three hours and still have absolutely no clue as to how to go about solving it. I have no problem with very difficult problems that take hours, but I would like to spend the time actually working on the problem, instead of staring at it, wondering where to start or what that notation means that the author never defined. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really bad book.","review":"The book has a few good parts, but there are just too many flaws to grant anything higher than one star. Griffiths leaves many important steps out, sometimes leaving them to the problems or just not covering them at all.

If you ever need to teach yourself Quantum Mechanics, Use the Feynman Lectures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine, clearly written introduction","review":"This is a well-written, beautifully done text for beginners. Though not a brilliant book like Dicke-Wittke (which sparked at every page and, alas, is out-of-print), it brings the message. Besides the more usual topics, I particularly liked the treatment of adiabatic processes and the Berry phase, which is the best I met in textbooks. The exercises are effective, and vary from routine to tough. I've met at least one which slightly strains, in its wording, the laws of electromagnetism. But I liked to teach from it, and, better, the students loved it. I wish I had a text like this when I fought against old Schiff, centuries ago!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written elementary QM text.","review":"David Griffiths concentrates on the classic and important QM proplems, such as the Schrodinger equation, the finite square well, the delta function potential, the hydrogen atom, spin, etc. He does not touch on QM \\"side line\\" issues. Thus the students efforts are most efficient. Griffiths develops each subject in a balanced and easy to understand way. His book could be home studied without assistance from an instructor, which is certainly not true of many QM texts. The exercises are well selected and appropriate, and many of them have implicit or explicit answers provided. Along with QM by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, I would rate this one of the best choices for the beginning student. While Cohen-Tannoudji is comprehensive and elegant, Griffiths is basic and focused."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice book.","review":"I hate books which put things more difficult than they really are. This is not such a book. It gives the reader an clear, consistent and very readable introduction to quantum mechanics whithout the usual pooha and bigtalk.Griffiths is precise, not overly detailed and in my opinion a huge didact. He also wrote an introduction to electrodynamics which I found of the same quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull as dishwater","review":"What an uninspired, leaden, workmanlike book. Quantum by the numbers, turn the math handle and crank out the answers. Although this is supposed to be an elementary book, there is more mind-numbing math here that many contemporary Physics majors can handle, and there is much less discussion of concepts than they need. If putting a dead pet on the back cover is friendly, this book is friendly!Goswami's book (now sadly out of print) is much better on motivation, and desn't do as much grind-math. I wish there were a book on Quantum that would break the mold and try to be interesting for today's students, and not just churn out the same old calculations on the same old systems (harmonic oscillator, hydrogen atom, blah-blah). It could have sections on quantum computing, laser trapping... This is not that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptively pedagogical with lousy exercises.","review":"Don't be fooled by the informal style of this text. Griffiths has a bad habit of leaving many important results to the exercises, and he also briskly jumps over many difficult steps. He doesn't even provide a plausability argument for the Schroedinger equation (I know it's not necessary, but it wouldn't hurt to provide the steps how Schroedinger arrived at his famous equation).His exercises are very lousy and have little effect in reinforcing the material. A much better book is <I>Principles of Quantum Mechanics</I> by Shankar or <I>Quantum Mechanics</I> by Cohen-Tannoudji.In short, Griffiths' text has too many holes. (It's a shame this book is not in par with his excellent <I>Introduction to Electrodynamics</I>.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantum Mechanics For Dummies","review":"I can't understand why Mr. Griffiths' undergraduate physics books are so popular. The low intellectual level of his writing can only discourage more advanced students, yet the physics is so watered down that you won't learn much anyways. His books read like a \\"Physics For Dummies\\" series.Griffiths' Quantum Mechanics book continues in this tradition. He introduces Schroedinger's Equation on the FIRST page without giving any of the traditional \\"plausibility arguments\\". He bypasses any discussion of the Old Quantum Theory (Bohr's Correspondence Principle and the Bohr-Summerfeld quantization conditions). He gives a watered down introduction to the Dirac formalism which fails to adequately explain Dirac's measurement theory and such important concepts as simultaneous eigenkets and non-commuting observables.There are innumerable superior QM books at the undergraduate level. Save your money and forget about Griffiths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete failure","review":"I believe it arrived DOA as the instructions said that it was to have a cotton like top and mine was smooth like icing.

In fact, having him nurse on this pillow caused him to pull on my nipples, even when he was latched properly, causing me much pain, and cracked and bleeding nipples, until I figured out what was going on.I don't know if you're one of those moms who's got a waist immediately after giving birth, but I wasn't.

Its a little bigger and more adjustable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for baby than mom","review":"For all of the positive reviews on this, I didn't find the Boppy all that great. It didn't support my arms as I held my baby and it was more cumbersome than anything when I was trying to feed him. I don't think I would suggest this to other moms, regular pillows you'd find on your couch or bed are easier to get in place than this thing. About all I'll use it for in the future with other children is for the baby to lie in when they're between 0-3 months in age. The Boppy with toys that hang over it might be a good purchase, but this thing does not work well for breastfeeding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy item!","review":"I find that the boppy pillow is very handy.

I use it for feeds and holding him for hours at a time. It is very comfortable to use in the gliders that the nursery has and for keeping my arm from feeling tired while holding him. This is something that every mom should have to help with the growth of their babies. My first child loved hers and at 5 brings it out still for naps and lounging. Give it a try!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Luke warm on the Boppy","review":"I'm not sure what the fuss is surrounding this product and why so many deem it a \\"must-have\\" I find that a regular firm pillow works just as well if not better. The width of the boppy is too narrow to support a bigger baby. The U-shape isn't especially comfortable to me. The other problem I've had is washing. They come with slip covers now, but if you ever need to wash the pillow itself, it screws up the distribution of the stuffing.I much prefer the My Breast Friend pillow: it has a back support and is adjustable. Very comfortable and gives the baby a wider and flater surface to lay on. Mine is the inflatable version, which is great - when you take off the cover to wash, you can easily clean the pillow beneith with just a damp cloth. My baby also like sitting in it better than the boppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boppy Overrated","review":"Another MUST HAVE I was told. I think not. Pillows are much more effective in my opinion to prop up the baby while nursing. The boppy just wasn't comfortable for me, it was too stiff. I didn't feel like it really fit me - and I am not a big woman - size 8 before pregnancy, size 10-12 while nursing. I really think it is overrated and not necessary.I have heard good things about \\"my breast friend\\" I might try that one next time. But still felt like the pillows did the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"This item is a must have for bottle or breast feeding","review":"I love this pillow and recommend it for either bottle or breast feeding.

It is also a great way to prop up our son when he wants to look around and helps with his GERD after feedings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This is a great product for nursing moms and non-nursing moms also. I bottle fed my daughter and still got a lot of great use out of the Boppy. It was perfect for her to lay in on the floor and great for when she was learning how to sit up."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy a cheaper one","review":"This is a good pillow if you do NOT plan to breastfeed. The pillow doesnt stay around your waste if you want to sit comfortably. I find that in order to breastfeed my son i have to lean foreward so far that it hurts. It is just too bulky and firm for brestfeeding. The star is for helping my son sit up. However it does tend to slide back away from him. This pillow is also too bulky for tummy time. My advice is to buy a cheaper one if you feel you need one. Or buy one with toys attached, even better is the gym model, which I plan to get after I return this useless pillow. Think about this: $34 for about $3 worth of material and stuffing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I like this pillow. It was very helpful when I was nursing my newborn.

My boppy is pretty flat now-a-days from over use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Stay in Place","review":"I found that the Bobby just wouldn't stay in my lap, making it worthless for breastfeeding. No matter what I did, it just slipped away. My lactation consultant recommended the My Best Friend/My Brest Friend nursing pillow instead. It has back support and a velcro strap to hold it in place. I LOVED the My Brest Friend nursing pillow and would recommend that over the Boppy any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I love my boppy pillow!

I would encourage all moms to get one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Nursing Pillow Ever","review":"I read all the great reviews and tried this as a nursing pillow. It was horrible! It was large and cumbersome and too low for me. Because my baby was constantly tugging my nipples down I was cracked and bleeding for two months. I finally put it in the closet thinking I could at least use it when he started sitting up. I think he sat in it about 5 times before he could sit up on his own so I was disappointed I had wasted the closet space storing it. After talking to my girlfriends I found out that everyone GETS a boppy but most people don't actually use them. They just don't bother to post reviews! If you need a nursing pillow there are lots of other ones out there, just not at BRU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better options avaliable","review":"I was given this by a friend when pregnant. I was quite excited and even took it to the hospital with me. I hated using this pillow. I am not a big woman at all (5'3 130) but it would not fit in the glider with me comfotably. I did use it to sit on for a while and I used it to help my son sit up when he was learning but if you are looking for a nursing pillow try the \\"My Brest Friend\\" or my favorite the \\"NoJo Nursing pillow\\" Boppy just does not live up to the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product!","review":"I am a first time Mom and I use this Boppy daily! My son loves to sit in it and he does drift off to sleep in it too. Both my husband and I prop our son up in it to interact with him and we don't have to worry about him tipping over. It is nice to have on the sofa with you so you can give your arms a rest with out the worry of the baby rolling off. It is also another place you can put the baby with out having to keep putting him in a bassinet or crib all the time. Great for tummy time too.I use it for nursing and do not have the problem of it moving around. In the hospital I used pillows and they worked fine, but the Boppy works much better for us. Pillows do have to be adjusted to get the right position for latching and the Boppy does not. I do recomend getting comfortable with some back support before nursing with the Boppy.Very good product and I do recomend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Boppy is a MUST HAVE for a new baby...","review":"I received this boppy as a shower gift. After struggling in the hospital to position my baby with pillows for nursing, I was glad to come home and try out my Boppy. What a perfect fit!! This pillow works for nursing a baby, then transitions into support for a baby learning to hold up their head, then sit up...etc. You'll use this pillow for months. I am sure that there are even more uses that I haven't even though of yet...but, if you ONLY use it for nursing, you will still easily be getting your money's worth. Have one ready for yourself when you get home from the hospital!On the practical side, the Boppy cover is easy to zip off and throw in the wash - it washes/dries well. Mine still looks pretty much brand new after months of use and many many washings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for teaching baby to sit up, not good for nursing.","review":"I am not a fat woman, but when I've just given birth to a baby, I'm not a SKINNY woman, either. Boppy Pillows are designed for SKINNY women. If you aren't super-skinny, you will never get that pillow around your waist. If you are skinny, I'm sure this is a great product.I did find my Boppy was useful for sitting my baby inside, as he was learning to sit up. It supports them all around from falling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy My Brest Friend instead!!!","review":"I was given this pillow as a gift and wish I had kept the gift receipt. This pillow slowly moves away from your waist and I was often left with my baby on my lap instead of on the pillow. My back often ached if I didn't prop myself up with enough pillows. The only place I could use it comfortably was in the car. I bought the My Brest Friend nursing pillow myself at the prompting of my lactation consultant and it worked out much better. I could use it on the sofa, at night in bed to nurse my daughter and then easlly place her in her bassinet. The boppy looks nicer but not very functional at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for nursing","review":"There's so much hype over the Boppy being a \\"must have\\" that I made sure to get one when our first baby was born. I was very disappointed. It is horribly designed for nursing a baby. The cushion was always slipping and sliding out of position. There is no way to strap it to your waist to keep it in place. For a nursing support pillow, I highly recommend the the \\"My Brest Friend\\" pillow instead. It's a flat crescent shaped pillow that straps around you and provides lumbar support as well. It made a world of difference for proper positioning, and latching on correctly. If you want a pillow for nursing support, save your money and skip the Boppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has been a lifesaver!!","review":"We registered for this item before baby arrived, and thank God someone purchased it for us! In the hospital we had problems with breastfeeding on day 1, day 2 my husband returned with the Boppy Luxe in hand and it has been smooth sailing ever since. When I am sitting our daughter is comfortable, content, and at the perfect height to feed. My husband uses the Boppy when he is cradling her in his arms for extra support. Our daughter if given the chance falls right to sleep in the softness of this product. Other Boppy pillows are cheaper in price, however one of the features all three of us enjoy that is unique to this one is the fleece covering. I would have given five stars, except for the fact that the fit on my waist is not always comfortable in every seating situation. Great product though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"buy \\"my brest friend\\" instead!","review":"bought this pillow because of the wonderful things people say about it. i thought it'd be great. i found that i needed other pillows to support my arms and back each time i nursed with this pillow. saw \\"MY BREST FRIEND\\" pillow, tried it on in the store, and i never used the boppy again. \\"my brest friend\\" has a strap that fastens pillow to you so you can be reasonably mobile and nurse at the same time. it also has back support and a firm, flat platform for baby to lay on. by FAR the best. also comes in an inflatable style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for Breast Feeding","review":"I had a boppy with my 1st child and found it hard to use. It kept popping out of place when breast feeding. A friend then loaned me her breast friend which I loved!!! I will definitely be getting one of those this time around. I would like to get the boppy for tummy time and when baby is learning to situp by himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for new moms!!!!!","review":"I love this thing!!! I had never heard about them until I saw it in a pregnancy magazine. I then came online to read the reviews and ended up buying one for myself. It's great for breast feeders and bottle feeders! It puts the baby at the perfect level. My mom-in-law uses it just to hold the baby because it cradles the baby and allows your arms to relax. The cover is easy to wash, you just zip it right off! My daughter is 6 months now and I still use it. I put it on the floor and put her in it. It supports her enough so she won't tip over, but helped her learn to sit on her own. It also works as a great pillow and neck support for lying on the floor or couch. i recommend it to everyone!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boppy from Heaven","review":"We purchased the Boppy Luxe just before the arrival of our little one. My husband was skeptical, and thought the price was a little high. But, after spending three days in the hospital holding, feeding, and rocking our baby, we both had some sore shoulder and arm muscles. When we got home, I placed the boppy in his lap -- his first words were \\"Ahhhh. This was the best investment we have ever made.\\" We use the boppy at every feeding, as it makes holding baby much easier. Plus, the boppy is comfortable for baby. We highly recommend the boppy luxe."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"Even though I ended up bottle feeding, I did try breastfeeding while using this pillow. I am not a huge person, but a little larger than average, and this pillow just DID NOT work for me. I tried it every which way I could, and no such luck.My son enjoys it as much as a 3.5 month old can. Even though it clearly tags the product to not use for a sleeping infant, it saved me at times when his reflux was especially bad.If you are a size 14+ you will want to look into a pillow that will fit you better, because most likely, this one will not be as helpful as it is for smaller women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I attempted to use the Boppy twice when breastfeeding with no luck.

It makes such a big difference feeding the baby that I don't think our baby got fed once without it. Out Boppy travelled across continents, on airplanes, in cars, anywhere, we just would not leave without it.It is a much needed article. Feeding time becomes easy and relaxed, it helps your back and arms, it is warm and soft for the baby, it actually helps the mother and father correct their posture as they feed the baby, a total must have.I've heard that Swiss hospitals offer this pillow to new mothers, I could not think of a better gift for a baby shower, as long as you buy it before the baby is born, because it helps mothers learn the right feeding position and it may make the challenge of brastfeeding a much easier task."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was a must have but.....","review":"Being quite tall and not petite, this pillow just did not fit well while breastfeeding, it put my son up to high.

Now I just grab my daughter, go to a chair/couch and find a comfortable pillow and do just fine without a boppy! The boppy is collecting dust. Pillows work just fine!UPDATE: after 2 years and 2 babies, the Boppy is now my favorite for when the baby is around 5 months old-7 months: for putting behind them for sitting up!

The purpose of the book is not self-help, or to give readers a warm fuzzy feeling- it is but a glimpse into these women's realities.The author does not project *any* blame onto the interviewees. She states explicitly in the second chapter (by means of her discourses) that it is society that puts the onus of victimization on the women. The women are, Phillips argues, trapped in an inescapable cultural system and are socialized to take the blame onto themselves, though in truth are merely products of an unequal environment.If you want a light at the end of a tunnel, there are many books written with the intention of that final \\"feel-good\\" release of dramatic tension. No, this book doesn't have a clean, fix-all solution for the women in this book.

At the point this film was released, he'd mostly starred in British television, the sole exception being the vastly underrated filmCroupier. Shortly after 'Greenfingers' cameGosford Parkand, more importantly,Closer (Superbit Edition)in which he blew Jude Law and Julia Roberts off the screen. Now he's Clive Owen, International Superstar, the kind of actor that makes my wife audibly gasp when he appears on screen (Bardem is the only other guy in this category).So, from that perspective, it's interesting to watch a movie made in 1999 - 2000 and see Owen putting in a workmanlike performance. I like the chemistry between him and David Kelly (ofWaking Ned Devinefame) as well as the paternal stewardship shown by Warren Clarke as the warden, who I enjoyed immensely in the underrated, mis-marketedBlow Dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clive Owen has the Greenthumb","review":"This is a great example of british acting and cinema.

For anyone interested in England or gardening, the movie is worth seeing just for those features, aside from the simple \\"niceness\\" of the story, and the acting of Clive Owens, Helen Mirren and David Kelly.

It deals with many things beyond the seemingly straightforward plot - knowledge and power, duty and desire, destiny and will. Years of writing scientific papers affected the author's style - the language is precise and clear even when facing Unknown. The pace of the book is somewhat more relaxed than is typical for the genre but those extra words per unit of action are worth reading. The book is rather mild and kind in coping with harsh realities of life. Generally, fans of Conan the Barbarian saga will be disappointed; fans of J.R.R. Tolkien and G.G.

It is set in the ancient Middle East instead of modern day England, and it has those sensual parts that are definitely not appropriate for young adults, but this book has the same genuine purity of an all-time classic. It tells of a princess growing up in a richly described world of the Arabian nights. She is a shy and quiet child with a lot of responsibilities, but her life completely turns around on her twelfth birthday when she finds herself in command of an all-powerful djinn who obeys nobody else but her. It is not simply an adventure book, although you will find plenty of magical adventures an near-death experiences there. It explores the meaning of wisdom and suffering that comes with it.

The story is this: a group of English schoolboys get shipwrecked on an island, and eventually go crazy and kill each other. It was just evil. The one boy, Ralph, who is the \\"main character\\" of the book, has very few faithful followers. His rival, Jack, has a much larger group of followers - and they think there is a \\"beast\\" on the island. To lure it (to try to capture it), they kill a pig and put its head on a stick. This becomes the \\"Lord\\" of the flies, because so many flies crawl in and out of its disgusting, dead eyes (or holes where the eyes WERE), nose, and mouth.

I agree with his message because it's true: evil can appear where ever it wants to. Just look at those school shootings, they unfortunately prove my point. I think he did the characters very descriptively. He is psychoanalyzing every main character in the entire book. It was very believable. I could imagine a news report saying about a couple of boys found on a burning island. About changing the book, I think it should stay the way it is. Some parts are very confusing, but it should stay the way it is.

All the little good kids on the Island die except for Ralph. Ralph was the leader of the kids then jack took over. This book is good for people that like reading about 6 - 12 year old kids killing each other. This book is a symbol of the modern world.

I say this because I prefer to read happy and cheery books and the deaths in the story sort of brought me down.I think other people would also like this book.

There is NO way normal men could kill wild boars, let alone young kids. Weapons are hard to make too, I don't know how the older young boys, around the age of 13, can make weapons that is sufficient and adequate enough to use for killing wild boars and other fierce creatures. This book is extremely far-fetched as I see it. But there are interesting elements too, I suppose. It's very symbolical. There's some symbols that I didn't fully interpret until I look into them closer, and I thought that was quite intriguing. It brings a more dark atmopshere into this book.

And that's what it is: a bunch of young boys are stuck on an island, they start off somewhat organized, and then, one by one, turn savage.My best friend recommended it to me, saying the ending was amazing. Perhaps it is. It is a sudden let down from the tension. Yes, I agree, it is amazingly written, but it is also hopeless. What life is left for the boys? They'll need a lot of visits to the shrink, I expect.But that's not what it's about. We are not supposed to think of the long term, only be aware of the depravity of the human race.

Lord of the Flies is a novel about a bunch of young boys deserted on an island with no adults or the presence of society, and all the complications that go with that. The whole book is a fight between right and wrong, order and chaos, and intellect and instinct-- Golding was trying to show just how much evil people have hidden inside covered by society, or in other words, that the only reason we ALL aren't savages is because society is always telling us we shouldn't be... A very interesting thought, one that I do in a way stand behind, but the actual PLOT and STORY of Lord of the Flies disappointed me, so I don't believe you should take the time to read the entire book; just maybe the afterword written by Golding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alone by Yourselves","review":"Stranded on an island alone as a twelve year old; how would you survive? That's the question author William Golding poses to us in his adventure novel \\"Lord of the Flies\\". While escaping WWII in England, a plane of British school boys is shot down, and they suddenly find themselves alone on a deserted island with no parental supervision. Now completely alone, the boys begin to assemble on the beach with the help of a determined young boy, Ralph. You will follow the power struggle between two twelve year olds from beginning to end, who both want to take charge of all the children on the island. Soon the boys take sides, and begin to form two separate tribes, and the attention is deviated away from the major goal, getting off the island. This book will hold your attention throughout with the impending question on your mind; will they make it off, and back to safety? Golding does an exceptional job of creating an action thriller that you won't put down until the very last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"THUMBS UP OH YEAH","review":"The Lord of the Flies tells the story of a group of boys (pre-teens and younger) who become stranded on an island with no adult supervision.

The boys are plagued by \\"beasties\\" and \\"serpents,\\" but in the end, as they are driven to murder and betrayal, they realize that the only beasts on the island were in themselves.Whether or not you look at this novel as a fable, a myth (as Golding preferred to call it), or a simple \\"what if?\\" story, I think it is very good. The novel itself is fairly simple, but it leaves much to be discussed and/or mulled over. Many people think that the ending is \\"cheap\\" or \\"gimmicky,\\" but I think that it was the only ending that could have worked so effectively.Anyway, I recommend this to anyone, whether or not you need a book for class or for leisure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable book not as described","review":"This was described to be a \\"good\\" or \\"like new\\" condition (I don't remember which now) paperback of a classic book in a more recent edition.

I read it thirty years ago and recently read it again because my kids had too. The language is archaic. The imagery is impossible to grasp.

Bought the book for my kid who needed it for for a school assignment. Quality control is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, awful book","review":"Golding's idea was brilliant. He delved into the true, hidden nature of humans; our origin as an animal. In his book, a group of young boys are stranded on an island without any adults. They set up a society with rules, goals, and a leader. Of course, this society fails miserably. Rules are disregared, goals are forgotten, and the leader is overthrown. Their miniature civilization degrades into chaos. The implication is that civilization as a whole is just a thin mask that covers our more primal nature.The idea is well thought out and interesting. However, Golding focuses on the details of the boys' existance and the symbolism of the story to the point that the story itself is lost. The only remotely interesting part is the end, when he stops focusing on the symbolism as much and lets the story drive home the points that he tries to make throughout the book.If you want an examination of human nature, then read this book.If you want an adventure story, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very boring book.","review":"I might just be a teen in high school but I know what I like and this book was not one in my interest. Although William Gerald Golding wrote this worthwhile astonishing book it made no imapct to my opinion. The book was very well presented and had touching moments but lacked the realism that books have to maintain. Its moments of exitement were short lived and really weren't that exciting to begin with. All in all it was a hell of a book to those who actually like reading books. To tell the truth I hardly remember what the book was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"What I do not understand is how people can like this book! It is really boring and I don't really like or understand that Jack guy. I think I would've given this book a better grade if it hadn't started out sooooo slow.

It's just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"lord of the flies","review":"Golding wrote his worse book yet, when it comes to lord of the flies. He tries to show the evil in mankind, but saince it is a group of (5-12) year olds it is totally unbelievable. The kids start off all gitty and gay but then turn on each other in a short period of time. The have a democracy at first but then they lose all rules and start killing each other. Ya how real is that? People this is a group of 5-12 year olds and they are roaming around hunting pigs and killing humans. The meetings start off when Ralph calls a meeting with a conch he found. The group declares Ralph as the leader. Piggy represents rules and guidelines. Roger is supposed to show a misguided soul he proably was picked on when he was at his school"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unimpressive let down","review":"I read Lord of the Flies and I can honestly say that it is thought of too highly.The symbolism is way to obvious, and pathetic fallacy is not used to it's full potential.

After being on the island for only about a year (assuming that is how long, with the change of seasons) these proper British boys turn into bloodthirsty savages. I understand them doing stuff they would not normally be allowed to do, but to murder someone the way Roger did? I strongly believe something like that would never happen in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Flies","review":"In the book Lord of the Flies, the author William Golding shows the reader what it would be like to be stranded on a deserted island. This great book was written in 1954. Lord of the Flies is a fiction, adventure, novel.William Golding writes about how the kids on the island face their fears in order to survive. Golding does a great job of painting a visual picture with his detailed descriptions. He describes the emotions and challenges that each individual character is having. William Golding makes Lord of the Flies sound so real that you don&#65533;t know if the two worlds, the fiction and ours are any different from each other. He describes his book so well that the fearful life the kids have might just scare you too.I would recommend this book for anyone especially people who like descriptive, puzzling, nightmarish books. I would give this book a 9 out of 10 on the rating scale. In summary, the book had lots of details, a splendid plot, and a very unexpected ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Better Than \\"Lord of the Dance\\"","review":"If you have ever read \\"Animal Farm\\" by George Orwell,then you will enjoy \\"Lord of the Flies\\". \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is a book that demonstrates how society deals with war, and also serves as a warning bell to society to show people what could happen if they don't react more civilized in a time of crisis. Golding symbolized this situation with children stranded on an island forced to live by themselves and under their own rules. This is a great book if like political/war novels or if like Goerge Orwell since both authors deal with the same topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"The closest comparison to The Lord of the Flies is probably Animal Farm. I think the Lord of the Flies is better then Animal Farm (also a classic) because the lord of the Flies can be an Allegory to several different things. Among them are: What people behave like in groups, how childred act without proper supervision, how people act in desperate situations etc. It could be studied in a Sociology class just as easily as in an English class.A real eye opener"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was boring, but informative.","review":"I felt that the book \\"Lord of the Flies\\" was very hard to get into.

I'm glad that Ralph made it at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally unbelievable","review":"this book, while trying to simulate a society of youths thrown together in unusual circumstances, is simply too far-fetched to work. the psychological component would not be present without a string of huge coincidences that cannot be taken seriously (im talking about the parachuter on the top of the mountain, among others). i continually found myself comparing lotf to animal farm by george orwell, another \\"simulated society\\" novel. the latter is by far more convincing, even if its main characters are nothing but common barnyard animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad before the Good","review":"This book was absolutely awful until I reached the notes at the end of the book. I was bored by the lack of theme to the story and much of the visual descritpion was unnessecary. I was also confused by the absence of important information. Not until the end of the book did I realize that the story took place during World War II. Also, I could not decipher who the boys were and why they were all together yet did not know each other for some time. Once I reached the reflective notes at the end, though, I was very impressed by the symbolism and hidden ideas in the book. I would only prefer to find them myself in the reading, rather than be told them at the end. For instance, I made no connection as to how the sow was killed to rape because the killing was not vividly described, and no resemblance was obvious. The notes told me that, and I understood the total point the author was trying to make more, but I was still disappointed that I could not have made the connections myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"looking into the meaning","review":"i just completed reading the novel, Lord of the Flies. I am a 12th grade student at North Penn High School. At first i was bothered with the fact that i had to read the novel because i had so many other things i'd rather do, however after i did finally complete the book i saw a very interesting point behind it. this novel is a very true story about human civilization. it makes you really think about how people change because of society and also how people fall into other peoples traps by manipulation, just like Jack manipulated the boys. the book has a lot of symbolizm in it which can sometimes be hard to understand, but once the point is seen, the book is actually a good one. overall i dont think that this novel is all that bad. it is actually kind of interesting and i'm not so upset that i was forced to read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lord of the flies","review":"The author's, Golding,s purpose was to show the need for civilization. I agree with him because some of the boys died due to lack of rules and discipline. They needed civilization on the island. Also, I think that Golding handled the art of symbolizism best. The spactacles, the conch, and all of the other symbols made the novel a little bit entertaining. I think that the novel, Lord of the Flies, was believable because without rules and authority figures young teenagers will act in that manner, uncivilizied. There is nothing to my knowledge that Golding could have changed. I did not like it when Piggy died because he was my favorite character. I do know that without such an important event as Piggy's death the novel would not of had as strong of an efect on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, and very disturbing book","review":"This was one of the few books I had to read for school, but that I really enjoyed.

I think that the idea, or theme of the book was well thought out, but I don't really think that is was well written. Golding had a good theme to his book, about how we still have wild instincts that are just covered up by civilization until we feel the struggle to survive or the threat to our own life. Golding book was, in my thought, not well written. It was overly descriptive at some points, to the point where it lost your interest. After finishing the book, it was easier to understand, thinking through the whole story without being held back by Golding's descriptive periods. I did not enjoy this book, though projects used to review the book in the classroom were fun and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gruesome Savages","review":"The Lord of the Flies is about boys who are in a plane crash and get stuck on an island.

Ralph has trouble with this because he needs help with other things. Their disagreements lead to a lot of fighting and deaths.

On the other hand their are so many innocent people who are given wrong or misinfomation and theirby led to the ignorance , stereotyping etc. Ralph the character who tries to bring the justice and stands for the truth ends up on the loosing side and is that not true of many experiences we see. The police always gives you a ticket for even a minor accidental mistake yet they feed so many criminals who are convicted.

Too bad author was overly influenced by Freud, but other than that the story is fascinating.We tell our kids, \\"There's no such thing as Monsters!\\" The truth is, the Monsters do exist inside of us.

But I however did not like the book for the sole reason of the killings, and how the boys felt no remorse at all, except for Ralph.

The book is about a group of boys stranded on an island. The author tries to show how society works, and what would happen if a group of young boys were stranded on an island, but fails miserably. His opinion of what would happen is just wrong. And even if you do agree (once you've read the book) the writing still destroys the book. It is such a slow book! Way too much unnecassary details! When it comes to an actual important part of the book, there is barely any time spent on it. I would not recommend this book to anyone!!

Lord of the Flies might be a suspenseful and thought-provoking book, but it's main thesis --children turning into beasts as soon as the burden of civilization is taken off them-- is utterly silly. It makes me wonder how many children Mr. William Golding really knew or talked to before writing this book. Children are always capable (many times much more than grownups) to act with common-sense and responsibility. I think Mr. Golding knew this (he can't be that narrow-minded), but simply choose to forget it since it would destroy his thesis and he wouldn't be able to write this novel. It's also fun to see how easily some authors can ignore or blur the most simple realities. I don't recommend this book to anyone who loves children and childhood, which is a period of exploration and friendships."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"This book can be summed up in one word: BORING.

The story was inspirational and categorized by myself to be the greatest book i have ever read along side 'The Island Of Doctor Moreau' written by H.G Wells. The two books concentrate on the humans mind and traits within the stories and therefore they make a great contrast to be noticed by everyone.

Secondly if you think you know who the Lord of Flies might be without reading this book your wrong. Third and lastly do yourself a favor anyway and pick up this book, it's a fun, quick read. I liked this story of young boys stranded on a island having to fend for themselves and at the same time trying to keep some sort of organization among themselves as they wait for a possible rescue. But therein lies the problem as their little world begins to turn up-side down as different personalities begin to clash. I felt as though I too was on the island with these kids as I read along.

Day THree (aprox) The kids are now half naked, spear-toting, near-savages who cannot agree one anything (JUMP) Day Eighteen--Bloodthirsty, Chanting monsters who kill for pleasure I really think that Golding is a horrible man. We, as humans, DO have a dark side. But for God's sake, it would take MONTHS for the kids to fall THAT far! Years, maybe!

We ended up eating snakes, toads, insects and anything we could steal or terrorize from boys scout and National Guardsmen on training exercises. We also disintegrated into tribal savages like Golding describes in the Lord of the Flies. Between these interludes in the woods with the boy savages, I read this book (around age 10) and found it jibed with my reality. The words of the Lord of the Flies struck deep into me, for I knew that darkness well. Some believe the book overladen with \\"humans are evil\\" symbolism. Well, they are, and boys do revert to the lowest common denominator in the jungle, despite their best intentions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Kids","review":"The strong point of this novel is that even people's criticisms are actually good in the book. The great irony is that the boys are saved by a man going off to war.

The book is burned into my memory. That's how good it was. It's a tale of a boy growing up, and the evil in our society. We see how the boys decivilize during their stay on the island, and degenerate into savage groups. As in Jack London's \\"The Call of the Wild,\\" the characters revert to their natural instincts. In this case, the boys become savage group hunters, similar to eary humans thousands of years ago.

As a result many people read it at an age where they are filleting its pages for 'symbols' to be reprocessed in exam answers, and sniggering at innuendos such as blowing the conch.All of which is a shame, as Lord of the Flies articulates a theme of the innate savage just under the surface of civilized man. A trope that has spawned a thousand imitators in films and books since, but Golding's novel was probably the first. Beginning as a deceptively simple fable about some well educated British schoolboys stranded on an island after a plane crash, the allegorical story traces their descent into frenzied barbarisim.Golding himself was a schoolmaster for a number of years, and he knows exactly what boys are like. If they are not strictly regulated and controlled, chaos is the inevitable result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Flies","review":"We've just recently read this book at my middle school some of my classmates and I found this book to be unappealing. I thought it was actually a boring book even considering all of the violence. In my opinion, Golding picked a subject for each chapter and dwelt on it. I thought that this was a slow-moving book. Also the way he wrote things was kind of \\"beating around the bush.\\" So my advice to you is if you do not have to read this book, don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ickkk","review":"I'll preface this by saying I was made to read this in the 10th grade, but I really did not like this book. And I graduated college with an English degree. Maybe it's just a boys book, I don't know, but it disturbed me to read and I was thinking the whole time \\"this would never happen, this is the stupidest thing I have ever read.\\" Perhaps this is a classic, but would I tell people to buy it? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"am I the only one who didnt like this?","review":"I just finished reading Lord of the Flies in my gr. 11 English class and I wish that this book was not required to be read in school, because I do not recommend it. Although it was thought provoking, and at times you really felt for the characters, it was too grim a look at mankind. I entirely disagree with Golding's idea of mankind being inherently evil, and that made it hard to get into the book and also made it hard to believe. This was fairly well written, but I have read books that challenged my intelligence more. It is obvious that Golding wrote this book as a way of getting his point across to people, and you can see this because the reading comprehension is pretty simple and most people can breeze through it. I felt that it was borderline propaganda, and I actually regret that i have read it, but I didn't have much choice in the matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"More disturbing than interesting","review":"After reading this book, I think William Golding is a sick, sick man. The book portrays small boys as savages trying to kill each other. Some might find it entertaining, but I find it downright disturbing. I only read it because it was required for school, but I wish I'd burned it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"This is a horrible audio book, read by the author. He offered an engaging prologue, but the reading of the book was just awful. The author was monotone, sighed while reading, and in general, sounded bored with the book. His reading does a disservice to the excellent story that he crafted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ripoff!","review":"If you want to read the inspiration for this book (i.e., the sorce from which it's central concept was copied) readA High Wind in Jamaica (New York Review Books Classics).

This book is incredible and will appeal to anyone with a philisophical side. The in-depth symbolism is applicable towards any time period. Lord of the Flies is a a mind blowing experience and the reader will undoubtably gain from reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little hard to understand","review":"I'm currently reading this book as required reading for next years English class. I'm about half way through and so far, I'm having to force myself to pick it up and continue reading. The plot is sometimes hard to understand and the dialouge is hard to follow. There are often places where there is no indication as to who is saying what. I also find the beginning a little confusing. I know that the plane was shot down but WHY? Was it an accident or was it on purpose? The book is good, I guess, but you really have to WANT to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOOK","review":"THIS BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD TO BE QUITE FRANK IT WAS DISTURBING BUT VERY GOOD I GIVE IT 5 STARS ALL THE WAY IT IS A COMPLEAT MASTERPIECE EVEN IF NOT FOR BED TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no Hunger Games!","review":"Lord of the Flies is alright I guess. I mean, I know it's a classic, but the plot is distinctly lacking in so many ways, you feel like it should be updated for today's readers. For instance, there are no touchscreen interfaces OF ANY KIND in this book. Nobody has a camelback or even an earth-friendly stainless steel water bottle. And unless I'm forgetting something, there's no suggestion whatsoever that aliens or supernatural intruders are secretly present on the island. I don't know, I guess there's just a lot of missed opportunity in this book. Maybe whoever wrote it should think about some revisions? Because as it is, there's really not much to it except a searing journey into mostly unanswerable questions about what it is to be human."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMEBODY PLEASE RESCUE THIS BOOK FROM ITS AUTHOR","review":"This audio CD had me excited at first, at least until I actually played it. It's the most boring read of any story I've ever heard in my life. Golding's a great writer, but he ain't no reader. His own commentary in parts is distracting and irritating. His mouth noises unsettle me, and his slow, dull, expressionless rendering of this classaic grates on the spirit. Too bad an accomplished reader such as Roger Dressler or Garrick Hagon can't do this novel justice. It's just a damned shame is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood and insanity frolics gleefully among the pages!","review":"I have seen several reviews in here that say this book was boring; It wasn't boring, it was nasty! Several people also said it wasn't for people under thirteen. Well, I'm twelve, and I read mostly adult books, so it's not like I didn't understand it. It's just that I hated it! Yes, I admit, there is evil lurking inside everyone, I know. But I find it hard to admit that it could be quiet as much as Mister Golding portrays. There are also some nice little descriptions about a bunch of savage boys dying very painful deaths, and I wonder why anyone would title their book after a pig's head speared on a stick. ??????? In my opinion, if you haven't read this book, dont' touch it, unless you want to have your fingers tainted forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly dull","review":"In my opinion, this is one of the most boring books ever written. Sure, Golding is trying to make a point about power's effect on social stability and structure, but it is lost in the mumbo jumbo style that he writes with. (The movie is also a pathetic depiction of this cliché-ish message.) There are so many books out there that deal with this same topic, and because of this common subject matter, a novelist needs to be truly inventive to create a real masterpiece. This book should not be ranked anywhere near the top 100 novels on the Modern Library Association's list of the best novels of the 20th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliantly memorable","review":"Lord of the Flies showcases the idea that we are empty canasters being filled by environments and echoes the haunting statement that children are capable of immoral acts. Perhaps it uses the Robinson Crusoe idea of isolation.I do think, as inspirational as Lord of the Flies has been, that it's an overblown, overrated affair and that Golding wrote other more powerful works, such as Darkness Visible. The problem for me lies in the difficulties of using children as main characters while writing from an adult point of view. Difficult to relate to, harder to realistically decribe a child's feelings and emotions because, psychologically, the author is on another level (even though the novel's fiction). On the other hand, Golding's style is attractively fluent in that you want to find out what happens next and that's always a good sign for a classic read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Flies","review":"I have recently went through the extremely torturous chore of reading this novel in my eleventh grade English class. I hated this book so much that I went up to my teacher and told her exactly what I thought of this abysmal piece of work. Guess who wasn't too happy. I've heard so many great things about this book, so I just couldn't wait to start it. \\"Yeah, Lord of the Flies, great!\\" From the first page, I hated it. This book is so hard to follow. I read a page. Then I think to myself \\"What the heck was that?\\" I read the page again and only got a vague impression of what was going on and struggling to figure out what William Golding was trying to get across to the reader. Sure its possible to figure it out, but how can you really enjoy a novel if you have to strain your brain to be able to get the badly told story into your mind and keep it there. I disliked this book so much that I removed the cover and glued it on upside down before I gave it back to my teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful but interesting","review":"I am a 14 year old hyperactive male. So as anyone would know, being hyperactive, book reading is not a favorite thing. But when I really started to understand the book I became quite intrigued. This book is based on two conflicts: Man vs. Self and Man vs. Man. It gives a great aspect of how civilization turns wild when no control is in order. It also shares two different points of views. There is more irony in this book in any that I have read (which is very few). Not many people would understand cause even I had to ask for help in understanding. This is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have mixed feelings about this book.","review":"In the book, I have mixed feelings. The first thing that I feel towards this book is that I don't like it. I thought it was more of a boy's type book that was really hard for me to understand. I thought it was very confusing and complicated. As I continued to read the book, it began to make more sense. As you read it, you learn what the main concept is of the book. The main concept is that if you live for awhile without someone watching over you, you begin to become a savage. This is especially bad for young boys. Then I began to like the book a little bit. I liked it because it taught a valuable lesson to the readers and to the boys that were on the island. It taught them that to survive you have to work together as a team. It also teaches the readers how cruel the world can be. This is an okay book once you look at the whole picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book review for Lord of the Flies","review":"The book \\"Lord of the Flies\\" was confusing at the start, but as it progressed it got better as the story unfolded. The book was about a bunch of boys stranded on a island after a their plane crashed. As the story gets going a group of the boys become savage with out rules to go by. Many of the boys die, but some are saved in the end of the book. I only recommended this book to someone who doesn't mind demonic behavior or violence otherwise don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"my opinion of Lord of the Flies","review":"My opinion of the book is that i didnt like it as much and that it didnt pull me in to want to keep reading it.If you like action and like story lines where theres a fight for survival than you would probably enjoy Lord of the Flies.In the story you will see a group of kids that are stranded on a island and theres problems and many adventures that take place and if u want to find out more you'll have to read it for yourself.I wouldn't recommend this book because it wasn't exciting as much and i wanted to stop reading it becasue it was a waste of time for me.This is my opinion for my point of veiw of the book but its up tp you and hope you mgiht enjoy it or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human nature exposed","review":"Lord of the flies is, to me, a metaphor of human history. A group of boys ends up in a desert island after a plane crash and they have to struggle to survive. The battle of leadership begins shortly and two styles arrise. One is a symbol of order and civilization. The other is the opposite: anarchy and barbarism. Everything happens through the eyes of these boys, whose hope is to rescued. Highly recommendable if you liked Animal Farm for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Flies tells about what it takes to be a leader.","review":"I just finished Lord of the Flies not more then 20 mins ago.I had my doubts on this book very much.I have read many books in my life but this one had one of the best endings.I wasn't that happy with the book for the first 100 pages or so,but the rest was all good from there.Lord of the Flies shows the meaning of the struggles it takes to be a leader.There were key moments in the book nthat foreshadowed the ending.One was in the Beginning when Jack Showed a certain quality that showed that he had the quality to be a leader.When Ralph blew the Conch the First words that JAck said were \\"Who is the man with the trumpet?\\"That foreshadows the leader qualities he has by his curiosity for his choir's sake.I am not going to go any more into detail but you should buy this book and do not give up on it.It has a great ending that you will enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book For Everyone","review":"The book written by William Golding, Lord of the Flies is a great book. It not only captures the minds of readers of every age, but it states a point about human nature. I think Golding's point in writting this book is to tell show us that there is a \\"beast\\" in all of us. As young Simon so clearly states. I agree with him on this point because at one point and time we all can loose control and become \\"savage\\". Golding was brilliant for using children to bring this point across, because so often we think of children as being the complete example of innocence. And I think as the years progress or situations change, we gradually loose our innocence. This book was great and I would recommend it for children and adults of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review","review":"In my opinion, Lord of the flies was on of the dullest books I have ever read. It started off slow and at times I found myself trying hard not to fall asleep. The plot was actually quite interesting, but William Golding wrote it in such a way, sometimes I couldn't understand exactly what was going on. His word choice left me scanning through a dictionary a majority of the book. Yet this book did contain some quite profound symbolism. The theme would have to be the best party of this novel, being it relates to the real world or the cruelties of the real world.Some of the scenes in this book are actually quite violent, and unrealistic being that the kids are so young. In fact, numerous times I became sick to my stomach. Some of the scenes were good and beautifully written but overall I felt most of it was superfluous ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book is amazing. Some people says it's not realistic, people don't behave that way, it doesn't represent makind... Thousands of people are killed everyday around the world. The rich countries get richer and richer while the poor countries get poorer and poorer. Hundreds of millions of people around the world don't have anything to eat or drink. Small kids are forced to work for the benefit of occident companies.Who dares to say *we* are not evil?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great read","review":"Like most high-school kids, I read \\"Lord of the Flies\\" and forgot about it. That is until this year when I was forced to read it again in order to teach it to my tenth-grade class. I had forgotten what a great read it is. As a teen, I missed out on so much that Golding had intended. Today--now that I'm a little older, a little better at understanding novels--I see so much more. The symbolism is wonderful, as is the book as whole. Plus: this is a beautiful edition and the E.M. Forster intro is brilliant. If you are looking for a heavy read, you might want to try something else. But, if you're looking for a great, quick read, give \\"Lord of the Flies\\" a whirl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of The Flies","review":"Lord of The Flies, by, William Golding is basically based on a childhood fantasy everyone would like to explore.The book mainly revolves around a group of English teenaged boys whos plain crashes on a desserted island.The boys basically have to live and fend for them selves without grown-ups. Scavenging for food,building huts,tools,weapons,and defending themselves against the island monster. All in all if you like the thrill of a hunt and remember the fantasies of living on a deserted island as a kid this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Depiction of a Cruel and Barbaric Society","review":"A great book... A wonderful depiction by Golding of a group of teenage boys that are supposed to be \\"civilized\\" boarding-school students but turn wild and barbaric as a result of the harsh island environment that they are set in. This book provides a powerful representation of our own society, and how these animalistic natures all exist in the underlying shadows. Although the adult in his ship rescues the kids at the end, the point is made by Golding in the Epilogue that, even though the kids are rescued, who will rescue the adult? Lord of the Flies connects all readers with its harsh, gritty setting and the personalities of all characters"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic!","review":"I read this book again for the first time since high school. It still holds you from page to page!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, that was pretty bad!","review":"I think Golding really screwed up on this one...I found the plot really boaring and unrealistic. There were too many characters and most were undeveloped. And just when I thought the novel was the worst thing I ever encountered, I saw the old black and white Lord of Flies Movie. I really honestly think that a three-year old directed this...P-U."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described!","review":"This book is not as described. It is basically a paperback with a flimsy hard cover attached. I returned it.

How this book gets onto college lists is beyond me. Are we actually meant to interpret/understand the vague imagery, if that's what it is? Boring. Unfortuantely this is my first Golding book, and I'm afraid it will be my last... for some time at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moral Lesson Wrapped in a Story","review":"Don't expect to read this book for entertainment value--it's too dark and disturbing. This book is basically a moral fable that illustrates the innate character flaws in human nature. In order to illustrate the point that human nature is inherently flawed, the author chooses to use young children stranded on a deserted island as his means to do so. Although the children start off with some standards and an attempt at civilization, the flaws in human nature ensure the group devolves into anarchy. The point is that civilization and morality take effort, they are not natural. This is an instructive and important book, if not a happy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows the true nature of man vs. survival","review":"I just finished this book for English, and I felt it nailed its message pretty well. The symbols and deeper meanings are really an early attempt at exploring the true nature of children vs. their morals under survival situations. It is sad seeing how young boys can do this to each other, but it is very realistic in its psychological views, and shows how anyone has the ability to give into power and impulses under the right circumstances. The ending just pieces everything together, and shows the true impact the actions have caused these boys emotionally, even though it is a little anti-climatic. In the end, the basic moral is to not give in to your natural impulses so quickly and not to be quick to judge other people. It also teaches you that anyone has the ability to turn evil when given power, but there will always be those with morals who continue to fight on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame book!","review":"I had to read this book for school and I would say that I and A and B student(not bragging), but I just couldn't understand it!

All it is is an outlet for an author's deranged sybolism. The story is stupid and at the same time, pointlessly graphic. If you want to read a good book, read Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. It is a very good book. Golding, in a vain effort to make people understand his sideways point of view, wrote a parody of 1940's British society. Who really gives a crud? I don't. All in all, please, please, please don't read this horrible, awful, stupid, pointless, terrible book that is a great waste of time. Also, William Robert Gording can suck my big white paperback version of his novel through a straw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Flies","review":"This allegorical novel fails to deliver to its acclaim.

I did not like the plot of this story and although it had an interesting idea I don't think the author did much with it. It is full of violence that is un-needed.

He starts to talk about something and then just moves on to something else. He also leaves you hanging. He also uses way too many uncompleted sentences!

Unlike Harper Lee, whose novel requires a certain level of intelligence to interpret and understand, this novel spits out the themes directly, leaving no space for imagination. Even the symbols are so simple and uninteresting.This book has such a cynical and pessimistic view of the world, that i totally disagree with. I believe that no child would cause such destruction as this, and no child would be like he described, a incarnate of Satan.It is a book with his own thinking. It may be good if one understands and agrees with his way of thinking.I don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Flies","review":"Lord of the Flies was a fantastic story that i would recommend to anybody.

Participating in anything they want they have the time of they're lives.Soon though they're order starts to come to a hault and all they're fun has spiraled into a down fall as they try to figure out how to be rescued. Chaos consumes them for an incredible story with an incredible ending. Four Stars to William Golding for this marvelous novel about brotherhood and representation of society at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A startling insight","review":"William Golding's classic book Lord of the Flies is a startling insight into human nature. It shows humans acting at their most basic, primal level, which to us in modern times is the worst level. This level is one of instincts, fear, and a will to dominate and survive. However, Golding is in many parts too wordy, which interferes with the flow of the plot. I recommend this book to anyone who does not mind a little bit of gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent story - not sure about the narrator...","review":"If I were scoring the story, it would have 5 stars. Unfortunately this reading by the author isn't all that great. For one, it's dated and the audio quality suffers from that. There is no consistency in the sound so one minute he sounds okay and the next as though he's stepped away from the microphone. Another annoying factor is the breathing and sighing while he's reading making the whole thing sound like a chore. It's a pity because this is an excellent story but the narration could use improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"My time to hold the Conch","review":"A true masterpiece. To me on par with \\"Heart of Darkness\\" and \\"Crime and Punishment\\" on the subject of human nature. Each of the boy's, or groups of boy's, personalities are spot on in representing individual human traits. Death, innocence, jealousy, it's all disturbingly spot on. This is a must read for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Welte's Review","review":"The Lord of the Flies was a book that I was required to read at the start of tenth grade. When I started reading the book I wasn't interested right away. I thought the book lacked any action, and I couldn't identify with any of the characters, personally. Honestly, I kept reading because of obligation. Eventually I realized it was a good book. Towards the second half of the book the author added action and the characters evolved. Arguments took place among the boys which started fighting and drama. When the story started picking up it had me excited until the very end. Overall, I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a great adventure book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely evil!!! - in the good way","review":"90% of this book's readers (including me) read it in high school. I'm the only one in my class that loves it. This book is for thinkers that like peering into the savage part of our nature. Besides, it's about seriously messed up, angsty, half naked British boys! The bast parts are the confrontations between Ralph and Jack and watching the tumbling transformation of all the boys. It leaves the reader yearning to know what happens after the ending (which in itself is a brilliant passage of irony)Woe to Simon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fighting for Survival","review":"Have you ever had to fight for your own survival? In Lord of the Flies by William Golding, a group of kids crash on a deserted island with no adult in sight. The kids choose a leader, Ralph, who fights for the survival of the group.I felt this book was slow in getting to the turning point in the plot. When I did reach that point it changed so drastically it left me puzzled. Reading this book was a chore. I struggled to keep myself interested through every chapter. The characters behaviors kept changing and it made the storyline hard to follow. I do not recommend this book to readers who crave exciting and interesting plots.-Tim Fox"},{"rating":"2","title":"A High School Student's Short Opinion","review":"I was required to read this book in my Honors Literature class. The book started off as somewhat interesting and grew boring, then interesting again. While the rest of the class hated it thoroughly, I took the time to really dig into what the book was about and what my teacher had to say about it. And now, looking back, I think that this is one of the most profound books I have read this year. The use of symbolism is incredible and the book has amazing depth...or maybe I just had a fabulous teacher. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meaningful Masterpiece","review":"With total disagreeance to all of those who say that this book has little to no meaning, I'd like to counter that statemnt. Being a perfectly vivid book with deep meaning and descriptive plots, the author, William Golding, puts deep meaning to this book in a most subtle way that immature ro inadequate readers cannot truly appreciate or find.FOOTNOTES:The deeper meaning of this book ladies and gentlemen, is actually an allegory, a piece of writing that means or symbolises something by using character use or plots. In this book, the group of boys stranded on the island symbolises the human race. Jack is the major antagonist and symbol of the darkness and th interior rages and evilness that we hold within each and every one of us. Ralph symbolises the good within ourselves... But it's not my job to help you all with your reading homework."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book on two levels","review":"This book is not only an exciting adventure story, but a chilling parable for the depths of human nature.

Keep your eye out for great literary devices!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully written book.","review":"If you are going to read one book this summer... read this. This packed with hidden double meanings and awesome realism, it can be strangely haunting at times. The breakdown of order and how it affects the boys psyche makes this a truly provocative book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think the symbolism in this book is not \\"made up\\"","review":"I think this book symbolises the tightly held rope between civilization and mass chaos and degeneration. Piggy symbolises the intellectual and concious mind. This book is a reminder of how thin the line is between humanity as conciousness and barbarism"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good writing, buy not for me","review":"I just finished reading this book in my 8th grade English class. Golding is a fantastic writer, but the book was not my type. There were to many gory detales, but it really made me think. I would recommand this book to anyone who likes to really think about what they read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Flies by Andy Lemmons","review":"The book Lork of the Flies was an ok book. To me I thought there was too many stories going on at the same time and there was to many charcters that the author talked about. Yet it had good adventures I was not really thrilled about this book. If you are looking for an adventure type or survival book then this book is a good book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"I think that the authors purpose for writing this was to send a message that there is evil in all men. I agree with him because the boys expressed it after they lost respect for eachother. They all showed some kind of evil on the island. The literary element that the author showed was symbolism. He handled it very well because it made you want to keep reading to see if his symbolism was true or not. In my opinion, this book was believable because imagine being on the for six to nine months. the boys went crazy thinking about how long they were going to survive which of course made the evil come out in them. The book was less than perfect in the ending. I probably would have had some cops investigate on why some of the boys that were dead looked the way they did. That would have been my way of changing the flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review that won't give away the ending...","review":"Although I found this novel tedious at times, I believe it is well written and held my attention the majority of the time. Golding definately knew what he was talking about. The situations in the book are realistic. I can imagine young boys turning into savages after spending enough time on an island... without grown-ups. The theme of this novel is not purely political or social. It deals with the capacity for evil in all humans. Even in \\"civilized society\\" there is corruption. By the way, there is no cannibalism in this novel... I don't know why that rumor is so widespread, but it's not true. This is not the novel for you if you're looking for something light-hearted and simply enjoyable to read. It is a serious novel that deals with moral issues that are still relevent today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Flies Review","review":"i think the author's message of this book is very clear. He is telling about how mean, cruel, and uncaring people can be, no matter what age. I definately agree with this because of all the horrible things that are seen on the news, it's supports my theory. I think the author used characters best in the book because, in the book, from beginning to end, he analzyes and builds up every character. This is good because it lets you know who you're reading about. This book was pretty much believable, excpet for the fact that the kids were a little too young to be doing what they were doing. Which incidentely, in my opinion, is the only flaw in this book. If i were the author, i would have simply changed the kids ages by making them a couple of years older. If this was done, it would have been much better and more realistic. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+","review":"This book is kind of confuseing and one has to somethimes read a part more than once. However the way William Golding writes teaches many of lifes lessons in an realistic adventure. I would not recomed this book to someone eho dosen't read a lot and/or wouldn't put in the effort to re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel teenagers would love","review":"I personally really enjoyed this book. I believe that it would appeal more to teenager than adults, but both would like it. It has a good beginning with the kids stranded on the island. The novel is a page turner and has interesting and unexpected twists throughout it. The main suspense is wanting to know if the boys are going to be rescued. There are many instances where the novel reminds me of real life today. I would recommend this book to everyone, especially teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Flies by Nate(DINGBAT)","review":"This spectacular classic demonstrates the state of nature when a group of young boys crash on a desolate island in the middle of the ocean in the 1950's. The Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a great thriller that tells a story of how power can overcome a soul and how quickly horrible things can happen. After happiness and hope turn to violence, Ralph is left with no power and turned against by his friends and hunted down.I thought this book was incredible because of the characters and how they acted on the island. I began to wonder what it would be like to live on an island with forty other kids my age and no adults, I came to the conclusion that it would be terrible and it would be grand chaos. I would recommend this book to teenagers and adults over the age of twelve because it has very intense action and hard language for a small child to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic for good reasons","review":"This novel has become a hoary old standard of high school literature classes, but it deserves everyone's attention. In it Golding brilliantly develops the stranded childrens' point of view, enlarging it to the scale of a mythic struggle between civilization and savagery. Don't be put off by this grandiose theme: each of the main characters is a sharply drawn individual even as he represents an idea, and the prose is stunning--a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the flies","review":"William Golding wrote a good book contrasting two types of war. Boys are stranded on an island after a plane crash. They are challenged to face a number of opsticals, including death. The time set is during WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"um......?","review":"In the book Lord of the Flies, the author William Golding shows the reader what it would be like to be stranded on a deserted island. This book is for thinkers that like peering into the savage part of our nature. Besides, it's about seriously messed up half naked British boys. This book has a great plot because it's about a bunch of psychotic kids killing others. This book was extremely intersting and had great symbolism. I gave this book 4 stars because it was a really good book but not the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book I wasen't really to thrilled of finishing.","review":"This was A book of choice I had chose for a book report in my histoy class. As I read the first couple chapters, I'm sorry to say that it was missing something....I didn't really get into it. The plot and descripton of things were kind of boring to me. But I did however, like the description of the platform, with the green water and reflection on the plam leaves. But They way he described the kids,i don't know their faces, and that whole skinny dipping scene and that they're all boys on the island- the way he kept descripbeing them, every detail of there looks- sounded kind of quer to me.--I'm sorry, no offense.

While it might have some important messages and symbolism, it is all buried too deep between the lines. It projects the problems of society onto a group of boys plane wrecked on an abandoned island; in the beginning they all attempt to survive and use the resources that are available, but as they continue to be marooned on the island, their little society becomes corrupted as they become violent and manipulative. The multiple plots, many characters, and headache-inducing descriptions all made this book tedious and unpleasant to read, especially since I had to do so unwillingly for school. I found the fact that the author had to use symbolism for every point he wanted to make, such as the boys turning into monsters, and the pig's skull, got really tiring and boring to read. While this book is considered a classic and I suppose it has its relevancy after all these years, I would not reccomend wasting your time on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"Just wanted to assure all the students who are forced to read this that it won't be that painful. It's a pretty good story about two friends and jealousy and all that interpersonal stuff.

This book was a little bit difficult for me, becauce of the details and the feelings. But I liked the conversation between the characters and I also liked that the book was very dynamic.I recommend this book to anybody who likes to read. I think this is a good novel \\"Lord Of The Flies\\" because it makes you think about how the world is working now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was good","review":"The author wanted to show you the lost of innocence. I agree with the author because the boys were so innocent in the beginning but as time goes bye that soon changes. The author best handled symbolism. For example, the conch represented authority and Piggy's glasses represented nearsightedness. These symbols helped me understand the book. The book wasn't believable because I don't think that a bunch of boys ranging from the ages of 5 and 13 can really survive on an island all by themselves. I think the author shouldn't have Piggy and Simon die in such a cruel way. If I had a choice I would've let them live and I would've had Ralph and Jack become friends again.Overall, I thought the book was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The review","review":"The sequence of events throughout the story were very well designed through the way of Golding's description abilities. Sure, sometimes it does become annoying and you lose your place a lot, or you can't understand what's going on or who's doing what. Yet, it was still good. The book was, though, within the greater whole, a well written believeable piece. Some of what happened could happen and some of if really isn't that believable. Yet, with how well Golding described it as if he was actually seeing it, that helped get the effect of it being real. Also, none of us really know what would happen if we got stranded on an island. So we don't know how true or untrue the whole actions of the situation are. Some people might agree or not with what all I have said, because everyone interprets things differently, but this is what I think"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Flies","review":"I really enjoyed William Goldings novel Lord of the Flies. It was adventurous, tragic, and very convincing. If you like novels that start off shaky with a high climax and end not happy but not sad you'll love Lord of the Flies."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was not the greatest book","review":"We did not think that the book was very good because up unitl the last few chapters it was soooooooo boring. It took a while for the book to get interesting. It was very disturbing to see 11 and 12 year old boys wanting to kill each other and hurt each other. We liked how there was a lot of symbolism in the book and how it related to what was going on in the time period in which the book took place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Flies is about the animalistic side of everyone","review":"This is not a book that is for somebody who plans on being a dedicated reader. It is not a book that is easily accessable. It was hard to understand the symbolism and hidden features. It was hard to grasp some of the themes. However the message in the book is and important one to learn. It shows us that no matter how young, or old you may be you still have that seed of evil hidden inside of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would recommend this book to everybody.","review":"Golding does an excellent job in conveying man's essential illness in this book. He does a convincing job of proving his theory that man is basically evil, and I would recommend this book to somebody who doesn't read everything on a literate level."},{"rating":"2","title":"steps of corruption","review":"I think that this book is a great example of how corruption can begin and infectiously spread through a seemingly good group of boys. It is great for teenagers and adults to read to see how easy it really is to fall into the bad crowd because you are scared of being a leader of your life and future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever","review":"Omg!!! This book was the best I ever read. It can get you to understand how things can be when you dont have any adult around.This book has a lot of details,and it also has a little of irony.Then it can also relate to many people, like when a person is getting picked on by his name,when people want to fight over being a chief, and when people think they are better then the other kids. But overall i really did enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book","review":"This book was a fantastic book. It really shoes how a society without rules would turn in to.

I enjoyed reading this and so will you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Flies","review":"Like many readers, I first heard about this book in an L.A course in school. I chose to read it for a novel project. The title of the book made me curious as to what it was really about. The first couple of chapters are boring and confusing, so you'll probably have your doubts about it being a good book. As you read on, you'll begin to understand what has happened and you'll agree how William Golding's symbolic meanings are awesome. The ending of the is best and I'm glad I read it. You'll be too! It's definately a five star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"one of the all time greats. this book is so haunting, and horribly ugly at times, you will feel filthy reading it. some of the actions that the characters do, are startling, but you will find yourself thinking that if you were in the same situation, what would you do? it will challenge all of your misconceptions about this book and others like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a good book.","review":"I liked the book Lord of the Flies because of everything that went on. The book is very believable in that you can get stranded in an island during the middle of the war. Also because of the different themes in the book. The author handled writing symbolism best, because you can understand each character. For example, Simon is a symbol for spirtuality. And Piggy is a symbol for reason. I think the author's purpose for writing this book is to show how you can lose your innocence. I agree with the authors message. Although the book was great, the book was less than perfect in that it had too much drastic description about the killing of the pigs."},{"rating":"1","title":"shocking","review":"I was shocked by this book and dont think that it deservs the accolades that has been given.

My teacher said that it related to man's inner self, and she led discussions how Golding is trying to portray that man is inherently evil and killing is man's natural instinct. I feel that this is rather a bleak and completely pessimistic view of humankind, and I do not believe that a group of children, or people of any age for that matter, would behave as savagely as Golding suggests. I did not agree with the themes of the book and did not enjoy reading it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't good.","review":"\\"This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.\\"-Dorothy Parker. That just about sums up my feeling towards this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thematic novel whose theme is not well presented","review":"I read a lot of novels for entertainment purposes, but I'll start off by saying that those I read for school I usually like less then those I read on my own. It is possible I am biased. This novel seems to invite overanalyzation in the worst way. The flimsiest throwaway line can be sought out and examined for meaning. These meanings often reflect only what the reader wanted to see. I think Golding was trying to make a point and did a passable job at doing it. I think he lacks subtlety, however. The books that carry the most weight in my mind are those which do so in a manner you hardly notice, but at every turn Lord of the Flies screams out, \\"there is an innate evil in humans!\\" Its ending seems contrived and somewhere along the line it acquires a nightmarish quality that seems to me to detract from the theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"How thin the veneer of civilization ..","review":"I first read this book as a young teenager and I've revisited it twice since then. There many messages in this novel for those who seek them but for me the key message was how a group of children organise themselves in order to survive.Resourceful, ruthless and inventive are some of the adjectives that first came to mind. The boys demonstrate the best and then, increasingly, the worst of human behaviour. Jack and Ralph each have strengths and weaknesses: there is no single leadership model which best addresses the situation the boys find themselves in.Whether you read this as an allegory or as a black and bleak adventure story, 'Lord of the Flies' invites you to think about what you might do in similar circumstances.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say...","review":"I am sorry to say but this has to be one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. First off whatever plot was meant was basically pointless, in fact the plot was basically non existant. The writing was focused on what the author thought probable, however this probability is highly unlikely. I would never actually want to read the book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Book","review":"I think Lord of the Flies is a very good book, aside from the parts where kids die(the littlun with the mulberry birthmark, Simon, and Piggy). The book goes really deep, and gets very disturbing when you think that people you know could do the same things the savages do to fellow human beings. You can put yourself and your friends in the characters' places and imagine the same things happening to you. Freaky!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Flies, A Society Eye Opener","review":"This book in my opinion is a decent book for a adventure sotry or for a exotic novel. But what it is good at is opening a eye to what our society is really like. Lord of the Flies is about about 20 or so english kids who crash land on a deserted island that know ones knows about. The actual LOTF means Devil or Satan if translated. The Devil in this book sads for the boys evil in killing a pig and putting its head on the stake so the \\"beast\\" won't kill them. It goes on for a while and then the boys split up and become savages killing 2 kids. This book represents all the flaws in society and how all men (and women) are truly evil at heart. I hope you liek this book and I think you would enjoy reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review on Lord of the Flies","review":"Lord of the Flies is a very interesting book about a group of English school boys who are stranded on an island. The book takes you through the journey of these boys. They have to deal with the fear of the beast in the dark forest, the fear of each other, and the fear of no escape. The book shows how normal boys can turn into savages and turn against each other. The two main characters, Jack and Ralph, start off friendly but as the story developes tension rises, and things take a turn fot the worst. In the novel, William Golding uses suspense and mystery to keep the reader interested. I would recomend this book to everyone. Golding's descriptive novel will keep you interested from start to finish. It will also keep you in suspense about whether ot not the boys will get off the island."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"easily one of my favorite books of all time, particularly in the fiction category. the author gets across his point about human nature being basically animal in a humerous and even sometimes gripping way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life on a Island","review":"Lord of The flies is a good book that has many suspensful conflicts.

It is easily understood plot wise, a group of young school kids are stranded on an island. But the book is far more complex because it truely explores the dark hidden depths of human nature, and what people would do if there was nothing around to hold them resposible for their actions. I read this book before it was ever assigned to me, and I loved it then, and I still love it today. Everytime I read it I find something new and different that I did not catch before.

His name is Ralph. They all just want to have fun but the littleuns don't listen to the older ones like Ralph and Jack. Then every one starts turning on every one. Ralph and Jack are arguing and the littleuns just swim and play never help with anything. Jack is starting paint his face with different colors while he hunts. Then he kills a pig. Ralph wants Jack to make shelters and Jack wants hunt so they start fighting and Jack takes a group of kids and he has a tribe. Jack and his tribe kill some of Ralph's tribe. It's a very good book you will have to see what happens to Ralph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Disturbing","review":"Lord of the Flies is a menacing look at the true nature of man, or the author's idea of it. I found it an unbelievably shallow look at the human spirit. Just thinking of this book at night keeps me from getting a good nights sleep.

The writing is great. It is also a great study on human nature. It is the perfect example on why anarchy can not work. Human nature does not allow a society without hierachy to function. It all falls apart in the end. Also when one reads the book, one can also get a lot of pop culture references to the book like the conch, and piggy.

It wasn't very interesting and for the most part it was difficult to understand. I still haven't completely grasped the concept of why it was called \\"Lord of the Flies\\" even though it was explained to me many times. I cannot grasp the smaller themes in the book, but I did understand the overall theme. I had a very bad opinion of this book until I went back to school and parts of it were read aloud to me. I think that this book is much better when read aloud and with emotion, however it was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not understand this book!","review":"I hated it, it was soo confusing.

The best part was when the kids were getting killed then the story started to pick up a little but then it got dumb after the rampage stoped. Thats why this gets a rating of two."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Flies","review":"\\"The Lord of the Flies\\"The Lord of the Flies is a really great book. I was assigned to read this in my reading class. Some other people thought it was to big of a book, which had very small words, so they changed their books to \\"Tanning the Star Runner\\", which was about the same as my book, but they had a lot bigger words. About the story, it is about a bunch of kids and they got into a wreck, and they all landed on an island. They all spilt up and went their different ways. The main characters are, Ralph, Jake, Simon, and Piggy. Ralph took the little boys known as the \\"Littluns\\". Jake took the older boys because they knew how to hunt better than the littluns did. Piggy went with Ralph only because Jake didn't like him. When they all got to get rescued Jake took all the credit for everything and for the responsibility of everyone there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Flies RULES!!!","review":"I am 16 and really picky about books and if you like survival books then this will be great for you but if you also like to just read this will be great for you from BILLY W"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I was asked to read this book, and I thought the title was interesting. Well, I was wrong. The only good part was the last chapter!!! Here is a basic synopsis of the book: A bunch of boys are stranded on an Island. They know how they got there, an airplane. None of them know each other (unless they went to school with others), yet they were all on the same plane. The pilot did not survive. Some of the boys become obssessed with killing while others are obssessed with being rescued. Kids die and a few turn cannibalistic. I won' t tell you the end, but there is absolutely no point in reading this book unless you like being bored out of your mind when reading. By the way, the title has relatively nothing to do with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"As a teen entering the 9th grade at private school, I was instructed to read this book by the school. I, of course, read the book, but did so with pain. This is not a long book, but not short either. It took me about a week just to read all 208 pages. I was unimpressed by the topic of this book, several young British boys stuck on an island, and in my opinion, this author was in la-la land when he wrote the book. Although this is just my opinion, it was agreed on by my father, who read a small ammount while he waited for me at an appointment. If you love fantasy stories about people on deserted islands that try to form a government and fail, then resort to killing each other, this is definately the book for you. This is not a book I would recommend for those my age, 14, at all. I will say, however, that the ending reflected the main idea of the story and was excellent. The book was still difficult to read and I hope this review will warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"lord of the flies","review":"I hate this book. It was by far the worst book ever. The book could easaly be 10 pages but it was like 300 pages. The book was so slow. The book had to much detail, I had no idea you could have too much detail.I would never recommend this book to anyone. My little tip to the auther is to never write another book. I would rather read cifford the dog.The whole plot of the story is the same as \\"Lost\\" so that is kind of cool. The book was with kids so it made the book more intresting but not by much. I felt reading this book is a punishment.

Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! So Good!","review":"I mean it!! It's just so good. With the flies, and the Christian symbols. (\\"Lord\\". Get it?) And that Bill Golding, he's so arch. It's no wonder they gave him the Noble Prize. My girlfriend read this one and that other with the island and the lobster, and the other one, with the apes, like that one movie, and she thought they were just the best. And she knows her literature.So buy this book and read it right away! And I'll bet you can buy both the movie versions here, so buy them too, right now, because you won't regret it.

This book does just that perfectly. At the beginning of the book, nearly all as well. The turning point is the slaughter of a pig, an event whose symbolism can become more clear later. The Cliffs Notes available for a low price greatly enhance the reading, and define several British words used. Also, the characters and their allegorical symbolism are explained. This book is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Flies","review":"I purchased the book on cds for my daughter's 8th grade class.

It really opened my eyes to the evil nature of human beings, and how, if we let it, that evil nature will come out. When they first land on the island, the boys are all dressed in a uniform, and they are proper, as their upbringing would cause them to be. There is, however, a huge difference in their appearance and attitudes at the end of the novel. All of the boys are dressed up like savages, with paint on their bodies. None of them care at all about rules or regulations or what is right or wrong. That shows just how easily humans can turn from good to evil. I enjoyed reading Lord of The Flies because there was usually never a dull moment. In every chapter, there was always something new developing. This was a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was really boring","review":"I hated this book, along with my other book i had to read this summer.

It is more like stale beer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most hopeless book I have ever read","review":"I really don't know what kind of criteria this book met to receive as much acclamation over the years as it has, it is the absolute worst book I've ever read. Pessimistic, cynical, jaded and completely blind to the truth of the human condition, Golding uses this book as an opportunity to highlight the worst part of the human condition. Golding's message that mankind is imprisoned by civilization, and once we are freed from it we will return to \\"savage\\" roots is baseless and nihilistic. Save yourself the agravation and do not read this book. If you are looking for a cautionary tale of some sort, read 1984 by George Orwell or anything other than this insulting piece of overrated literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written , but disturbing!","review":"The purpose of this book was to reveal the loss of innocence.

Universiality or something appealing to all people is a criteria in judging good art."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Flies\\" is a mean and flawed book","review":"Golding proceeds from the flawed premise that human beings, if left to themselves, will revert to their animal natures. Obviously it's flawed because otherwise we would never have achieved civilization in the first place. Besides the general degredation of humankind that Golding appears to relish, the book also fails because of its silly, deus-ex-machina ending. In short, about the best thing that one can say about this book is that it's widely read; but then again, so was the Little Red Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book Ever Written","review":"The Lord of the Flies was without a doubt one of the stupidestand most pointless books I've ever read. Some people say it had adeeper meaning, a meaning that could change the readers life. To those people I say, \\"Get a Life!\\" There was no meaning or point to it at all! The book was about naked kids running around killing each other for no reason. It was retarded! It's not even worth my time writing this review - the only reason I am is to warn others who might innocently pick up the book because they heard it was good. My advice: don't waste your time or money (this book doesn't even deserve to be rated as 1, but I couldn't get negative numbers)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Lord of the Flies\\" Sinks","review":"This is the only book I've ever read that I actively dislike. I'd be tempted to say that it's an accursed book. The imagery is somewhat confusing and, when worked out, sometimes means the opposite of what I think it should mean. There is some semblance of a plot, but it does not follow a clear story line. The thoughts behind the book are garbled, the language often muddy, and one has the feeling that if there had been just one female on the island of whatever age, none of the events would have happened. These were not the actions of boys. It was not a representation of society. It butchered my mind as surely as the schoolboys butchered each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to Read LotF again","review":"Unlike most graduates of American primary and secondary schools, I managed to get through high school without reading William Golding's Lord of the Flies. I first read it to familiarize myself with the text in order to better assist a student I was tutoring. Since its publication in 1954 readers and scholars have found it to be a perfect subject for infinite speculation and theorizing as to its philosophical and allegorical underpinnings. But even apart from theory, Lord of the Flies is a marvelous novel for its attention to pure story. My recent re-reading of the text revealed Golding's real gift as a writer is in revealing tone, voice, emotion, and character."},{"rating":"2","title":"More interesting at the end","review":"This book is a little slow at the beginning, but if you keep reading it gets very intersting. Even if you don't get all the symbolism in it, the story is still exciting even if it is depressing. Although I don't think they needed to describe the bloody pig hunt in as much detail. Give this book a try if you like adventure or symbolism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Flies asks us to question human nature...","review":"In William Goldings timeless tale, Lord of the Flies, we are shown a much darker side of human nature.

You will be shocked by you findings. If you have seen films on this one, ingnore them. No film can touch William Goldings pen on this one.

But, with further reading and understanding of the book, I really came to love it. I wouldn't hesitate in calling it my all time favorite novel. On the surface, Golding seems to be merely telling a tale of a group of boys stranded on an island. However, a closer look reveals Golding's true intentions of depicting the world and war as depraved and corrupt. He has an extremely pessimistic view of human society and this can be seen through some of the actions of the boys. I would also like to say that Ralph is a great character and the movie is one that should not be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfull book","review":"this book has many symbolisim,and it is mainly about human behaviors.

This book has lots of themes, and I think that it also shows the loss of innocence. The author Mr. Golding described the setting so detaield, that you could watch a movie in your head.

Although it's been 50 years, his story remains timeless. It deals with the pure essence of what it is to be human, and how it is to loose that humanity. The event begins as a group of boys find themselves alone on a deserted island after a severe plane crash; they are quickly drawn toguether by a conch blown by Ralph. Since the very beggining of the book a conflict of interest is noted between Ralph, the leader; and Jack, the hunter. This conflict does nothing but expand and broaden, until finally all hell breaks loose. Lord of the Flies is more than a story, it's a walking breathing epic of symbolism, as colourfull, lively and destructive as the human race itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"lord of the flies","review":"\\"Awwwwwww\\" screamed the Littlun, \\"It's a beast\\". The older boys reassure them that it's only their imagination, because that's all the littluns have for comfort. English boys stranded on an island with no first aid kit, nor any food. They have to try and stick it out and build some sort of a community until they get rescued. But along this journey, survival becomes betrayal, and back stabbing. Ralph, the main character, convinces everyone that they all have a part in living, and having some part of getting saved. But the rebel of the island, Jack, has a different plan. Becoming obsessed with killing and ruling above everyone, including the leader Ralph. They try, Ralph's plan but all fails and chaos strikes, with Jack leading the way.

I read this book late last year...it is about an all-boys scout getting into an airplane crash and getting stranded on a deserted island--with no adults supervising them. First few days work out so-so but then it starts turning into cave-manism(if that's a word) and then later on canabalism(almost). This book really teaches a lesson, about people, how they really are.

I could picture myself in these kids shoes trying to survive, struggling for leadership and trying to stay cool when faced with totally anarchy.

What a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not like this?","review":"I gotta say, I loved this book. Leaving all the school reviews behind of foreshadowing and such, I really could associated with all the main characters and see it through thier eyes (except Simon, not much of a mystic myself). I could feel the power trip of Jack, speak the voice of reason of Piggy, know that it's gone too far like Ralph, and mindlessly follow the masses as a child. It's IMO, a real reflection of human nature. READ IT!

Reading it now as an adult this will no longer be the case, it will stay with me forever. There were two parts in particular, two of the main events, that as I was reading I literally felt sick to my stomach and had tears in my eyes. This book is really quite disturbing and I realise now that really it was a big ask to get a bunch of 15-year-olds to read and watch this and perhaps if my memory was better I could tell you why it didn't affect me like it has today but alas I cannot but I must say I also wonder why not, maybe it was just too disturbing and I blocked it, who knows?

I must say that this book is engrossing. Sure, there are some that won't like this book, maybe it is so because they did not fully comprehend the story, thus they make hasty judgement.

It did not bring out any emotions in me at all while reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece of Modern Literature","review":"Lord of the Flies is, in my mind, one of the greatest novels in the Englsh language. It is an errie combination; it delves into the dark philosophical content of Heart of Darkness in context of a childhood adventure story reminiscent of Peter Pan, and it blends the two perfectly. This confuion of innocence and evil adds a singular flavor to the book, which simultaneously chills and entertains the reader. Lord of the Flies is an absolute must-read for anybody of relatively mature age who is interested in examining the animal side of human nature. The book is thought-provoking, memorable, beautifully written, and entertaining. It carries my unqualified recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating, disturbing, and insightful read!!!","review":"this is most definetely the best book i have been required to read in high school. \\"lord of the flies\\" symbolizes the evil within everyone of us and survival with no rules. this novel is defenitely worth reading- but not for children. this book hints at a different form of reality- where there are no rules, no compassion...only survival. it will make you doubt yourself and help you to see things differently. it's a very enlightening and insightful book, and i loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"A novel full of action and adventure.

Every-time I see a temporary bank I dream and then I remember the troubles Dortmunder and company have in this book. First - the wheels - removed when the bank is put in place. Second - where do you put a stolen bank? and third - the safe, can your lockman open it?I am happy that Victor is not a recurring character - appearing in only one more book in the seriesNobody's Perfect.I really don't like Herman either. He does not seem to be a very good lockman. He shows up again in Nobody's Perfect and inWhat's the Worst That Could Happen? (Dortmunder Novels).Overall, this is a good solid Dortmunder book but as the second in the series the team is not yet together.I have just discovered that Nobody's Perfect is book number three. After I reread it, I will find book 2,Jimmy the Kidand review both together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets old quick","review":"Dortmunder stories are amusing, but this one would best be served by being a short story rather than the short novel tht it is. The premise of stealing a bank, temporarily located in a mobile home trailer while construction of a new facility is going on is certainly entertaining and humorous, the book even in its compact form drags on. If you love the antics of Dortmunder and his cohorts, you will probably like this as it follows the same formula as others. However, if you are looking for a humorous story that is more than absurdity then pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a tad plain","review":"I really had no complaints about this set when I bought it on an impulse: I knew Rousset's name from his role as baroque opera conductor, and I figured I couldn't go wrong.His Goldberg Variations are very good...but he takes twice as long as Gould. On the other hand, I hardly noticed because I enjoyed them so much. The other works seem a little stiff, either from interpretation, or just because they aren't supposed to be Bach's most passionate. Either way, if you appreciate Bach + Harpsichord, I can't imagine you would have too much objection over this four-disc set."},{"rating":"2","title":"GLAD's early band years at it's best!","review":"This is what I consider to be one of GLAD's best band albums. Not only in musicianship but lyrically as well. This album may have been released in 1982, but the songs are still relevant today. And their listening styles are easy as ever, with light jazz to a 80's pop feel, they have it all. I have loved listening to this album for so many years, it's been such a blessing to me. And just to let you know...if I was stuck on an island with only one GLAD band album to choose, this would be one of my top picks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lost CCM CLassic","review":"One of Glad's early recordings before they became an acappella unit. I did not recognize it at first due to the change in cover artwork (my old LP had the band in front of an old juke-box but without the green border. Superb songwriting, musicianship and vocal harmonies are what's in store on this excellent recording of diverse tunes assembled in a attention-holding mix.. The music style blends rock, jazz and pop styles effectively. This disc should be re-issued if it hasn't already, but then the CCM record industry seems reluctant to do so with many if not most of the early to mid-era classics. Get it when you find it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Isn't The John York","review":"I haven't actually listened to this CD. But, this is not the John York who played with The Byrds from 1968 to 1969. This John York CD has been linked to this along with a book on The Byrds. It's a different guy. Just thought you should know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good.","review":"Funny, sad, and heart-warming without being corny. The characters and the sometimes borderline surreal-ness of their lives reminded me a bit of ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. If you like Marquez, you'll like this book. Be patient at the beginning though - you won't realize how good it is until after it's over. But the ending felt a bit contrived. Anyway, great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Difficult Read","review":"This was a tough one. It felt as though the author was on a mission to use every word in the dictionary only once. People just don't speak this way. It took me less time to read Atlas Shrugged."},{"rating":"1","title":"briliant","review":"This is probbably the best book i have ever read.it starts of good and gets better.it keeps geting better and the end is the best bit.if i had not read this book i would read it again.there are so many good bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read","review":"This book starts badly and gets progressively worse. By the time I had finished this \\"book\\"(!), I just felt compelled to register my disgust throughout the world. I really do not see what all of the fuss is about. It is just too farfetched, I mean, all the book is, is \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" set in the backdrop of some God-forsaken island that no-one has heard of. In closing, I would just like to say that I think that this book should be \\"nitrogenated\\" over, as Dr Iannis so succinctly puts it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, except for the bit where Corelli fails to return","review":"It was all exceptionally well written. But in all honesty a man who had fallen so much in love with Pelagia and who had gone through so much with her and with her family and friends etc, would not have returned just for a glimpse of her only to disappear for 30 years...that was unrealistic. If it had been me I would have run over to her and embraced her!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read, but runs out of steam toward the end","review":"This is an excellent book overall, but I felt the author rushed the last 100 pages or so. They are simply not up to the standard set by the rest of the book. Maybe an editor wrote them? It struck me that somebody said \\"OK you've got 80-100 pages left, so wrap it up Louis\\" ...so it ended up a bit flat. However, the first 400 or so pages had everything and I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much up to that point."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books written -- almost","review":"Man, this was one great book. I can't remember the last time a novel invoked such passion. But that ending -- humph, it's like de Berniers just got tired of writing. Don't get me wrong, I love a tragedy as much as the next, but the author's reasons for Antonio's actions in the book's final 80ish pages are wholly unbelievable and bordering on insulting.AND to expect us to believe he had trouble excepting Carlo's secret -- give me a break!This truly is one GREAT book, but I'd like to think the last 80 pages were written by someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin","review":"Captain Corelli's Mandolin is one of the best books that I've ever read. Bernieres created a wonderfully woven story of passion, history, politics which resulted in a clear sense of place and time. It made me laugh out loud in one chapter and shed tears in the next. The characters were well developed and more so in this book than in any other, I truly felt for them. However, I have to say that the ending was not of the same quality as the rest of the book. As I read it I felt as if he were trying to cram it in. This amounted to almost five decades being wedged in the last few chapters. All in all though, I would still highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich prose with a historic mediterranean backdrop","review":"Romance, history and beautiful language this novel has it all. The characters are well developed snd grow with the story. Tragedy and pathos are interwoven in a rich bold tale which updates the Romeo and Juliet theme. None the less, even though the first chapter is linguistically challenging, through gentle perserverance a glorious story evolves. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books Ive ever read","review":"I had almost forgotten what it is like to be completely hypnotized by a novel. But Captain Corellis Mandoline does exactly that! And yes: its all there: humour, tragic, the lot. But most of all: the supreme beauty of an otherworldly kind, to be found also, for example, in the music of Schubert, Jacques Brel or Billie Holiday. Surely one of the best books I have ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a literary masterpiece","review":"an absolute masterpiece.....i have never read a book which was so rich in its prose, in its content and at the same time unputdownable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Protection","review":"This is what I needed.

Picture a really bad Tuesday night made-for-television movie, then imagine paying for it. What was most annoying about this picture is that it's been done before. I am fairly certain that I remembered some of the same footage from one of the 1970's \\"747 at the bottom of the ocean movies\\" -- Airport 1979, I think it might have been. Bad acting, bad dialogue, unconvincing special effects.

It's ok as an album, but if you don't care for their stripped down and under-produced acoustic guitar and piano leanings, this isn't their best work by far.

My daughter is still a beginning skater (Freestyle 1), yet after paging through it, I found 3/4 of the book to be irrelevant to her level. The small portion of the book that would be helpful to her begins on page 161. I would only recommend this book for parents/children who are thinking about beginning skating, or have just begun to take group lessons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected.","review":"This movie has the same characters as the show, but it just didn't seem the same.

When you're used to those bite-size 15-minute Franklin stories, this was a LONG one -- we has to stop it and continue later. However, it's a cute story, and especially useful since we are expecting another child just like Franklin's family, so we will use this tape as one way of preparing our son. It's a little strange to see Franklin and gang doing song-and-dance, I have to admit. And I missed the toe-tapping \\"Hey, it's Franklin\\" at the beginning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Franklin's Feature","review":"My 4 1/2 year old LOVES it. The first day he watched it 5 times. Not bad for an austic child who dosen't sit still. Not for the very young because of the length (75 mins)Great songs and a wonderful message.

We were studying the Guilded Age and the teachers felt this novel would help to portray exactly what people went through. Needless to say I was very bored. The descriptions are so intense and Dreiser's style of writing was not enough to keep me awake. There were certain aspects that I enjoyed, however the majority of this novel was comprised of verbose sections. This book did not really meet my expectations and I was not very satisfied. However, I was told that you might need to read it 5 times before all of the meaning would come through. I wouldn't give it the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating viewpoint on some very big issues","review":"This book challenges many commonly held perceptions about our economy.

She imagines herself being able to have a variety of occupations when she gets older. I teach ESL (English as a Second Language). I found this book when I teaching about occupations. All children seem to love Little Critter, in this case his sister, so they are motivated to want to read about the occupations mentioned in the book. The pictures are great, full of lots of clues about the words on the pages. There is a minimum of text which makes it easier for children who are just starting to read to manage.

It has remained in my memories for over 15 years. When I found it on Amazon, I had to have it. The story is of extreme pain and extreme love. How far will the extremes go? how deep are the wounds of pain and how deep is the love that one man has for a woman he knows he can never have? how far will he go for her? this movie is very deep and emotional, one of the best Dicken's stories.

Masterpiece Theater got the Emperor's New Clothes instead of A Tale of Two Cities. Madame Defarge as a pin-up model, indeed. Switch her with Miss Pross and you've got it. Avoid this movie at all costs. 5 stars for putting your English class to sleep, teachers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate But Boring","review":"This is probably the most accurate version of \\"A Tale Of Two Cities\\" but, it's the worst version to own or watch. Sticking strickly to the plot of the story and historical facts this movie has no spark or passion. It's an easy out though for the teens to lazy to read the book for English.The movie is extremely long which is part of the problem and the acting is horribly done.I found myself straining to stay awake. The script is something out of the Middle Ages with no modern word adaptations it's hard to imagine any of the characters are \\"real.\\" The storyline is straight out the book with no hollywood adaptations this causing part of the problem-- you don't get any sparks between Lucy and Carton- or dialouge. It focuses more on the war and hardly anything on the romance or passion in the story.All in all this movie in my opinon butchered one of the classic love stories in literature.

It takes the stories and looks at them in the order in which they were written! This book is a wonderful look at the \\"periods\\" in the Baum Canon.

That Ms. Barrett would even presume to complete the work of one of the greatest English authors is audacity personified. This book is extremely boring and seemingly plotless. If you're looking for a satisfying completion to this novel choose \\"Sandition\\" by Jane Austen and \\"Another Lady\\" instead. Ms. Barrett not only fails to deliver the wittiness and sharp insight of a Jane Austen novel, she also fails miserably at attempting Austen's style of writing. Truly a disappointment, to put it mildly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barrett destroyed Austen's story","review":"Jane Austen's fragment is a delightful story which is ruined with the first sentence Julia Barrett writes. In it she has Charlotte repeat the joke the narrator has just told. The language becomes convoluted and flowery. All the characters sound like Sir Edward Denham but without the poetry quotations. There is very little action of any kind in the book. Jane Austen's characters fade into the background and the new ones introduced by Barrett take over the story. Charlotte, Lady Denham and Sidney Parker seem to change character completely as soon as Barrett takes over the writing. She takes six or more pages to say what Austen would have put in a couple of sentences. What plot there is bears little resemblence to anything Jane Austen seems to have had in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a purist, but disappointed all the same...","review":"I am always eager to read completions of Jane Austen's work, unlike those who find it unthinkable that anyone should touch the gems she left behind. I find Ms. Barrett's work disappointing, however, because it appears to me that it lacks the subtlety and charm so characteristic of Jane Austen's: the minimal changes of place and scene, the delicate development of character through conversation and observation, the wry humor she employs and the focus of thought and action through the eyes of her primary characters. This Charlotte is too full of inconsistencies of characterization and plot (Lady Denham throwing lavish entertainments? Lurid tales of piracy and gambling?) for me, and I didn't enjoy reading it. I liked Sanditon by Another Lady much better - I think she did a lovely job of capturing JA's essence and finishing the novel in a manner more consistent with it's original author's style and pattern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but it pains me to say that is was terrible. I am mystified why the author chose to call the book Charlotte because after JA's portion, Charlotte is rarely mentioned. The rest of the story is a collection of rambling, tedious speeches by minor characters. The story becomes ridiculous when the author introduces piracy and horse racing into Sandition. It ends with the inevitable, but unbelievable uniting of Charlotte to Sidney. It is unbelievable because they have barely had 2 or 3 superficial conversations in all of the author's addition to JA's fragment. Don't waste your time on this one, check out Sandition instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"As a lover of all things Austen, I was very excited when I first came upon this book. But this completion of Sanditon is incredibly weak. The plot wanders aimlessly, although \\"wanders\\" is perhaps too favorable of a term since it implies some momentum.Worse, the characterization is frightfully dull. The previous Sanditon completion in the 1970s by \\"Another Lady\\" is vastly superior, fleshing out very memorable characters and making you really care about Charlotte. By the end of this book, I didn't care about any of the characters as they were so frightfully dull. The climactic conclusion was more like an afterthought; perhaps the writer(s) wanted to be done with the book as fast as I did.Avoid this debacle and track down the completion by \\"Another Lady\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time, not worth reading","review":"I found this novel terrible and was a waste of time. I can't bare reading another page after chapter 11 where Austen had left it. This is by far the worst novel I've ever read. If you want to read the completed version of Sanditon, I would suggest Sanditon by Another Lady. It's a good novel and was well done compare to this clumsy one. This novel is not at all worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read cover to cover","review":"I received this as a gift because I am a huge JA fan. I read it through to the end because I read all books related to JA. I cannot believe this book has a rating of 3/5 stars. The plot, as continued by Barrett is absurd in the extreme, and, as others have pointed out, inconsistent and capricious. There is almost no dialogue, a distinct departure from Austen's usual style. A smarmy, confused, verbose narrator conveys most of the \\"story line.\\" Adding insult to injury is the unnatural and awkward writing style. Barring a few grammatical constructions and vocabulary changes, Austen's language is not so different from our own. Barrett would have us believe that people, in truth, fly everywhere and use the conditional every other word. Would that eager JA readers could but be warned away from this unhappy collection of words!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Austen Would Be Proud","review":"Julia Barrett has done a wonderful job capturing the imagery set out by Jane Austen.

My eight year old cousin could write a better continuation of this book. The diction and use of words in the novel make confusing and difficult to read. I was more than half way through the book and could hardly continue. The plot of the story stopped where Jane Austen had stopped. Julia Barrett dwelled too long on the thoughts of other characters and avoided the main character. The writer would not get on with the story. I suggest the novel Sandition. It is far more superior than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful - zero stars!","review":"I love all of JA's work, and have also read many sequels/continuations with varying degrees of enjoyment. But this is by far the worst. It has nothing of JA's style, wit, irony, insight into human nature, etc., etc., etc. The people who gave this 'work' good reviews must only have read the fragment actually written by JA or must be shills for the publisher. For more detailed comments, I recommend reading any of the many reviews which gave 1 star, which I assume they did because they did not know one could give zero, or the amazon web site won't allow it; if you find this review listed with the generous rating of 1 star, then you will it is the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching, Soul-Searching Novel","review":"I recently got done reading this wonderful, yet forgotten novel of Lawrence's.

She goes on the 'universal' self journey and discovers that she was lost and finally finds her identity and sensuality in the man she loves. D.H. Lawrence has a wonderful way of not wrapping up the ending in a nice,neat little package. As always, Lawrence is the ultimate man of mystery, sensual needs and desires. A \\"must read\\" for those who love to read Lawrence and for those who never have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in parts","review":"I found that the first half of the book enjoyable, but the second half not so. From the moment that she meets with the 'Red Indian' troupe the story descends into the unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor construction","review":"Straight out of the box I could not play any record on this turntable without the record grinding at the base of the deck on every rotation. It seems like mine has the same flaw as another reviewer's, which is that the silver base of the unit is not attached firmly enough to hold. I've tried raising the platter with a piece of felt, which prevents the record from hitting the deck, but then the pitch is still a bit unstable and wobbly on many records. I am sure this could have been prevented if Numark had used some screws instead of glue to attach the parts of the deck to one another.However, I am still in doubt whether I am going to return it because I like the overall design and features so much. Hence, two stars instead of one. Maybe I am going to try fixing it with some super glue ... if anyone with the same problem has tried this, I would love to hear in the comments whether your attempt has failed or succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity at its best","review":"The Numark PT01 hits the spot for my needs. I have several hundred vinyl records, including some of all three speeds (78, 33 & 45 RPM) that I need to put on CD so I can listen to them. Most turntables will only play 33s & 45s. The Numark PT01 plays all three speeds. The 45 RPM insert stores neatly in the case. It also has sufficient output to feed into my iBook through an iMic using a RCA to 1/8\\" stereo splitter. I have been able to rip the records and create the digital music files which I am able to burn to a CD.The output is crisp and without any unnecessary EQ. The speed seems to be accurate to get a quality recording even with strings and piano.I do wish it had a lever action to lift and set the tone arm on the record without any noise or undo bumps.Lastly, cudos to Amazon for a significant price break and speedy shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of customer support, flimsy stylus","review":"The turntable feels cheap and flimsy, especially the stylus. It would not play large LPs properly because of uneven platter. Tried to have Numark/Ion stand by their warranty, but they would not respond to email in a timely manner or respond by phone. If you google Numark support, it seems many people have this problem. I will not purchase another Numark or Ion product, and I strongly encourage you not to do so either. Try the Vestax Handy Trax portable turntable instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"tin can with a needle","review":"if your looking at this to buy to play on your house stereo you will probably be disappointed this is a portable player and should be used as such. it has a very tinny sound no depth at all do not be cheap when it comes to purchasing a record player"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted.","review":"On nearly the second anniversary of receiving this player, the table stopped spinning. I called Numark and since it was out of warranty there was nothing they could do for me. The player was awesome. It one of my favorite belongings. The sound was pretty good for a built-in speaker. None of my records were damaged by the player, and the speed never seemed to waver. I gave it one star for every year of enjoyment I got. I'll be buying a crosley next, and if that one craps out I would probably buy another Numark. I just wish it hadn't have broken in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Turntable","review":"I was totally broke during x-mas season and my lovely girlfriend had dropped hints that she wanted a portable turntable to take along on our vynil digging adventures, so i scoured the internet until i found one that was affordable and seemed to be good quality, The Numark name said it all for me. Prompt delivery and she was the happiest woman in the world. Needless to say i got a little more for christams than i expected(in a GOOD way), and it was GREAT! Oh Yeah, the product......it was in great condition and works perfectly, and the built in speaker....is acually alot louder than i expected. GREAT product and Speedy delivery. Thanks.Ricky Corona (MODesto, CA)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure junk","review":"I'd always heard great things about numark products, so I decided to roll the dice on the PT01, a big mistake. The good, is that it is a light weight truly portable turntable. The built in speaker provides pretty good sound for being a small speaker. Why the 1 star? b/c the player is poorly constructed. The shiny top piece is poorly glued on, and pops up rubbing against the record while its playing. This causes the record to wobble and creates a very poor sound. I had to put a weight on the player to keep the piece from popping up in order for it to play properly. Little to say I will be staying away from numark products, and I highly recommend that anyone in the market for a player such as this look else where."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Control","review":"The large silver colored base around the platter would NOT stay in place. It is only held down by a sticky material underneath it. The one I purchased was raised up just behind the platter and rubbed on the record. Very poor quality construction and no final inspection at the factory. Good luck if you buy one. I returned mine to Amazon. It's been over two (2) weeks and I have not received any acknowledgment from Amazon regarding the return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turntable is uneven.","review":"I bought this for my roommate as a Christmas/graduation present. When she opened it and threw a record on we noticed a distortion in the sound which we initially attributed to the record being warped. Several more records later and we discovered that the felt on the turntable was unevenly applied, causing a \\"hump\\" in the record's path under the needle, distorting the music. To be fair, we haven't contacted the manufacturer yet to see if this is something that could be repaired or replaced. It's still disappointing to give a gift that's nonfunctional however."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 years later, it is dead now.","review":"On the back of this record player, it was manufactured in January of 2008 and now in October of 2011 it is dead. Pretty sure the belt just died on it.I had it set up to play through my computer speakers and as long as you have a decent system it should sound good. I played records on it quite often, but I still think it should've lasted more than 3 years. I also had the same issue other reviews stated about the bottom plate sticking up, but I just taped it down and that worked fine.Probably should just pay a little more for something a little better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little turntable!","review":"Now since last year I have been looking for a turntable to use for my lp collection and I have found just what I was looking for. This turntable works great and connects easily with any speaker system that you may have."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money...","review":"i've long wanted to own a numark...if only it wasn't too pricey, until this particular model came along. the functions are pretty basic but the sound is excellent for its range. the thing i like most is that you can carry it practically anywhere you go and for those old enough to be alive when vinyl was king, it brings back memories of playing your 45's on your small phonograph. certainly worth the money. I would've given it 5 stars if it had an auto start and stop funtion though"},{"rating":"2","title":"solid purchase","review":"I got this as a secondary table for when I'm away from home, but I also use it occasionally when I'm out D.I.T.C. 'Works great in both scenarios. It's a tad bulky, but it's sturdy and has a lot of nice features like the various outputs, tone and pitch knobs, etc. I've got buddies who use this as their main turntable. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Mine came today and I was very excited because I have a fair number of 78s and this is one of the few reasonably priced turntables that will play them (or is so advertised...)Unfortunately, it is junk. The top is coming off just like noted in some of the other reviews, and either the belt is loose or the motor is shot because it not only does not play at a consistent speed, but even if it did it would not be at the right speeds...with the pitch compensation at a full 10% positive, it barely reaches the stated rpms. I tried both 33s and 78s, and the AC adapter.Now I am going to have to go to the hassle of returning it to Amazon and waiting for a (more expensive) replacement. I sure doubt it will be a Numark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"I purchased this turntable to listen to records. However, the speaker is so faint it's barely audible. I've returned it and am back to looking for a good one. This turntable is perfect if you're looking to transfer audio or use external speakers...just don't count on it to stand on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turned information over to a telemarketer","review":"Can't say too much about the product itself - it was a gift and I haven't heard anything negative about it, so it may be decent. What irks me to no end is that two weeks later I got a call referencing my purchase of this product and then an \\"amazing offer\\" of some coupon books where they would charge my credit card $1 now, then a monthly fee until I unsubscribe. Every time I steered the conversation towards that charge, opting out, or not wanting to participate, the lady on the phone drove it back towards how great the offer was. It took several tries to get them to take \\"no\\" for an answer.If you purchase this item, be wary of where your information could end up. I don't know if it was the company directly, or if they sold it to a third party, but apparently they already had my credit card information on hand, which is a bit unsettling. I will be monitoring my credit card statement closely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, terribly manufactured","review":"This item is filled with gratuitous functions that should be removed to improve the model overall. For example, battery operation? Is that really necessary? How many people are actually going to take this to the park and play records. To me it was designed only to transfer vinyl to digital format. That's it. With that said it really doesn't need a built-in speaker either. Finally, my biggest complaint is that the unit tends to fluctuate in pitch. This is terrible for djs that want to go digital as it is essential to maintain a constant pitch in order to mix another song. That problem REALLY needs to be addressed by Numark and until they do so I would advise against purchasing this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Numark PT01 Portable DJ Turntable (Purchased on 06/30/2006)","review":"I still did not get the item yet.What is going on?Please let me know ASAP.Thanks,Yong"},{"rating":"1","title":"very low volume","review":"This is a consistent complaint among people who have purchased this unit: THE OVERALL VOLUME OUTPUT IS TOO LOW. (The same complaint applies to the Vestak unit which competes with this item.) I would not recommend this unit, which I returned. The old battery-operated record players from the early 70's are superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if it worked","review":"I received this same record player as a gift a few years ago, and it works fine for me. But when I bought another record player for my roommate, it played for 6 days and then completely died. Flip the power switch, no light, and the machine won't turn when you move the needle. I asked for a return, but won't be receiving any refund because the box it came in isn't the box it was sent back in, because I'd already recycled the cardboard. Apparently, the company values the cardboard box much higher than the machine, so be super careful. It's a piece of crap, and they know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"I bought the Numark PT-01 USB portable turntable in January of 2009 and was pleased with it at first. I hadn't used it for about a year and today when I tried it the turntable did not play at the correct speed. There was no difference between the 33 and 1/3, 45 and 78 rpm settings, and even at the 78 speed the rate was slower than 33 and 1/3. I have no idea how to get this fixed. When I was using it it was also very difficult to get replacement styluses. I don't think Numark still supports this product and wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"TWO CAROLINES, ONE SUCCESS STORY","review":"I remember my 6th grade teacher reading this book about a hundred times to the entire class. We used to always find it funny and make jokes about the story.

Now that my son is almost nine, and going through that \\"I can do whatever I want whenever I want\\" phase, I have him read this book frequently.

It's an ambitious and groundbreaking album, that goes from piano laced ambient (\\"Hymn\\" and the seminal \\"God Moving Over the Face of the Waters\\") to infectious get-on-your-feet techno (\\"Feeling So Real\\") to trance like investigations into deeper musical channels (\\"First Cool Hive\\" and \\"Anthem\\", which is a personal favorite). Though a bit uneven, this is by far a defining album for Moby, and an extremely worthwhile listen for anyone who enjoyed \\"Play\\" or \\"18\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby's best album ever","review":"I love this album, it is my favorite album of all time, and thats all I have to say about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Good","review":"I bought this after listening to Moby's more recent offering \\"Play.\\" I must say that Play is the far superior record (see my review there) and that this CD isn't even worth owning. The slow songs sound like piano instrumentals for a movie soundtrack like \\"The Exorcist\\" and the faster pieces are distorted garbage a.k.a Marylin Manson. Nothing like the brilliant \\"Play\\" CD which mixes trip hop, funk, gospel, soul and acoustic into 1 totally awesome CD. Don't be fooled by Play's brilliance, save your money and pass on \\"Everything Is Wrong.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound, the fury, the mediocrity","review":"This is supposed to be trail-blazing, genre-defining music? Sure, it's more interesting than anything your parents are probably listening to at the moment, but that does not make a great record. If you consider Puff Daddy a more innovative rap artist than Public Enemy and Eric B. then you'd probably also pick Moby over Aphex Twin, Orbital, Leftfield, A Guy Called Gerald, The Chemical Brothers and plenty of other Brits who have done more interesting, compelling things with this type of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby at his peak","review":"I found this in a used record (I still call them records...) store and took a chance on it. It is Moby doing what he does best: mixing.He takes the songs from Everything Is Wrong loosely and tightly weaves them into a joyful adventure. Each CD establishes a different feel but they are both fluid and fantastic.Imagine, one song flowing into the next, no silence between tracks, each song woven as a tapestry. Moby where are you taking us?I think this is Moby at his apex, just before he broke really big and his stuff was sampled everywhere you turned. But Moby initially made it not by being the sample master but by being a DJ who knew how to mix records and really move the listener. This, in my opinion, is the epitome of such a genre.I have yet to tire of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby - Everything Is Wrong","review":"As much of the music released by moby, This Album is spectacular. Each songs fits well with the next. Sweet beats are well mixed with many different tempos. Specifically, the song everything is wrong is slow paced, but portrays a great deal of emotion throughout it. Overall, Any Moby fan would enjoy this Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mixed bag of Moby's best and worst.","review":"While there might me thematic motivations for the periodic instances of the punk/thrash-metal hybrid that occur on Moby's \\"Everything is Wrong\\", it is an unfortunate truth that the songs that exemplify this mode (ie \\"What Love\\") are not, in and of themselves, well done. Remove those hardcore pistaches, and what we have is a melancholy, classically-influenced collection of some of Moby's best, most soulful offerings. The album begins (\\"Hymn\\") and ends (\\"God Moving Over the Face of the Waters\\", \\"When it's Cold I'd Like to Die\\") in the gorgeous, blissed-out heaves and sighs of synthesizers; \\"When it's Cold I'd Like to Die\\" is my nominee for Moby's best work to date. On the whole worthwhile, but spotty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving","review":"OK, so the stuff printed on the CD jacket is pretentious & irritating--what's important is the music...& from whatever inspired Moby, the results are impressive. Although not nearly as catchy or complex as the grooves on 'Play,' 'Everything Is Wrong' dives into both joyous up-tempo & slowly etched electronica. If you're suffering from pre-millennial angst, this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Play!","review":"Moby, the underground techno icon, put his strongest effort is to everything is Wrong. Hymn starts you with a hint of ambient, almost eclastic beauty. Feeling So Real grabs you after the second or third listen. Moby really streches musically here. Its an odd piece that really grows on you. What Love &First Cool Hive brings us to the forefront of the depth of expresion this man is capable of. He took chances that no other artist of his time would take. With Everything is Wrong, he was finalizing the techno bible so-to-speak. We end with Into the Blue- a fantastic piece that leaves you hanging in his grooves. In 1995, Moby was awesome but most folks did not see it. Then the off beat strang attempt with Animal Rights, which even now distance himself from. If you REALLY want to know Moby, this record is a must! Beautiful spin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saved by two tracks","review":"Being a big sopranos fan and having watched episode \\"join the club\\" where Tony is having his dreams while his on the e.r. from a gun wound from his crazed uncle.

Both tracks are wonderfull but i realy hate Mobys techno songs but his slow songs are realy great. Almost the whole album sounds pretty annoying, except for the two slow tunes. Moby stick to your slow songs : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"such a letdown","review":"i had a single from this album and a song called IN MY LIFE completely rocked my world...MY MISTAKE. do not call this album techno. call it top 40, or electronic but not techno and do not call it punk rock inflenced or even rock oriented. there is little rock on this album. this album is the predeccesor to play. if thats your bag then by all means this is for you but it is a bland mix of top 40 wanna be music.i also bought animal rights by moby. THAT is quite electic with a good mix of musical styles...yes i did like the soothing intro of hymn, the funky beat of lets go free (song is 37 seconds long) and the blues of what love but this is not a reason to keep this overrated mess. although i do love the thought provoking essays in moby's cd's but otherwise this is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is WRONG on this CD","review":"This is a marked departure from Moby and his regular music.

Moby has grasped what is needed to create a wonderfull album. People don't understand that Moby is a genius, his music has no catagory (don't belive me? check out his album, \\"Animal Rights\\"). Moby can create dance beats and classical all on one album. Solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is hard to find some THING that IS WRING.","review":"I think that this could be Mobys best album. The best part about the album is the way rock is used. Mobys PLAY > dose not have song that I would call rock.

I have heard it in TV adds and it is in the movie SCREAM, it has a short clip of sound when the movie ends just for a few sec.

Why else would Geoff Downes think he could get away with re-recording the band's best-known hits with a singer-guitarist (John Payne) who can't hold a candle to either John Wetton or Steve Howe?

Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International.

Tracks like \\"Coon On The Moon\\" and \\"Watergate Blues\\" updated the form itself, and he re-invents the past in songs like \\"Moving\\", \\"Trying To Forget You\\", and the utterly amazing \\"Can't Stay Here\\". Some so-called purists were put out by the keyboard-simulated harpsichord on a few cuts, but it only adds to the effect of killer tunes like \\"Speak Now Woman\\". The great Hubert Sumlin is here as well, and if you're a guitar player, clean your ears and listen up. While many people point out \\"The London Howlin' Wolf Sessions\\" as the highlight of Wolf's last years, this album is an even deeper, purer document of maybe the greatest of them all. He's been gone twenty-two years, but I don't think that voice will ever be entirely dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs work","review":"As a wheelchair user, I am always looking for a bag or pouch that I can use on the sides of my chair so when I saw these, they looked like they might work. On the plus side, they attach easily over the chair arms with velcro fasteners and are sturdily made from denim. On the minus side, the pocket is not deep enough and the bag tends to hang over the wheels, getting in the way when I'm trying to push myself around. The product description says they can be used for wheelchairs, walkers and bedrails. I think these pouches would work best on walkers. On bedrails, because of the shallow depth of the pouch, when the bed is raised to a sitting position, the contents of the pouch might fall out. It's a good idea but I think it needs a redesign. I would recommend them only for walkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"works just fine","review":"this pouch is basic, but fulfills its function just fine, especially on a smaller size wheelchair, with limited space on arms and from arms to wheel. Other styles either did not fit or got snagged in the wheel. The only difficulty is it tends to creep backwards, would benefit from some sort of stop - not sure how to design that. I bought this for my 91 year old mother with alzheimers, and she manages to use it as well as can be expected. The price is great, much better than other, unnecessarily complicated bags."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY NICE BUT","review":"VERY NICE PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY.

Let me tell you why; the graphics are choppy and blocky. The music is nerve grating and frenetic. The images are very dark on content as well visually. I missed the gracefulness that I've seen in other DVD of this type and I had to fast forward through most of it as it was giving me one heck of a headache. As I said I hated it, but you must decide for yourself if it is more to your taste. I hope I made it clear why I didn't like so that those of you who enjoy frenetic music and its kind will explore it further, and you who are looking for floating gleefulness and soothing music will Stay Away!

It has gone old though. Once the techniques used in the animation are not so complex anymore, some of then are features of today 3d softwares, some so simple that even my young daughter masters, the animation gets very boring and naive looking at some point.

I know I'm going to have to hold onto this book and refer to it often on my spiritual journey, as a lot of it was difficult to grasp in the first read (and I'm a big reader). As they say, the more I learn, the less I know...and I love it that way. What this book did was to point my way on the journey, and validate the steps I have taken so far.Not recommended for general reading. This book will only make sense to you if you are already on the path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Loved It","review":"You have to read this book with an open mind and heart realizing that humanity tends to 'fight against' things that are perceived as scary. There are a lot of concepts in this book that may create fear in some. You have to feel what is being said through the heart center. Your intuitive sense knows the truth (whether the mind knows it or not). This book answered so many questions for me..questions I had had about feeling like I didn't belong, where I come from, etc. The truth of the matter is that the earth is changing in frequency and we need to choose to ascend with it, or to stay behind..this book talks about that too. Even 10+ years later the information is very relevant. Highly recommended for those who are just awakening or anyone already on the spiritual path."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Setup!","review":"I was going along with most of this until the last two chapters when it becomes very similar to the Left Behind Christian rubbish. Most of the principals the ET's present are very close to Eastern philosophies and religions. But then the last couple of chapters predicts the Second Coming of Jesus where he will collect his flock. Those not ready will have to wait another 26,000 years to be \\"saved\\". One of the ETs even claims to be John the Baptist.

Sure, this book was entertaining; these kids are indeed fascinating. But after reading the Einstein Syndrome, it was clear that my boy is not one of the children Sowell is describing. Overall this book left me with more questions than answers on the subject of delayed speech.If you actually want to do something to help your child, and not just read about other kids who turned out to be super-intelligent engineers, buy \\"The Late Talker: What to Do If Your Child Isn't Talking Yet\\" by Marilyn C.

This is a book that gives parents real answers about how to help their speech-delayed children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Stories, No Real Conclusions...","review":"I purchased this book because I am interested in the topic of language generally.

But ideally *some* analysis could have been done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last half of book borders on offensive","review":"Beware...the author of this book is \\"trained in economics\\" and is NOT a specialist in the field. The first half of the book is interesting in that tid bits of actual research data is presented, but it takes a wrong turn towards the middle of the book. For example, This is an actual quote from the book \\" Some professionals, and especially semi-professionals like social workers and school personnel, have airs of \\"experise\\" and an arsenol of jargon and dogmas...\\" Sounds like the author is describing himself.The author also shys away from early intervention... I am totally clueless. Don't waste your money or time.

This book seems more an homage to the author's late-talking son, who clearly was too busy formulating a solution to the Middle East crisis to speak to his parents. It is merely a collection of anecdotes of bright people who tended to speak later than other children.If you're looking for \\"help,\\" this isn't it.

As the months go by, thomas sowells diagnoses for such children is becoming more and more apparent in my child.This book costs only [$].

That's pretty much a summary of this book's contents.However, all too often, they do not work out on their own, and any parent that buys this book because their child isn't talking/developing appropriately, and decides to do nothing or delay testing and treatment, is making a regrettable mistake.True, some kids talk late and turn out fine. But all too many don't, and even children that are \\"on the borderline\\" can fall far, far behind unless Parents make an effort to address the situation.Early intervention is key in helping kids on the Autism spectrum. If you're worried about your child, go ahead and purchase this book, but look at OTHER books on the matter, and think carefully about what you need to do to ensure your child's needs are fully met."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's dated indeed...","review":"First, let's get the negative aspects of this DVD out of the way: yes, it's dated. It's cheesy, corny. The set list does not even contemplate the best songs of Triumph amazing catalogue. The show is from the tour of their final album, when they were clearly writing pop songs and getting mellower and mellower, like a lot of bands of that time did: changing their sound to go with the times.Editing is atrocious, effects utilized also are.The thing that makes this watchable today is, basically, that it serves as a testimonial to Rik Emmett's skill with the six strings. The guy is clearly a natural, both in playing and singing. Also, the remastered / remixed sound was good.This is a guilty pleasure, only that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Have This On CD...","review":"The reason I gave this DVD only 2 stars were for the audio and picture quality which are SUPERB, but there are way too many crowd shots. The guys who filmed/edited this concert must not have been music fans. The most annoying shots are when Rik's singing a chorus and they zoom in on a fan. So, all you see is a fan singing and pumping her fist and they stay on her for 7-10 seconds. And they do this throughout the show. There's another song where Rik is about to rip into a solo and they instead zoom in on the crowd! Another drawback is Triumph don't play any songs from 'Never Surrender', yet they play a cover of \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\"??? What for?Triumph's attire for the show was an eyesore, especially the outfits that Mike and Rik wore. I'm hoping Triumph release this on CD. It's a great concert sound wise.

While some of these tangents of Wolfe's can be fascinating, most of the time it just slows the peice up and makes us want to move onto something faster, something with a better pace. With all this color, all these descriptions of extraneous subject matter, I think we as readers become blinded to the writing's main intentention.

But if you are willing to make the effort it is a beautiful story (autobiographical) of a man from a small town who becomes an author and writes of this town.

The kimono already IS art to wear. It doesn't need to be dragged down by modernization.But that is not my only problem with this book. In the history section, written by Toshiki Wada, the editing is so bad that spelling mistakes are made and repeated. Also, Miss Wada needs to pick up a history book sometime very soon. Her grasp on the history of Japanese clothing is tenuous at best and the more bad history sections she writes (like this one and the one in \\"Shibori\\"), the more misinformation she disseminates to the English-speaking public.Ignore any historical information on the kimono written or \\"edited\\" by Wada. Go out and buy Dalby instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I am probably the only person on this planet who has not read Parker, though I know Spenser from TV and enjoy the character. I picked up this book because I like to read series from book #1 and I enjoy female protagonists; this one filled the bill.

It was the worst book I've ever read. I finished it because I couldn't believe it was as boring and shallow as it was and thought, hoped it might change. Some men can write from a woman's point of view, but this author cannot or did not in this book. I feel he wrote it while watching a crime drama on TV. Nothing new, interesting. The dialogue was the most trivial and boring I've ever read in a book. The characters were flat, shallow and full of the Boston cynicism that is reason I left Boston. All the softness, love and caring was focussed on the dog. People are afraid to show themselves. I wouldn't want to meet any of the characters or the author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start-Weak Finish","review":"I read everything Parker writes and was delighted with his new protagonist Sunny Randall. Unlike Grafton and Evanovich who have created likable but semi competent characters, Sunny is as tough as Spenser himself.

Parker novel I have ever read! I am sorry that I spent the money on the paperback. I loved the Spenser novels, I even loved Night Passage with Jesse Stone, but this book was pedestrian, right from the start. The dialogue was so predictable, I could practically guess what Sunny was going to say. The characters were underdeveloped with no real depth. There was no thrill or excitement at the end of the book, like in the rest of Mr. Parker's novels. All I know is that I will be getting the next book he writes from the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A female Spenser.","review":"It seems to me that all Parker did was give Spenser a sex change operation and name him/her Sonny.

It is in fact several Spenser books rolled into one. Fans will recall how Spenser saved Paul by building a cabin in Maine. They will also recall that Spenser saved a run-away in Ceremony. Roll those two up and you have a good part of Family Honour.The plot is predicatable, although the development of a new, if similar character, is welcome. This book really is for the devoted fan.Regardless it is a good read.The fact that the book was writen with Helen Hunt in mind to play the lead in an upcoming movie is encouraging. Most of the Spenser movies and the Spenser television series did not do justice to the characters (with the exception of Avery Brooks as Hawk, who Parker noted was type cast)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrea Thompson was terrific!","review":"The Book was okay. Sunny Randall very likeable and human. The characters were developed well and I really enjoyed the effort to \\"humanize\\" a teenager. To me it really wouldn't matter what the content was, because the unabridged performance by Andrea Thompson was the best I've heard...and I listen to 30 unabrideged audio books a year! She was so real - she wasn't reading, she was acting, but not overacting - merely conversational as one would be. I looked all through Amazon.com for other books read by Andrea Thompson and can't find any. Hopefully, this will inspire her for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific story, as well as it's predecessor.","review":"I have yet to read one of Parker's stories and not be totally engrossed with the characters..

With reluctance I picked up Parker's first Sunny Randel novel. On the plus side I can see Helen Hunt playing Sunny in the movie, on the down side I fear the movie will stink as much as the book.After reading \\"Family Honor\\" I asked myself is Parker biting off more than he can chew? The book was poorly researched, and appears to be quickly written. The characters were one-dimensional and in many respects unlikeable.Nevertheless, if you are a Parker fan this will probably be a must read, hopefully this will be his last Sunny Randel novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO MORE SUNNY RANDALL, PLEASE","review":"I have read every Spencer book written by Parker and both Jessie Stone books. I enjoyed them all, some more than others but as a whole I like all of them. I even keep them and read some more than once, which is rare for me. Now comes Sunny Randall. It is the worst thing I have read that Parker wrote. All about a privite eye who finds a fifteen year old for her parents and then decides to not take her home until she can find out why she ran away. Sunny uses her ex-husbands mob family to get her into places and to see people she cannot do by her self. Spike is the answer to Spencers Hawk, I guess. I had to force my self to finish the book. I understand there is another Sunny Randall out in Hardback, guess who WON'T be buying it. I know Robert Parker could care less what I think if this book, but, I wish he would stick to the Spencer books which he does so well. This is about the same as Spencer and Paul in Thin Air. The names have changed but not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"want my money back","review":"Parker's dedication was, I concentrated on you Joan. He should concentrate on his writing. The computer enables fast editing and that is all he does. Sunny and Spenser are the same, just cross dressing the characters. Of course the gay guy is Hawk in a nice suit, and all the bad guys are the same. I bought the paperback for a flight home and was wishing for the plane to crash before I choked down another boring, boring page of the same old Parker has been doing for the past twenty years. What is worse are all the glowing reviews from the paid of reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, read that.","review":"Let's face it, folks, Sunny Randall is just a female Spenser, and this book is just another Spenser book with the names changed.Same characters, same dialogue, same PLOT, for God's sake! If I didn't know better, I'd swear that this was a cynical attempt on Robert B. Parker's part to cash in on the current popularity of female sleuth novels.Hey, and just so you know where I'm coming from, I've read and enjoyed every Spenser novel from The Godwulf Manuscript on. AND I think that Parker has shown that he CAN write something other than Spenser books by creating the Jesse Stone series, which is markedly different, although just as satisfying, as the Spenser series.Just my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Honor","review":"I have read all of Robert B. Parker's novels except the Sunny Randall novels. I wasn't sure that I would enjoy Parker's writing about a female P.I., so I was pleasantly surprised when I finished \\"Family Honor\\". Sunny Randall is 35, divorced from her ex-husband whom she still loves, and paints. She also owns a bull terrier named Rosie. Sunny is hired by Brock and Betty Patton to find their daughter, Millicent, who has run away from home. Sunny locates Millicent, but she refuses to return home. It seems that there are some other people who are looking for Millicent as well. Sunny hides Millicent in a friend's home while she investigates. I like the character of Sunny Randall and plan to read the next two novels while awaiting more Spenser and Jesse Stone novels from Robert B. Parker."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Parker Book, Family Honor is a great introduction .","review":"While not \\"heavy\\" reading, nor Pulitzer Prize material, I really enjoyed this book. I was introduced to the story with an audiobook (abridged), and didn't like the gaps, so I had to sign the book out of my library. Sunny Randall would be a cool person to have as a best friend, since she's witty and wise, and has a neat dog! I wish I could come up with those quick responses when confronted with life's little challenges, like Sunny can, which cracked me up. I will definitely read more Sunny Randall novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story","review":"Love Robert Parker and his characters and Sunny Randall is fun to listen to. Family Honor was a great story. I purchased this copy second hand, however, and it was listed as top quality and it was not - 2 of the discs had spots with sound problems. I was still able to get the story alright and enjoyed it a great deal...fun to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spenser in drag?","review":"Really, this is Parker's male persona stuffed into a petite female form. It was like reading Spenser as a weird female impersonator.

Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Time Parker Reader...I'll be back","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author and I really enjoyed it.

Yes it reads like a Spenser novel, is kind of a fun read if you're a Spenser fan (which I am), but here Parker takes out his Spencer cookie cutter and plops out a rather uninspired story. Nothing new here. If you like Parker -- his best novel is Love and Glory, which isn't a Spenser novel, but an excellent story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-plagiarism by Parker","review":"You have to kind of respect the size of the cojones on Robert Parker to put out this book. Not only is the main character Spenser with breasts, but she has her own tough-guy sidekick like Spenser, her own cute dog like Spenser, and the relationship with her boyfriend ends up exactly like Spencer's and Susan's. What makes Parker the winner of the chutzpah award is the fact that the PLOT of the book is the same as the Spenser novel \\"Early Autumn\\"! I give this 2 stars because if you've never read any Spenser books it's a pretty decent read, but if you're a fan of the series, this is just Spenser rehashed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parker's back, full throttle!","review":"The best Parker I've read in ages, tho even his lesser books are great fun. Sunny is sharp, wise, funny, tough - the writing sings, and the character descriptions made me laugh. I'd rank this right up there with the best Spenser (Early Autumn, Looking for Rachel Wallace). Parker is back in touch with his twinkle, and his love of women -and at the peak of his form. Best in genre I've read in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"As all the other reviews, note this book is not much of a departure from Parker's Spenser series. That said, it is a fun read. Sunny is a fun new character. It is clear Sunny could easily be a Helen Hunt.The story is much like earlier Spenser books we have all loved-whether that is a good or bad thing. Parker has included the good and the bad from his earlier efforts. We see the effortless way he puts characters together with only a few words. And the way the characters interact-much like Spenser with Hawk and Susan. Sunny has her sidekick friends Spike and the lover with who she has the issues involved in all long running relationships. Nothing new here. Parker also uses his broad brush of few words with the usual character stereotypes the reader will recognize from the Spenser books.All these things aside, we are glad to get a new Robert B. Parker book. He still has what it takes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rehash of Parker's Spenser novels.","review":"Robert B. Parker writes captivating, exciting prose. Unfortunately, he has already written this one. This book is a rehash of \\"Early Automn\\", with chunks of \\"Ceremony\\" thrown in. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read, but comes up short of Spenser.","review":"I have been a huge fan of the Spenser books for a long time now and always look foward to the release of a new Robert B. Parker book. This new character is good, but lacks the spark (and wit) of Spenser.Sunny Randall is, however, a much more exciting character than Parker created in his Jesse Stone books. I especially enjoyed the interaction between her ex-husband and her gay friend Spike. They are so different and yet so alike.Despite the short-comings of this book, it is still a wonderful read. Nobody gives rich dialouge like Parker. And it is amazing how much excitement Parker can pack into the 3 page showdown between Sunny and the villian at Tony Marcus' resturant.It's just sad to have your appitite whet with Tony Marcus and Ty-bop and not have Spenser around. Well, I guess we just have to wait another six months ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MOST UN-CHICK LIKE WOMAN I HAVE EVER HEARD OF","review":"Seems like i've read this story before in a Spenser novel. Disguising the detective as a woman didn't fool me, and I don't think it'll fool many others. And Sunny was completely unbelievable. Although, RB Parker did manage to make her into a male fantasy: gorgeous, perfect body, guilt-free casual sex, completely self-assured...yeah right. Haven't met too many of hose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome, Spike!","review":"Why did Robert Parker give Sunny Randall (a daintier version of Spenser) her own book, other than to give Helen Hunt a job? The best character in this book by far is Spike, the gay restaurateur/tough guy. You have to love a man so comfortable with himself that when he's asked how he can bench-press 225 pounds, he nonchalantly replies, \\"Fag power.\\" Parker could do amazing things with this character, but instead he relegates Spike to Hawk status. Don't get me wrong--Sunny's okay, but Spike's the reason I'll continue reading this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"two very different disks","review":"If you are going to buy \\"Animal Rights,\\" this is the version you should get.

I could buy individual CDs with each genre for when it suited my mood. Listen to all of them intermingled is annoying and not at all entertaining.

I have listened to three other Moby CDs and this one is the pits. Even his earlier albums are better. I cannot believe that someone who has released such an intelligent and versatile album as \\"Play\\" could have put his name on this pile of nothingness. And as if the awful racket that is supposed to pass for music wasn't enough, Mr Moby also gets on a veeeeeery high vegetarian horse in the liner notes (\\"If you look at the course of western history blah, blah,blah ........ zzzzzzzzzzzz\\"). I fell asleep reading them but was rudely awoken by the noise on the CD itself. I am afraid Moby's plea at the end of the notes to \\"listen to animal rights in its entirety at least once\\" fell on ears deafened by the trite on the CD. This album is a waste of money, don't touch it with a barge-pole!

Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges).

When searching for a particular parable or passage you have to search through the chapter headings one by one to see if you recognize the content. Furthermore, Mr. Edersheim is so unbelievably wordy it can be frustrating waiting for him to get to the point, but this is typical of late 19th and early 20th century biblical expositors. Overall this is a must in any self-respecting theologian's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the complete work","review":"This edition is not the complete text.

Also, there were several sub-plots that were thrown in that made it confusing.What was the deal with Catriona's uncle and his mysterious assistant? This was some other story entirely. Does the author intend a sequel? Also, Catriona's brother had some serious problems including a missing child who was later found. Again, this was another story.

Especially enjoyed the alternate-history angle--what-if? Mr. Turtledove is a master at that.I just wish he'd written some aliens with even a little bit of ability/intelligence/luck/you name it. The series starts out with them on top, and they go downhill from there. I've finished the series, and I don't recall a single time that things went their way. Sure they're the bad guys. Sure we want the humans to win. But, PLEASE, give us a bad guy that's a little tougher. Put me in just a _little_ suspense as to the outcome.That said, I still bought and read the whole series. :-}"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for sci-fi freaks","review":"Everybody seems to either love or hate this book--personally, I love it. Though we all know how the series will end, it's the journey that matters. And what a journey Turtledove takes us on--full of twists and turns, and clever observations, which make this quite a page-turner. I almost never read sci-fi and I think this book is awesome--that should tell you something about it; it's not just for sci-fi freaks. This is not Turtledove's best, though--Guns of the South is a better outing, but not by much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy Publishers","review":"I have purchased this book in paperback and loved it, liked it so much I wanted it on my kindle as well, so much that I was willing to pay the price set by the publisher. The publishers claim that just as much expense goes into converting these books into eformat as it does to print them. Well.....I find this hard to believe since I am finding so many spelling errors in the ebook format. Looking at the errors I am finding they are simple OCR errors, so they have paid some intern, or got the intern for free, and had him scan the books in. Did anyone check for errors, no way could they have, im only 120 pages in and already I have found 38 errors. So the next time you hear the publisher cry that they want more money for ebooks, cite this one as an example.

The story went directly from the eve of invasion by the aliens to \\"Oh, my, they're here!\\" with no explination no how they got here. The book was also more concerned with the characters sex life. They spendt 90% of their time having sex, with the aliens forcing their captives to have sex, because they didn't reproduce sexually and were doing 'research'. Even earth people who weren't in captivity seemed to spend most of their time having sex.

The historical characters are at best two dimesional. The fictional ones are even worse, more often than not b-movie rejects sent from central casting.

Bad book.","review":"Having read the last three books (couldn't find the first) I kept expecting it to get better. It didn't. It was an excelent idea but are all Germans really evil? Are all English and Americans really good? There were so many subplots it was hard to keep track of what was going on. Each subplot was mentioned in each chapter and many had nothing to do with the main plot. Made you wonder why they were written other that to just fill paper.Turtledove missed a good opportunity here to write a classic science fiction novel. He would have been better off to mention his idea to someone else and let them write a 600 page novel than meander through 2400 pages himself.Yup, still read three of the four books and he is spending the royalies he made off me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for SCI-FI Alternate Reality buffs!","review":"I couldn't put this down.

Three stars- sure- four -maybe. But five? Come on. From my perspective, this book was pretty boring and unoriginal. The \\"Lizards\\" are supposed to be so different but their society seems more Japanese than extra-terrestrial. They are also kinder than most human invaders. I find that implausible.

You'll need a scorecard just to keep track of the plethora of characters (some rather poorly-developed to the point of stereotyping). Quite a few scenes seem contrived (e.g., Mr. & Mrs. Larssen...I won't say more), and it feels like Turtledove has opted for quantity over quality, often filling scenes with comments on liquor quality, etc. Turtledove seems to fall back on constantly reiterating how slow the invaders are, philosophically, to the point where I was ready to say \\"enough already...can we please get on with the story?\\"I stand by my title. This could have been good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book. NOT a great e-book.","review":"The price of the e-book is the same as the paperback; $7.99.

If you like Turtledove, read the paperback; it's excellent. However, the e-book is painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where fact and fiction merge","review":"This book is a well written alternate version of WWII. The fiction is blended so well with fact that it is hard to tell the difference. The characters are developed well and there is a great amount of carry over between the books in the series of events and conversations. Set against the backdrop of WWII, the story begins as the \\"Lizards\\" show up for their conquest and colonization of earth. Unfortunately for them, their reconnaissance probe took 1000 years to transverse the distance to and from their planet and earth. In the time since, mankind has made just a few improvements to the weapons of war. What follows is a story line filled with enough plots and subplots to satisfy all of the readers' sci-fi cravings. Buy the hardback - you'll want to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"As mentioned by another reviewer, this Kindle edition is plagued by OCR errors.

Turtledove must have been getting paid by the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another good idea gets drawn into a 4 book contract - UGH","review":"A fantastic idea. Some good action scenes. A bit of good writing. But, once again, a story that would have been GREAT as a single long book, is dragged into infinte boredom. How many times will the aliens tell us that they thought the natives of Earth were going to be primitive? How many times is the same plot re-hashed over and over? This is one of only a few books that I've found myself actually skipping huge chunks of text. To be fair, perhaps hopes were set in the wrong direction - I wanted to read a great Sci-Fi book. Perhaps this was catering to those who love 'war-epic' genre. If so, then this book may be for you. I didn't hate the book, I just found myself wishing the story would move much much faster. Instead, I continually found myself saying, \\"Oh no, not this group again, I wish we could get back to the aliens, or at least the war itself.\\" Save your money and your time, this just wasn't worth the pain of going through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not believeable","review":"I found the characters including the historical ones to be unbelieveable. I don't think some of the historical figures would have acted as they did. The aliens are naive beyond belief. They just don't seem that bright. I don't think they could successfully invade my grandmother's kitchen. The aliens can somehow cross lightyears of space, but their technology doesn't seem to be more advanced then that shown in the Gulf War. A worthy attempt at an alternative history that just falls flat. I don't think I'll bother finishing this series. Try Harry Harrison's East of Eden for a great alternative history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait for it to end","review":"The idiotic plot moves at a glacial pace, and the characterizations are laughable.

Gimme a break! And what's this drivel about them being hooked on Ginger? (The spice, not Tina Louise, though that would be just about as believable) I read this at first thinking it was written along the lines of the \\"Toxic Spell Dump\\".

Shine it on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive, painful, unnecessary","review":"The lady and three gentlemen make every effort to reaffirm the populist cliché of Beethoven the Madman. Perhaps this is a small triumph in itself. Beethoven's sadistic (perhaps also masochistic?) outbursts make for a heavy meal even on paper and with this new recording the shock value is doubled by the use of period instruments and playing techniques. It is a sawing of the most cruel kind. The amount of discomfort brought by listening to the op. 135 quartet can compare to, say, post-Stockhausen trauma. Or perhaps Elliot Carter. Or any number of last century's modernist pricks. Eroica Quartet seem to be advancing boldly into the 19th century quartet repertoire (next victim is Florestan himself!).

This CD gets better and better everytime I listen to it. It has from Tears for Fears ( Mad world) to Smashing pumpkins and offspring.

It may sound pedantic but to enjoy these sort of boys books, I at least need to feel confident that the author knows what he is talking about. Two of the more frequent and irrating errors: British (and British derived) air forces do not use army ranks but have their own air force ranks. Thus Mr Meade's air force captain would in fact have been a Flying Officer. And Lieutenant Colonels are addressed as and call themselves \\"Colonel\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad,even for a beach book","review":"numbingly stupid thriller. Sorry, the plot is so implausible, the coincidences so staggeringly forced, the characters so thinly drawn, and the editing so poor, that you end the book wondering why you wasted valuable vacation time reading it. I like historical thrillers and search them out, but got burned on this one. It's very lazy. Two examples: 1) A seedy hotel is first described by a character seeking asylum, and 50 pages later by the guy trying to find him, using exactly the same phrases. 2) A British officer in charge of a POW camp, talking about a German prisoner, says \\"He usually beats me at chess hands down all the time\\". How can you usually do something all the time? Where's the editor?

The idea of a plot against FDR and WC is fine (though we know outcome ahead of time) but the writing sinks the book. The coincidences relied upon to keep the plot moving are rediculous (coincidences usually play a role in spy thrillers but here seem to be used simply out of laziness or lack of imagination). The dialogue is wooden beyond belief as if taken from Hollywood B movies of the 1940s. If the book was \\"extensively researched\\" (see Amazon review) it doesn't show. The period touches amount to the simple mentioning of makes of old cars, military planes and weapons.

Read Meade's 'Resurrection Day', banned in USA","review":"Sands of Sakkara is a terrific read! However, I recently finished his latest, Resurrection Day, oublished only in Europe, and not in the USA (banned, I hear, because of the controversial and sensitive subject matter!) Resurrection Day is an incredible book, prescient and right up to the minute, about an Al-Qaeda terrorist attack on Washington DC--and one of the best books I've ever read, a must for Meade fans, up there with Snow Wolf, and maybe even better. You have to read Resurrection Day--it's scary, fast paced, and stunning. US readers can order it through ... Don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Glenn Meade's previous books were good escapist fun...a pleasant way to pass a long plane ride or a winters night. The plots centred around real people and events but Meade still made it seem as though his fictional events had happened and the characters, while being sterotypes, were good. Unfortunately, in this latest book, this is not the case. The plot is too flimsy to hold attention and the characters are boring...you don't care if they live or die. The big surprise at the end is predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOOOrrring!!!!!","review":"The story line is excellent but unfortunately mired in too many depth-less characters and painfully convoluted subplots. It is slow on the uptake tho thankfully does pick up the pace, but only at the last, and after you have waded through so much extraneous babble that you often wondered where you were headed in the first place---which was, incidentally, a plot to assassinate Churchill and Roosevelt.The book flap summary---and even the design of the dust jacket---made it seem like I was in for a treat. Wrong!! I often did not want to pick it back up (it took forever to finish!!!) but I am determined that if I spend money on a book, I'm going to read it.I would recommend this story to only the most patient of readers and certainly will not read again myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"To help clear the confusion","review":"I thought the following might help clear the confusion between HT of Dublin and the reviewer who then followed. The fact is Glenn Meade wrote Brandenburg first, followed by Snow Wolf - and that was the order of publication in Britain. However, Brandenburg failed to get placed with a US publisher, the first book they took was Snow Wolf. Then, following the success of Snow Wolf, the US Publisher brought out Brandenburg. This is why the order of the books is reversed in the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot Structure, Dialect Were Annoying","review":"I've not read this author's other works, so I can't compare, but two things made the book less enjoyable than it might have been: First, the plot mechanism of Harry Weaver narrating his story to the journalist was patently unbelievable, because (obviously) many things that occurred in the story could not have been known by Col. Weaver. The story would have been good without this convention, and more convincing. Second, it was distracting to have all the characters, whether British, American or German, speaking in British dialect (e.g. beginning sentences with \\"Right,...\\", \\"organising\\" a trip, \\"in future\\", \\"in hospital\\", etc.).

I didn't dislike the book, however, its not at all what I expected or was looking for. Instead of just a simple collection of myths, this is more of an attempt to explain the circumstances that brought about the myths, and give facts pertaining to those myths. In each section, the author tells a myth, then spends countless pages presenting facts, alternative tellings, and general information about the myth. This is all well and good, if you are interested in learning about the origin of myths, however, if you are not (which I was not), then you will probabaly read each myth, then find yourself skimming throught 10-15 pages of non-fiction detail that you really aren't interested in.

Yes, this season was a major departure from the original premise of the show, some people may be put off by how different it is. It's more violent, more disturbing, and much more intense. But it had me on the edge of my seat during almost every episode and I loved the new additions to the cast, specifically Demian Bichir. Mary-Louise Parker was phenomenal, and I loved the direction Andy's (Justin Kirk) character took. There is still humor, but it's much less zany. My one criticism is what they did with Doug - he simply doesn't fit in well outside of Agrestic. But Nancy's progression from small-time dealer to a player in a Mexican drug cartel and its moral implications whose fascinating to watch, and Jenji Kohan turned in a terrific finale, as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show! Great cast! Cant wait for season 5!","review":"The first time I watched weeds I didnt like it. For some reason I watched another episode and absolutely fell in love with it. I now own seasons 1-3 and have just preordered season 4 (which I have already seen on showtime). The cast is great. I really like Kevin Nealon's character, absolutely hilarious!If for some reason you are having doubts as to buying this season, believe me, it is as good if not better than the other 3. I would encourage you to start from season 1 (which is also cheap on amazon.com) so you can see all the character development. Season 4 is great on it's own(it was the first season I watched prior to buying 1-3) but watching the other 3 first would make it even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SEASON","review":"In Season 4...oh so much happens. Nancy and her family moves from Agrestic. Silas grows up A LOT...and so does Shane. Nancy has moved up in the business and made some serious connections that potentially could end poorly until alas that last moment of the last episode, just the way I love Weeds! Season 4 will keep you watching, glued to your TV. Can't wait til I can watch again :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Disk","review":"Weeds Season 4 - Disk 2 was damaged and locked up near the end of the first episode on the disk.

If you have loved any of the previous seasons of Weeds, you will love this one, too. It changes perspective a little, as they are no longer in the suburbs, but the social commentary follows them to their new home. If you've never seen this show, you need to. If you've seen it, you should own every season on DVD, including this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always entertaining!","review":"All of the WEEDS seasonal series are great entertainment.

Also I always thought the plot was kinda bad. Whaaaaa! I can't live in the wealthy suburbs I gotta turn to illegal drug trafficking. It would be one thing if if was to survive and barely cling to life. But this show is just about money loving people who wanna live the fine life at the expense of others!Its not the worse show on TV (DEXTER owns that) but there are much better programs out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stuff","review":"I love this show. every season becomes diriter and more depraved than the last.This season in addition to the rampant drug culture and treachery we get oedipitical masturbation, an affair between nancy's son and a cheese shop owner and Mary Louise's twins on full display. Only in America! or perhaps in Russia too."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Longer The Same Show","review":"Season 4 brought about huge cast, plot, and setting changes.[Setting Changes]Old Setting: Aggrestic, CA near LA (Fictional affluent suburb)New Setting: Ren Mar near San Diego/Tijauna (Fictional run down beach town)[Cast Changes]Heylia James, Conrad Shepard, and their associates are no longer in the show. Guillermo, Esteban and other Latino drug dealers are now the main counterpart to the Botwin Family and Friends.In short Latino drug dealers replaced the African American drug dealer characters.[Plot Changes]Much darker, less creative, less humor, more violence, and much more severe moral issues. Human trafficking, gun running, harder drugs, addiction, sex with minors, etc.[In Summary]The writers ran out of creative energy so turned to smut to fill the hole.

My library of NFL films spans darn near all of them. I received this DVD as a present, watched it once and have never even had the urge to pick it up again.

St. Bonaventure said that those who do not have a devotion to Our Lady will die in their sins and be damned for all of eternity. Nevertheless, Elizabeth Seton is never portrayed as having a devotion to Our Lady and indeed, never even says one hail mary that I could see. Other Catholic teachings are notably absent. The acting and production values are lamentably poor.

After reading the other reviews I was expecting an exceptionally funny and fast paced story. The plot is great, no doubt about that. The execution left a little to be desired. I did like Julia, she is smart and gutsy. Alec, on the other hand, is not really likeable. He doesn't make you swoon or wish to be in Julia's shoes.Sorry, I didn't like this story too much. It is not a \\"keeper.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Love?","review":"Julia, kidnapped by Alec to keep his inheritance, is a reformer who demands half of Alec's inheritance to help her in her Women's Society efforts. Alec should have sent Julia packing. She supposedly loved him for years but instead of behaving in a friendly manner, loving I guess was too much to ask for, is always a shrew to Alec. Why? It is logical to assume that the more shrewish and unreasonable, yes very unreasonable, she became, the more problems they would have. This is not a good love story in that I wish Alec would have found someone else. Lucien's story, which comes out in 2001, I look forward to and I hope he choses more wisely."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding me.","review":"I enjoy a good love story but this was ridiculous. The damned female thought she was flawless. I mean no problems at all and got away with evverything. She was supposed to be helping the man but in my eyes caused more trouble than she was worth. She was not a very likeable creature at all because she was so selfish. She thought everything she did ws for a good cause. Who in their right mind brings a prostitute to live under their roof who promptly embarasses almost the whole dinner party by showing them the gifts they gave her. Must I add that they were married, and then she had the nerve to get mad at her husband because he was mad? SERIOUSLY??? I stopped reading. I tried to give it a chance but it was not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious Heroine!","review":"I agree with several of the other reviewers: Julia is so unbelievable and unlikable that the book is nearly unreadable. I initially liked Alec, but he quickly lost my respect by not asserting himself over his impractical, selfish wife.I finished the book because I was stuck for several days with no reading material BUT this book and I wanted to finish it for the background info for other books. I sincerely hope that this book doesn't set the tone for this whole series. I've read other Karen Hawkins books and liked them, but if this had been my first it would have also been my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Contrived","review":"I found the situations created in this book were done by having the heroine do stupid things, like getting herself into bad situations with her husband's enemy. The fact that she was presented as intelligent in the beginning of the story made this all the more hard to read. I didn't care for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Start.. Then really boring!","review":"This book had an excellent theme: ugly duckling intrigues handsome hero with her wit and unique character, and then she becomes a swan and steals the hero's heart. The book had a promising start with interesting dialogue and the instant attraction of the h/h. However.... the book quickly bogged down. Despite their mutual attraction, and the fact that Julia has loved the hero for four years, and the fact that they are MARRIED - the couple have hardly any physical interaction in the book. The smolder that started in the first dozen pages was all smoke and no fire for this reader. When the couple finally consummate the marriage, it is a disappointment and I almost didn't care! I skipped through pages and pages of this book - which is something I have NEVER done before. Since this was the author's first book, perhaps I will give her one more chance in a more recent work. However, I will certainly check it out at the library before I buy any of her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to put it down!","review":"I've always loved the clash of American heroines and English lords, and Ms. Hawkins delivers two of the best main characters yet. Julia is feisty yet sensible, lovely but self-effacing. Alec is the rogue with more depth than even HE is aware of. Add to this a cast of amusing, come-to-life characters, and one sexy as-all-get-out villain and you have the making for one of the best romance reads in a long time. RUN to get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"I didn't like this book. I found it really boring. I had to force myself to finish it. The heroine was too perfect, and I didn't feel that she and the hero had a lot of chemistry. I prefer passionate love stories. They were so dull together. I don't think I'll be buying another book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I liked this novel a lot. It was a funny and enjoyable read. Alec was great and I loved the way Hawkins described what he felt. He was a good guy that needed a little reforming! Julia was nice too. I liked the way Hawkins portrayed her character: Not vain but still wanting to look good for Alec. Not selfish, always helping others. I loved the secondry characters in this book too (I think Hawkins always has very good secondry characters - usually old funny people). I adored Alec's cousin (the bad guy) and really want to read his story when it comes out! Basically the story line was very good - you'll find that having a story based around a 'no scandal' theme when really there's scandal weaving its way around the characters all the time, can be very amusing! I do recommend this book - a satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Very Boring\\"","review":"I lot of unnecessary writing. Too boring. I will not be picking up anything else by this author.

And while Dominik is a decent-looking guy with a nice body, he's hardly captivating enough for an hour-long feature. He has little of interest to discuss during the interview. And while he continues to ramble on while being massaged, the producers apparently decided whatever was coming out of his mouth was so uninteresting that they covered it up with some mellow music.In short, if you're willing to spend the day (or even an hour) with Dominik, you really need to get a life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read the beginning or the end.","review":"This author actually believes that she can tell you all about your life just by what age you are and she can predict what kind of story you will write, just by knowing your age. Wrong! There is also an entire section telling to basically quit your job, ignore your loved ones and devote yourself fully to becoming a millionare writing in Hollywood (which in reality, most of you will never make a penny doing). This book is entirely unrealistic, but not because of the premise of the title.What I do like about this book is she pushes you to quit procrastinating, gives good writing exercises, and gives you your basic outline without being too specific.

Forget it and follow my advice above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haste makes waste","review":"This was the first book I bought when I was learning how to write screenplays. I have a finished screenplay now, but this book was not at all helpful. In my opinion this book adds to the difficulty of writing a screenplay when there is a time factor. I would suggest a period of at least 2 months, most of the time going into planning. Who really cares about how quick you can write a screenplay, isn't the real goal to see how good you can write one? By the way of all the seminars by professional screenwriters that I've been to, I've brought this book up. None of them cared for it.

While you may not be able to have a perfect (aka, salable) screenplay in 21 days, there's no reason you can't at least have a solid draft in that time period if you use this method. It breaks down everything you need to know, from how to come up with a solid idea and plan out your script so you know exactly where you need to know, to what to do after your first draft is complete.I cannot recommend it highly enough for anyone who's struggled to get started writing screenplays or finish a script."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!","review":"Thanks to Viki King and this great book, I did it!

Screenwriting and spirituality may or may not mix, but spirituality really has nothing to do with writing a good screenplay! I have to agree with the previous reviewer who gave the book one star and say that I, too, found little practical advice in this book and the premise is even stranger. Why 21 days? Why does the author suggest that we whip out a screenplay in only 21 days? Isn't quality better than speed. I recommend Syd Field and Lajos Egri instead.

While I can't say I agree with everything in this book's approach, I can say that it helped me put \\"pen to paper\\" when I was \\"stuck\\" otherwise.There are a couple of weak points to the book. One is that King should have advised that the writers know something about supporting characters before starting to write the actual screenplay. Another is that she advocates a set pattern of writing when in reality such a formulaic method will not apply to all people.But, I still highly recommend this book as it was extremely helpful to me. I would just add a cautionary note to modify her method of writing to fit your own. Once you do that, you will become more prolific in your writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for Me!","review":"This is a gimmick book with substance, if such a thing is possible.At the risk of sounding like a cheesey testimonial, I want to say that I bought the book, read it, followed the simple advice she offered and the result was a finished screenplay.Viki King understands all the things that prevent people who want to write from doing so. She can chase away all the negative thoughts that cloud a writer's mind. I also appreciated the way she assures you that quitting your job and selling all you own will not make it any easier to finish something if you are not in the right frame of mind.Have I sold my screenplay? No. But the satisfaction I got in finally finishing one was worth the price of the book and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can't get past page 60...","review":"I am a working screenwriter, and this is the only screenwriting book I recommend.

There is no way to turn off the water part (which means you need water for the electronic sounds)It needs to be cleaned all the time (even using distilled water).The electronic sounds do not seem as real to me as the Brookstone one did. Wave cycles too fast, etc. For the cost of RAM these days you would think they could have a sound loop longer than a second or so. The Brookstone one was about 7 seconds for a sound loop and you had to listen carefully to hear the replete. Not bad considering I purchased the Brookstone unit in 1996.

While the sets, costumes are actors are all exceptional, the story itself is one of the darkest and disturbing ones I've seen.While in all probability more realistic to the times, Cooksons portrayal of a young girl, born on the \\"wrong\\" side of the bed, and her eventual life with her illegitimate father, and terribly sadistic stepmother is very hard to watch. Be forewarned-this is not a \\"family\\" film, as brutal beatings of children, forced sex, adultery, attempted murder, someones hand almost cut off in a \\"man trap\\", and many more throughly unpleasant scenes make up this mini series.In the end, I found no characters worth any empathy, in fact the \\"heroine\\" herself becomes so sneaky and underhanded that I for one wished she would NOT end up with the hero at the end.A depressing way to kill several hours and one I would not recommend.1.5 stars for the sets and costuming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storytelling.

None the less because I wasn't shown a full bill of goods so to speak I have to deduct 1 star for not giving all the info. The product Dash Mat is an awesome product otherwise as it cools your dash off and keeps even dust fom being a big problem but the biggie is the lowering of solar radiation through the windshield . As a resident of Arizona I can appreciate even a few degrees lowered temp on a110 degree day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Gill fever","review":"Large Bluegills are one of the hardest little fish to catch because they are wary like deer. Fooling a bluegill with fly tackle is as much fun as catching a giant bass because of the fight they give, and this is why this book is so good. It breaks down the fishing element into steps that lead you to the big ones, and teaches you how to find the right places to fish for them. This is a Great Book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"After reading the book and having the pleasure of meeting the authors in Missouri, all I can say...nothing new here.

Mr. Duncan's decisive five minutes with his former associate now provide a unique opportunity to see HCB in action, but I suspect that \\"Faceless\\" would not have sat still for the candids if he realized that his old friend DDD was going to blow his cover and publish the off-guard moments. One reviewer of this book notes that Mr. Duncan lost his friendship with HCB because he published these photos. Even though the proceeds from the book will go to the University of Texas, losing a friendship would not be worth this book of snapshots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disavowed by Cartier-Bresson","review":"Those of you who would buy this book because you are fans of the subject should know that Mr. Cartier-Bresson has done everything he could to prevent this book from being published.

Out of an entire roll of film, even of a master like Cartier-Bresson, how many images are publishable and how many are forgettable?This is a sad exercise by Mr. Duncan to cash in on the famed reclusiveness of his subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 times broken!","review":"We bought this blender/food processor combo last month and after about a week on the second use of the food processor, noticed that the plastic latches that hold the lid on the food processor were broken.

The cable is held together with electrical tape, gum, and duct tape. I thought it was me at first so I replaced them. I don't what the designers were thinking. The unit is designed to be used both on the boat and in the car. It's moved around alot. Even with the greatest care breakage is inevitable.

It plugs into a 12v cigarette lighter and powers my 276c GPS and provides the speaker needed to get voice directions from the Garmin software.

It will plug in and if I want to hold the plug in place, will work.However if you are not able to hold the cable and the unit together, it will fall out. comparing it to my existing charger cord, it is missing a flared out area close to the end of the cord which would allow friction to hold the cord in place. This cord does not have this, it is not the same as the cords that I have purchased in the past and therefore it is useless to me.It was a good price and I liked the fact that the cord did not have a 90 degree turn at the plug but it still does not stay in place and cannot be used."},{"rating":"1","title":"good product, poor engineering","review":"Like the previous reviewer- great product because it allows you to hear the directions from the 276c, but given the bend in the attachment point, it will break.

I've got a direct wiring kit for a motorcycle but in the car in unfamiliar places it's nice to have the voice tell you where to go without having to watch the screen.The garmin 276c is a great piece of equipment but the subpar accessories (garmin proprietary card and poor power cable) really make me want to look for another GPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"The speaker didn't work","review":"I don't know what happened but when i plug it, the speaker didn't work.

An absolutely WONDERFUL book. The images not only come out of the page and materialise, but you can smell the smells, taste the tastes, feel the heat of the sun on your skin, as you vividly dream together with the author. No movie, no visual depiction has quite the comparable ability to make you feel like you have been allowed for a moment to step into it's world of imagination anchored here in a small 1930's town in eastern Poland. It contains the light and wonder but also the darkness and pain of living. The line between the two is never clear, the perception of the world constantly slipping into the surreal.... with this book as part of the curriculum, I can only regret that this author is so little known outside his country, as it would seem natural for him to be recognised as part of the world literary heritage...."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAMN!

I would have perferred not to have the thong hole in the rear bolster or the \\"Winchester\\" logo on the blade, for my purposes, but they do not really distract from the appearance of the knife. I think that these knives compare favorably with the 110 Buck which sells for three times as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretensious","review":"While at first drawn into the lush visual imagery, I eventually found the poems, and long journal in the back, strikingly empty. Christopher seems to be a showman, constantly performing for the reader with too many sleights of hand and verbal somersaults. The basic premise of the journal is interesting, but Christopher takes the rumination of life and death to a cloyingly predictable, pretensious degree. The Dcotor, the driver are one dimensional figures trapped in Christopher's invention. The overall effect is a kind of patronizing and inaccessible work, where Christopher's characters are walking blindly through a universe of chaos, where the poet seems to mourn their darkness yet fail to illuminate much for the reader. A depressing combination, in part because the poet obviously spent a good deal of energy performing for the reader during what's essentially an empty journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great expectations, almost-as-great disappointment","review":"Scripting is a hot, extremely-important topic, and Barron is to be commended for the very idea of basing a whole book on presenting and surveying it. However, the execution of this good idea turns out to be far too flawed -- this book is NOT to be recommended. There is no coverage of the most important, up-and-coming scripting languages, particularly Python; this is a truly damning defect. The role of scripting in conjunction with XML, EJB/Corba, databases, and other crucial technologies is absent. Nothing about scripting's use for component prototyping, its connection with the Extreme Programming movement, integration of scripting in one's general or special purpose applications; nothing on the vital issue of interaction between scripting and security. A pity: this book could have been far, far more than what it turned out to be. As it is, it provides little or nothing that's not already and better available elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clever black comedy!","review":"I don't understand why people are knocking this picture.Five minutes into it, I knew I wasn't watching a straight horror film...but a clever black comedy.The writer-director and the actors are playing this one strictly tongue-in-cheek...and they make it work.And, for those people who didn't \\"get it\\" while watching the movie, the Coda at the end was designed to let them in on the joke.Too bad they weren't astute enough to realize that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Budget Campy Horror","review":"If you're into cheesy horror films, then this movie is a good rental.

Roy Scheider must have been on vacation and decided he needed some extra spending money. Scheider's worst performance, more than likely. But he's not in it too much, and that leaves us with the likes of Don Maloney, Lauren Woodland, Christian Harmony and the howlingly funny Teresa DePriest. Teresa plays a double role, first as the demon Elizabeth Van Buren, and then her psychic descendant Lydia. Watching dePriest make demon faces while taunting Maloney is hilarious. She looks like a little baby trying to make funny faces at mommy, it's very very funny.The script is not important; the sex scenes are obviously used as padding, and are about as erotic as celery and onions.

On that count, the audio version is right on the mark. The interesting (and disappointing) thing is that the author actually \\"reads\\" the pertinent text to you from each of the 100 items. In the book, he talks about overcoming a fear of public speaking and putting inflection into his speaking voice. I guess he feels qualifed to \\"read\\" to us based on his accomplishment. If reading his text was the selected approach, he should have let a professional narrator make this tape. I guess I was expecting excerpts from his speaking engagements (ala \\"7 Habits...\\").

I gave up after slogging through 150 pages. New characters (many with similar names) are introduced about every other page, making the story very difficult to keep straight. Benjamin January also brings a multi-layered backstory to the proceedings, adding additional layers of complexity (and does anybody else think a musician-surgeon-classically educated sensitive widower is a bit too good to be true?).Add a setting unfamiliar to most readers (an 1830s Creole sugar cane plantation), and the density of details overwhelms both plot and characterization.

Then i found out that the collar is not touching the skin on the sides of the neck. Also, the heat or cold lasts only very few minutes (Max. 5). Overall, I'm very disappointed. Definitely, not worth the money. My Drugstore Cold pack was much more effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great relief from pain!","review":"This item is super fantastic. It is easy to use, and WOW!

This is an assemble-it-yourself item, which is fine except...many of the holes did NOT match up (some were up to a HALF INCH off and looked as if a 3-year-old had drilled them). When I say drill, I mean that loosely, because some of the holes weren't even drilled all the way through. The showpiece of this toy is the fire truck ladder, but the ladder did NOT fit into the ladder holder...because the holes for the holder were drilled on the WRONG side of the truck! The only way to fix all the hole problems would be to take a power drill to it, but the wood is extremely soft, so you may end up shattering it. This is the worst quality control I've seen in a looooong time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"While the wood products we have purchased by the same company, mostly puzzles, are wonderful, this item is not. It was difficult to assemble, it doesn't stay together while playing with it, and my 3-year old son only became impatient with it, rather than enjoy playing with it. We opted later for a plastic firetruck, that a year later, he still plays with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"You can read other reviews about this toy and get an idea. The holes don't match. The wood is too soft. The ladder comes off easily, so the kid can't tip it over. Impossible to assembled so I left one wheel out due to screw holes not matching. The paint is very soft and it will become dust when putting the toy together. Given that the toy is MADE IN CHINA I was concern about the paint coming off as dust, so I threw it out. The boy was not happy. If you want a good truck check out the Mega Blocks firetruck. It is plastic and the kid will love it. If you want the feel of wooden toys, then go to an unfinished furniture store."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk","review":"We've had other toys by M&D, they've been very good. This one was an utter piece of garbage. The instructions printed using a cheap colour laser printer and the thus made it hard to identify the multitude of similarly shaped items that were in the box. A few of the included screws had heads that were not properly punched so the screw driver wouldn't bite. Several of the pieces were warped and if it wasn't because my son was looking at Daddy to assemble his new fire engine, I'd have thrown everything back in the box to return to Amazon. The main wooden frame that made up the chassis was glued on crooked, thus forcing the other parts to be forced to follow the contours. The bucket at the end of the ladder was loose, the included pin was too long and thus couldn't maintain any friction on the part. After a couple of days the knobs that are used to raise and lower the boom arm are free spinning, rendering them useless unless I glue them back on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it","review":"Yes, this kit is hard to put together.

The whistling cover on the spout had been left in the \\"UP\\" position after filling and I totally forgot about it. Well, I thought, THIS teakettle had solved that problem for me. Just a squeeze of the handle causes the spout top to flip down into the spout. When the the kettle is set down and the handle released, the spout top closes. What a great idea!After just 6 months of light use, the spout top will no longer close. I am so disappointed. FYI, the whistle on it was great, not too irritating, but loud enough to get one's attention.I am on the hunt for a new teakettle.

The learning comes from being able to make connections, build stories, follow through on thoughts, learning how to play with others, expanding vocabulary so forth and so on.

Maohfauouz takes all of the major world religions and retells the stories of the prophets in a modern day context set in India. The retelling of the prophets allows one to examine the actual stories of the religions in a way that encourages critique and in some cases acceptance. It is a fabulous read - especially for those who enjoy challenging and clarifying their own beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Edition","review":"I'm giving this product one star, not because it's that bad, but because there's absolutely no reason to buy this version. The X Press edition of Chesnutt's \\"Marrow of Tradition\\" (curiously shortened to Tradition) is an abridged version with no explanation for the reason for the editing or the choice of passages removed. In fact I had no idea that there were segments (just paragraphs and phrases) edited out until we happened to read a passage in class that just disappeared from my text.The editing doesn't make it unreadable, and the majority of the story is there, but with plenty of other editions in print and available for the same price, there's no reason to buy this one.Does not reflect on the quality of the novel itself; great piece of classic American literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully Dull","review":"It's been said that the short story is a more difficult genre to master than the novel. Clearly that's the case for Jeffrey Deaver. His novels, while not literary masterpieces by any means, at least hold the reader's attention with reasonably intelligent and interesting plots. This collection of short stories, in contrast, is thoroughly predictable, in places laughably bad (eg, the story set in Shakespearean England and written in a ridiculous, ill-informed version of period language), and mostly just downright boring. The stories are of the same caliber as you'd find in a cheap mystery or horror magazine or anthology filled with the efforts of unknown writers. Unless you're stuck on an airplane with nothing else to read, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe","review":"I don't believe that a writer wrote only one story and all others 15 weren't written by him and everybody says that is a good book and a good writer.All the stories are predictable and alike, if you read them all together at the end of the third one you will know the end of the rest of them only by reading the beginning, if you read these stories between books (one or two each time) may be you will enjoy the book, but maybe also you already read most of them before you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Assume Anything","review":"Twisted puts the mind of Jeffrey Deaver against the reader. He's got some stories to tell, ones that will shock people - once they read it to the end.One of the best stories is Triangle, where there is a classic three person love story when a male plots to get rid of the other man who loves the same woman he does. Another great bit is \\"Lesser Included Offenses\\", which documents a prosecuter's battle with a man who can't afford a prison term - but can afford to bribe and threaten witnesses. Finally, in a Rhymes / Sachs story, he tells the tale of a Christmas present - given by the team to a woman who fears her mother was abducted. Turns out, her mom was just fine all along. But while the evidence might have pointed to an innocent explanation, after it was all over the mother learned the truth - she was going to be the victim of a violent crime by her so-called boyfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"I liked this.

I tried to like the stories and they were at times ok, but I just found myself trying to guess the sting in each tale and not really relating to the story at all. The stories were not enough for me to get involved and to care about what was happening.This is for the ultra-serious Deaver fan, while others would do better to look at his Lincoln Rhyme series which are brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sixteen little gems","review":"Good value this - sixteen short stories instead of one, but some of them might have been stretched out to become full-length novels by other authors. They're not great tales, but collectively they make a compulsive case for you to 'add to basket'. Apparently some have criticised the Olde English tale \\"All the World is a Stage\\" (which includes Shakespeare as one of the characters) but I thought it was very authentic given the American hand that wrote it! There's also a mini Lincoln Rhyme story, and several tales in which the baddies get away with it! A good way to introduce yourself to Jeffrey Deaver, if you're not a fan already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviews by Nan Kilar and Bobby Miller","review":"If you've read any other books by Jeffrey Deaver (and I've read most of them), you know what a strange (OK, weird) mind this author has. This book is a collection of his short stories and includes an original story about a favorite character of mine, Lincoln Rhyme.Each story is, of course, carefully crafted with a twist or turn of fate. How can he get so devious in just 20-30 pages per story? Characters include an ad exec, William Shakespeare, a beautiful woman, a boy and other assorted personalities. Settings include olde England, New York City, the New England countryside and the eastern shore. You never know if the good guy will win, the bad guy, or what sneaky outcome the author might have conjured up. You're quickly engrossed as each story begins, and you never know who's evil or who's nuts. And do be sure to read Mr. D's introduction. It's a fun, quick, must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!!","review":"This was such a good book!!! I was reluctant to read this book after ATTEMPTING to read The Bodies Left Behind. I was so wrong about this book. I thought it was going to be just another boring, overly detailed book by jeffery deaver. But wow, this book was so wonderfully written. All the stories make you think, wow, he got me. I dont think there was one story in thsi book that i figured out the twist to. You may think you have the story figured out, but you will be fooled. I love the element of surprise in each of these stories. When finished with each, you sit back in awe thinking, \\"wow... i never saw that one coming.\\" I recommend this book to any reader who loves surprises, irony, and twisted stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visioneer doesn't honor its warrenty","review":"My visioneeer scanner broke down after 3 months of use ...

But after less than a year, the scanner became practically useless. Scans would take up too much disk space, copies were crappy and the software was confusing to configure and use. Also, Visioneer software loads itself into memory at boot up and slows down system performance. It would not operate properly on certain Windows operating systems and worst of all, Visioneer would not provide new driver for it.

Somebody give these guys a clue what songwriting is. It certainly isn't running around saying dirty words with no shirt on, trying to be a fifth rate Chili Peppers/ Jane's Addiction (both yucko too!,as well as ancient history ). I was given this disc for free at one of their shows(which was hard enough to take)and promptly sold it to the used CD store after one painful listen. People must get the impression that this garbage is all the state of Maryland has to offer musically;we also have a thriving roots music/alternative country,garage rock, and power pop scene that these guys and their Fowl records disciples are not part of.

Its a strange mix of old and new, and the actions scenes are very comic book in their execution. The only bad points of the film are Rhona Mitra's incredible lack of acting skills, she is the original 'Lara Croft'model, game fans, and the cartoon like CGI monster... Those points aside, if you like movies with big swords, over the top martial arts, big monsters and a pumping dance and heavy metal soundtrack, Anthrax and Rob Halford are just two of the acts included, this just might be the film for you......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story, Bad Writing, Bad Acting, Bad Directing","review":"And worst of all was the techno music, which in no way fit the setting of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Film Was a Waste of Time","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said, \\"Read the book.\\" Or better yet, see Thirteenth Warrior, which is another fanciful rendition of this myth.Yeah, it's a B movie. It even has glimmers of interesting character development and plot line in it. But it's also-as one reviewer recognized--a pseudo video game, an imitation of an imitation of a life. It's a hostile, cretin, pubescent violence fantasy, festering in a cracked mirror. Beowulf, in the original tale, saved people from the monsters and nobly sacrificed himself. In this moronic film, he is a sociopathic \\"swiss-army-knife\\" who wants us to feel sorry for him. BEOWULF, the film, is gratuitous violence run amok. Who is the real monster in this film? Who really cares if the main character gets et? Everybody, not just mostly everybody, should have died in this film. They were all despicable."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"This is a pretty bad movie. It was only 90+ minutes and it seemed like forever. The sets are pretty good and some of the action scenes are as well. That is about all that is good. The special effects are bad...laughingly so at the end. There is no character development and most of the actors don't even bother to act (such as the king). There isn't much plot, except near the end. You spend the whole movie wondering when the actual story will begin. It canabalizes the Beowulf legend to the point where the only thing in common is some monster killing everyone. And while they claim it is a \\"technofuture\\" its really just a medieval setting with some props forced in (like a loudspeaker in a stone castle). You'd be much better off watching The 13th Warrior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beowulf films","review":"I liked the 13th Warrior, at least they tried to recreate the world that actually existed, but in reality it was based on a novel by Michael Crichton called Eaters of the Dead, not Beowulf. Making a film version of Beowulf in the time it existed would be possible, but with no help from the poem. It's images of lands and places are sparse. The original poet liked to describe the insides of rooms, gold, gifts, weapons, battles and skirmishes, but the setting is very sparse, the filmmaker must supply his own image of the setting. I agree however, that this was not the setting the film needed, it suffered as a result. F/X can't make up for poor writing, nothing can, which is exactly why you shouldn't see this film. I was disappointed that Chris Lambert would condescend to play such an empty role in a film that is like a small child with anemia, there's not much hope for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Anyone Read?","review":"I'm sitting here reading these reviews and wondering if anyone even read the description on the back of the box about this movie. Over and over people are commenting on the technology that is present in the movie. Well, if certain people had takent the time to read the synopsis on the back cover, one would find that this moves takes place in a futuristic setting. There are some remanants of technology left, but most of it has been left behind in a \\"muted past\\".I didn't find this movie to be a masterpiece, but it was enjoyable for at least a night's rental. Christopher Lambert is just wooden throughout and does his best job at being Mad Max, but just does not pull it off. The character Kyra is tough and really is the only believable person in the movie. What I did like about the movie was the setting, the costumes, the weapons, and overall bleak post apocolyptic vision of the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie, bad writing, bad everything","review":"Ok, where to start with this piece of junk. Christopher Lambert sleep-walks through his scenes and the other actors take their queue from him. The soundtrack his pure heavy metal with no real link to the scenes. The set is minimalist to say the least - pipes and natural gas flames do not make a set. Writing was atrocious, directing was even worse if that is possible.This movie is just one more reason that Hollywood should not be allowed to touch a classic written story. Read the classic Anglo-Saxon story, but don't get this movie. Avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just a movie...","review":"There's two ways you can watch this movie:#1 - as a film rendition of the great epic poem of the same name.#2 - as a cheesy action flick.Once you settle into watching this movie as #2, you'll be Ok. If you expect this to be Beowulf (\\"t ws god cyning!\\"), you'll be severely disappointed, as the movie seems to just borrow a few key ideas from the poem, but goes on it's own from there.It took me about 10 minutes to stop looking for parallels between the movie and the poem, and when I stopped doing that, I was finally able to settle into watching the movie.I wouldn't buy this movie, but I rented it, and for $5, it kept me busy for a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"for sci-fi fan; not English teachers","review":"This version of Beowulf is perfect for those who enjoy Sci-Fi movies; however, if you are searching for a classroom supplement to the epic poem, this selection is not for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed opportunity","review":"What a pity! For once, a kind of historical theme based in the Middle Ages was picked up by the film industry and what is the result: a mixture of Mad Max, Alien and the 13th Warrior plus Techno-Music and technical equipment that did not quite fit into the time. I wonder how the producers put those things together!Anyhow, if you are looking for action-type movie without hoping to see mythical themes covered then you may enjoy it. But: thank god it only lasts for 89 minutes. Christoph Lambert is not as bad as some reviewers write but lightyears away from his performance in Highlander.In conclusion: a lost opportunity to show something interesting. Never even consider buying this ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeesch","review":"I'm convinced that this is the worst movie ever made. I rented it because it sounded like it might have been remotely interesting but it wasn't even that. The story was godawful, the acting was worse and the effects were comical. So instead of purchasing this film, do yourself a favor. Take the money you were going to spend on the tape, buy a torch and a metal hanger, heat the hanger with the torch and beat yourself senseless. It would be infinately more enjoyable than watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"I only saw this movie because Patricia Velazquez is in it. Lets put it this way her small scene in the beging is really the only scene worth watching. I think Christopher Lambart is a first class actor the story is wonderful and so is the sets and music. The audience has to almost help make the story because it seems like the movie is either in future of in the past its hard to say, the movie is based on a 18th century poem and the way people dress and the way they live seems to be from the past but then there is the little thing of having zippers, lighters, and so on and so. I don't understand either that only one person in the movie has an english accent shouldn't they all? In all i found the movie hard to understand you have to watch it a couple of times and read allot about it on the internet to undertstand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink! Stank! Stunk!","review":"Unbelievably stupid and inane. Chris Lambert has the acting ability of a limp dish rag. If you haven't seen a pseudo-martial arts film that spends most of its time having the actors sommersault backwards again and again and again and again to a soundtrack filled with WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!, then this film is for you. And the fact that this film is based on what is considered the first English language literary classic is sacrilegious. Everyone associated with this film should be subjected to that huge single-edged razor blade used to separate people shown in the beginning of the film. This goes down in my books as one of the biggest bombs of all time. And Chris Lambert is positively laughable as an actor. Bar this man from acting!! Trash this film or--better--use it to prep people in how NOT to make a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worthwhile on any level","review":"I rented this film knowing it would have nothing to do with Beowulf, the book. In fact, I rented it expecting very little, except for maybe a couple good action scenes and some Rhona Mitra cheesecake. There's one passable action scene in the first few minutes, and Rhona Mitra is appealing in her low-cut leather bodice, but she doesn't really do anything in the movie, and frankly, neither does anyone else. This movie is ten minutes of excitement jam-packed into two hours. It's not really \\"funny bad\\" in a B-movie way, and it's not really interesting on any other level. The biggest laugh you will get out of this flick is the \\"Mortal Kombat\\" rip-off opening credits. If you're looking for a cheesy B-movie to watch, re-rent an old favorite and don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideously Awful!","review":"Wow. I really didn't know they made movies this bad. While Lambert has been known to star in a few clunkers this one has to take the cake. The script is just the pits, the soundtrack is an incessant techno-type music that seems out of place, the setting is terribly unconvincing, and the actors (to the extent that they can act) are worse than just about anything I've ever seen.Avoid this film unless you are a connoisseur of bad movies. Otherwise, it'll subtract at least 5 points from your IQ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Beowulf movie ever.","review":"I've seen every movie versian of Beowulf that I know of and this is the only one yet that disapointed me. Setting, casting, custumes, props, soundtrack(WTF!), dialogue and the very story itself were all garbage. It seems as though every character in the story has a differnt accent with no effort put in whatsoever to make it seen like they didn't all come right off the boardwalks of California. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed adaption of the classic epic","review":"If you are a literary nut looking for a sophisticated adaption ot the Beowulf epic you might be a little disappointed. However, if you are a little more open-minded or enjoy a good action flick this one is great. The fantasy like setting is extremely well done and somehow the use of modern technology doesn't seem out of place here. The storyline is changed slightly from the original work to make it more presentably to the big screen. Some of the things are a little weird but the gorgeous women more than make up for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A True \\"B\\" Movie","review":"Having read Beowulf as a high schooler, I wondered if anyone could do justice to the epic poem. Unfortunately, we will have to wait.

The highlight of the film has is the fight exchanges, and even then, the feats fall flat. In a day when the Matrix and Jet Li (Romeo Must Die) have taken fight scenes to the next level, employing the latest and greatest computer aided and stunt techniques, Beowulf takes us back to the dark ages of cinematography. My recommendation: if you must see it, wait for it to come on television. It is truly a \\"B\\" Movie....BAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaming Beowulf...","review":"This movie was, in short, terrible. The storyline was filled with holes and didn't even come close to following the original epic written so long ago.The actors almost seemed to be ashamed of themselves for taking part in this F-movie production. Simply because Christopher Lambert can wield a sword doesn't make him right for the part of a warrior as great as Beowulf was meant to be. Rhona Mitra was a waste of a character. As was Gotz Otto. Out of all the characters that were written in the epic poem only two of the original names were used. The rest were changed or omited unnecessarily.The creature they came up with for Grendel was cheap and even silly to say the least. The rest of the special effects were second rate as were the actors.The end scene with Grendel's mother was drawn out and sad.If you want to see a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the great epic of Beowulf then buy otherwise save your money for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The profanation of Beowulf","review":"After reading Beowulf I was curious how this great epic could be translated into other genres. Part of what makes the poem great is its language. It's chant-like use of alliteration, caesura and compound wording makes it beautifully nuanced reading. Moreover, the story itself has all the essential parts and themes to keep the reader intrigued. The film adaptation, however, had none of this.I was very disappointed to find that besides ignoring all of the above, the movie created such ludicrous plot twists as a weakly contrived love interest and far fetched psychological melodrama.

I say this is way better. Full Circle does not have the stand out tracks this cd has. If you are wondering what Saga sounds like and would like to get one of their more recent cds get this one.My favorite tracks are Money Talks, Always There and Only Human. But a strong cd overall.

But our experiences were entirely different. I hope no one thinks all orders were like hers! I guess I must have been in a house entirely populated by nuns like Armstrong's saintly and brilliant Mother Bianca! I did not stay either, but am honest enough with myself to see that 1) I hadn't a vocation, and 2) everything I did was my own choice. Why would anyone stay in a place with a Mother Walter? And why would her order put someone like that in charge? I would be interested in hearing that nun's rebuttal. Having said all that, I did enjoy the book. Armstrong is simply one of the best writers on religious subjects. I am sorry she has no faith herself any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intense Story of A Young Woman's Spiritual Struggle","review":"Amazing detail about internal sturggles; the book manages to be both compassionate and honest at the same time, especially when discussing some of the cruelty she suffered under her superiors, especially Mother Walter.

It is also excellent, and even more mature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed emotions","review":"I enjoyed this book for it's view into the cloistered life of a nun- pre-Vatican II era, but the problems I perceived from the author's vocation seems to have resulted more from personality conflicts and clashes than anything. I couldn't relate effectively to her plight and wondered why she stayed as long as she did. I was also bewildered by her declaration that she didn't believe in the resurrection of Christ. I'm still scratching my head over that one since she obviously believed in the virgin birth (which requires alot of faith as well) and the divinity of Christ or else why the heck was she there in the first place??? I think there was more going on in her head when she decided to leave the convent than she leads us to believe, especially considering her more recent books like The History of God. I think maybe one of the mother superiors in her book had it nailed when she said that karen had a problem with intellectual pride."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD BOOK/ LAPSED CATHOLIC/ FORMER NUN","review":"WE ALL GO THROUGH JOURNIES IN LIFE, IT IS SAD SHEHAS LEFT THE CHURCH, AND EXPRESSES HER OPINION'S IN SUCH A ONE SIDE WAY.

I took a chance, and I'm very glad I did. EXCELLENT READ! I had fun with this book, enjoyed the cast of characters, enjoyed the story. I like the writer's style - the author kept a lot of characters going in this book and didn't lose my interest. I liked the main character Ester. She got involved, and she helped solve the mystery and fight the good fight. The names of the characters might throw you - the names are \\"theatrical\\" (like Golly Gee, Darling Delilah), but since the characters are mostly actors or performers, this can be forgiven.

Magician assistants are disappearing all over N.Y. and it's no illusion. Actress Ester Diamond quickly adjusts to the amazing realization that magic is real and sets out to solve the mystery behind the disappearances so that her big break shot at stardom won't be her final role. Ester pulls together an unlikely group of cohorts to solve the mystery and tries to resist the hunky detective who suspects Ester knows more of what is going on then she is willing to share. This was a fun romp, nothing heavy or serious, with zany characters, but entertaining enough to look for the next one in the series when it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Mystery with some Cool Magic","review":"I really enjoyed the \\"cast\\" of the book, mainly the \\"crew\\" with the super-old guy as the fighter of evil with the help of the very smart and Agatha-Christie-like heroine. She's the kind of young woman you want at your side, really a role model as a great friend, and she ends up helping strangers. I think this is a good scifi/paranormal read for any age.

Least that has been the performer's credo, but when magician's assistants start disappearing--yes, almost on a nightly basis--Esther Diamond skips out on doing the 'disappearing act' in her current production. Instead she goes to work with 300 plus year old sorcerer, Max Zadok, to try and find who is making these women disappear. As the incidences pile up, Esther and Zadok acquire quite a team of helpers, including a crew of transvestites, a cowboy and a socialite magician. While this does make for a varied and interesting cast, there are far too many toss-off lines and too much repetitive dialogue. For those of you who have read Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels, \\"Disappearing Nightly\\" is definitely a pale copy. If you are into fantasy, go ahead and read the book, but add Evanovich if you want some truly hilarious mystery stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Package fine; pan bent or warped and they shipped it anyway!","review":"I would assume whoever packages these items, looks at them -- this should be a round pan -- not a dented pan.

Nice and heavy in weight (yet not overly heavy), and the non stick surface is both durable and incredibly easy to clean. Eggs, omelettes with cheese, are easily cleaned off.

Anolon will make their money on me many times over as this will be my cookware of choice from now on assuming the other pieces in the Advanced line are this nice. Much heavier than you would expect. Because of that, it's a little slower to heat up, but for even heating, great non-stick properties and super easy cleanup, you can't beat this pan. I love that it's got non-stick on the outside of the pan, too. That means it not only works well, but it stays looking good, too. Excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best skillet I own","review":"This skillet is excellent for the price. The non-stick coating on this pan is REALLY slick and I easily cook up eggs for breakfast where others stick and fail. Even heat distribution and great construction round out the package.

I had heard there were differences in the two religions and was very interested in learning what they were. It took a while for me to get used to the wording used in this story. Most Amish stories explain what their terms mean. The story got so exciting I didn't mind having to assume what the terms meant.

Britan in the late 1970s was a grim place;unemployment,IRA bombs,recession,depression.These were the reasons why punk had to happen. The first truly great Pistols movie(after the disapointing Great Rock'N'Roll and Sid & Nancy).Excellent retropective interviews with the four surviving Pistols,a dazzling array of clips and concert footage and,best of all,previously unseen interview footage with the late Sid Vicious,who proves to be surprisingly articulate and intelligent.You can't help but feel touched when John Lydon sheds a tear for his deceased friend.

The film beautifully outlines the short history of those quintessential punk rock icons, the Sex Pistols, from their painful birth out of the English social strife in the late 1970's, to the heights of infamy, to their on-stage self-destruction just two years later. A must-see for any alt. rock fan. The \\"cut and paste\\" quality of the piece might rub some the wrong way, but I feel it fits the subject matter like a glove. If you have an interest in punk rock, or in general hellrazing, you're gonna want to see this!Favorite quotes:\\"We managed to offend all the people we were f***ing fed up with...\\" - Johnny Rotten\\"We weren't the nice boys that they thought we were.

We wanted more than fiction, we wanted to see what it was like as a Sex Pistol first hand, and who would know better than the Pistols themselves? Thats what The Filth & the Fury was made to correct: the deciet that Malcom McLaren projected into the enraged \\"punk-rock\\" audiences of the late 1970's England scene. And amazingly, that fraud has lingered on into the late nineties where the confusion about the true Sex Pistols is still being pondered. As you will see, this film is based fully on the truth; no scripts, no rehersals, just truth.

It made me wish I had the kahunas to do the same ... they had the courage to stand up to society, authority, etc. to make their voices heard. And, at times, were just nuts. Very entertaining, interesting. Really enjoyed the flashes of 70s commercials/popular t.v.

I can say this is a touching, hilarious, inspiring, fascinating film about some very young men, their music, their fashion and the social upheaval they caused just by saying what they believed.Julien Temple does a great job with the movie itself, giving the Pistols a strong sense of context for the American viewer, but his commentary on the DVD leaves something to be desired.

I think any big Sex Pistols fan would not be disappointed by this film. Even if your not a fan I'm sure you'll like this film. To see the rise and fall of the Pistols was very cool to see. The thing that I did not like the film was that the Ramones and the Clash were not mentioned. The Ramones started the whole sound, and the clash and the pistols were like brothers. It all just seemed very odd to me. What I also didn't like with this DVD was the lack of features. You only have the trailer, director commentary and the documentary of the whole punk movement, which all that I thought was good but I just thought they should've added more interviews or more footage of shows, tv stuff, etc. If your a fan or not, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOLLOCKS!!!!!!","review":"The Pistols made Punk into the biggest media bonanza since hippie.When Punk came out, to spread out its dirty little wings, the generation caught by the narcotic f**k up of the sixties had a new hope something to fight for, to live, but within months the dream was sold, baught out it was turned into another commodity beacause of bands like The Pistols,The Damned, and the Clash.

However, there is no section for X, and the sections for Y and Z are only a half-page each. The entries present are well written, but there are simply too few entries. For example, although the book's title is \\"Whodunit?: A Who's Who in Crime and Mystery Writing\\" by my count there are only three authors listed under A and seven under T.Because of the excessive pruning of significant and even important potential entries, this is not a book than can be recommend as a reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the finish!","review":"I enjoy Hillerman.

The writing style is classic Hillerman, and wonderfully entertaining, but you expect a story to have an ending! It was interesting that in the promo for his memoir (the publisher should have used the pages completing the story), he refers to a book he wrote that had an inadequate ending.

The mystery is good and watching retired Lt. Joe Leaphorn work it from one end and Jim Chee work it from another was interesting and enjoyable. The banter in the early parts of the book between Chee and Cowboy Dashee is very enjoyable.

Very disappointingly, Hunting Badger has no character development of the antagonists, no suspenseful plot and no real conclusion. This book seems to me to be a \\"My editors want another book.\\" piece. I look forward to additional Hillerman books with hope that he will again do his usual interesting charatcer development as well as geographically detailed work. But, as far as Hunting Badger goes, miss it. It isn't very good. jbd"},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of hero","review":"If you want an action filled story that's full of blood and gore then this is not the book for you. If on the other hand you like a hero that would never consider himself a hero and uses his mind rather that his fists then you may like this book. If you have an interest in learning about different cultures then you will definitely like this book. Even though he usually leaves his pistol in the glove compartment of his pickup officer Jim Chee always seems to get his man. In his spare time he is learning to be a Navajo medicine man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Hillerman's best efforts","review":"The characters are familiar to Hillerman fans and the plot and story are good enough for a decent read. But publishing houses obviously do not proof read books any longer. There are numerous typos that distract the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"hunting badger","review":"A major disappointment for Hillerman fans. The type is large and the page format designed to make little appear to be a lot - it DOESN'T! Tony should be embarrassed to offer a minor effort like this to his long term fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks vitality","review":"I have read all of Hillerman's work and this was one of his weakest. It did seem like he was just going through the motions. It was particularly weak on the Navajo culture that is usually fascinating and the reason I read him."},{"rating":"1","title":"hillerman befogged","review":"i am a long time fan of tony hillerman but this one has tested my loyalty. no question that it was abysmally edited but has anyone stopped to puzzle out where the villain at the end managed to get his truck loaded with the missing money since he's hardly had time to arrive and shoot up his partners. hillerman must have been working on a bad batch of peyote. harper collins should be ashamed of themselves"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunting for a reason to like this book.","review":"Tony Hillerman is a great American author. His Jim Chee / Joe Leaphorn mysteries have introduced me to the Navajo culture and the American southwest, about which I knew little before I began to read his books. Therefore, I was very disappointed to discover that Hillerman's most recent book, \\"Hunting Badger\\", is far below his usual standards. I read the book before coming to this site, and I agree with the many criticisms posted by other reviewers. What I would like to add is my concern that two or more reviewers stated that \\"Hunting Badger\\" is the first Hillerman book they have read and it will be the last. They don't know what they're missing! \\"Hunting Badger\\" is in need of better editing, plot strengthening, more character development... and an ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinetah","review":"This is another typical Hillerman, with his signature plots and style.I find books like HB one of the best way to understand the Southwest, canyonlands between Bluff, Blanding, Shiprock and Flagstaff. Its people, from rugged ranchers, to acculturated Navajos & Hopis and the 'traditionals'. And the interesting and often exhilarating competitive cooperation between various law enforcement agencies, including Tribal Police, BIA agents, FBI, State Police, INS agents, Border Patrol etc.before he died, Jim Chee's spiritual father, taught him one last lesson to become a hataalii singer. \\"When you heal people who are out of harmony, who see no beauty anywhere... you tell them that the Power that made us made all this above us and around us and we are part of this Power and if we do as we are taught we can bring ourselves back into harmony. To cure them you must make them believe. You must believe so strongly that they feel it. \\"Can't miss with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfinished","review":"Tony Hillerman is my favorite author. I re-read his earlier books while waiting for the next in the series to arrive. I visited Navajo Country just to be near the land and people he brings so completely to life. Hunting Badger made me fear that there will soon be no additions to the stories of Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn. Much of the plot seems calculated to tie up loose ends, to settle story lines. I read that Mr. Hillerman has been ill, and that he recently lost a beloved brother. I hope he isn't contemplating retirement. Please, Mr. Hillerman, send Jim and Joe to us again soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misstep in the series","review":"I've been a fan of the Hillerman series for many years, but Hunting Badger represents a great disappointment. I only hope that most new readers begin with another book in the series--any other would do. Also, why name a book after the villain if you're not going to confront or even glimpse him in the book? I felt as though Hillerman simply got tired and quit before he wrote the final chapters. Lots of typos and poor editing throughout. Maybe he had a falling-out with the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best effort!","review":"I received this book, which I'd anxiously awaited, for Christmas, and was disappointed. Weakly plotted, not Mr. Hillerman's best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth or fiction?","review":"Mr. Hillerman should at least get the facts straight in his author's note! Officer Dale Claxton was murdered on May 29, 1998 not May 4. Disjointed and poorly proofread, this novel is at least a short one. I find it unfortunate that Mr. Hillerman uses the tragic incident in Cortez as the basis for a diatribe against the FBI."},{"rating":"1","title":"As The Sun Slowly Sinks Into the West . . .","review":"I think it may be time for Mr. Hillerman to end this series of novels. I've read them all, but the most recent books, including this one, just don't measure up to the earlier stories. Leaphorn and Chee (and the FBI) are becoming caricatures. I think this series has run its course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"This was my first Hillerman book, but I don't know if I will be trudging my way through another. As a fan of the modern detective/crime genre, I thought it would be great to happen upon another prolific author. Instead, I found myself mired down in the multiple characters introduced in the first 100 pages or so, even going so far as to skip whole passages. My attention just was not grabbed, let alone held. I may try another of his books, as several of the reviews indicate this is not one of the author's best, but I'd recommend John Sandford's \\"Prey\\" series or one of Johnathan Kellerman's great Delaware novels long before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft cover incomplete?","review":"This is not actually a review; its a question. I have Harper Torch soft cover edition. On page 318 the story just ends without tellin the reader what happened to the Badger aka Ironhand. Am I missing something here? If there is another reader who can set me straight, I'd be grateful. My copy just seems to end and then there is a promo for Hillerman's Memoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his Best","review":"The audio version of this book made a 6 hour trans-Penn drive go very fast. Hillerman has a knack for weaving interesting characters, intricate plots, and Navajo mysticism into one cohesive package.\\"Hunting Badger\\" recounts a multi-departmental manhunt for three cop-killer/thieves through the area surrounding the Four-Corners region. Our familiar heros are faced with the task of solving the crime despite of the best efforts of both the criminals and the FBI.My only criticism is that I would have liked more explanation of the motivations of the criminals, and more of an aftermath. This book lacked some of the action of some of the other books, but what it lacked in gunplay it made up in interesting deduction.Like his other works, it is a quick read and a good book on tape. And, being a reflection of an actual event, the plausibility factor increases the interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunting Badger","review":"This is my first Hillerman book, and it will also be my last. I put it down after enduring 125 pages. I am not sure what the problem was, but it never really grabbed hold of me. The book seemed to just meander along without any real bite."},{"rating":"2","title":"GPS Power/Charger","review":"There's not much to say. It is an original Garmin product that works perfectly.

Like \\"maybe I just ingested something I shouldn't have\\" strong. The effect is lessened when combined with other spices. I used a no salt blend (Kirkland brand) and added Nu Salt to give the blend a little more salty flavor. It worked OK, but not as tasty as I had hoped. I'll likely try out other similar products. If they all taste like this, then I'll just use it sparingly with heavy doses of other spices. It is definitely worth it to try to find tasty lower sodium options. Salt kills."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE USING","review":"This product was used in our hospital and had to be pulled.If you have poor renal clearance or suseptable to retaining Potassium you could have heart failure and die.

Doctor told us to eliminate solt from his diet as much as we can. So I ordered Nu-Salt. This product does not even taste like salt, it tastes like an iron, very strange and unpleasant taste. People, please DO NOT buy a whole 12 pack before you taste it. I'm actually pretty amazed that people leave good feedbacks for this product which is in my case totally oposite. Try to use lemon, lime or maybe different type of salt replacement but not Nu-Salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if you're sensitive to MSG","review":"I bought this at the health food store, and I guess I could get used to the bitter aftertaste that, as one other reviewer says, ends up in your throat, but I should have read the ingredients more closely. Even if I liked the taste, I couldn't use it because of that last ingredient \\"natural flavor\\". Not sure if you're aware, but that's one of the many aliases of Mono-sodium Glutamate, as in \\"Accent\\", and is a flavor enhancer. Many people have no known sensitivities to MSG, but I'm a lifelong migraine sufferer and have to keep an eye out for it because it's poison to my system."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff is absolutely NASTY!!","review":"I have no idea who is submitting the 5* reviews here, but they lost their taste buds years ago.This stuff tastes nothing like salt. It has a horrible bitter after-taste that lingers in your mouth ruining anything it touches.Try it at a restaurant or something before buying it. It even nauseates in cooking or in recipes requiring any significant amount of salt.If you are on a salt free diet, find something else. Yuk! With a capital Yuk!!=============UPDATE=====================I have found one use for this. In cooking, with tomato sauce, if you mix it with real salt, you need much less salt. The tomato sauce appears to nullify the bitterness somehow. So, if you like pasta with sauce but have to cut down on salt intake, perhaps this is the answer for that.But it is NO salt shaker for the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!","review":"You should not use potassium chloride if you have kidney failure, Addison's disease, severe burns or other tissue injury, if you are dehydrated, if you take certain diuretics (water pills), or if you have high levels of potassium in your blood (hyperkalemia). Potassium chloride may be harmful to an unborn baby. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Serious side effects of potassium include uneven heartbeat, muscle weakness or limp feeling, severe stomach pain, and numbness or tingling in your hands, feet, or mouth.In addition to all this scary information...product tastes horrible. Like something that is not intended for human consumption. Its bitter with a definate 'bite' and aftertaste. I would not expect anyone to use this product regardless of their health...it's that bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NU-SALT","review":"I have been using this product for many years.

Long and seemed like it took forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drums in the Deep South","review":"This DVD is of a very poor quality, looks like reel to reel copy, similar to a home copy. Guy Madison is listed as apparently the main actor, whereas in reality, he is fourth or fifth down the line. I complained of this to your company at the time of viewing, but heard nothing at all, not even a courtesy reply. Hense, after generally good service, as your company did not fulfil what I think is good business, I have not purchased anything since. Not much to your company, but still fair expenditure in the past from my end. A pity, but unless things chance, that is the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"no Rod Stewarts here","review":"Cibo Matto are one of the many bands trying to be too many things at once while winking to their friends in the audience. Stereotype A is an appropriation of many disparate styles, and it never comes together. The one lead singer in the band is very attractive, which makes their shows a must. Nothing on Stereotype A suggests that Cibo Matto will ever be able to incorporate many styles into one seamless blend like a music maestro such as Rod Stewart, whose many great albums are on sale right here at amazon, the country's most reliable source for music and book purchases. I think Yuko is the name of the very attractive member of Cibo Matto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cibo - Oh no!","review":"I'm a big fan of Cibo Matto's \\"Viva La Woman!\\" and was really looking forward to this new cd.. But here it is almost a year later and I still can't listen to it clear through. Fans of their earlier work should stay away, or at least be ready to be disappointed. Songs like \\"Working For Vacation\\" and \\"King Of Silence\\" are very catchy, and worth the price of the cd. The focus no longer seems to be on beautiful, bizarre, and haunting vocals, but on the electric and synthesizer heavy background trash. I hope their next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful CD","review":"Cibo Matto 1999! This is the best driving music i have ever heard! Just listen to Sunday part 1. I bet you'll instantly think of driving through a huge city. Its great for parties too! A pure and original blend of pop, techno, jazz/blues and rap makes this cd enjoyable for everyone. The tracks have a curious transition however. One songs happy and whizzy and poppy then the next is a distorted roller coaster of rhythms. Its a great experience. I would reccomend this cd to everyone because everyone i know liked it a lot when i showed them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!! Cibo Matto Rox!","review":"Cibo Matto is such a cool group. They are very original and well..... are just out of the oridinary! I love them so much. tracks such as 'Flowers', 'Spoon', and 'Working for Vacation' are stellar. These two woman (Miho Hantori and Yuka Honda) have come a long way in music. One of the reasons they are great is because you can't classify them into a group such as pop or jazz, rock etc, etc. So if you love life buy this CD immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 4.5","review":"A Japanese-born duo relocated to New York and christened with an Italian band name. Their surreal narratives sung in a combination of French and broken English may not be for those fans of J-Pop groups. I have seen this group emerge since 1994 since their first release Viva! La Woman in 1996 ... this is when I immediately started to buy their releasing albums. We should be thankful we have an imported talent from Japan signed to Warner Bros."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good a Viva","review":"For me, this sophmore effort from Cibo Matto is a little bit disappointing. This time around there are less food references one of the things I loved on the first lp and second this album is less wacky and hip-hop oriented with the exception of Sci-Fi Wasabi. You definitely can feel the influence of Sean Lennon on this album. It seems Cibo has gone toward the pop route, which is not good. A plus side of this album is that it demonstrates Miho's great voice, she is way more clear and fluent on this one. Moonchild is a good example on how good Miho's voice is. I like how Cibo is evolving their sound, but this evolution is below par, hopefully the next time around they evolve again for the better. Overall is a good album, but I like Viva better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect way to end the 1990s!","review":"This 1999 album captures the best of the 90's lounge vibe and has really aged well. I still play it often and love hearing Sean Lennon on it. Every song is a keeper. Just pure pleasure for now people. I wish they'd get back to gether and record again. I want THIS sexy back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quantum Leap","review":"I loved Viva La Woman, but Stereotype A has to be considered a qunatum leap forward for Cibo Matto. A lot more cohesive. They haven't lost their tendency toward the experimental, but it's a little more contextual this time out. Fantastic ballads in \\"Moonchild\\" and \\"Stone\\". Really well crafted songs reminiscent of some of the best of Tropicalia. Perfect for a drive down the SoCal coastline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infectious pop goodness!","review":"I have been flipping through the reviews here, wondering if those who think VIVA is a superior disc are crazy?! While a fine debut, this album is so much better. I agree that the older version of \\"Spoon\\" from the SUPER RELAX e.p. is better than the newly recorded version. Otherwise, I think that this disc is a blast. Tracks like \\"Lint Of Love\\", \\"King Of Silence\\", and \\"Moonchild\\" are heads and tails above anything they've done before. I got an advance of this album back in April and I listened to it so much that I had to get another copy---I wore it out. This album deserves your time and your dollars. BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Ever!","review":"\\"Stereotype A\\" is a CD that I can listen to over and over and over and not get tired of it. I've been a cibo matto fan since Viva!, but I'd still say that the new CD blows the last one out of the water. They are great live now, too, with the addition of Sean Lennon and others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the quirky fun?","review":"This was okay but I already own Pizacatto Five and Stereolab. I miss the innovative loops and samples - like from the first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy...","review":"Sometimes simple is best, so I will keep this simple. This is the grooviest album I have heard in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cibo Matto Goes Mainstream R&B","review":"What a disappointing, overproduced, overhyped mess. Yes, the ladies have abandoned their former trip-pop, sampled, quirky kookiness for radio friendly, very mainstream r&b blandness, replete with empty romanticized lyrics (I really miss the food references) and annoying (Shades of a Carpenters revival) backing vocals. There are only two vaguely salvagable tracks here \\"Sci-Fi Wasabi\\" (Derailed for me by an uncool Star Wars reference) and \\"Blue Train\\" (Sounds like a bad Buffalo Daughter outtake). The rest is an indistinguishable blip on the Top 50 charts. And why did they tamper with \\"Spoon\\", which was perfectly fine in its former incarnation (Perhaps to show off their improved diction)???? They're sure to make lots of money (Probably the idea)with this as the new Japanese TLC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wear it out!","review":"Last week, I had my wallet pickpocketed, had a love meltdown- all while my father went in for emergency surgery. It is to Cibo Matto's unending credit that I somehow could not get their unusual, uncategorizable album out of my head. I sang the songs constantly to myself at some very inopportune times. The spirit of \\"Stereotype A\\" was so tender and fun that, in spite of the fact I probably would have prefered to immerse myself in some moody heroin-induced lyric of Millennial agony,I had to be a part of it. I retained a marginally good attitude. My wallet was found and my dad is going to be okay, (I'm still annoyed with my love interest.)and now that things are better I am absolutely wearing Stereotype A out. This is one of the most listenable and brilliant albums in years. Thank you Cibo Matto!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, zany fun!","review":"OK, most of us remember and cherish Cibo Matto's 'Viva La Woman'. We melt for \\"Birthday Cake\\", pine for \\"Sugar Water\\", and get a big kick out of \\"White Pepper Ice Cream\\". Well, the whole food thing isn't present on Cibo's new album, 'Stereotype A'. And in my humble opinion, it's all the better for it. While 'Viva La Woman' was an extraordinary album, I feel that 'Stereotype A' is the next step - It is strong and pick-uppish where 'Viva' occasionally stumbled. 'Stereotype' definitely shows influences in hip-hop and J-pop - but it truly depends on your personal preferences of music. Me? I'm in heaven. My personal favorites are \\"Spoon\\", \\"Sci-Fi Wasabi\\", and Speechless\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must own album.","review":"If you like eclectic sounds, this is the album to buy. Cibo Matto has always been able to blend tons of sounds into one album somehow and \\"Stereo TypeA\\" doesn't sway from that formula. There is a little bit of everything on it, from rap beats, to latin sounds, to lounge and even a taste of heavy metal. Miho Hatori's vocals are inchanting. I highly recommend this album to anyone with an ear for great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly engaging","review":"I had to read this book for a Senior Seminar in English and was surprised to find that it was an entertaining read. Granted, one must suspend disbelief in a few places in order to allow for coincidences but what Chesnutt does is something of a pastiche of different writing genres. He also goes to the very limits in portraying the many gradations that existed in the Southern color line.In truth, most of the characters are not necessarily likeable, but one cannot help turning the pages to see who will do what next. Those who chanced to pass for white were never far from an intrigue of some kind.This is a fast read as well as an entertaining one, and while Chesnutt plays with many different styles and humors, it is not without historical merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Great- this book arrived on time and was in the condition that was stated.

This CD proves me wrong. The production is thick and muddy, the playing is slow and slovenly, and the lyrics are dull and lifeless.The only redeeming tracks here are \\"Lie Down And Be Counted,\\" an acoustic strummer with a sense of humor and some tasty backing vocals, and \\"How Sweet To Be An Idiot,\\" which fits in with some of the very best of Innes' catalog. Too much of the rest of the record sounds like Innes and some studio hacks trying to fulfill contractual obligations.Thank God for the Rutles."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Remember It Well","review":"This is an excellent book.

I never gave up looking for them and was surprised to find recent publications."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULLSVILLE","review":"MAXIMUM VELOCITY's script is so shoddily written and so many plot devices unexplained, one has to wonder what in the world it was made for. Seems like perennial bad guy Michael Ironside and the US AIR FORCE have developed a Storm Fury program that can generate devastating hurricanes, and has been designed as a weapon of destruction. However, when a black comet passes through the earth's atmosphere, it causes a superstorm with the potential to devastate the entire east coast. Now Ironside seems to be doing good when Storm Fury is reinstituted to destroy this storm. The script is so wishy washy and unfocused that what little tension or suspense is generated is wasted on the muddled governmental interference. Dale Midkiff (Pet Sematary) is wasted in his good guy role, and the rest of the cast merely does their shtick.

At one point, Hawkfrost says he's Thunderclan instead of Riverclan... ugh... and various other grammar mistakes. Plus, the characterizations are beginning to run together. Oh.. and don't even get me started on things being mentioned that are completely ignored as though they are never said for books and books. At first, I put it off as: It's a book for kids... but good grief, dragging them out as far as they have and having characters acting inappropriate from what they've been told as though it never happened,... characters who have in the past been known to pay attention and dwell on such things...ugh.

The theme of the album is extremely dark and the CD simply depresses me.I am eagerly awaiting Kurt Neuwmann's solo effort (coming July 25, 2000).

I was impressed by the writing and the content. I have never met Mick Brown but I like him and I appreciate his objectivity and at the same time his receptivity to the possibility that there is more to life than what we may see or think. I was especially pleased with the chapter on Krishnamurti and the theosophical society. Having read several of Krishnamurti's works, I still find him the \\"wisest\\" for lack of a better word spiritual teacher I have ever encountered."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Guru. No Method. No Teacher.","review":"THE SPIRITUAL TOURIST: A PERSONAL ODYSSEY THROUGH THE OUTER REACHES OF BELIEF, is a personal chronicle of the author Mick Brown's spiritual peregrinations around the globe searching for...well, just plain searching. The author's search for far-flung spiritual gurus takes him from the peaks of the Himalayas to the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains and all points in between. Though Brown approaches his journey with the skeptical eye of a journalist and is forthright in his opinions, he never writes with condescension towards his subjects and allows the reader to make their own judgment about the spiritual validity of the various gurus encountered in his journey. As the title of the book indicates, Brown journeyed as an observer; I don't think he expected to find THE spiritual truth and I suppose in doing that, he indeed discovered a spiritual truth: truth will find you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A colourful intelligent journey led by an enlightened guide.","review":"The Spiritual Tourist's greatest strength is that it is accessible to believer and non-believer alike.

Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fly on the wall","review":"I enjoyed reading this book although it wasn't what I had thought it to be. Mike Brown manages to maintain a balance of scepticm and respect for each guru he encounters throughout the book, which is good, as it keeps the book open to believers and sceptics alike.My only criticism was that the chapter on theosophy was far too comprehensive and long. I actually stopped reading the book for some weeks half way through this chapter. I did enjoy reading many of the short quotes and phrases spoken by some of the Gurus and it would have been nice for more of these to have been included.Overall a interesting level headed guide to eastern guru religions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes entertaining but spiritually barren","review":"There is perhaps no bigger waste of time than reading about spirituality from a journalist with little serious interest in his subject. I can't blame the author who admits in the title that he is just a \\"tourist\\" in the spiritual realm and I am not against some healthy skepticism in approaching this subject, but it seems to do this subject justice you must actually live, not just visit, the spiritual path with some sincerity for some time in order to recommend or criticize. Without a doubt some of the teachers and gurus he visits are easy marks for some cheap shots, but that's what they feel like -- cheap shots done for the sake of entertainment, not insightfulness. The amount of time spent on Theosophy and Mr.Creme is baffling given their relevant lack of importance today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointing; I expected a much better book.","review":"From the cover I thought this was going to be fairly entertaining, but it was mushy, tedious, and lacking in any serious thought.

It's like a song for God, but a song for the people. It took some time to make that song, it's tight. Fiend definitely had the right set of producers behind him. Now all he needs is a music video or two, and a couple of songs on the radio....that's instant success right there. 4X Platinum. This right here is gonna sell millions, MILLIONS.

Its a textbook, you get what you expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is atrocious","review":"If it were possible to give negative stars I would do so for this poorly written farce. I've never read Ed Greenwood before, but he has the MOST ludicrious style of writing-- it's akin to some sort of drunken Shakespearean ramble, the way he throws in \\"henceforth\\" \\"anon\\" and every other word that makes fantasy readers' eyes roll. It doesn't seem like anyone edited this book, because the sentences don't even make sense. The descriptions are horrible and the way he writes about his female lead sound like a pubescent boy's fantasy (clingly, wet clothes, etc). UGH! I can't even keep the action straight because Greenwood has to use so many adjectives. Greenwood's habit of throwing randomly scary and deadly beasts/perils on our protagonists every other sentence is absurd. I have never read a fantasy book so poorly written and with such a pointless, mindless plot. Books like this give the fantasy genre a bad name. DON'T READ IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of book","review":"This book is full of action, adventure, and magic, so much that it seems as if it were lifted straight from a D&D campaign. Unfortunately, that doesn't make for a very good book in my opinion. The characters do ridiculous things, seeming at times like they were taken from a 14 year-old's hormone-driven fantasies. It is a fast read--you should be able to finish it in a weekend--and it certainly doesn't require much thought. If that is the kind of book you are looking for then by all means read it, I doubt you will be disappointed. However, there are other books out there that have those qualities (action, adventure, magic) but are much more interesting to read (anything written by David Eddings or Raymond Feist, for example). I gave it two stars because the book isn't unbearable to read, it's just not very interesting. Also, I don't think Mr. Greenwood was trying to write a masterpiece and I imagine it is popular among its target readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless dribble","review":"I've read almost all of Ed Greenwoods works and I really have to say that this series wins the cake on the worst one yet. It starts out with promise but the further you get in the book the more it seems to insult your intelligence. The main characters mainly go through this one and the next two just fighting an endless host of people with swords and magic. Through pure luck they continually win and if they get beat someone comes along and saves them at the last minute. There is really no plot development and it gets way too mind numbing. I made the mistake of reading the next two out of boredom and kept hoping that something would happen. IT NEVER DID!!! Even if you love Ed Greenwood please avoid this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kingless Land","review":"This was a disappointing read. On par with fanfiction at its most mediocre even down to some very overused phrases. The plot was choppy, the action muddy and the premise predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy without characterization","review":"I've read some of Ed Greenwood's other work, with mixed feelings. His Dragonlance book on Huma was pretty good, so I always try him again when I run out of other things to read.Unfortunately, this one has finished me....I'll stay away from Greenwood here on out. This book jumped around so much I couldn't keep things straight. The characters, while they had a chance to help the story, are not developed, and when they are there are inconsistencies. I like the story itself (the only reason I continued reading after 50 pages) but it's not enough for me to recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Human Happiness and Other Ephemeral Desiderata","review":"This is a great, great movie because it gives such poignant portraits of lonely people trying to find happiness . . . along with some wonderful dark humor. Described in the marketing material as reminiscent of an early Jarmusch film (a description with which I agreed), this movie also has great cinematography that operates to bring home the existential angst and jokes at the heart of the movie. For example, you will see amazing shots of characters phumphering around within the absurd constraints of their circumstances (e.g., on top of a bus, trying to figure out how to get better radio reception), silhouetted all the while by tremendous Iranian landscapes and skyscapes, reminding you of how tiny these people are and how nearly futile their plots and exertions will be in the universe of uncoordinated (yes, random) natural and human events. Each time I watch this film, I see more and more in this rich film . . .

So we went ahead and purchased this movie on DVD. However, how annoying is it when the DVD doesn't allow you to skip the previews of other insignificant movies before you actually get to see the feature film. This thing locks up your DVD player control completely (disables functions of menu / stop / fast forward) and forces you to sit through previews of five movies before ever getting to the Babe feature. It is simply the most offensive and intruding thing my family has ever experienced in DVD's and VHS.I have a lot of words to describe those folks at Universal Studio, I will try to be gentle. Let's just put it this way - your limited creativity in marketing really must be the ultimate lowest of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five-star movie, one-star \\"Special Edition\\" DVD","review":"Commercials on DVDs are nothing new. Annoying though they are, you can always skip them with a click of the remote, right? Not anymore. For Babe, a title targeted at kids no less, Universal saw fit to make the commercials non-skippable. They start as soon as you put the disc in, and the \\"Forward\\" button on your DVD player won't let you bypass them. The \\"Menu\\" button has no effect either. Even the \\"Stop\\" button won't work! Once the commercials start -- including one for the dreadful Cat In The Hat that's nails-on-chalkboard offensive -- there's no escape from them! Shame on Universal for ruining the long-awaited widescreen debut of this wonderful film. My solution: I will no longer buy Universal DVDs until they discontinue this practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal Doesn't Get It","review":"Babe, a 5 star delight of a movie, is more beautiful than ever in widescreen. The single star is for the Universal DVD. I have always supported the notion that the best way to make money is to sell a quality product. Universal doesn't seem to agree. The disc starts off with 5 minutes of forced advertising (some marketing 'genius' at Universal deserves to lose a job over that idea). The special features are the poorest I have ever seen for a special edition and include a 'making of' that is a downright lie; 5 minutes of computer graphics about how they made the animals seem to speak. I prefer to buy DVDs because I want to, not because they are the only choice, but if you want to see Babe this is the only choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie, not the previews...","review":"First and foremost: Babe is one of my favorite movies.If you haven't seen it, you're missing out.But this movie has \\"coming attractions\\", previews that cannot be skipped. Granted, they're only a few minutes long. But you have to watch them each and every time you play the disk. No skipping to the title menu.If there were other versions available, I'd buy them.Hey studios: Ineffective marketing tool. Next time I'll research before I buy, and won't buy a movie with forced previews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless!","review":"I remember when this movie first came out and I said I'm never gonna watch this crap. Then my family was like oh come on. You gotta watch this movie. They finally got me to watch it after I got bribed with Taco Bell and man, I was put to shame about what I said about this movie. It captured my heart from start to finish. Babe shows us that pigs can also get respect on the farm. He's adorable, lovable, funny, nice, and smart and finds his identidy as a \\"sheep pig.\\" At first he's being clowned about it but as the movie goes on, you see what happens. The other character that I like is Ferdinand. He is really funny. There are some sad parts like when Babe has his mother taken away from him and when Ma gets killed by the dog but every great movie needs adversity. I hate The Oscars but James Cromwell won best supporting actor for his role as Farmer Hoggett and that's one of my very few reasons why I like The Oscars.

This benefit is exceptionally true when you have kids and they want to watch a movie. Normally, you can skip the trailers and head right to the movie or at least the main menu. This DVD makes you go through each of the many trailers before you can get to the main menu. You can't fast forward through them or skip them. You must wait until the trailers have completed then select \\"Play\\" from the main menu. Because of this, we would have rather bought the VHS version of the movie. With a tape, you can at least fast forward through the trailers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE PUT THIS ON BLU-RAY!!!!","review":"That's all I'm saying - this movie screams out for Blu-ray!

One of the great thing about DVDs in the ability to skip the previews at the beginning of most VHS tapes. The first thing this DVD does is disable all controls so it FORCES the viewer to watch ALL of the previews, including one for that horrible 'Cat in the Hat' flick. The only button that works is EJECT. That's right, you can't even select STOP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compassion","review":"This is a story of Love, Compassion, and Understanding. As any good film maker is required to provide, a Story must be told. You won't be let down. But, if you don't like animals talking to each other, then you should avoid this movie(cold hearted son-of-a-gun you may be) The \\"story\\" (narration adds the gravey), is what makes this eternal and complete.

It truly is one of my favorite movies ever. It's really quite sophisticated ; mote than you would expect from a talking pig movie. It was nominated for best picture when it came out in (1997). Just a clever and darling movie. I wanted to give a fun movie to my niece and her children. Most people have seen \\"A Christmas Story,\\" so I decided on this one. \\"Milo and Otis\\" is another talking animal movie that is a lot of fun too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seller","review":"There needs to be more cartoon movies with cows and farm animals, as most toddlers love seeing animals and making animal noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-See for Animal Lovers","review":"This truly is a movie that can be enjoyed by animal lovers of all ages.

There's lots of things in here for both parents and kids.:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Film, but what about the full picture?","review":"Babe is the only series of films that through playing the theme song I actually start tearing up. The first one is simple, and so meaningful. Every moment is crafted to stick in a persons head forever, and that makes the film that much more precious. Everything about this DVD is excellent, but what I ask is, where is the WIDESCREEN VERSION! The images in this film are so meticulously crafted, depths of fields are perfect, composition is subtle, but it really matters. Everything about this movie is quite brilliant, but the DVD is lacking the original filmmakes vision to it's fullest extent. Yes buy this film, because it is the best of the available editions of it, but be prepared when half a sheep in the foreground is cut off, or when Babe and His Owner walk onto the field at the end, and it doesn't seem half as big as when you saw it at the movie theatre, and therefore far less imposing. And I give it a 4 out of 5 because of that alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Fairytale!","review":"I simply adore this movie. It is a modern fairytale. Watching it for the 1st time was like being immersed in a magical land..Timeless and without a place....a true fairytale!It is a bit dark (as most true folk/fairytales are) but that just gives it enough of an edge to make it that much more so complex.A beautiful, delightful and enchantment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5-Star Movie with a 2-Star Presentation...","review":"Here is one of the best movies ever made, but with 1/3 of the image missing. Don't buy this one, folks, wait and buy the wide-screen version."},{"rating":"2","title":"La la la, La la la, La la la la laaaaaa!","review":"This is the story of a survivor, the only little pig not to get taken to the butcher. He was just a little pink pig, and what was his usefulness. The family cat told him he was the bacon on the family table, the pork chops in the freezer. So little pink Babe had to prove his worth, and thereby not become a meal on the family table.He could talk to the sheep and the sheep finally listened because they thought he was such a sweet little thing. He could round them up and tell them to do stuff and they would do it because he was always polite when he asked.At the county fair, there was a sheep rounding contest. All the other contestants had dogs, but it was Babe the Pig who won.I'm sure anyone who watches TV on a regular basis has seen this sweet little movie. If you have not seen it, you are missing a great show. I highly recommend the movie Babe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pigs are Great, REAL GREAT","review":"Please disregard the statement below that reads (and I quote): \\"pigs are not well like for good reasons\\". I dare call that person a pompous jerk. Pigs are great for a million reasons and Babe, as a cinematic art, strives to show that. Who sings \\"la la la la la\\" to the animals? Who talks to the sheep? Who saves the day when the farmer is down on his luck? The answer to all of these is Babe, a pig. The hero pig of this movie. I ask Mr. Pigs aren't great, what would you do if I pig offered a hoof to help you out? Walk on you say? I think not. I think not.In conclusion, pigs are great and this movie shows how great they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this disc; you will be forced to watch 10 minutes of advertisements","review":"The movie is great. This disc will end up in your trashcan in pieces unless you have the patience of a saint. Universal pictures has decided that you are paying them for the imperative privilege of watching ten minutes of previews. /Dumb/ previews, through which you cannot fast forward and from which you cannot access the main menu. Buy the movie elsewhere or pirate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God they finally brought out the widescreen edition","review":"I was given a copy of BABE on DVD a couple of years ago as a gift (my girlfriend--who loves pigs--knew this is one of my favorite movies), but I was thoroughly disgusted to find, upon putting in in the DVD player, that it was a FULLSCREEN edition. I didn't even bother to finish rewatching it. I was further disgusted to learn that a widescreen edition didn't even exist.I was ecstatic to learn while Christmas shopping that a widescreen edition had recently been released. I snatched a copy of immediately, and I am happy to report that the movie was as good as I remembered it being. The film was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscar, and I was pulling hard for it to beat the bathetic and overblown BRAVEHEART for the award. Unfortunately, the best film did not win (as so oftens happens).I cannot recommend this movie strongly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wouldn't load!!

Good old fashion love story between man and pig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film with one disappointing note","review":"Absolutely splendid film, enjoyable by both children (other than the very young) and adults alike. The big disappointment, though, is the lack of widescreen format, especially missed in a film with such breathtaking cinematography, for which I've docked this DVD a star. Now available at half the price in a two-DVD package with the lesser sequel, \\"Babe : Pig in the City\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So Kid's Fodder....","review":"I was disappointed with this show, especially the ending. There didn't seem to be a point to the story. Sure, Babe was cute, and it is kind of sweet to see the animals talk, but I don't think this movie would hold much interest to those over 10. If you want a really fantastic pig movie, watch Charlotte's Web."},{"rating":"1","title":"heartbreaking and cruel","review":"I just got done watching this movie and am really disgusted.If the writers intention was to make kids and adults cry and be horrified, well thumbs up.After giving each animal personality, they got killed off.this movie went from bad to worse.The kids were so upset by it, i turned it off 3/4 of the way through and tossed it in the trash.I kept fastforwarding over sad parts, thinking it had to get happier, only to have something more awful happen next.It had potential to be wonderful, with the animation and scenery, but they made it a movie that animal lovers can not stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sad!!!","review":"I'm sorry, but my eyes were filled with tears through the entire movie!!!

It is a gentle and sweet kids' (and adults') movieand I get a big kick out of it.And Babe engages in NO SASS at all. NONE. Hooray!Language note: One \\"my God\\", several \\"stupid/idiot/moron\\", and one \\"butt-head\\". Thought you should know.

My daughter actually stood in front of the TV and started to cry because she wanted the movie to start. Shame on Universal for ruining what is supposed to be a fun experience. I've paid for the DVD - I should have full control over what is shown and not be forced to watch yet more advertising. I'll be asking for my money back on this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crocodile Dundee II","review":"A funny nonstop romp of a movie. One of the few sequels that is better than the original. Hogan and Kovoslosky have enormous chemistry and the rest of the case perform credibly. There are a few problems with story that bothered me such as why the aboriginals don't have more force and focus in the story, but it still doesn't take away from the joy in the movie. Worth seeing again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dundee 3","review":"I thought you would like to know that Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles (part 3) is coming out next year. I was one of the first people to see it (at a preview) and it was extremely funny. Much much better than part 1 and 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Sequel","review":"I know I am in the minority here but I actually liked this sequel better than the original...and the original was very good and extremely popular.Maybe I was biased because I played this with some kids present and was pleasantly surprised to hear almost no profanity, which I couldn't say was the case in the first film. It was a \\"cleaner\\" movie, and still an equally entertaining one with a good mix of drama, action, comedy and even some good music thrown in. The film has no lulls and 110 minutes go by pretty quickly.The first half of this movie takes place in New York City, where we last saw \\"Mick Dundee\\" (Paul Hogan). The second half, the crocodile man takes his bride (Linda Kozlowski) back to the outback in Australia. Hogan was never more entertaining and, of course, feeling comfortable back in his home territory.This is just a fun ride all the way and, yes, to use a cliché, good family entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker, yet not bloody","review":"This sequel is something of a departure from the original, less comic but equally character-driven, and gives us the opportunity to see Mick Dundee exercising his bush skills on his \\"native heath.\\" The story reverses the geographical course of the original, taking Mick and girlfriend Sue Charlton from New York City back to the Northern Territories in an effort to escape the Colombian drug kingpin (Ubarry) who has targeted them for death. Bad guy Rico has the men and the guns, but Mick Dundee knows the territory, and he exploits that knowledge to the fullest. Like Matthew Quigley, he picks off (or scares off) Rico's men one or two at a time, but manages not to kill any of them, while still contriving to keep himself, Sue, and old partner Walt Reilly (Meillon) alive and unpunctured--and maintaining his lighthearted outlook on the world in general. A good comedy-adventure for families to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Hogan great as always","review":"Miss these kind of movies, remember getting so excited as a kid to find out the Crocodile Dundee movies were coming on that weekend, couldn't wait to watch them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crocodile Dundee II","review":"This is my favorite of the 3 Crocodile Dundee movies!

The senator is in his late fifties and so how old is his father? If he had the senator when he was twenty he'd have to be 77. Is it really reasonable that he's running around killing people, and setting houses on fire. It was a very unlikely twist to the end. It still was a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic JAK","review":"A light fun read, and you get to learn a bit about Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which seems to take up as much room as a character in this book. The Strong Silent Man has the required quirky family. The leading lady is as always very insightful. There is humour, there is suspense, the traditional small town community and there's even a few little twists to keep you very well entertained. All in all it was a satisfying JAK story."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Night Long -","review":"Jayne Ann Krentz has the gift of making you care about her characters, she also has always plot twists that keep you reading.

It was always believed to be a murder-suicide. Irene gets called back to Dunsley by her one-time best friend Pamela Webb. Irene is anxious to hear what Pamela has to say and get out of town. Instead she discovers Pamela's body. Local residents say she had problems but Irene suspects more. Pamela's father Ryland Webb wants to put the tragedy behind him and continue his run for the White House. Irene pursues the case all the way back to her parents' old house, with the help of former marine Luke Danner. Luke and Irene both have their buried troubles however their attraction to one another is great. The dialogue weakens a tiny bit every time his brother says \\"Boy, Howdy\\" as his constant refrain. However, it is a good mystery with a convincing romance and an intriguing twist in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saute Pan at a Great Price","review":"This is a fantastic saute pan.

But is never bad, better longevity and cheaper than natural gut, and I don't see any extra benefit from natural gut for premium price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Wolfe stories","review":"\\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\" is the worst of Stout's Nero Wolfe stories. To quote Wolfe himself, (minor spoiler) the solution was \\"the silliest idea in the history of crime,\\" and the actions of a couple of other major characters are almost as preposterous."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not his best","review":"Although written in the 1940s, and using an unusual \\"in the army\\" scenario, this Nero Wolfe mystery still holds up well, not nearly as dated as you would assume. As always, Wolfe's sidekick, Archie Goodwin, supplies plenty of irreverence and laughs ... and he always gets the girl. Not the strongest in the Nero Wolfe series, but still a thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best by the ebst","review":"\\"Not Quite Dead Enough\\" by Rex Stout is one the best in the Nero Wolfe/Archie Goodwin canon. Here we have a patriotic Nero Wolfe going all out to help the Nation during World War II, with Archie serving as a Major in the US Army. The plot is a great whodunnit, which requires Wolfe to leave his brownstone mansion, unheard-of behavior for the great detective, to solve this mystery. For those who relish any good detective mystery this will be gourmet reading and, for those that already know Wolfe and Archie, it will be another wonderful reunion.J.

It's not quite as good as A Grand..., which was a great day-in-the-life-of concept album, but this one's still great. I could see if you were a die-hard rap fan who only listened to rap, you might not like this guy.The Streets always covers diverse topics (ie, missing his dead dad); he's one of the 'realest' rappers out there, not afraid to reveal his emotions and personal life.The beats are actually decent, with more electro influences. The beats are still simple. The Streets is definitely not all about great beats; it's always been about Mike's rapping/talking. Luckily that format hasn't changed at all.This is a very solid album.

I find these tapes worked very well for me even when I was writing/editing long narratives such as grants, etc. I do not like a lot of \\"new age\\" music, I tend to find it too spacey - it's ok when you are getting a massage, but not okay for staying focused, yet relaxed on a time-consuming project. I wondered if I would like this CD and if it would work. I like all the tracks well enough to listen to all of them and, at the beginning of the day or work session, I find listening to them in sequence helps me find a very productive state of mind. Once I get going, though, I tend to listen only to the second half of the disk. I would definitely recommend this CD, especially to writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete, missing musicians","review":"This release is missing two of the songs from the original performance at Woodstock, \\"Gypsy Woman\\" and \\"Mastermind.\\" Hendrix only performed these songs at the Woodstock show; therefore, their historic value is impossible to deny. Yet these songs are not on this release!Additionally, this album does not include some of the other musicians' performances. The guitar of Larry Lee, for example, has been mixed out, along with other percussion and singing.This release could have been the definitive edition of Jimi Hendrix's legendary performance at Woodstock. Instead, it represents almost nothing beyond the 1994 Alan Douglas :Woodstock release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Couldn't We Get the Uncut Concert??????","review":"It's a mystery to me why the Hendrix family (ExperienceHendrix) couldn't release the complete and uncut recording of this performance. Instead of releasing the complete recording of this historic concert, the Hendrix family has edited (or deleted) instrumental sections (from songs), guitar solos, some of Hendrix' comments between songs, Larry Lee's solos, most of the percussion section, and two songs (Gypsy Woman and Mastermind).The Hendrix family has announced in the past they have hours of live recordings. It's probably safe to say that we can expect more of the same with regard to these future recordings, that is edited songs, deletion of songs, etc.Unfortunately, we'll never be able to experience these shows complete and uncut. Despite Jimi's musical prowess and talent, which is in abundance on this recording, I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing tribute to one of his best performances","review":"Hardly anything was edited from this superior album and the way that jimi leaves the distortion in woodstock improvisation and moves on to an almost Catalan guitar solo is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I have a good collection of hendrix and heard much more; this is trash cashing in on the extremely overrated concert of its name. The band is very spotty and really juiced making them all completely unable to follow Jimi's talent (which shines through in SSB and the long solo afterwards - pretty much the only highlights of this disc) You would be much better off with Band of Gypsies or Live at the Fillmore. In this vein Isle of Wight works from a more solid foundation. Do note that Jimi never played with this band again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much editing","review":"Not a bad peformance. An understatment, obiviously, but the editing done onf this disk is dishonest. Hendrix was great, his performance was Woodstock was awesome, and maybe, just maybe,we'll get to hear it in its pure form today.

His magic and depth cab be felt each time his music oozes intensity out of the speakers. It's important to feel Jimi, to appreciate the immense ability he had not only as a virtuoso guitarist, but as a gifted song craftsman. Simply put, the man was a genius who loved and nurtured the music he wrote. His Woodstock performance, as with his studio albums and other live recordings, possess soul and character rarely found elsewhere, if anywhere at all, and are integral pieces of Rock and Roll history.

The album is four tracks long, though all are the containers for several lovely songs that are pieced together through sound collages and disjointed jams.

This book is nothing but fluff. If you are anything more than a newbie, it's got nothing and if you're a complete newbie there's just enough information to be dangerous. She promises periodically that more information will be given about actually growing certain plants, but that information is never forthcoming.It's full of personal anectdotes that have little to do with the topic at hand, the tone is condescending and she encourages the use of poisons. She anthropomorphizes plants in an embarrassing way, telling a story about a poisonous plant she accidentally purchased as if it had a personal vendetta against her and her family. Her attitude toward plants goes beyond respect into something slightly off-kilter.The book is good for a giggle. If you must read it, make sure you have a firm grasp of both gardening and herbal magic first. Otherwise you could well follow this lady into lala land."},{"rating":"2","title":"yay!","review":"I love this book. Ellen Dugan is funny, down-to-earth, and no-nonsense.

Good section on Faeries. Good personal stories. Great suggestions for planting magickal gardens. Overall I enjoyed it and refered to it while planting my own Witch Garden!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make your green thumb happy!","review":"I really enjoy Ellen Dugan's style of writing. It reminds me of talking over the rose hedge to my next-door neighbor (who just happens to be a witch like me), getting advice on all things magical. Using what I learned from this book, I created a beautiful new perrinial garden in the front of my home this spring. In addition to being beautiful, it is also an abundant supply of magical herbs and flowers that I already use in my celebration of the Lord and Lady. No more expensive trips to the cheesy witch store to get herbs! I recommend this book for the beginning garden witch as well as the more advanced practitioner. It is entertaining and informative on magical gardening as well as flower folklore and the language of tussy-mussies. Before this book, I didnt know what a tussie-mussy was. Now I love to give them to family and friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty well done","review":"I like this book, it gives tons of information and is very well written.

He was a Christian school teacher who begain collecting and compiling information and theories about creationism and evolution into a series of lectures and sermons. Some of what he has to say is good, while some is rejected by even creationists. Dr. Hovind is also a believer in conspirarcy theories regarding the UN, the US Government, and 9-11, and is a tax resister (which led to his conviction on tax evasion charges). While this has little to do with his work on creationism, it does call into question his credibility.If you want to research or study creationism, I recommend that you pass on Dr. Hovind's work and check out material by organizations like Answers In Genesis and Creation Ministries International. They employ real scientists and are much more reliable sources of creationist material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrews, Parson, and Fanny","review":"This book was assigned to me in my British Literature class for a book club. Shortly after being assigned this book, I quickly went out and began reading it. While Fielding's writing style does seem to run on a bit, his narrative wit and dialogue is enjoyable.I found myself liking the three main characters, Parson Adams in particular. He told some interesting stories, and has kind of an older brother relationship with Joesph, making him a good side character. The brief moments of action were pretty good in the story, as were the humorous bits. Its easy to see why this novel will go down as one a classic in literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great RnR; PERIOD!","review":"As mentioned by the other reviewer; thank goodness he paid for it!

Play this CD after listening to Evergrey or SymphonyX and you can tell the production is weak. They try - oh do they try.The good news -the music is to darn good. Once listening to the CD after about the 3 songs the production won't kill you as much. The Lyrics are great, the guitars, drums, keyboards, base, and arrangements all TOP NOTCH.

You can follow my progress at [...].This is a very easy to read translation unlike several others I have looked at before. The index is great for looking up doctrine based on key words or Scripture passages.If you are looking to purchase a copy of the Institutes, this is the one that I would recommend.

Paul L. Lehmann, Th.D., late theology professor at Union Theological Seminary, based his introductory course in systematic theology on Calvin's work back in 1973 when I took it. Calvin divides his effort into four books, \\"The Knowledge of God the Creator,\\" \\"The Knowledge God the Redeemer in Jesus Christ,\\" \\"The Way in Which We Receive the Grace of Christ\\" and \\"The External Means or Aids by Which God Invites Us Into the Society of Christ and Holds Us Therein.\\" I recommend this book to the theological student and pastor as well as to the layperson who wishes to do serious reading in the academic field of theology.In my 36 years in the ministry, I have been helped time and time again by this great work.Mercury Man from White Plains, Westchester County, New York"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gospel Wine","review":"This tall stack of sheets houses the most comforting words a man can read outside of the Holy Bible. Calvin writes of the one true God in all of His goodness, sovereingty, and majesty, of mankind created for His glory, of mankind's wllfull rebellion against Him, of His just punishment of mankind in this life and the next, and of His Incarnation to bring mankind back to Him by faith alone in Christ's blood alone. Calvin also writes of the Christian's proper use and enjoyment of this life and the Christian's real hope, the resurrection of the dead at the end of the world when Jesus Christ will come again to complete His deliverance of His people from their own sin, death, hell, the devil, and the wicked. Happily ,Calvin does not neglect to expose heresy and condemn it at the same time he feeds us with the good word of our Lord and our forgiveness and righteousness in His incarnation, death, resurrection and ascension.

They didn't even bother to get any Boston PD paraphenelia when Quirk and Belson make their appearances. I first saw this shortly after seeing WITCHBLADE, so I felt that Yancy Butler didn't really fit as Lisa, since the role is a lot weaker and passive than anything else I've seen Yancy do in the past. But it was interesting to see Spenser work with Vincent del Rio's enforcer Chollo, since Hawk is off in Burma for the duration of this one, and get a look at the Latino shadow world in the fictional town of Proctor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource!

I feel like everyday the boys come home with a different sport they want to join and it's so hard to pick. This book was a GREAT way to help us all figure out what would be the best for them to do. It's so easy to use and so easy to find what you are looking for right away. It has outlined notes and information about each sport that is extremely helpful in selecting the right sport for your kids. Both my boys are in baseball, but one of my sons has talked a lot lately about karate. After reading the section on Karate I talked to him about it, so he would know more about what to expect.

The book is designed for SCWCD 1.3, and did a great job covering all the topics. However, Sun Microsystem discontinued SCWCD 1.3 on December 2004.

This book covers both the standard concepts and the new features in Java Server Pages latest specs like tag libraries.The treatment of the subject is very methodical and concise. The chapters are organized such that both a new person and an experienced one can gain good value from the book. There are optimum number of examples and exercises at the end of each chapters. The selection of both examples and the exercises is very intelligent and effective.This book touches all objectives for the SCWCD exam.

I am pregnant and had gone and had my legs waxed so I wouldn't have to contort my body to get to my legs. Then I read all the reviews and decided I could save money if I just bought this instead of waxing. Well, it didn't really work for me. I have light, thin hair on my legs and it just seemed to break them off. The ones that it actually pulled out left little dot bruises on my legs so I had to wear long pants anyhow. The hair all grew back within a few days (no better than shaving) and it left my legs really, really, really dry. I wasn't any more impressed with the results of waxing, so I think I'll just be sticking with a razor. The size is great, it didn't hurt much (but it just broke off the hairs!), and seemed like a great little gizmo, but it just isn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equilator","review":"This is the first time ive used a equilator. Got to tell you it hurt the first few times and it irritated my skin a little to. Ive realized the more I use it the less it hurts.

Nearly all of the book contained folksy little anecdotes about, for example, John and Jill Doe from Faraway, Georgia who bought DELL and Intel, got enthused, started an investment club with people from their church, invested $50 EACH per week, yada yada yada.In a word, worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"How CBS Marketwatch Made a Fortune and took us for a ride.","review":"I bought this book with high expectations since I truly enjoy the insite and writing skills of Thom Calandra.

There is a section on preparing your leather for embossing as well as choosing the right weight leather for your project.The directions are clear and step by step and color pics of finished works are included. There are several projects in the book that walk you through different techniqes of embossing; from basic to how to emboss animal teeth on a dog and a cougar, how to put in glass eyes on an owl, raised letters, flowers, birds legs, as well as a project for a free standing bird, etc. Great book.

Setup with my XP desktop system went well enough and throughput was sufficient to watch videos via the wireless network. But after a week or two of use, I noticed my signal strength steadily dropped from the high 40s initially down to 15-25%. When the signal gets down below about 30% Web pages start loading slowly and videos start buffering more than usual. Also, I noticed that the Airlink adapter would be almost too hot to touch, so I developed the habit of unplugging it when not actually in use, which is a pain. I'm returning this item and will try a PCI adapter next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other brands","review":"I used this adapter for my laptop, as previous reviewer mentioned, installation is easy, and it connected to my local wireless network with no probelm. The range is good too, I connected through 100ft away, no problem, signal stayed at 50%.The problem I am having is that my laptops are configured to \\"Stand By\\" after a while, I never competely shut them down, and after waking them up from Stand By, the adapter refused to find wireless network again, even I unpluged the adapter and re-plug it back, it resisted to work. I believe it's a bug. I had to re-start laptop to make it connect, The other well known brand cards can connect to network from any state of the laptop: wake up from stand by, or unplug/plug, etc.I give it 2 star, basically because it's designed for laptop but this is unacceptable.I also tried Airlink's cardbus adapter(awlc3026), same problem.

I opened a few doors and the signal has strengthened noticeably, so maybe it's not so bad. It's small, looks and feels flimsy, and gets a little hot during use. The software is simple, but simplicity can be a virtue. I guess for the price this adapter gets the job done as long as you're not seeking top notch quality, reliability and durability.

It is insightful, analytical, intelligent, and historically accurate.\\"Power of the Witch\\" opened up an entirely new world of understanding, and revealed FACTS.

I found it as alot of jibberish, granted there was some decent parts, most of it seemed like it was written for her and only her and those she teaches.

My only reservation is that this collection doesn't include \\"The Last Round-Up\\" or \\"Bury Me on the Lone Prairie\\" -- also I would have replaced this original \\"Silver-Haired Daddy\\" with a more soulful one, but then again the one here was the one that won Gene the first Gold Record ever (not HIS first, but THE first), so it's hard not to include it. Quibbles aside, there's so much else on here that it's hard to complain -- including two very early and eerily good Jimmie Rodgers covers, with haunting guitar work, that make one wonder what Gene might have produced in his long life if Hollywood hadn't gotten hold of him.

I know autism is a serious subject and that there is grief and pain involved for the parents. Those are included here, touched on, lightly. The trip to Peggy's Cove, for example, showed the heartache of this mother of an only child. But Jennifer Overton's book \\"Snapshots of Autism\\" is really a song for her beautiful son, and parts of it are amazingly funny. I think that's what makes this book so real and so touching.Jennifer does discuss Lovaas and ABA and various other kinds of teaching and dietary theories in her search for just the right things to make Nic's life easier. But mostly this book is about the *inside* of their family--- the real deal, the gut-level day-to-day life with an autistic child. Shattered dreams replaced slowly with new hopes. The celebration of small triumphs. Laughter. And a lot of love.This is an amazing book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for those who knows very little about health.","review":"I got this book cheap at a local bookstore and I thought why not read it. I am not a person who reads much, to be honest. But I have to add this book actually got me reading something before going to bed. What I did was read at least 10 to 20 advices before sleeping.

So thanks to Celia for this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Highly Recommend!","review":"This is one of the most unique stories that I have read in a long time! Not since Stephen King started his Dark Tower series have I read a book this intriguing and different. The characters are all very interesting and the story is quite compelling.

Can't wait for the next in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"De Niro does it again","review":"After seeing this film on large screen, I knew I wanted it for my own. De Niro's character is so convincing we forget the young, thin man of The Godfather or Taxi Driver. He's great.

After watching it, all I hope is that I will forget it quickly. It wasn't just a drama (not a comedy at all), but a sad and depressing drama that left me feeling yucky after watching it. Aside from what I believe about heaven, I struggled with how this film used it--it is simply a convenient mechanism for the story to tie together. It was also painful for me to watch how the children related to their father and vice versa. There seems to be so much blaming who we are on our parents--and that's essentially what this movie is--one long, long story about blaming who they were on their dad.I don't recommend watching this movie.

Substitute Ed Asner for Robert DeNiro, Connie Selleca for Kate Beckinsale, and so on and you get the idea.The ending was predictable and pedestrian. You never got a sense that these people could even be remotely related rather than sisters and brother and father.Also, for a road-trip movie, the settings lack authenticity of place. Why would Denver be the home of the Northwest Symphony? Did the screenwriter and director both confuse Boise for Denver?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No one is fine!","review":"It's not fine! It's totally boring. I can't believe I paid full price for this lame film. Robert DeNiro, who would have thoughtNo one is fine! Everyone in this movie will put you to sleep. The story is long, drawn out, and a total bore. With a great cast who would have guessed. To be honest I couldn't tell you what the movie is about. All I can remember is I had to watch it twice because I kept falling asleep. The holidays aren't the same since Deniro's wife passed so he sets out on surprise visits to his children. He seemed to be an unexpected intruder to his own children. The movie could've been better if it were humorus instead of dramatic.

I would recommend this movie for any De Niro fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequels are almost always disappointing","review":"Having been so impressed with the original \\"Megatrends,\\" I was very much looking forward to this edition. Unfortunately,the authors' crystal ball failed too often this time around to inspire much confidence. One major flaw, I think, is that there is much less content analysis used in tracking these trends and far too much fluff in the way of interviews and anecdotes. Too, in \\"Megatrends,\\" statistics were used to back up forecasts derived from content analysis. Here statistics and surveys seem to be the sole basis for the forecasts. Perhaps the authors' thought the original work was too dry, or perhaps they were just trying to capitalize on a winner with a quick and dirty follow-up. In any case, this book was not nearly as insightful, or useful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled!","review":"Sounds up to date, and I bought it thinking it new, but tired forecasts from 1990 can easily be beaten by anyone of average thinking from the vantagepoint of 2000.

They barely mentioned the way technology started to shape the new century, and they were so focused on Europe being at peace for almost 50 years that totally forgot there were other countries with enough forces to create worldwire conflict (terrorism, oil interests, territorial struggle, ethnical issues, etc).My most honest advice is: don't bother, and don't waste your time, unless you simply want to see how much they failed at what they intended to do.

It only lasts about 58 minutes. Most clock in 1:40 to 2 hours. They only spend about 10 minutes on Big Show's WCW run, skipping over a lot of his feuds. They spend too much time talking about Knucklehead. They also skip over a lot of Big Show's feuds in the WWE focusing way too much time on the Show/mayweather feud. Some of the matches on the dvd are good. They serve, mainly, as a nostalgic glimpse into the past. The later matches aren't as good.

He is masterful with the guitar and his spirit comes out in the music. The result is an album that is relaxing, soothing, yet energizing...creates pictures in my mind of happy places, happy thoughts...so hard to explain. I just don't think I could ever get tired of this one. \\"Sunshine\\" has the happiest sound; \\"Goodnight\\" is a beautiful melody to end the day. My Mom was in the hospital and I brought the album to her to listen to and she absolutely LOVED it--it made her feel better and be able to imagine she was somewhere else. I can't recommend it enough. Truly, this will not disappoint. Listen at the end of a stressful day- light a candle, relax, and just breathe."},{"rating":"2","title":"The feel of Aloha...","review":"This aptly tightled and carefully crafted album welcomes you in, and welcomes you back for every listening with true Aloha. I'm lucky enough to number some of Hawaii's legendary guitarists as good friends - but this album is unique.It rightly prioritizes guitar pyrotechnics (yes, even slack key has its technicians) for lush and lovely melodies that blend Hawaii and the West, in a deeply emotional but spare technique that accentuates rather than dulls the gorgeous simplicity.A landmark album that may mark a vibrant new era in an increasingly cluttered slack key pantheon. (Are the traditionalists listening?) It stands the deepest scrutiny but, more importantly, gives a sense of enchantment and freshness that is so often missing in today's musical offerings.Hats off to Darin for a spectacular debut.Tim Dick / Lanikai"},{"rating":"2","title":"We liked this book a lot","review":"This book is a solid book on how to work the bars.

Not having any reading material, I am going out on a limb and say it was innovative for its time. Maria Falconetti plays Joan with intensity, conveying courage, fear, and fragileness with expertise througout. The Inquisition are presented as smug and patronizing, making the drama even more realistic. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer skillfully interweves shots that broaden the film, and his attention to details is ground breaking. The close ups and editing are of the caliber that today we take for granted. The pace of the frames flows along like real life, unlike, say Charlie Chaplin's silent films do. Presenting a trial and the burning at the stake that never seem fake, 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' is a real triumph. Even as a silent film, the facial expressions say more than words. The film, which like Joan herself, was thought to be lost in a fire, has been resurrected for the benefit of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trainer, Easy Setup and storage.","review":"Throw the directions out... it will take you about 5 minutes to setup this trainer and get your bike attached.

I could not find one positive thing to react to in either of her parents....both struck me as self-obsessed depressives. Luke and Angie seemed to have some spunk at least but even his girlfriend, Wendy, seemed flat to me. Reading about Jordana and the baby bunny rabbit at the end did me in.

Angie floats around, mostly in a paranoid state, in and out of hospitals, group homes and her own home. Luke leaves college, leaves his girlfriend, drifts around for a while, then gets back with his girlfriend and goes back home (doing what, I'm not sure - the book wasn't clear on that). Pieter keeps playing his cello and wallowing in self pity. And Jordana never fully copes or even comes to term with Angie's illness. She is also drifting.This may be reality, but it is an extremely depressing reality. I have read \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" and loved it.

It succeeds on many levels, but the most important point it makes (which those who dislike the book seem to dislike the most) is that the results of your actions are actually more important than your intent. The Do-Gooders of her book are those, primarily liberals, who want to do good things for many of the right reasons. Their problem, which makes it all our problem, is that they are unable or unwilling to use objective measures to determine if the results match the intent.If you enjoy this type of book, I would direct you to my favorite socio-political author Thomas Sowell. His book The Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation As a Basis for Social Policy is another powerful indictment of those who do things because it makes them feel righteous - even though they leave disaster in their wake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad theories and even worse writing","review":"As usual, Charen is preaching to the converted here. This is not thoughtful political science but merely repitition of common right wing dogma to a willing right wing audience guaranteed to buy this book. It is definitely not something for the middle ground independent thinker. Case in point:Charen hates the 1960's-especially the various civil rights crusades and especiallly feminism. Yet she refuses to recognize that the credit goes to liberals and feminists that Charen is in the position she personally enjoys.Feminists insisted that women be permitted to participate in society and realize their full potential as equals to men. There were not any significant female political columnists and well known female political writers such as Charen before the feminist movement. I was there and I am old enough to remember. Also I found at least four grammatical errors in this book. It got increasingly sloppy when you got near the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly And Too Simplistic","review":"The author is not in danger of doing-good with this book. This book is hard-to-read even if you are a \\"red-stater.\\" This book does not look for a moderate middle-road.

Or that Democrats have some kind of organized Master Plan to keep blacks voting for them by making them THINK they are discriminated against.She even blames liberals for homelessness, which is just too absurd to even comment on.

I have two reservations, though, although one may be silly: 1) The microfiber pads shrink considerably with the first use and don't seem to cover the whole mop head anymore. Perhaps I washed them incorrectly, but there were no laundry instructions included. 2) The mop is very light and the swivel head makes it easy to get at tight spots, but I'm concerned the mop handle might not be very durable because it's so thin and light.

One of my many frustrations with American Idol (or with my young students) is that all too often they believe all one must do is open their mouth and sing some words. NO! It's about expression and delivery. Check out Camille's CD if you want to learn about expression and delivery. That's what story telling/singing/performing is all about. Music should move you. The last song on the CD \\"The Last Day\\" is so beautiful that I wish it would have been released as a single by her. It is worth buying the CD just for that song.

This creates a sense of purpose and even peace out of the ur-chaos.The overall effect is very restrained and controlled, even though the source material appears to be randomly drawn noises from the world around us.

As the bindings must be placed between the racks, this means that the width of the skis in front of the front binding and behind the rear binding must be less than that size. In my experience, that eliminates of modern alpine or tele skis.XC skis would work fine, as would (1) snowboard.Other than this major concern, the magnets seem to hold securely & rack is of good construction.

I purchased it for just over $10.00 (USD) new and well worth it for that cost but it is a bit short though content is great of the early Pink Floyd era. Also, I found the interviews with Mick Jagger, Michael Cain, Julie Christie, and David Hockney interesting to varying degrees along with the cool cameo of John Lennon and the Yoko Ono Happening scenes.In all, it is well worth it if you genuinely dig the early Pink Floyd with Syd Barrett before his mental breakdown (two extended music jams). As a veteran musician myself, I also learned a few things watching this too."},{"rating":"2","title":"good piece of collection","review":"This video reflects the early years of Pink Floyd. In that time a bunch of innovative guys, mainly Syd probably because his use of sychedelic stuff, trying to bring something new in terms of music.

This is almost bootleg level in terms of editing quality and intention as a piece of art but that besmirches the good name of the better quality bootlegs I've enjoyed in my life. This so totally sucks and was probably only vaguely authorized by the band. It certainly seems designed to slip into the \\"gimme everything\\" filterless, fanboy bloodstream. Which is a shame.

As a pagan I found this to be of no use to me and I felt like I was ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is Proof(Rock-n-Roll will never die)","review":"I graduated high school in 1989. When I heard this album I thought I was back cruising in my 79 Cutlass, jamming with the boys. This album is a true throwback in time. It would have been a number one back then and should now. If it doesn't get the credit it deserves it shows how screwed up the so called critics are. This is absolutely a totally kick-a** album from the hard rocking licks to the beautiful ballads. In all my days of rocking this has to rank with the best albums I have ever heard bar none. It is excellent real rock-n-roll from the heart. 10 stars on a five star scale. If you like good ol kick ass rock and heart felt ballads you won't be disappointed. Trust me, buy it now. It is positively the best album out in the last 10-15years that I've been a serious music fan. Keep up the great work Great White. ROCK ON !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for good rock???","review":"So here I was, wanting to buy a good rock cd. Just looking for anything. Then I got to the letter \\"G\\", and then I noticed GREAT WHITE. Sure I had some of their stuff and it was pretty good. Never been a big big fan of GW but I respected them as a good straight foward rock n roll band. I picked up a copy of \\"Can't get there from here\\", just as a shot in the dark. I hit the damn target here. This album has truly opened my eyes. From \\"Rollin' Stoned\\" to \\"Hey Mister\\", this album rocks. Highlights, to me, are \\"In the Tradition\\" (beautiful song) and \\"Wooden Jesus\\" GREAT WHITE will always hold a spot in my cd player. Keep Rockin'!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"as usual the great white crew puts out another good one. Any true fan will love it and play it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great White, Great Album","review":"Every single song on this disc could be a radio hit. Ever since I got this album I can't stop listening to it, and when I'm not listening to it, I hear the songs in my head. It is the best album of 1999."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss This One!!!","review":"I have been a Great White fan since their self titled first album...in fact, I went to see Judas Priest back in '84 only because Great White was the opening act.I still love listening to the old stuff, but this one is by far my favorite. It is definitely more mature and mellow by comparison...but I keep listening to this one over and over! \\"Rolling Stoned\\" is good, classic rock'n'roll, and the ballads are fabulous!The boys get some help from a couple of my other favorite rockers...Jack Blades (Night Ranger, Damn Yankees, Shaw/Blades) helped to write quite a few songs. You can really hear his influence on \\"In the Tradition\\"...which has to be the best song on the album. Don Dokken (Dokken) helped out on \\"Wooden Jesus\\".So, whether you are a \\"old\\" die-hard fan, or a new one, don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Great White's Best!!!!!!!!","review":"Rarely has an 80's metal band been able to put out a CD that has come close to or matched their albums of the 80's. This is one of those rare CD's. It is an absolute must have for anyone who likes Great White or anyone who enjoys a bluesy type of rock 'n roll/heavy metal. What makes this album so much better than most matal releases of the late 90's and even alot of those actually released during the 80's, is that there are no throw aways and it stirs up emotion and passion. Every song from beginning to end is top quality. A few of my favorites on the hard rocking bluesy side are Wooden Jesus and Rollin Stoned and for the slower rock ballads In the Tradiiton and Silent Night are very solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the Tradition of Rock N'Roll","review":"If you loved the Once Bitten and Twice Shy albums, you will love this one. If you really digged Psycho City, you will also dig this. And if Let It Rock was your favorite, then this album will take its place. What I'm trying to say is that Can't Get There features songs that could have easily been off of their other releases: \\"Rollin' Stoned' would have been perfect on Once Bitten, \\"In the Tradition\\" could have been easily on Sail Away, \\"Loveless Age\\" would perfecly fit on Psycho City... you get the point. This album has it all. True, Great White's sound hasn't changed all that much over the years, but here it is at it's very best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for Robbing Me of my Money","review":"I would just like to thank the Sinclair Institute for robbing me and the other 4 million people who bought their videos of our money.I cannot believe that someone would produce something that is this terrible.Let me save you some money. This video reveals no \\"SECRETS\\" to sex and no \\"AMAZING\\" positions. The Doctors that give the advice provide a lot of Medical Mumbo Jumbo.Let me save you some money. The video has bad actors filmed in a terrible setting. It looks like a bad 70s adult flick. Yes a 70s film. Nothing from this millennium that's for sure.As for an overall synopsis: Pay attention to your lover and try to satisfy them. Try different places and positions for sex. And oh yes, men and women love oral sex. Come on Sinclair, everyone knows that.Thanks but no thanks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled. Save your money.","review":"I purchased the Better Sex Videos with my boyfriend because we were looking for something new for our relationship. Well I purchased this DVD with their Sexual Positions For Lovers - Beyond the Missionary Position.What a mistake. When the DVD arrived I noticed that the couples are not attractive (turn off for both of us), the quality was terrible, and the information provided was basic information that everyone knows. As for the positions, they are general positions that anyone knows.This company claims that they have sold 4 million videos. I wonder how many returns they have gotten out of those 4 million.I would give this and the Sexual Positions For Lovers - Beyond the Missionary Position zero stars if I could. Don't be fooled. Save your money.If you are looking for a great sex position DVD, try: Sex Essentials Videos: Seductive Sex Positions. Also another great DVD (for the females out there) is Female Masturbation : Every Woman's Orgasm is Unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Sex Video","review":"I found this video very informative even for a man of my mature years. I cannot say I learnt much, but still found it very informative and not the least obtrusive. The video was easy to view and is a video you would have no fear in showing someone close to you, as it explained the facts of the information it was reviewing. I would have no hesitation in informing others that it is a video well worth obtaining, especially for younger married couples."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad video, poor sound","review":"I can't hear the great Sills, I'll recommend her roberto in cd instead. Wolftrap has bed accoustics. I was there, and Sills was great. But the recording is badly miked. She sounds thin and can hardly be heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMENAL","review":"I cannot understand, for the life of me, why US Pop Radio is not all over this song. It is by far, the best club song of the summer, and I get chills just humming it to myself. \\"I Will Go With You\\" is simply Donna Summer at her very best; and it's great to see the song rise to No.1 on next weeks Billboard Club Play Chart. Now if only mainstream radio will take notice - this could take her to the level Cher has experienced this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donna Has No Limits","review":"Here's a vivid and clear example of Donna's capability of creating a dance record out of even a \\"Classical\\" like this one. Not only does she makes you dance & dance & dance with this single, it also proves once more that Donna has the vocals to do a song like this.Once a \\"Disco Queen\\" now the \\"The Queen Of All Stars!!\\"Great come back Donna..I Love You!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Master-pieces?","review":"I've purchased many concert music DVD's (and other things) from Amazon and am very happy with prices and fast delivery. I've never taken the opportunity to review an item, until I watched this one.This DVD package contains two, dreadful one-hour documentaries which were horribly pieced-together from various other documentaries. In that regard, the title \\"Masterpieces (Collectors Special Edition)\\" makes sense, but there's nothing here close to an Eric Clapton masterpiece. Even if you paid nothing (instead of the high $25 price) and got free shipping, it would still have cost you two hours of your time.If Eric's guitar playing and singing is what interests you, get his One More Car, One More Rider and Live in Hyde Park dvd's. (You can probably buy both here for the same price as this useless item.) Then, you'll be hearing, seeing, enjoying, real Eric Clapton masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"xxxholic","review":"This is pure clamp!!! Ties in with Tsubasa its clamp counterpart. Be amazed and even chilled by this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Get Enough of XXXHolic!","review":"I first found out about XXXHolic when I was offered it by the Amazon Vine program. I received the first DVD collection. I also have many students in my class from China, Korea and Japan so I was already getting more exposure to Manga than I have ever had before. So since I enjoyed the DVD, I started buying the Manga books, I had also found Suki Volume 1 in a used book bin and enjoyed that series too. Now I am a XXXHolic nut who has read all 12 volumes out right now and of course, I need the DVDs too! This collection was quite good and I enjoyed every minute of it. It gets better when you have read the Manga too. I highly recommend this series. It's wonderful and turned me onto Clamp and Manga."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a complete waste of time and money","review":"I have no idea how it did in the theater, and further, I don't much care.Even with the acting potential of Terry Farrell (Star Trek, Deep Space Nine) and Parker Stevenson (Hardy Boys, Baywatch), this just plods along. A group of military criminals are given one last chance--go on a mission to occupy a space-outpost, held by enemy forces. Unfortunately, something is loose, and killing everyone nearby.The acting was wooden, everyone seems capable of two emotions--fear and anger. There are no light points, no comedic moments, no gentleness in the movie. There are no low moments that are necessary to the increase in tension. As a result, the tension never really gets going, and the entire movie falls flat.It's not really even worth one star, but Amazon.com has that as a minimum. I'm glad I rented it. I'd probably try to return it if I'd actually bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legion: A Lesion on the movie industry!","review":"Terry Farrell, Rick Springfield, Parker Stevenson, Corey Feldman are the \\"headline\\" actors in this flat and slow moving Sci-Fi Channel exclusive. None of them are directed to their potential in this excuse of an \\"Aliens\\" wannabe. Poor storyline also contributes. Only buy this if you are a deranged fan of one of the actors and you want to throw away a hundred bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got my $3 book EyeRobics","review":"I never got the book EyeRobics.How can I get it ? Please send. Or find where it was lostThanksSteve"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"It is unfortunate that people with refractive errors will buy this book, which was written by an accountant, not any sort of health care practitioner. As an eye doctor, I see many types of ocular problems, and, yes, some of these can benefit from exercises. Roy's book misreads Bates's work, is ignorant of ocular anatomy and promises results that just cannot be delivered. Again, ther are some eye conditions that benefit from exercises, but many (most?) do not. See an accredited optometrist or ophthalmologist for help. Behavioral optometrists are especially aware of eye exercises regimens for improving vision. Most people are only to willing to part with their money for miracle cures, be they surgeries or exercises. Please take responsibility for your own health - find out the facts yourself. The author of the above book published and toured to support her book for one reason - cash. Don't let it be yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give no stars?","review":"Written by an accountant. Erroneous anatomical concepts and a misunderstanding of the visual system. Not only misreads modern medical explanations, also doesn't understand Bates' explanation. When in doubt, invent. It's bad enough that people will but this book hoping for improvement in their vision. What's worse is that this charlatan will profit from their misfortune. Some people can derive benefit from eye exercises, or vision therapy, and have great results. That's no reason to generalize and write a book that jettisons physics and biology. Save your money and see an optometrist that you trust. Final note: I offered to examine this author after hearing her \\"lecture\\", but before reading her book. She agreed, but alas, did not show up. After reading her book, I know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Starting book, with few warts","review":"I wanted a beginning book on Access, which still went into Power User mode at some point. This book fills the bill. The author uses three complete applications -- a college advisor's database, a music booking agent's application, and a (simple) wedding guest database. Through these three applications, with very nice lookup tables, connected queries, and involved reports, the author shows how to do it. First with the Wizards, then directly in Access. I found this book an excellent introduction to Access, showing where all the features are hiding and how best to use them. The only warts are that the directions are not always clear what screen you should be on, or how you got there. It can be figured out, but does take a bit of time investement. The time invested is well rewarded, however, in terms of your comfort with what you can do with Access."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Walk To Freedom","review":"Ladysmith is a wonderful group.

The charecters were just not that compelling and while the storyline was original in that it did not recycle the same naive miss for the zillionth time it lacked a certain spark. It's a bad bookjust not engrossing. Still it's a decent read with likeable if somewhat shallow charecters and a fresh story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Though the author could have given the characters a little more depth and dimension this was an overall good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and Daring","review":"This wonderful book, about a relationhsip with one of the most mysterious and charismatic rock stars, is blatant in its honesty. Often, through her perfectly timed and wickedly dry sense of humor, Ms. Huddleston simultantouesly shows us her naivete in direct conflict with her alter ego which knows better than to think for a moment that Jim Morrison will actually rise to her girlhood-like expectations.
