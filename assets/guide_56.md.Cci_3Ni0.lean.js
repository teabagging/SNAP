The screen play is rank; any first year drama student could do better. Rather than use the English language to convey emotion, mood, and (even a hint of) intelligence or wit, the writer simply loaded the dialog with the foulest of four letter expletives. The only funny part of the DVD is contained in the interview with the director in which he describes one of the actresses as the typical \\"girl next door.\\" He must live next to a bordello! Not one of the actors in this film did a creditable job (it's hard to put your heart into vulgar inanity) Special effects are fair; audio and video are very good, but I give this one a \\"BLACK HOLE.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"ST-3000 CHROMATIC TURNE","review":"I PLAY A GUITAR FOR MY OWN PLEASURE AND ALWAYS HAD TROUBLE TUNNING MY GUITAR.

This \\"jazz drummer's drummer\\"(in my estimation),also shines radiantly in his \\"Short'nin Bread\\" solo,on melodically-tuned tom-toms.Eugene Wright's delightful bass solo in \\"Old Man River\\",leaves no room for criticism either,confirming that he & Morello were two, sometimes overlooked, pillars supporting this innovative,trail-blazing quartet.Much (deserved)praise has been showered upon Brubeck & Desmond of course,& one listen to \\"Georgia on my Mind\\",with Paul's luscious,almost haunting sax solo & Dave's beautiful piano interpretation will suffice to instruct anyone unfamiliar with them,as to why their music remains so popular to this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"good music, bad sound","review":"I recently bought this album.

Why did it bomb? Because it's awful, that's why. It limped to #122 on the charts and with good reason.Again, I truly love this band, but this is worse than sitting through 3 consecutive viewings of \\"Ishtar\\" baked with fire ants on my body.Nice job by American Beat though, restoring the proper credits and artwork.

The selection of poems is at once characteristic of Sexton's work without becoming overly monotonous in tone or subject, but it is really the sound of the author's own voice that makes the poetry come alive. Sexton's dark voice adds an element of authenticity to these poems that is perhaps lost when they are read silently. Her convincing reading is truly a testament to her own tortured yet beautifully rendered artistic vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sound of Immortality","review":"Having to read the seminal poetry of Sexton--in my view a giant in the world of poetry (regarding just her talent for words alone, never mind her being a woman, etc., etc.)--and having to have fallen so deeply and intimately in love with the work--without ever having the opportunity to HEAR and LISTEN to her recite these masterpieces; well, that would be somewhat akin to having been given the gallies of all of Bob Dylan's lyrics, and never getting the chance to hear him sing[ing] them.Listening to her reading these words which I had known and admired for so long, and never knowing what her voice was like; finally hearing her speak the lines was like being in the room with a ghost who could make you hear her voice.

This is one group that should have been a big time act but never made it. After the success of Play Deep they never got much airplay.

John Spinx's guitar-playing is amazing! (gotta be among the world's most unheralded six-stringers) You can just sense his feel and passion- listen to the solos in \\"Bangin' On My Heart\\" and \\"Long Way Home\\" and see what I mean. And Tony Lewis's voice is as recognizable and powerful as ever. The drum playing is solid as well. This album covers it all- from hard, driving rock such as \\"Main Attraction\\" to beautiful ballads like \\"No Surrender\\" and \\"Alone With You.\\" The Outfield were and are often characterized as an eighties band, but whatever you may think, these guys plain know how to write and perform music.

I have just read from their official website that the reason for \\"early release\\" of \\"Bangin'\\" was that they had too many songs during the recording of \\"Play Deep\\"! My favourite songs on this CD are, \\"No Surrender\\" (hence the title of my review), \\"Long Way Home\\" and of course the famous classic single from this album, \\"Since You've Been Gone\\".

The author derives a method for determining the speed potential of almost any sailboat and shows that his method produces the same results as classical methods and furthermore, his predicted speeds are in agreement with observations taken on at least two actual sail boats. For the average recreational or racing sailor there is very little of value in this book primarily because the author assumes a great deal of mathematical sophistication on the part of the reader, and fails to show what insights (if any) accrue from his methodology.

Although Rickson's insights are somewhat interesting, his \\"philosophical thoughts\\" get kind of old after a while. I found the other fighters stories (Todd Hayes & Koichiro Kimura) more compelling. Nonetheless, the documentary is very interesting and enjoyable.

I've had it for several months and I really don't pay that much attention to it, but in the shower today I realized that there were mistakes on it!! There is one spelling error and an actual GRAMMATICAL error!! On any other product I would just ignore it, but you would think that on a product that promotes itself through grammar, it would actually be correct. I was pretty mad, considering the product is supposed to teach one the correct rules of grammar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna Fever","review":"Madonna was cute and sexy in the '80s and I loved her music from that time. I love this movie. It's pretty light and basic. It's about an upper middle class housewife (Arquette) who's bored with her life and nerdy husband, so she peeps in on the personals and gets entangled in a diamond robbery and love affair, when she loses her memory and is mistaken for this mysterious Susan who is desperately sought after by more than one man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I have no background on massage or reflexology, so I bought this book thinking I can do home study without going to technical school. Just to learned proper techniques and thumb placement for basic to moderate massaging or reflexology. No! This book has a very nice colorful pictures but the way it explain movements or techniques are a little confusing to me...maybe if you have a little knowledge about the subject, you can follow and understand what the author is trying to show or explain. I don't think this book is for beginner. My only suggestion is to actually follow the techniques by watching it on YouTube.

My son loves bath time, and any time I can make it fun and a learning time, it's a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looks BUT critical flaw","review":"I was really excited about this coffee maker in large part because of its design with the removable water tank. All around the coffee maker looks sharp.However, I was disappointed rather quickly as the machine makes very weak coffee. I read through some other reviews on this site and others and apparently it's not a unique problem with my machine. Even after using the \\"Flavor+\\" button, I had weak coffee despite using two heaping tablespoons per six ounces of water. For some of you, maybe using the \\"Flavor+\\" button with large amounts of ground will be fine, but that's your risk to take. Without using the \\"Flavor+\\" button you might as well be drinking water!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny looking but good cup of coffee","review":"I bought this coffee maker based on it's good reviews. The positives: I really like the fact that you can remove the entire water reservoir and clean it. I automatically use the Flavor+ button every time I brew as it makes the brew a little stronger, which is a nice option to have. The pot has a no drip spout - that is a really great thing! I also love the blue light.I only have minor negatives: I, unlike many people who reviewed, think the machine is somewhat ugly. The big \\"dial\\" on the front reminds me of an old phone. The design looks somewhat whimsical compared to higher priced machines but it's nothing terribly important to me and its great features outweigh this.Finally, for the price, you can't beat it. I've enjoyed it for 1 month now and hope to have it a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after 6 months","review":"After 6 months the loud clicking noise finally stopped and so did the coffee.

We were hoping for a good, simple coffeemaker, and this one seemed to come close. We could have lived with the last two problems, if only it heated the water hot enough and used cone filters. It's being returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coffee Maker Ever!","review":"I am sixty two years old so I have owed quite a few coffee makers in my lifetime. Without a doubt, the Michael Graves coffee maker is the best one I have ever purchased. I use 4-5 scoops of Gevalia brand coffee and it brews a fantastic cup of coffee every time. While it is true that the carafe has to be hand washed, it is a small price to pay for a machine that very easy to keep clean. I love the detachable water reservoir and I am able to use a metal filter basket instead of those paper ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money on this one","review":"This item looks very nice; however, it is a mess to clean-up the filter basket after the coffee has been made. Even though you're supposed to be able to leave the caraffe's lid closed and placed directly under the basket's valve, water continues to drip. During the percolation phase, water does not flow evenly, but sprays over the lid of the caraffe. I had to keep the lid open. Appearance isn't everything and you're better off looking elsewhere for an easy-clean coffee maker. Consumer Reports gives this item a high rating which is the reason why I bought it in the first place! I guess that Consumer Reports is better used for \\"big ticket\\" items and not for small appliances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible Mold Hazzard","review":"I bought the highly rated and lovely Michael Graves coffeemaker. As soon as I started using it I became aware of a serious design oversight. The flip up lid above the coffee basket has a lower surface with a number of holes in it to distribute the water evenly to the coffee in the basket. When you have finished brewing, you can remove the coffee pot and wash and dry it. you can remove the basket and with great difficulty can dry it although the deeply ribbed interior holds water that won't evaporate and it takes a lot of effort to get the water out. But there is no way to get the water out of the sealed compartment above the filter basket and that is the oversight. Water can stand on plastic at normal humidity for days and days. Further, you can not see what is going on inside and if mold forms, you will only know it from your resulting illness. Unless you live in Arizona, I would advise you to be wary of this appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Great... till it BROKE","review":"After about 9 months of daily use, this coffee maker no longer functions properly, and spews steam like a witch's cauldron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carafe is extremely delicate!","review":"I like everything about this coffeemaker except the carafe. I think it makes very good coffee. The coffee never tastes \\"burned\\" even if left on the hot plate up to the automatic turn off time (after 2 hours).The carafe is extremely delicate though! The instruction book contains an entire page entitled \\"Carafe Safety Precautions\\" about being careful not to break this carafe. I had been very carefully cleaning the carafe by lightly swishing soap and water in it after each use . Although I never put it in the dishwasher, I did put my hand inside gently to wipe and it broke the glass. The instructions DO say not to put your hand in it, but I was really being careful! If you do purchase this coffeemaker be very careful with the carafe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent coffee maker - unique design","review":"Pros:I've had this coffee maker for about 3 years now. It' does a good job of brewing coffee. The strong button does work to let the water remain in the grounds longer to make a stronger cup of coffee.Unique design!fairly easy to clean.I like the innovative feature where the entire water tank can be removed & filled rather than having to worry about rinsing and filling the coffee carafe.Cons:No automatic shut off. I prefer this safety feature on my small appliancesTemperature not quite hot enough for me. I generally put my brewed cup in a microwave for 30 to 40 seconds to get it to the hot temperature I like. (May be hot enough for your taste) Krups coffee makers do a better job with coffee temperature, but are generally more expensive.Notes: Make sure that the filter basket is firmly seated into the coffee maker or you will get leaks and such. Don't over fill - don't go above the 12 cup mark on the water resevoir"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but beware that finicky filter basket!","review":"This looks elegant on my kitchen counter, and I really like the readable clock display. However, I would not recommend it because the filter basket must be seated EXACTLY RIGHT -- or you wind up with a nasty-overflowing-wet-coffee-grounds-disaster. In my experience with every other coffee maker, you just drop in the filter basket and proceed. With this model, the basket MUST be inserted to line up with a little notch, so that it drops into position. If you just drop it in, the drip process backs up and overflows the filter. Big mess! This is a design flaw you wouldn't find on a $15 model from the drug store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Automatic Drip Maker","review":"I purchased this make/model per a Consumer Report Best Buy plus reading the various reviews of the coffee maker on Amazon and elsewhere. For the last 7 years I have use a Farberwear Perk pot. That makes superior coffee as all perks do (in my opinion), but I was frustrated after my Farberwear died in less than two years. The one before lasted four. So, I thought I'd give a drip a try. This machine is streamline, easy to use, nicely designed for easy cleaning. My favorite feature is the removable water resevoir. It pulls off and you can add your filtered water. The coffee tastes good for drip. Again, it just can't compare to perk. I am happy with it and the price was right. I hope that it lasts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee maker.","review":"I have had this coffee maker for a few years now. I bought it at Target because Consumer Reports recommended it. I will admit that sometimes it still drips onto the hotplate, which frustrates me. but, it does make flavorful coffee and I love to set it so that I can wake up to fresh coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Design, Easiest to keep clean, Easy fill","review":"I'd buy it again. I had none of the issues described in some of the negative reviews with dripping. We are coffee hounds and have been through dozens of coffee makers and this is the absolute best by far. You can spend more (we tried) but you will not beat this design."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought it and returned it","review":"This coffee maker might look nice, but it makes a lousy cup of coffee. The regular cycle runs so fast that you get weak flavored brown liquid, and the flavor cycle produces a bitter cup of joe. I am going back to my DeLonghi 12 cup, which, although not rated that high on this site, gave me a delicious cup of coffee every morning. I really do not recommend this machine and I very much doubt that Michael Graves (whoever he is) makes his morning coffee using this inferior machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Finally, a coffeemaker that works and is easy to operate. It's clean too, no nooks and crannies to gunk up with coffee residue. The blue light is nice at night, it alluminates the kitchen just enough, so that i won't run into anything. But most of all the coffee is brewed to perfection everytime. I have used it at least 20 times and it's a breeze to clean. I love this machine. thank you.Denise"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Coffeemaker","review":"After having a Mr. Coffee under-the-counter coffeemaker for a million years, it just stopped working one day. Read reviews of this one and decided to go with it. It is truly a wonderful coffeemaker. No dripping, very easy to use, easy to clean and makes terrific coffee also! The features are great (automatic stop to pour, automatic start by setting the timer and flavor button). I highly recommend this coffeemaker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The BIG BLUE EYE","review":"I really, really do not like this coffeemaker. We have it put away for our next yard sale. With all the digital clock devices spewing unwanted light at night around the house, the BIG BLUE EYE was just too much. The other thing I did not like was the small, plastic-rimmed opening of the carafe; I cut my wrists several times when trying the wash the interior. Coffeemaking and cleanup should not be this hard for the price offered. I gave it one star just because it did make a liquid that resembled coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible carafe","review":"I purchased this coffee maker 6 months ago. so far I have had to replace the carafe twice. I have had drip coffee makers for years and understand the necessity of waiting for the pot to cool before you clean it.no matter how gentle I am the bottom just seems to develop these little cracks.BTW, yes, the coffee is very good, but the replacement cost for the carafe is high so I will no longer use this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless, have to replace","review":"We purchased this coffeemaker on the recommendation of a well-known consumer advocacy publication. We purchased it just over a year ago, just long enough for the warranty to expire. It takes two hours to make eight cups of coffee. If you try to make a full pot, the two-hour safety shutoff will kick in, and you will be left with water still in the tank. I like the blue display, the simplicity of setting the timer, but the quality is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe not dishwasher safe","review":"The reason we chose this model is because of the removable water reservoir.That is convenient. I'd like to point out to consumers before they buy this coffeemaker that on page 9 of the manual in bold letters it says \\"Do not place carafe in dishwasher\\". If it had indicated on the box that the carafe was not dishwasher safe, I would never have purchased it. Also note, on page 6 of the manual under 'Important Notes' the top one is: Automatic Brew must be programmed each time it is used. Annoying! The blue light is super bright - I'd like to know how much energy it uses. It does call for one scoop of coffee for each cup, that's 12 scoops for a full pot? We will be returning this tomorrow. After using it once. Too many cons for this consumer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible coffee maker","review":"This is the best coffee maker I have ever owned, and one of the least expensive. The carafe does not drip when you pour coffee and the water container on the back is great, no more spills when pouring water into the reservoir. As others have said it does drip some when you open the lid, but it's easy enough just not to open the lid without the carafe in place. I definitely give it an A+."},{"rating":"2","title":"No spills - great design - but not hot enough","review":"The design of this coffee pot is great.The easiest coffeemaker to fill without spilling water all over the counter.Never spills/drips when pouring, the carafe is well designed.However, it does not make coffee as hot as we like it. Could also be improved by being able to keep the coffeemaker on for more than 2 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Coffeemaker","review":"This is the second Michael Graves coffeemaker we have purchased. My husband wanted to bring one in to the office. So I bought this one for the home. The carafe for this is very nice. Unlike other coffeemakers you can pour quickly without dripping all over the place. It has a reservoir that you can remove to clean easily. The brightly lit clock is easily seen even with over 40 eyes. It also doubles as a night light in the kitchen. It brews well and quickly. I did have to replace the carafe on the old one because the handle broke. This was after 2 years of daily use. I recommend supporting it with one hand in the front and one on the handle when pouring full pots, this lessens the pressure on the handle. I would also recommend that you do not use the reservoir to fill the coffeemaker with water. This may lead to some leaks. If functions better if you fill the coffeepot and then fill the reservoir.This is a well designed coffeepot and well worth the price. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRETTY, YES, BUT.......","review":"Wow...disappointing!! This is really pretty music. And yes, the lyrics are simple in the best sense, and touching.

I had to have a native speaker assist me in figuring out where the tape was reading from, and make marks in the book. I also felt this went to fast, and didn't cover basics such as syntax.

It infuriates me that a publisher can get away with distributing a tape that does such a terrible job following the book. If a publisher distributed a book with several chapters missing, people wouldn't stand for it. But the book/tape interface here is the equivalent - whole sections of aural instruction referred to in the book are missing from the tape. It's also worth noting fully half of the first side of 1 of 2 tapes is taken up with the basic introductions - the vocal equivalent of a title page."},{"rating":"1","title":"A word of warning...","review":"Make sure you get the book WITH the audio cassette. There is basically NO description of prononciation in this book.

In the bedroom?\\" etc. In each room, the child lifts a flap to see a cute monster - one's in the shower with bubbles all over his head, one's fixing the sink in the kitchen, a baby monster is in the nursery riding a rocking horse.

Has a wide range of selection (from dips to wraps to skewers) and is beautiful to look at. I tried the \`Sun-Dried Tomato and Cannellini Bean Dip'(pg. 34) and the \`Spicy Satay Sticks'(pg. 76) and they both were excellent. In addition, there is a section in the back of the book that describes all the cooking \`techniques' used in the recipe section - extremely helpful because it can help the aspiring chef.To let you know, I'm a music producer and basically invite people over to my studio/loft in Soho all the time for business.

The movie played right off the DVD recorder hard disk is perfectly clear, so that is not the problem. The problem seemed to be independent of film/program length or recording speed.

I've looked at Office Depot, Staples, Best Buy, Radio Shack, Walmart, Target and many other stores. I have compared the prices. Some sites sell the DVD's for a little less money but get you on the shipping, handling and state taxes. Others are a little bit more expensive but the shipment is free. I've found that the cheapest way is to buy Memorex 100-Pack Spindle from the site above. I am happy with my purchase and I do recommend it to other people.

The customizable aspect is nice for keeping variety without having to own a ton of DVDs. If you are a beginner or casual pilates patron - this DVD is not for you. Even though they claim to have a person doing \\"beginner\\" level version of all of the exercises, the type of exercises that the instructor does are inherantly advanced. So even though there are modifications shown, they are way above the skill level of the casual pilates user. The progression is fast and intense, and the camera angles do not make it easy to follow the person doing the modified moves. If you are advanced and have very good strength, balance and endurance, then the speed and intensity of these workouts should be good for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful but...","review":"I love this DVD it has some new exercises that I had not seen before.

I was not allowed to switch the workout around. Third, I could only pick 3 of the 6 workouts in my \\"customized\\" session. Not happy at all with that as I would have liked to add more.

I have done a decent amount of yoga and pilates; however, I couldn't believe how difficult this was. The first workout was practically impossible for me, as it required SO much upper body strength. It put a ton of strain on my wrists. Kristin McGee is lifeless, and she never explained what parts of the body each exercise was suppossed to be targeting as most instructors do.Kristin tells you if you're a beginner to watch so-and-so for modifications, however, the way the DVD is edited makes this impossible as the \\"beginner\\" person isn't always in view.This DVD left me annoyed and discouraged.If you are looking for a total body, low-impact workout, I highly reccommend Carmen Electra's \\"Fit to Strip.\\" Unlike Kristin McGee, Carmen is very fun and down to earth. She makes you feel like you're working out with your best friend.I also reccommend Winsor Pilates, Tae Bo, and The Firm dvds instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too advanced for beginners","review":"I purchased this product because I was trying to get more out of my workouts and I wanted to try pilates. Though the instructor says to follow one of the other trainers if you're a beginner, they don't focus in enough on that person so it's hard to follow. This is for more advanced pilates users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for your back!","review":"I'm 49 and have been doing a variety of pilates videos for a few years without trouble and found this one to be too difficult. I hurt my back trying to do this one and will not attempt it again. Do not get this if you are a beginner bacause you need a lot of strength. You have to be super limber to do the moves.

If making a joyful noise is the minimal standard for Christian music, then Brewster is adequate. However, \\"Everbody Praise the Lord\\" is embarrassingly passionless. It's as if Brewster is praising God from somewhere in his head rather than in his heart. His affected vocals, \\"I thank the Lord for the smile that he's put on my face; I thank the Lord for his Grace\\" sounds more like a high school football cheer than an inspirational connection with Deity. \\"Spin\\" is a bouncy little number, but really gives me no feeling of love of God.

In addition to this you've got people like Vanessa Williams, David Sanborn, and Michael McDonald adding their talent to this great live album. I now sing in Rob Mathes' choir, which is an amazing experience, and I can tell you Rob is the best conductor I've ever had. Hopefully soon some more of Rob's albums will get full release, like his first non-christmas CD, \\"Evening Train,\\" which is also a great piece of work.

I don't expect anyone to know this and no-one does, so just stick to the facts Randy no need to embellish! This is the kinda subject that sells itself. On top of it this book was pretty long winded and boring, the truth is I never bothered to finish it, not out of disgust, but just out of boredom. I'm also skeptical of the accuracy because J Randy Taraborelli has written about a number of other celebrities including Frank Sinatra, Madonna, Liz Taylor, Grace Kelly and Diana Ross so maybe it's a hobby or a job for him to make celebrity semi fiction novels.

I know that michael has his faults but who does'nt? he chronicles everything from the victory tour to michael's marriage with lisa marie to the hyperbaric chamber. while reading this book there will be times when all can do is shake your head at the things that michael suggests, and there will be times when you truly feel sorry for him, and then there will be times when all you can do is laugh.

I began to understand MJ better regarding his handling the business, his love to the animals & children and much more....I was lucky to see Michael Jackson's \\"Dangerous World Tour\\" concert in Lausanne, Switzerland in September 1992. I always thought he was really a great entertainer. Beyond that, I really don't know much about his personal life. It's like a revelation to me by reading the biography up to 1990.I can't wait to read the author's new book, the whole story (1958~ 2009)about Michael Jackson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky, but if you want to feel uplifted, there's another book...","review":"Michael was probably going to die young because of his excessive use of weird behavior and drugs. There's another book, a new book, that just came out, that warns you how to know your limits and live within it-- told by a rock star. Michael could have used this book. It's called \\"What Would Keith Richards Do?\\" and it's both funny, informative, and philosophical. While this MJ read was good, and chilling, I think MJ would have done well to read some of Keith's quotes.... this MJ book only shows how desperate he was. It's a good read, but he could have/should have been helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"What you learn from Michael Jackson: The Magic and the Madnessis that everthing before 1989 was magic, everything that followed was pure madness.With all his money, Jackson was manipulated by his handlers who looked after themselves and not him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloids Suck!","review":"I'm going to use a quote from Michael Jackson and tell me if I am correct about this book. \\"Just because you read it in a magazine or see it on the television screen don't make it factual.\\" Now look this book is filled with lies don't read it, for a Michael Jackson fan it will only upset you. Frankly I haven't read it but I've only seen reviews that support this kind of nonsense! DON'T READ UNAUTHORIZED BOOKS GUYS! It means it doesn't come from Michael's mouth so why should you believe it? I love you Michael Jackson! You rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid Read","review":"DO NOT BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ, ESPECIALLY UNAUTHORIZED BIOS. I checked the 1st ed. out of the library. Sure, there are some truths that I've heard from interviews with Michael from his mouth, HOWEVER, they are interspersed with lots of fabrications. I think people recognize the truths, but then assume that the entire book is legitimate. That's how tabloids and tabloid writers make money and get these positive reviews. This entire book reads like tabloid trash. I actually get a yucky feeling in my stomach as I'm reading. And I've had to browse through sections because I just can't take the horrible writing. Sure, the author seems to support Michael, so to many readers, they are more likely to believe everything in it. I probably won't finish it. I checked it out of the library out of sheer curiosity since this author gets the best publicity for a unauthorized MJ biographer. Trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerpoint is disappointing","review":"I love the printed products from Rose. The content and design are exceptional.

I pulled the battery and it tested fine on my other meter. Put it back together and started twisting the knob around. Presto, suddenly started to work. OK, decided to do a simple continuity test. It takes almost a second for a tone. Rubbing the leads together produces a scratchy tone. Even my $20 DMM gives a solid tone when rubbing the leads together. The voltage reading worked fine but when I tried switching over to ma the meter went dead. Switched back to voltage, the meter comes back on. Switched back to ma then it worked for a minute then died again. That was it for this POS. Due to the poor quality and toy-ish look and feel, it didn't last 10 minutes on my bench before I was packaging it back up for return. I'll keep using my cheap $20 unit and save my money for a Fluke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective New Meter","review":"Upon turning on the unit for the first time, I was surprised to hear a loud, high-pitched oscillation emanating from the meter. Ignoring the oscillation, I proceeded to test the various functions of the meter. I tried to measure a number of resistors without success. I then attempted to measure voltages, again without success. The meter was obviously defective, so I decided to return the item to Amazon. I was most pleasantly surprised by the ease of returning the defective meter. I found the return process to be a quick, simple, straight-forward procedure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Meter but","review":"Ex430 works well and price was good.The only issue I had was the continuity tester sound. Even when the probes are touched directly the meters sound sputters vs a constant tone. It made me think this part of the meter was failing. I called Extech and they said that is a issue with the Ex430. Meaning the continuity tone sputters and would need to get a 500 model for that to be better.Anyone else notice this on the Ex430. Don't have another one to test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monosodium glutamate disaster","review":"Whenever I eat foods with MSG in them, I get mild to severe heart palpitations. I forgot to check the ingredients of Planters Dry Roasted Sunflower Kernels and I suffered the consequences. I am angry with myself (for not checking) and I am angry with Planters (A Kraft Foods division).MSG is only added as a flavor enhancer, it has no known health benefits. It is a chemoinducer of obesity, it affects neurons in a bad way, it decreases learning ability in children and lots more. In short, MSG is more a slow poison than it is a food.Planters has made, in effect, a healthy food into a very unhealthy product.Sorry Planters, I will never buy this product again unless you take out the MSG, the corn syrup solids, and other unnecessary ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"not just kernels","review":"I purchased these for a snack for work. I love slated sunflower kernels and with the label saying simply \\"dry roasted sunflower kernels\\" I thought that was what I was going to get. I was wrong!They tasted off. I even scraped off the sticker to see if they had expired because the flavor was wrong. Nope, not expired.I went and looked at the label and discovered the problem. They are not just sunflower kernels they have other flavorings in them like paprika, onion/garlic powder, spices and other natural flavors (amongst a long list of other ingredients). This would be fine if they were labeled as \\"lightly seasoned\\" or anything that would indicate they were not plain kernels.I did not like them at all and will not buy them again. I also will not trust planters to be what the label indicates again as well.Read your ingredients."},{"rating":"2","title":"Planter's Bob's Seeds","review":"We enjoy having plenty of Planter's Sunflower Kernels in the house which we nicknamed Bob's Seeds because the little one's enjoy Bob the Builder in Sunflower Valley.

I only finished it because I invested too much time and energy in trying to figure out what the heck was going on. Firstly, the central plot was very weak. Who invites an ex-boyfriend to their engagement party when the man doesn't believe they have miscarred a baby and accuses them of aborting the child? Secondly, there was entirely too much going on with all the love triangles and raving lunatics in the book. The characters had no depth or substance. The entire writing just seems so forced. It's almost as if the author kept writing even when she knew her material just wasn't working. I noticed this book is on backorder. There will be some terribly disappointed folks out there. Please, buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CONFUSING","review":"This was a very confusing book. She had one to many characters for me to understand what was going on. The party sceen was to long. She should have develop the main characters more. There was more relationship between Michelle and Craig than Sissi and Percy. It took me one to read this book because I wanted to know when the main characters were going to get together. The book was not boring just to confusing for me.This might have been better as a full lengh novel than a romance book.I gave it 2 star because it was a bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was meant to be enjoyed.","review":"I hate to read but I could not put the book down I read this 300+ page book in about 2 to 3 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uughhhh!!!","review":"I would like to know what book anyone who rated this with more than two stars were thinking.

I couldn't fathom why Ms. Mayhew even bothered to write this if it's not readable. What editor would allow this? This is absolutely one of the worst. Save your money. If you got this book from the library like I did, go and get something else, but if you bought or are thinking about buying it, please save your money and your time.

The songs themselves--such as \\"Colors\\"\\"Blue\\" \\"Kairo\\" and \\"Passion\\"--feel as though they're telling a story only its listeners can understand.

I'm not going to be showing it to the whole world anyways, just as long as it gives me good support, looks good under my shirts, blouses, etc, is all that matters to me, and this one does all of the above. I keep holding it in my wish list, and check periodically to see if they have brought it back yet. I keep hoping. Why do companies make a bra so wonderful, then zap it away from us and replace it with flimsy unsupportative bras, that are so uncomfortable? This, I will never understand.

However, the only fun thing to do is try to hit pedestrians and bash into other cars. When it was reviewed by many game magazines, it was apparent that they too were underwhelmed with it and immediately wrote it off. Driver, Parallel Lines though, is much better. It was created after the take-over by Ubisoft. The graphics are much better and the gameplay and storyline are also very good. It is still trumped by the new GTA 4, but nonetheless a major improvement and shows promise that the next one (if it is produced) will deliver on its promises. The best thing about this game is you can buy it cheap and it doesn't make a modern gaming pc break a sweat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Driver yet","review":"I cant even compare this with the first one.

Plus you can make cool replays somehow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"I bought this game hoping it was something along the lines of the GTA series. It isn't really. It is very linear, which might be somewhat forgiveable, but its also very hard. In GTA, if you failed a difficult mission, you could just move on (unless you attracted a big police presence). Fail here, you start over from the beginning of the mission. I suspect the game might be a bit easier if the controls weren't so bad. I've tried modifing them to be more like GTA controls but it just can't quite be made to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain boring","review":"This game has got to be the most boring game I have ever played. It gets tough, and all you do is hide in the shadows and wait for the enemy to pass. The AI is very well done and very smart. The graphics and sound are very good as well. Thats why I gave it two stars. But the game play is just boring. This would be a great game if you did other things then just hide in the shadows. I know your a thief and everything but if all you do is hide, the game gets dull very fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have T&L video card!!","review":"Don't buy this game unless you have a video card that supports transform and lighting.

Normally a series has a few good shows and starts to falter slightly, however, GA improves each week. It's the first time you actually look forward to Sunday night! If you missed Season 1 or just recently got hooked (that Superbowl episode probably scored in a big way for GA), rent or buy the DVD.

The characters are deep, loveable, and different. Watching their struggles, which are not necessarily unique to television, makes you feel what the characters feel even as they pull you deeper into the immediate and ongoing plots. The endings of each eppisode are nearly always happy, or atleast bittersweet. You'll never feel like you've wasted your time in watching them.The extras could have been done a bit better. I have to admit, that I was a little dissapointed that there were not more deleted scenes. If I were to rate the extras seperatly, they would only recieve three stars.Regardless, after watching all nine eppisodes of the first season, I can't wait for season 2 to be realeased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"I enjoyed the Season 1 Grey's Anatomy DVD!

I highly recommend this series to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, great season","review":"Being that this is the first season of Grey's Anatomy, there is quite a bit of good character development that goes on during season 1. What I really enjoyed is how the creative team made sure to build in the character developments to the various story lines. So many shows have spent the first episode or four just introducing the various characters that there's essentially no story and end up with a boring or unwatched show. The writers of Grey's Anatomy created a show with characters and stories that are relatable to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grey's Anatomy is awesome","review":"I bought both the 1st and Second season of Grey's Anatomy because I watched the reruns during the summer and every episode was great, do I bought the dvd to catch myself up on all the episodes. They are all so much fun and awesome. I enjoy every episode. The writers make the lives so compelling. You will enjoy it too, the episodes are like how ER used to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down-- the best!","review":"I happened to buy this DVD on a whim, having never watched an episode before, but just bought it because I had heard good things about it. And now...I'm completely obsessed with it! This show has non-stop action and drama that is very very addicting. The characters are so easy to relate to!Highly recommend this to anyone. Just try it and you'll get sucked in too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great season for the show","review":"For anyone who loves the show, or any drama based, doctor shows in general this is a must see. Grey's Antomy not only shows medical tradgedies, but peers into the life of new doctors and their personal struggles. This is a great show and the first season is one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFULLY ENTERTAINING","review":"The first season on this dvd is very crisp and clear for viewing.

I have never missed an episode, will not let anyone interupt my Sunday night viewing, and have sat here salivating while waiting to see when Season 1 will be out!The show has amazing depth mixed with hilarious comments and situations. Each character is written and acted with such realistic qualities that I feel like my best friends have left when each show is over.This is by far, one of the best drama's in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grey's blahhhh","review":"Yeah, you just have to sit back and scratch you head in awe at the popularity of this visionary abortion, I remember seeing the first previews of this show, and knew it was junk, and I was right, it is just another med show, don't be fooled, and to make it worse there's some kind of humor to it, better shows fell before this one and it goes to show that sometimes viewers like mindless T.V., I try to watch the show, but I can't seem to get past the first few seconds, even the T.V. spots are anguish"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grey's Great!","review":"I recently became a Grey's fan during Season 2 and purchased Grey's Season 1 for background info. The first season is great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"This is soapy garbage. Just how much sex are these doctors having? Probobly more than the doctors on ER and the ones onthe long gone Chicago Hope. This, like HOUSE, M.D., is a medical show that, although includes many cast members, is mainly about one person. The theme song sucks and the dialogue is cheesy. This nonesense belongs in a daytime slot. If you want a MEDICAL show, watch ER. If you want a HOSPITAL soap, then this is by all means the trash you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Season hit gold","review":"Back when grey's was fresh it was an enjoyable show with different types of characters. There was humor and unexpected hookups. The show hasn't been able to maintain the level of humor and has tried to force relationships upon characters with no chemistry. In the beginning though it made sense. Who thought the cold and calculating Christina would become close friends with the whiny Grey and then hook up with Burk? The cast is also racially integrated, but the character's personalities are what drives their characters, not race. Wake up networks. Integration is a good thing. Anyway the first 2 seasons are the best of the series. After that it becomes inconsistent."},{"rating":"2","title":"So sorry I waited so long!","review":"I was so busy with life when Grey's started and I never got into it. So sorry I waited soo long! I love the characters and the realness of the medical portion, being an RN I tend to criticize all medical shows because of their inconsistancy and lack if medical flow, I love that the show makes me feel like it could be another day at my hospital (except for all of the sex). Great job! I am hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best show on TV","review":"This is the best show in TV right now. My Sundays are better just because of McDreamy. Shonda Rimes has truly created a wonderful show. ER meets Melrose. The show, which is rather addictive, contains truly interesting and appealing plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Big Deal","review":"I bought the first season because some friends are always raving about this show and I wanted to watch from the beginning. Uh...never mind. While MILDLY entertaining, it gets old quick. It is incredibly predictable and the characters are totally implausable. The lighting is so affected and those constant musical vignettes drove me crazy. I gave it up after three episodes.I found it to be maudlin and sappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great show!","review":"Grey's Anatomy is a great show and it gets better with every episode. The characters are well rounded and I love their interaction. The medical cases are more in the background compared to ER but the show manages to stay realistic just as ER! It's just fun to watch and rewatch and watch again and again!I only give four stars because the quality of the DVDs could be better, the sound is great but the resolution at some points is horrible! And sadly there are not so many specials. But the show is good in and on itself. So go buy and watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anatomy of a Series","review":"I've never followed any medical drama series in the past. This is actually the first one I've seen and I like it. I like how there is an equal serving of blood and gore with the humour and the drama. The extra features doesn'tcarry that much punch but it's decent enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grey's Anatomy - Season One","review":"Great to have or to give as a gift for any Grey's Anatomy fan.

We're trying to get away from the prima donna mentality that has created such mass disfunctionality in the practice of medicine today, especially among Surgeons.And then comes this series, which glorifies that \\"fraternity hazing\\" culture much at the expense of \\"evidence based\\" medical practice.It's a terrible disservice. Science, not showmanship and gratuitous competitiveness, should predominate. The effective care of patients is way too important to trust to grandstanding and the cult of personality.That being said, this is a fun series and great soap opera.

She's like Bridget Jones times three. She's intimidated by everything, reactionary rather than proactive, and seems to generally have the social and emotional maturity of a twelve year old. I don't think there's been such a child-woman as a lead character in a tv show since Cybill Shephard in Moonlighting. The father/daughter dynamic of the relationship between Dr Shephard and Grey shows a disturbingly archaic attitude towards gender politics.The plots and supporting characters could potentially make up for the appeal the lead character is lacking, but they don't. They're not actively bad, just bland and inconsequential."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I ordered this product about 5 weeks ago.

But wait, ER's over!","review":"If I had wanted to watch a slightly upbeat and younger ER...well...I wouldn't. And that's why I gave up on this peice of junk! (to be fair, I did watch most of the episodes rather than just watching one and baging it).The show spends far too much time on the personal lives of the characters...I mean it might just be a misunderstanding, but I was lead to believe that these characters were doctors...am I wrong? They are the most unpassable doctor characters I have ever come across in a TV series. If I wanted humour and drama in a medical series, I would watch House, because at least the cases are interesting and the people intricate puzzles. If I wanted just the humour, I would watch Scrubs.In essence, if they were curing the bubonic plague on this show, then people might find it worth watching...otherwise, avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Season 1-Episode 1!","review":"I love this show and have from the start.Do not be fooled-this is for Episode 1,the pilot and not Season 1!Please don't be disappointed and think you are getting the first season.If it were, there would be more than one disc that was only 60 minutes long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious music in the background!!!","review":"Don't get me wrong but I love this show on MUTE!

It really distracts than what NORMAL background music that sets some sort of mood. PLEASE NO MORE CRAPPY SONGS IN THE BACKGROUND!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words...","review":"Soap. Opera.Not only is this show completely cheesy, predictable and cliche-ridden, but it also demonstrates contempt for nursing.Alex- Like I said, I hate nurses.Meredith- What did you just say? Did you just call me a nurse?Alex- Well if the white cap fits...The characters treatment of nurses is horrible. The show depicts tham as mindless drones, unable to do anything unless a doctor tells them to.This show also pokes fun at other professions. Such as Kindergarten teaching and postal work.The characters are so arrogant that I cannot stand to watch this show.I definitely would not recommend this show. Anyway, it will probably die-off if it gets severed from Desperate Housewives.Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way","review":"No way would I be caught dead owning this DVD set, or even watching this series. I can't believe that Touchstone/Buena Vista is rushing this to market (on Valentine's Day, no less) but are still stiffing us by not releasing the far superior Season Three of \\"Once And Again\\" (originally scheduled for 1/10/06, now indefinitely postponed.) In fact, Buena Vista touts \\"Once And Again\\" in the press release for the DVD set of \\"Grey's,\\" while still stalling on releasing the third season of \\"O&A\\" on DVD. Hypocrisy in the extremus, if you ask me. (You're reading this review, aren't you?) Come on Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Get off your high horse and give us quality DVD, not this twaddle. If you want to see a real medical show, drop what you're doing, and write or e-mail 20th Century Fox and ask them to release the last five seasons of \\"St. Elsewhere\\" on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!","review":"Wow! I didn't know they hire teenagers to write TV shows with adult characters, but I guess there's a place for puerile drama for adults. Not so sure what the excuse is for the atrocious acting by so many actors (especially patients and their families - holy cow! Surely they must be relatives of cast members, writers, or production personnel, only excuse I can think of), but I guess budget trumps all in this one. Still, I admit, I find this series entertaining to watch in the same way I'm drawn to watch \\"fail\\" videos on YouTube - like watching a train wreck in slow motion over and over. I sure do have respect for the lead actors who managed to keep straight faces while reading scripts and reading their lines, and can't blame them for going for the steady paycheck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv this","review":"This was great.

This is my favorite song on here. The title track grooves with a bit of a Raggae feelSome other recommended tracks are \\"Johnny B\\" \\"Satellite\\" and \\"Engine 999.\\" Track for track, this is not as good as their first release: Nervous Night. But there are some enjoyable songs on here and it showed the band's growing maturity and diversity, as well as how they came quite a long way from where they were just two years before.It's worth having if you like this group or are looking for something besides the standard rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Album","review":"I recently went to a Hooters concert for the first time in >25years!

This is an excellent book. The best series, i'd say, would be when Steve Dallas becomes Mr. America.

One thing I would like to get strait right away is that this game is not world war 2 age of empires. This game is real. If you push your men to hard, they get tired. You have take hold of victory locations to win, not slaughter the other guys. Your men get scared, and sometimes don't follow orders. The move crouched on the ground. In age of empires, they are you. You click them and say \\"Move there\\" they do it immidiatly. In this game they are your men. Another thing people think is that this game teaches about world war two. It is not a history lesson. It is a game of strategy. And unlike age of empires, you need a strategy. Features of this game are multiplayer and scenario builder. That's right, you get to make your own battles. You also choose different invasions to play. This game is the best strategy game i've ever played"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"An improvement over CCIV, CCV-Invasion Normandy is almost the ultimate WWII game. A Close Combat fan from Day 1, I thought CCIII was the best of the three when it came out, with its ability to build the opponent forces (although only for the initial battle). CCIV added the strategic element but eliminated the ability to control the make up of your own battle groups in the campaign scenarios. Invasion Normandy retains the strategic element as well as allowing you to control your opponents forces at the beginning of each engagement. The downside is that you can not build a fantasy group stacked with armour. If you want that, buy CCIII. I would rank the series as follows; III, V, IV, I, II.

Die hard fans will notice small features like ambient sounds such as machine gun fire, and faint explosions on the edges of maps -- makes you feel like you're there...very nice addition. In this edition, the armies fall back on their infantry. This is not a huge tank battle like the Bulge or the Russian Front.

However, Chapman decides his efforts would be better spend working for the allies and begins to send back false reports to mislead his Nazi handlers.What follows is a taut, fun and entirely satisfying adventure with the admirable cast of Christopher Plummer, Yul Brynner and Gert (Goldfinger) Frobe.

The extra stuff includes an older documentary on Titanic and her sisters, which helped shed a little bit of light on the question. If you liked the book, I highly suggest the DVD to help with putting all the information together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great...until I updated the software.

Sounds like a problem on the company's end. NOT WORTH the purchase price. Don't buy from Oregon Scientific.

Combining geography with easy to use tools makes this the undisputed interactive learning aid in the market. The sound effects are very cool and really grabs the youth's attention. Additionally, you get to have fun learning national anthems, timelines, history, leaders and more for virtually any location around the world. Our favorite learning is the world news which updates weekly. Furthermore, the SmartGlobe is suitable for different age groups so we share the fun with friends and neighbors. The vocabulary is unique and insightful. This is definitely a valuable item to own because learning has never been so much fun. I strongly recommend this for all families!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice product when it works, but BEWARE of updates!","review":"I purchased the SmartGlobe for my kids for Christmas after using the one my sister has.

The writer's tone is pretty casual and relaxed, not so intense, thus you also feel relax reading it.

The episodes with \\"Misha\\" the superstar and director at ABT, Gelsy Kirkland the great but \\"mean\\" ballerina (though he doesn't say it that way), etc. are quite interesting to read.

The camera work is annoying in its preference for closeups instead of taking a nice perspective and letting us focus on the overall action. Pavarotti is certainly better than he is today but still has the annoying habit of ending phrases with an \\"uh\\". The von Karajan film with Freni & Raimondi is much better (it should be on DVD soon) and the best of all is the Australian DVD.

The Musetta has the most georgous voice I've ever heard in the part, (although she overdoes the high camp comedy)....but the voice! Lets not forget Gino Quilico who plays Marcello, ....and he's good looking, sexy, and when he does a duet with Pavarotti he's the only Baritone I've heard who can hold his own in quality and projection.

In front of your small TV this video seems contrived because the wonderful arias are added out of sync. If you want to remain a La Boheme and Pavaroti fan, just listen with your eyes closed, or buy the CD. The English subtitles made a soap opera out of Puccini's masterpiece. If he were alive and watching, he would die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pavarotti and Freni pretending to be bohemians","review":"One thing I find dissapointing in many Pavarotti opera productions is that everything seems to be adapted for Pavarotti instead of Pavarotti being adapted for the plot (or the music). Everyone knows who is the star, there is no Rodolfo in Paris having a romance with a ill-fated girl; it's just Pavarotti with a wig pretending he is still able to sing a good Rodolfo and some other singers trying not to distract us. Excellent Freni does awful singing in this production and her overacting ruins her singing many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid like a blanket from Jeffrey Amherst","review":"Please, please do not read this book.

As an aside, Vernon Reid nor Lenny Kravitz, et. al., have any business commenting on Jimi...for any legitimate reason. The only significant draw in this video is the concert footage and a minimal amount of backround info. Also, as touched upon in the piece, we all know that Jimi was obviously correct to have fired and replaced Buddy Miles shortly after these historic gigs. Jimi could see that Buddy's skill level was not equal to the other two group members and the music itself. Don't expect too much other than some formerly unseen but remarkable concert footage.

The length of the wire was identical to the original part. One minor draw back. The original had 2 rubber boots along the wire to cushion the metal braxket from wearing into the loom as it holds the loom away from hot and moving parts. To remedy this I simply cut the boots off and slid them onto the new o2 wire loom and secured them with a few twists of electrical tape. Now when I placed the loom into the metal frame holders (2 of them) there is zero chance of them wearing into the wires. This was not really needed but I am a perfectionist when it comes to working on my car. The metal loom holders were loose enough they would probably not cause damage but I need that peace of mind.

Since Honda saw fit to use Denso during assembly and the original sensor lasted 220,000 miles before failure, how could a guy go wrong using the same exact replacement part. Everything fit and works perfectly. It came with anti-seize in the package so this sensor will screw right out when it fails at 440,000 miles.

On later sets the effects of her, shall we say 'exhausting', lifestyle seem to take some of the wind out of her sails.Holiday can sound dirty without being dirty, if you get my drift. \\"I Wished On The Moon\\" gets across a pretty clear message, a very precise feel, without actually stating the message. Listen to the tune, you'll know exactly what I mean.I love Billie Holiday, all of her stuff, but this record is a different Billie. She's younger and more vibrant, more romantic, more hopeful.

Few that have never been read before, but there is enough extra information included here to make them good for the second round. The editing is poor, with a few errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar here and there. The largest problem in this book, however is the attitude of the author. The reader can clearly tell what he is stating as fiction or myth, and what he presumes to be fact. He tells the story of the beginning of Earth (in his mind, the \\"Big Bang\\") as if he had been there. His annoying, persistent use of words like \\"negroid\\" and referring to Native Americans as \\"Indians\\" are both unprofessional and offensive. Over all, this pretentious bore should not be writing books on mysteries of the unknown, because he obviously thinks he knows everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"sizing wrong","review":"I ordered XL to allow circulation to help with warmth.

Ms. Butalia's work is so saturated with her personal opinions and idealogy, that it almost ceases to be a work on history than the airing of one's thoughts and mindset. Almost a diatribe, if I may.

It's a shame that they told their most touching stories to her and she squandered these in her own confusion. She forgot that she is because someone didn't yield and let her be what she is, her femimism and sikhi and all. That the history shouldn't be explained but told and understood. I would recommend not reading anythings from quackpots like her and her promoter Mr. Rushdi.

However, I was disappointed with game play. As the other reviewer indicated, game play is fast. No game I played last longer than 6 minutes. In addition, I had played only 4 games before I started to get duplicate questions and question categories. Now I have played 10 games-- totaling no more than 1 hour of game play-- and get duplicate questions with every game. It does not feel like the game has 2000 questions as advertised on the box. Very disappointing-- I'll stick to the show on TV.When I do not get repeat questions, the game is fun and challenging. However, I can't help but realize that the game will probably last me no more than 1 week. Maybe the gamemakers can do something to ensure that the full 2000 questions are used before repeating them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough questions!","review":"The game itself is fun enough, but there are so few questions that I started seeing duplicates in my third game.Wait till next year's version..."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"This bag is nice BUT... there are not enough compartments to hold things!

However, the person who said \\"For once the ENTIRE Hendrix Woodstock Performance on video\\" is not that bright. This is only about half of the concert and we are missing great performances such as \\"Hey Joe\\". I'm not sure whether the Experience Hendrix Ltd. wanted to make more money by releasing the second half of the set later, or if the second half was just never filmed. I would be very happy to see the other half of his set because as we can hear on the audio versions, it is spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has better Audio than the 2005 version.","review":"While the 2005 version has the complete concert, this 1999 version has its stereo soundtrack mastered at 448 kbps, while the 2005 stereo soundtrack is at 198 kbps. This results in that the 1999 one has more headroom and dynamic range and less compression then the 2005 version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimi Rocks!","review":"It's great to see more of Jimi's performance at Woodstock. Unfortuately, you are unable to hear the rest of the Gypsies, Suns and Rainbows (2nd guitar and percussion but I think that's due to the bad mixing of the original soundtrack and lack of microphone placement on the congas.

The gun is very durable and sturdy. The accuracy is as good as one will find in a spring airsoft pistol.

Josh Watzkin walking you through some of his classic chess encounters is one of my favorite parts of this game. You actually begin to understand what it takes to play chess at an elevated level. One part of this chess program I did have a problem with was playing computer players. Each computer player is rated and they play exactly at that level. What the computer cannot do, unlike a human can is make bad moves. The computer playing at a 1550 rated level plays it perfectly, unlike a player at rated at the 1550 level. A player at rated at the 1550 level may make a few moves at an 1800 level and then make a terrible move that a 1200 level rated player wouldn't even make. Humans make mistakes, whereas the Chessmaster does not. Except for this and the occasional crash (I am running the game on win2000, which is not a gaming platform) this game is excellent. I would buy it again if I didn't already own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay with Chessmaster 7000 and save your money","review":"One of the appeals to Chessmaster used to be the \\"auto-annotation\\" mode so a player could enter a game and Chessmaster would analyze move by move and offer better moves. This feature made Chessmaster worthwhile.Then came 8000. This feature is gone. Chessmaster will analyze the game but you can not print it out. Bummer!!!!While the tutorials are nice, they are not that much better than the 7000 so why spend the extra money.Of course, there are the problems with more advanced Windows operating systems and now why buy this product at all. If you are a parent trying to teach your children to play, look for Maurice Ashley Teaches Chess. A far superior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Horribly Buggy on Win2k Pro","review":"After getting trounced in chess games at ... I decided to buy this latest version of the Chessmaster series in order to actually begin learning the game of chess.People seeing the VERY low rating I am giving this program should understand that the program is packed with goodness. In fact, it IS a 5 star program. A grand master goes over games of note, explaining all the moves he could have made, followed by the move he actually played. This I found facinating. You can play any of a large number of computer players, (all levels) and even customize the difficulty. The tutorials on the movement of the pieces are great for beginners.Where Chessmaster 8000 suffers is that it is incredibly buggy. I've had this program for a day and it has crashed more than a dozen times!!!I sincerely hope a patch that addresses this terrible problem is released soon. It clearly devalues the obviously great effort that was put into the product's creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good program with a few design idiocies","review":"My young daughter showed an interest in chess, so I thought I'd get us a chess program. Chessmaster 8000 is a good program and fun to use. As a teaching program for kids or adults it has a few very annoying flaws:1) You can't pick up the (great) tuturial lessons where you left off. If you're at step 24 of a tutorial, and you stop, you need to resume from step 1.2) The program is not keyboard friendly (on Windows 2000 at least). Alt keys don't work, and there's way too much clicking."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Windows 2000 or Windows XP support","review":"This wonderful product will not run on any Windows after ME.UBI doesn't even plan to upgrade Chessmaster even though Microsoft will stop producing and supporting the Windows versions that Chessmaster runs on.

The fix was to go to the Chessmaster folder, right click on the executable (horse symbol),click on properties. Under proporties go to the compatability tab and clear the checks out of all the boxs. Start the game. I enjoyed the game on the '98 machine and after playing a few on the new machine and downloading the latest update it seems to work fine.

While there are some individually attention grabbing tracks (tracks 1,2,5, and 9) the rest of it is kind of in the background, projecting a mood of quiet paranoia.

No need to add more to the comments about the main plotline that are adequately described above. But the things that makes this movie special are the sprinkled esoteric references to a little known strain of Mediaeval (and earlier) Jewish gnostic mysticism that run thru this movie.

Jewish people are constantly being stereotyped by people who have never even met a Jew, and this film feeds many of those stereotypes. The psychiatrist/rabbi, for example, was a very unfair portrayal. The character of Sonya's husband, too, is a major generalization.Hopefully viewers of this film will not make sweeping assumptions about Jewish culture because of the way one Hollywood film portrays it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Side","review":"Despite the Orthodox Jewish background this movie is really about a womens life and her ways of reaching what she has always wanted.

But it is subtitled 'visio-textual art' so I guess it delivers on what it claims to. The problem is that most of the work inside isn't very good.

Both me and my 9 year old were very frustrated with this one because the pictures are so beautiful, but in order to make them as you see on the box will be close to impossible.

I looked forward to the release of Pool of Radiance with great anticipation.PoR was, without question, the biggest disappointment as a game I have ever encountered. The action and combat are slow and repetitive. Movement and travelling on the maps is arduous and stupidly difficult. The character screens are unintuitive and difficult to use. The spell and magic item casting mechanism is incredibly unwieldy and slow.This game really, really stinks. It is the only PC game I have ever purchased and not finished. I mean, it is awful. Terrible. Unspeakably bad.

Previews were very encouraging. Unfortunately, the final product didn't live up to those previews.I have not experienced any of the serious technical issues reported by others, nor install issues. Performance took a serious hit, though, and gameplay was just plain tedious. The interface was difficult to use and very non-intuitive.After growing extremely bored with the first dungeon level, frustrated at the layout of the game world, and annoyed at the cursor drag and graphical performance hit, I uninstalled it and found someone else to pawn it off on. May they be more easilly entertained than I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, frustrating, and boring","review":"Like so many very early attempts at role playing games, Pool of Radiance has failed to capture the very intent of D&D. The game is slow playing, has very little plot, no room for character development, and is technically inept. Combat simuilation is so slow as to be agonizing. Once combat is entered, you can't leave. Initiative (per combat rules) is almost impossible for a player character. In the early game, you can make a load of money, but you have practically nothing to spend it on. The graphics are poor, the interface is clunky, and the game respresents a bad interpretation of the 3rd edition D&D rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game isn't worth your time.","review":"I'll keep it short and sweet:Imagine Baldur's Gate I. Now slow down the action tremendously and make the plotline totally linear. Then make the game buggy - it often sputters (lags) almost like Ultima Online did back in 1997. That's essentially what you get with Pool of Radiance.Even with the inevitable release of a patch, the game itself is not compelling. You walk around slowly until you find a monster. The monster approaches you slowly. You slowly attack it and it slowly retaliates. When it's dead, you walk around some more.If you're looking for a non-linear game that you can play as a single player, I'd consider waiting for NeverWinter Nights."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO Stars!","review":"This game is the biggest disappointment I've ever seen, and being an avid fan of the Gold Box series, it doubly hurts.Beware at your own risk if you buy this one.

Go buy one of the Baldur's Gate games instead, or wait for Neverwinter Nights. I was so disappointed by this game because it could have been so much better. As the first D&D 3rd Edition game out there, it had the opportunity to define the standard by which others would be judged. Instead, it failed to qualify as even remotely fun, especially in comparison to the Baldur's Gate games.Plenty of other reviews talk about the numerous inexcusable bugs (like the install/uninstall problems) or the painful game play (why exactly can't I send party members more than one screen away from the leader?), so I won't get into it here. What I would like to know is:a) how could the people who slaved on this game night and day for god knows how long not realize that the game was fatally un-fun?b) how could these bugs have slipped past QA?So much potential.

Boy, what a disappointment. I would give it ZERO stars if the Amazon interface would allow it.The plot is terrible, undeveloped and difficult to discern. The maps are unnecessarily difficult to navigate. Party movement is tedious and cumbersome.

I bought the game unaware of how many problems there were. I quickly discovered all of them, and here are three.1) The combat system is rigidly turn-based with little or no complexity to add excitement. (zombie hacks, paladin hacks= noise).2) As with any true rpg fan, story comes first and foremost. POR simply had none. Perhaps a think tank of CPA's came up with this tedious dungeon crawl. I don't know.3) There were far too many bugs in the system, and I experienced three crashes in the first couple of hours of game-play.If you have extra money to spend, go buy BGII or DEUS EX.

While the graphics on the backgrounds and the animations are very good, and the sounds are good as well, the graphics on the characters are somewhat lacking. Character creation is fairly limited and somewhat bad at points (the fact that when you choose an icon for your character, you only get two options, and they are basically the same exact thing, only slightly different colors, was disappointing at best). I think where this game really loses out, though, is gameplay. It's just not fun. It plays like a Windows program, and that's just not exciting. You cannot scroll the screen beyond where your characters are standing, making the view limited. You can't rotate the view, meaning that your characters are often standing in the way of something you are trying to look at. Basically, nothing about the game screams excitement. It's a ho-hum, not really worth buying until maybe it comes down in price kind of game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"Thousands of user complaints about incompatibility with their systems, severely curtailed ability to customize the graphics and sound, reduced implementation of promised features, and little incentive to roleplay within the game are just a few reasons to avoid it.This is probably the worst implementation I've ever seen.

Interplay has set the standard with the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale series. This game can't hold a candle to them.

It looks pretty good butnothing exceptional here.The character customizability seems to be nonexistant, you justdistribute stat points and pick one of 2-8 character modelsdepending on the race/class choice you made.Overall it's disappointing, but that's mostly my own fault forexpecting it to have all the classes and races from DnD 3rdEdition, they left out my favorite (Wizards), and because Ithought the character developement would be more involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much can you slow the action in an RPG?","review":"I have owned this game for quite some time but because I was involved in playing several other RPG's I just got around to trying it and boy was I dissappointed. This has to be the slowest game play ever. If you don't mind playing 30 minutes to kill one monster (maybe a SLIGHT exageration) then this games for you. I played for several hours and never made it past level one (and I didn't die). I will be archiving this game in my trash can never to be mistaken for something I might like to play again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Money is Much Better Spent Elsewhere","review":"Starting off I'm stunned that a company would release a game in the state that this one was. It was pretty obvious that this game was rushed to the shelves w/out proper testing and tweaking. It's very easy to see things that were \\"wrapped up\\" quickly for release, even the intro movie looked to be incomplete. Among the bugs is one where if you uninstall the game it would hose your OS, nice.Past that, if you are one of the lucky ones and the game is able to run on your machine the gameplay is very lackluster. Again I blame a great deal of this on it being rushed. There are several issues with balance, you cannot customize your characters, pre-gen'd chars are better than any you can make. The storyline is HORRIBLE. It's very go to A to get B and give to C. C then gives you something else to go chase after. I really hate that they destroyed the name of such a great title. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time","review":"After playing all versions of Baldurs Gate, I thought I was good to go with Pool of Radiance.

The only people who will like this game are those who want complete control over their combat so badly they will put up with all of the short comings of the game to have it.This is a dungeon crawl in the truest sense. Your characters walk verrrrry slooowly from one sloooow combat to the next. You dread taking a wrong turn because it takes you soooo long to get back to another spot.The characters can't be customized that much, and the rules (they claim to be 3rd Edition D&D - I wouldn't know) stink. Charisma, the most important attribute of... a Wizard??? Excuse me, did I read that wrong?What is good about it? Well the graphics are beautiful.

My computer system met the requirements listed on the game.Eventually, I decided to remove it from my hard drive and wait until UbiSoft made a patch to let me play. -- I had read about the UNINSTALL bug, so I waited until I downloaded patch 1.1.Even with the patch installed, uninstalling POR2 crashed my system. It erased or modified some system files. I tried to do a low level restore of my system, but that did not help.

However, I soon realized that I was playing the same game over and over again, in different, but very similar areas with higher level players and monsters. I will say that I really enjoyed the graphics and the combat system. Magic is prety cool as well. And the outside areas of the game are fun. But this is mostly an underground dungeon quest and the dungeons are essentially the same. I finally reached a point where I was bored stiff and quit playing. I never finished the game, and I had been playing for weeks. I started with eager anticipation, ended up extremely disappointed in the almost endless repetition of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick...","review":"Many hours of my life have been wasted playing this poor excuse of a game...boring, boring, boring.

PLEASE!! THAT'S SO STUPID!! I still can't believe I found some +3 warhammer with a level 1 character. This game is insanely boring and just an attempt to have a chance at killing a Dracolich, a monster that in any normal D&D situation would be next to impossible to kill."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want 3rd Edition DnD, buy Neverwinter Nights","review":"This game was not what they hyped it to be. It was supposed to use rules from the 3rd Edition pen and paper game which it does to an extent but the characters are not only made pretty much for you (whoopee you get to change the name) but you can only have like a total of 4 saved at one time.

All the rooms are the same, and the game quickly becomes five levels of find orcs, kill orcs, find aombies, kill zombies. The entire game is spent in battle, and only in the last half of the game do you get to go somwhere outside and different. Overall, the plot is weak and you just battle, rest, battle, rest, etc. the sorcere's ability is nice, since you don't have to memorize specific spells, and its always nice to blasta group of drow with a wand of cone of cold, but the game is very underveloped and patch dependant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame, Shame , Shame . . .","review":"I really hate writing negative reviews, but this game needed it. When I first heard of PoR, I thought \\"Cool, a game using the 3rd edition rules that looks pretty decent.\\" It was $50. The next time I seen it, I hade no money, but gave it a look anyway.It was $30. At the time I bought it the price was $20. Yes, through explaining the rate at which the price of this game dropped, I can support my opinions. Before I played the game, I gave the instruction manual a glance through, and I was horrified. There was NOTHING on quite a few things that make D&D.;No two weapon fighting, only four people to a party, VERY limited character generation, and there's more, oh so much more. I'm really glad I bought this game for only $20, otherwise I would not be a happy gamer. This is NOT a solid game and I scoff every time someone asks me about it.

The interface is absolutely awful. The characters move in this pokey slow manner that make you want to scream. Getting at spells goes through a multi level menu. The combat is almost exactly like the old turn based Pool of Radiance from five or six years ago. I take a shot, then you take a shot then he does, etc. Utterly lame. The adventure is completely linear. It gives you no choices and leads you by the nose. Often you don't even have a choice of right or left since the dungeons tend to lead you in a line as well. When you level up the machine decides how to allocate your feats and skill points for you. Please, please, please save your money.

You have to install the patch from (...) to prevent save game corruption, which gives you an idea of how much QA they did before the release.Gameplay (stinks) too. It literally puts the word CRAWL in 'dungeon crawl' because your party trudges at a snail's pace compared to the easy, intuitive movement afforded in Baldur's Gate and other RPG's.

The variety of monstersyou encounter is slim, the plot is not really there at all.Finally, the combat (the meat of this game..) is plodding andtime consuming with very little flash or drama.Bottom line, and I am sorry to say it- unless you're justbetween games and have something like \\"federal prison\\" typetime on your hands to kill- don't waste the hours of your lifeplaying PoR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic reworking of old classic","review":"In the words of the immortal bard, \\"Man, this game [stinks].\\"All the promised features have been removed, and what is left is less fun that glueing the side of your favourite head to a passing train.Take your copy of P.O.R. and throw it around in the park with a close friend.

Althought the graphics are flawless, and the options are great, actually playing the game can be frustrating. It has a very good story line, however, you'll find that you'll quickly tire of taking 5 minutes for every battle, and that moving your party long distances can be extremely irritating.Several bugs are present, so do not play without downloading the patch, or all your work will be lost at the most critical of times.Other than that, the interface is nice, spells are done nicely, and multi-play works flawlessly (depending on your connection)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gameplay flows like concrete, but some good points too","review":"I was really looking forward to this game after finishing BG2 and its expansion pack. Unfortunately, it was disapointing.The game had a lot of potential, and did a lot of things right. Character generation is fantastic, and the graphics and soundare pretty good. However, it wasn't enough to make for it's serious defects. The interface is convoluted and difficult. More importantly, combat is turn-based. This makes for very slow gameplay, and it got boring quickly. Also, the story line is pretty weak, and the NPCs are flat and lifeless. To the games defense, it reminded me a little of a modern version of the old RPGs from TSI (like the pools of radiance or dragon lance games). I guess if that's what I was looking for this might have come across better.

I know you are allowed to move after attacks but if you move the enemies automatically hit for double damage and when they move sometimes you don\`t even get an attack.

The new NiMH and NiCd battery chargers (not this one) generally use some delta-voltage-current-somethingeruther and a few other newer techniques to charge batteries only up until they're full, then they trickle charge them. This Energizer model seems to use \\"old\\" technology to charge batteries. It doesn't matter what size/capacity/charge level, it charges them all for the same fixed amount of time. I found that it charged barely-discharged NiMH batteries for the same fixed 5 hours. To me, it should not run so much extra current through them unnecessarily.

So if your battery is only slightly discharged it'll still charge it for the same time as if it were totally dead. It also can't charge batteries individually which my Rayovac charger can. The only downfall of my Rayovac is that it can only charge AA and AAA which is all I need. I paid 25 dollars for the Energizer and the Rayovac was only 10 dollars... BIG difference. If you can find a Rayovac recharger at your local store get it! I even got 16 NiMH batteries for 25 dollars - PLUS they're ALL 1600mah (higher the rating the more power).

Overall I can't recommend this book to anyone with any sense of morality. It's one thing when a romance steps over the line and has two characters engage in a sexual act. It is quite another when the author uses the ruse of writing a historical romance to find a way to write out a bunch of sick sexual desires.

But after that it went downhill.There were mass assumptions made about what would be found and that may not be that bad, but then assumptions started being made based on previous assumptions and after 20 minutes what we had left science all together and was no better than an episode of Star Trek.

Using computer graphics it shows how a mission to explore an alien planet would be conducted by Earth employing a sublight spacecraft delivering sophisticated probes to the surface. The program explains step-by-step the mission as the probes encounter strange life forms, with frequent asides by scientists who explain how such life forms might evolve and live. Using computer animation, the program is very good. If it has a flaw it is in the asides, which frequently go back to something discussed five minutes and a couple of segments ago. In the DVD version the commentary might be edited in as an option, so it is possible to go all the way through the story, which is absorbing in and of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Masterpiece for JJ and the gang","review":"JJ Grey's debut CD, \\"Blackwater,\\" was as stunning a musical portrait as I've ever come across.

Terfel is also performing these songs as they would have been performed in their original state. He doesn't change the music he just interprets it to a degree that isn't a norm for the general populace. Most singers are on a mic when they perform live you will hardly ever see people like Bryn perform with a mic because they are trained to sing with dynamics that are inaudible without a mic for normal singers.

Eldredge continues, but does not advance one iota, a central theme he stated in WAH: there is a great battle between good & evil, between God & Satan, a battle which started with Eden's fall, and we all play our part in it. I probably should have issued a spoiler alert, b/c I have now just told you everything that Eldredge has to say in Epic. Oh, you can enjoy his constant movie references, if you like, but even they are re-hashed: we get it, John, you like Braveheart and Gladiator and similar movies.

Could it be that there is something universal in each of us longing to understand our own role in THE epic story of life? Eldredge seeks to explain a Christian worldview through a very accessible lense of popular media, showing how even our movies show a paradise lost, a rescue, a hero, and an important role for us all to play in the biggest story of them all. I think this short book could inspire non-Christians to seek answers to these metaphysical questions in an engaging way. I enjoyed it. Of course, the best answers are found right in the Source (Scripture itself) but it was a good reminder from a new perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written story but style is not for everyone","review":"The reviews on Epic are overwhelmingly positive. The book does have a number of good points, and is written with much passion. It's quite short as well, but moves along quickly. The author makes a number of very interesting analogies, drawing from Tolkien, Braveheart and other books and movies. Eldredge definitely has a unique style. As such, it's quite likely you will either love this book or find it so hard to relate to that you can barely make it through despite the length (which was my reaction, nothing against the author). If you've liked other books by Eldredge such asWild at Heart: Discovering the Secret of a Man's Soulyou'll probably like Epic. If you didn't like Wild at Heart, your opinion of the author won't change with Epic. If you haven't read anything by him, Epic is probably a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book and a great tool","review":"The book Epic by John Eldridge portrays a wonderful message for both believers and non-believers. We are in the midst of a grand story. Our sufferings on earth are not idly received. Eldridge refutes his points very effectively through both Bible verses and quotes from popular stories, eg. The Chronicles of Narnia (of which I am a huge fan), Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, the list goes on. I believe that he quotes Lewis the most and how could you go wrong when quoting the works of C.S. Lewis who wrote as a devout Christian with great messages in his works. This is a book that helps you stop and realize some things about the life we live, and provides a lot to think about throughout the day. And anything that causes us to think about the things of God during the day is a good thing in my book.

Even Jessica's stripper scenes cannot lift things up. Very heavy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very shallow movie","review":"I will keep this short. Do not see this movie unless you want to see Jessica Biel strip.I have read some of the positive reviews. I believe that other movies have posed and explored questions about love and human existence much better and more authentically than this movie. Everything about this movie is a cliche and Biel should be angry because if she didn't strip in this movie, no one would have watched it. Her routine--which is very well done, nudity besides--and Swayze's portrayal of the club owner are the only reasons anyone should watch this. Rent it and keep the fast forward button ready if you're curious."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING - RAY LIOTTA YOU NEED A NEW AGENT!","review":"BORING. 4 people that somehow interconnect by personal tragedies in a movie with a slow plot.The shocker here, is how come an actor like RAY LIOTTA is today doing B MOVIES or playing 3rd or 4th rate parts where was a STAR in GODFELLAS.RAY L - If you read this, you need a new agent, you are a brilliant actor wasting your time in these movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNORE....","review":"Are you kidding me? I mean seriously...After the success of CRASH and TRAFFIC there have been a number of dramas released that have focused on multiple subplots involving different characters that all tie together at the end of the movie. POWDER BLUE tried to work the same formula but fails terribly. The reason POWDER BLUE fails is because it is overwrought and tries too damn hard. Its overly bleak and ultimately unbelievable. I wasn't buying any of the characters and so the story became laughable. Was I depressed after watching this movie? Yes. But only because I realized I wasted four dollars and ninety nine cents that I could have used to buy a happy meal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tragic waste of talent","review":"The cast provides memorable performances but the story is totally lacking due to a sub-standard script.It fails to make up for the poor writing, production and direction.I wish that I never had purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and weird and not worth your time","review":"You would think \\"How bad can this movie be?\\" Pretty bad is the answer.The fault is not with the actors, but possible in the script and certainly with the director.Portions of the story are extremely compelling, but it never really delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Disappointment is an understatement.

But Jessica it's Go Go not... cry cry. Forrest Whitaker irritated the excrement out of me. Jessica Biel is not a good actress but the story with her and Ray Liotta was semi interesting. But still this movie blows... except for Jessica Biel stripping and being naked, something that most hollywood actress's who play strippers can't seem to figure out (strippers take their clothes off)."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Should Have Nuked Vietnam, I Guess","review":"...because the director of this junk was from there.I love Whitaker and Liotta (and Jessica Biel nude) as much as any fan of film, but this was terrible. The writing is incredibly awful. The dialogue is funny enough, though, of course, it's not a comedy. The overacting by Biel is horrendous, and also funny. The young actor with the name of Qwerty (possibly the worst, and laziest, character name ever concocted) in the film is also good. It might be enjoyable to some inebriated types due to Biel's nudity, the terrible writing and Liotta's final hilarious scene involving the actor and young boy giggling with a kite in tow in (would you believe it) a beach in heaven!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO","review":"After watching this movie, I wondered why I bought it. So, I went back to read the reviews. Most of them were really good. The rest were really bad. So, my curiosity was piqued--that's why I bought it. This film has such a really excellent cast. So many actors that I really like. And the quality of the acting, by everyone, was great. But, the content was TERRIBLE. I mean, really bad. Not as bad as Southland, but really bad, none the less. How did these magnificent actors align to work in such a bad, bad movie? One star is I hate it. Two stars for I don't like it. So because the acting was good, this product gets 2 stars. But wow, really bad. Maybe seeing JESSICA BEIL POLE DANCING AND TOPLESS (not unimpressive on both counts, admittedly) is what drives these many positive reviews. THIS MOVIE IS REALLY LACKING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feelin' Powder Blue","review":"I bought this film simply becuase of my faith in the cast, and I am very glad I did. This film is unlike most any other as it deals with a topic that most films avoid...that of desperation. The film follows the lives of four characters all in the throws of desperation. The film was beautifully acted, well written, and had a ton of really good shots...I feel the director did over use the blue filter ( I am assuming to be kitsch with the title) but this does not distract too much from the overall film. While not a new book...or even a new chapter, this film does succeed in taking the viewer to the depths of the dire straits of the characters. I enjoyed it very much and would suggest it to any film lover who wants to see a flick...just outside of feel good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more item of Mr.Christmas","review":"A nice item for collectors or even as a Christmas present.nice and clear music, steady movement up and down.A few more mr.

We stumbled across Little Bear about four months ago, and have been renting them ever since. Most are not at all scary, and none are as scary as the Disney movies. This Rainy Day video is especially good. My 3 and 5 year old girls belly-laugh through the whole thing.I will say that throughout our rentals, we have found a couple Little Bear stories that are slightly scary for my youngest. But most are a delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cut Above Most Kids Entertainment","review":"The Little Bear series is really a cut above most TV entertainment. It doesn't resort to cheap thrills like overly noisy sound effects, quick cuts or violent and explosive action. And yet, it is TOTALLY engaging.I love how the lovely music doesn't overwhelm the dialogue. When the characters speak, there is no extraneous music or sound fx to muffle their dialogue.There is no excessive action, yet the stories almost never drag. The characters speak slowly and clearly, yet the dialogue keeps a child's attention.There is nothing too scary, but there's enough imaginative fantasy sequences to keep things interesting.There's no violence but there are gentle, yet realistic, portrayals of arguments and disagreements.One of the best kids shows out there. Must have something to do with the magic and slightly kooky touch of Maurice Sendak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loves it","review":"My son loves this DVD. It has TONS of episodes on it!

If you're looking for a good fantasy of this sort, rent Darby O'Gill and the Little People or Willow. The 10th Kingdom, Legend, and The Princess Bride will also quench a desire for excellent fantasy, but don't waste your time on this over-long, cheesy movie. I will give it a thumbs up for great costuming, make-up and some highly enjoyable characters, but it still probably isn't worth your time, though your children will probably like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all ages","review":"This is a great movie.I saw it on TV a few years ago and have been looking to buy it since.

It was an adorable movie that is suitable for children of all ages, which is rare.

Another note, if the writer and/or researcher bothered to pick up a single book on mythology and folklore, they would have noticed that there are NO female Leprechauns whatsoever. Leprechauns are also Non-Trooping Faeries. The so-called Faeries, which are actually more like Pixies or Pillywiggins.In short, this movie is utter pap, having no research done whatsoever, but what can one expect from NBC, which featured a dreadlocked Calypso in The Odyssey and a completely uneducated retelling of the Arthurian Legend. (Queen Mab originates from Queen Medb of the Irish legend called The Tain, not Arthurian legend.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"Without a doubt this has to be the corniest fairy tale ever made! I'd like to thank the producers, actors, writers, and directors for turning me off pagan folk lore once and for all!

It is a cross between the Wizard of Oz and Romeo & Juliet with the most atrocious plot ever conceived! I would like to say this is a movie for children but my children saw this movie and said it was stupid! The movie comes with a fine cast of actors who waste their talents on this dog!

Still a great durable wooden strategy game though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Fun For Everyone....","review":"This is a cross between the classics chess, checkers, or tic-tac-toe.

It's like a combination of Connect Four and Tic-Tac-Toe with the ability to move anywhere and capture other pieces. It's simple to learn, but the strategy is more complex than it first seems. Gobblet is a fun challenge for two-players.My only complaint is that it is not exactly as pictured. In the picture the light colored pieces match the box, but in reality the game I got has an orange varnished wooden box and light blond pieces. Also, it appears in the picture that game board fits into the top of the box during play, but this is not true. To fit into the top the lid must be turned over so the the playing board is inside the box. It's no big deal since this actually protect the board from scratches when in storage, and it can easily be placed on top of the box or any flat surface during play.I highly recommend everyone try this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're typical terminals","review":"Nothing special but not sub-par.

It is a very dry formula and mocks an eyeliner that is a few months old and dried out. It didn't make my eyelashes even look like they had mascara on them.

I found their sound to be quite original with an interesting balance of emotion and humor along with the balance between electronic and acoustic music.So I was really disappointed when I heard their new album. This record is clearly intended to be their breakthrough, with far more vocals and regular song structure and less expirementalism. The record even reuses some samples from old albums which was really annoying. This album lacks the interesting, unexpected twists from their previous works, and as a result comes off as generally bland and sometimes even cheesy.If you want a Books album, please check out the other two first."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh...","review":"I agree with OneLove; I found this album the be much weaker than the first two...

It's not a bad book, with some solid and evocative descriptions - such as what happens to the concubines and the Palace of Discarded Concubines, along with what happens to the Emperor's love - this book is a interesting read in a fictional but Chinese-styled empire. I do wish there had been some more detail. The description made the book sound as if the Emperor was more crazy/cruel, and compared to the description, he actually comes across as rather mild, which disappointed me. I wanted to see an Emperor who would abuse his power more (and thus make a more fascinating and exciting novel for us to read) and even though this young emperor does do a few bad things, he's actually more meek and mild than what you would think despite his rages and tantrums.I enjoyed 'Rice' more than this book, but if you're a fan of Su Tong, you should at least find this book enjoyable. A decent 3.5/5 stars for a enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cute and quirky Japanese language aid","review":"This book provides a cute introduction to some topics in Japanese that aren't covered in the classroom. This book is quite amusing, and I did learn some information from it. Assume 1-2 semesters of college Japanese are necessary make use of the book. It makes no pretense of teaching basic grammar or vocabulary, instead focusing on tips on communicating as efficiently as possible in situations that prove difficult for foreigners. However, a few of the tips struck me as either impractical or obvious common sense. On the whole, it was a fun book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different category - the perfect toilet reading","review":"Learning Japanese can be heavy-going. This book is different. However, you won't learn Japanese by reading it. However, if you have a developed routine in place using other books or courses, then this book can be a good alternative. Say that you want to read something about the Japanese language, but you're not in the mood for more vocabulary or grammar exercises, but you are also in the mood for doing something. Then this book could be excellent to open at a kind of random page.

Also, it does not have a table of contents, so if you really want to read it, you have to start from the beginning and hope you don't need to skip around.Im sorry to put a negative review, but I figured I would let everyone know what they were buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase","review":"Poorly formatted, no table of contents, navigation near impossible.

The focus Abdul al-Wahhab's teachings is admirable, but leaves one with the feeling that Wahhabi Islam is about some notional classical Wahhabism with no bearing on the present day. Early in the book DeLong-Bas takes great pains to disassociate al-Wahhab from the well-known story that he and Muhhamed ibn Saud fused religion, politics and tribal violence to create a powerful political dynasty. If Wahhab was the unwilling rhetorical partner in Saudi expansionism, the co-option of his name and aspects of his teaching by the al-Saud is the more interesting and relevant story. DeLong-Bas makes no attempt to reconcile the Wahhabism of her her book, with the Wahhabism of contemporary Saudi Arabia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not History","review":"The poor quality of this book should be embarrassing to the author, who obviously succumbed to the agenda-driven bent of her professor, John Esposito.This book is not history; it's as though major, major aspects of Mohammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's life are simply ignored, and the remaining material creatively re-framed in order to paint him in some kind of angelic terms. It's really shocking, and not only is it ridiculed by any critical scholar in the U.S., but it would be laughed at by most Arab Muslim readership in the Middle East. Only in Saudi Arabia would this book find praise and appreciation, and is more evidence of the political nature of Esposito and his progeny.My honest recommendation is that you ignore this book and seek out real scholarship on the history of the Wahhabi movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to pray more successfully","review":"If you want to pray in a manner that is more successful and always the best for all concerned, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz as you like it(or love it)","review":"This album escaped me for several years as I didn't know about it.

An unusual arrangement of Paul McCartney's \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\" is most satisfying. Henry Mancini's \\"Moment To Moment\\" has a hauntingly sweet sound. \\"Lonely Town\\" is darkly complex.There are many sides and moods to each of the songs within this original work.

I think finding out there are bodies burried in your backyard would freak anyone out. When people are scared they tend to make connections between completely unrelated things. Most of the things in the book can be easily explained. There are some truely paranormal things described which did creep me out but I read the book late at night only streets away from where this supposedly happened!

Not just a \\"gay\\" book, this is a profoundly human, universal story. A must-read for anyone considering adoption or surrogacy. The book just keeps getting better and better, chapter by chapter. GETTING SIMON is a great, edge of the chair suspense thriller. Two men are turned away by the woman who promised to give them her baby in the delivery room. Out of the ashes of their despair rises a man obsessed with one thing only - finding the baby he names, \\"Simon.\\" A ragtag parade of potential birthmothers flows in and out of their lives, raising our hopes, then dashing them when they leave. Even though we know the ending, wanting to find out how they get there makes this book so difficult to put down. I read it in two sittings.

This is commendable and initially appealing and inviting. However,upon further examination,there is no substance to the preparatory reading material in any of the chapters. There is nothing unique in this workbook relating to specific issues of BPD. The very few cognitive distortions that are explained and dealt with are nothing that can't already be found in any of the available workbooks that deal with general issues of depression and anxiety. Moreover, my biggest contention with this volume is that the worksheets in each chapter are EXACTLY identical! There is absolutely no spontenaity or creativity on the part of the authors. Borderlines,who are especially prone to becoming bored easily, would find this workbook uninteresting,cumbersome,and tedious to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"no self-help book","review":"However much this book might appeal to you, the schedules in the book are not to be done on one's own, which i found quite frustrating. the book reminds me of 'how to reinvent your life' by Young.

The workbook addresses all of the main borderline characteristics used to define a borderline patient. However, if you have already spent a lot of time in therapy, as I have, it will not tell you anything you haven't already learned.

I also made the mistake of thinking this book was the book from the PBS show Kid Concoctions as did my sister. I'm sure many others are doing the same. This book is not bad, the problem is that it is very upsetting feeling that you were tricked into buying a knock off. Even if it isn't a knock off, that is the perception many of us have.

Again, refreshing! ... :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misplaced emphasis","review":"Albeit an interesting read, it fails to search the deeper nature as the author is caught in his own biases and prejudices [of which he seems strangely unaware]. He is correct in the location of information, but wrong in the placement of solutions and end results. Does education, as we see it today and perhaps since the appearance of radio, later television, and now computers and handhelds, need to change? Yes. In the way he imports? That would be foolhardy and is the mark of someone not addressing the deeper implications of technology on culture, behavior, and identity, let alone education which is directly related to these. Questions, thinking innovation, opening minds to possibilities, this is where education and schooling needs to head, away from standard prehistoric measures and check and balances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free your mind","review":"Shake out old notions of how things must be done. The main value of this book is that it shows there is another way. Children don't have to go to school.

Illich does a great job of discussing how the whole concept of an institutionalized school doesn't work and defeats its own purpose. And looking back at my own school experience I very much agree, despite having been a successful A student. He does not just present the problems in modern schooling but gives a whole bunch of alternatives, some with more merit than others, but which are really ahead of his time. He talks about a learning network, before anyone thought of the internet.Highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Versatile Brush","review":"Like all Regal products, very well made. I use this particular brush for Latin feels, as the wood handle sounds great as a cross stick clave' sound. For most other work, I prefer a heavier rubber coated model.

Only complaint is that the handles could be a little thicker,otherwise highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maximum Jazz!","review":"This boxed set is one of the most complete sets of essential jazz that I have ever found.

This contains an awesome range of artists, from Maria Stader, Fritz Wunderlich and Herman Prey, Gundula Janowitz, Irmgard Seefried, to Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, with music ranging from excerpts from Handel's Messiah to traditional christmas carols. Instrumental and choral performances balance out the collection. Documentation is well-written, and the sound is excellent high-fidelity mono and stereo.

I consider this an insult to Mariano Merceron's memory! Mariano Merceron was one of Cuba's leading composers and band leaders. At one time in 1952, he featured luminaries like Beny More, Pacho Alonso and Fernando Alvarez on vocals inhis gigantic jazz band, not to mention composer and pianist Juan Bruno Tarraza on piano! To shelve all those wonderful recorded treasures by Mariano & Guests and just re-issue this microscopic compilation is totally ridiculous and shows how much the present administration at BMG Latin knows and cares about the golden era of afro-cuban music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosmo Makeover Yourself!","review":"This game is okay if you like to play around with looks.

I felt that Dr. Leir was too trusting at times, and took many statements he received as \\"the truth and nothing but the truth.\\"However, from the book and updated information, it appears that \\"something did in fact occur in Brazil.\\" The Brazilian government seems to have gone to great lengths to \\"hide\\" or, \\"white-wash\\" the entire incident.Dr. Leir made it quite clear that the conflicting information he received by various doctors and government officials only served to strengthen his conviction that a UFO crashed in a small town in Brazil, and the waves from that incident have not yet subsided!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gute Musik von Peter Schilling!","review":"This is a great compilation from Peter Schilling.

They provide the most comfortable grip on your firearm and are exeptional quality and ruggedness. I did not purchase from amazon because of the 1-2 month wait for shipping.

This book was possibly the worst written fiction book about snipers or Vietnam I have ever read. It is poorly written, there are many typographical errors, the main characters are unlikeable and poorly developed, and the non-existant plot is unbelievable.

I think it's mostly because it focuses on the Ashcroft daughters, three beautifully independent girls who have parents who allow them the freedom to choose their own husbands. There's no real need for external struggles here---internal ones aplenty abound.The Ashcroft family is every bit as loveable and eccentric as the Chases. Not only are these books filled with heart-stopping romance, there are moments that will actually make you laugh out loud.It's a wonderfully sweet story, well worth your time. Pour a cup of coffee, snuggle up in a blanket, fire up your Kindle and enjoy. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something to read when you have nothing else to do","review":"I got about halfway through this and had to prod myself a little each time to open it up.

So, I was excited that they would appear in another book. Ford didn't disappoint in this book remaining one of my favorite characters. However, Violet was almost too unsure of herself. It got a little tired her feeling like she wasn't really someone worth loving. I always feel like Royal's books could end about 60 pages sooner. Still, I'm a fan of Royal and plan to read at least the next book in the trilogy. I don't think this family quite hits the mark like the Chase family, but overall a likable group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"It sounded like an interesting premise: bookish, plain girl and handsome aristocrat fall in love in Restoration England. Some scenes were amusing, such as any scene with the adorable Jewel involved. But romantic/sexual tension? Non existant. Story line? Other than having her (Violet's)mother throw her together with Ford and her hopes of them winding up together, there was no plot to speak of. Oh, there was a worry on Violet's part that Ford would marry her for her money only and Ford's financial concerns, but it felt as if it were added as an afterthought, as if the author thought the book she was writing was too thin. This book dragged on for pages and I had to force myself to finish reading it (Once I start a book, I finish it!). It, if it were given more sexual tension and a better plot line with more obstacles would have been a better book. I'll be selling mine on Ebay or at a used book store as soon as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's multi-talented","review":"Man, little did I know that Condi(that's what insiders call her) could read music notes before she could read English. Wow! That's talent. And, the fact that she went to college(even if it was Denver) at age 15 speaks volumes in and of itself for the sheer genius of Condi. Seemingly on the road to being a world-renowned concert pianist, Condi unexpectedly(and thankfully for our sake!) altered her course of action, and that of our nation, when she changed majors and went into international affairs. The ping pong story of her throwing a fit and smashing her paddle after losing to an older boy at age 12 is just one of the many funny anecdotes that shows her zeal and fervor(and not to mention that had Joseph O'Brien laughing out loud like I was at a comedy show or something, man). Kudos to Linda Wade for writing such a revealing and riveting book - and to Condi for providing us with the massively titillating subject matter! Good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Jerry's best","review":"Having read \\"Cruel Doubt\\" and being an avid fan of Jerry's books, I ordered this book from America as it is unavailable in Australia. It took six weeks to arrive, and when I read it, I was disappointed, as the boring, repetitive narrative is extremely irritating, and unlike his other stories, in this book, Jerry's writing style is poor and he fails (for the first time in his true crime writing career) to draw the reader into the story. I am still a loyal fan of Jerry's, but I would recommend to anyone who wants to read about the Von Stein case to skip this book and instead purchase \\"Cruel Doubt\\" by Joe McGinniss, which is far superior in its portrayal of the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my first true crime reads","review":"Much of my life has been dedicated to teaching the Bible in the Church. For a number of years I taught teens and could tell you stories about how lives were changed for the better. However I do also find a fascination with how people go wrong and how evil enters and permeates a life until the worst acts possible are committed against society. It is also intriguing to learn how these people are finally apprehended. I've heard raging controversy about whether Dungeons and Dragons is a dangerous game or not. In this case, it did seem to connect to the crime, as a North Carolina college kid conspired with two friends to kill his parents for greed. His mother survives and actually refuses to condemn her son, which, to me, reflected more stupidity than compassion. In any case,I do think Bledsoe wrote the story very well. Bledsoe, McGinnis, Olsen, Rule---these are some of the best at the true crime craft, and I'll stand by that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! Awful Kids and Parents!","review":"I vastly enjoyed this book and thought Mr. Bledsoe did a marvelous job of reporting this horrible crime. What a bunch of sick kids!

One mother just ups and abandons the entire family 'cause she had to be alone to \\"think\\" (i.e. or move into an apartment with another man.) Each and everyone dropped the parenting ball big time. Christopher's mother really amazes me. To think that she dotes on the \\"child\\" responsible for arranging to have her entire family wiped out so he can get some cash. She should be a sympathetic character but to me she just comes across as over-indulgent and insipid. Hello! Your son wanted to kill you, your husband and your daughter! What are you thinking?

It's smaller than the Montana, but I like the rustic \\"farmer\\" look. It seems to work well - I filled it with oil and lit the wick, and so far the flame is steady and clean with no odor. I noticed other reviewers complaining about the smell, but I used the Ultra-Pure paraffin lamp oil from Lamplight and kept the wick low. No problem with fumes at all.The only thing I don't like about this lantern is the \\"Do not fill above this line\\" sticker on the base. I don't like leaving stickers on items, and the base isn't transparent...so I don't really know if I'm close to the line or not. Most likely I'll take the sticker off and just guess!

This album is strictly for die hard fans and audiophiles. It's pretty much the same in style as Down In The Cellar. The recording itself is impeccable , but the songs are flat out boring and all but three or four lack any hint of melody - theyre sorta flat . The Immelman ,Rainbarrel and Gina In The Kings Road are'nt terrible but would be filler on most Al Stewart lps. The only standout is Katherine of Oregon - ( a short acoustic thing ) , the other songs are so mediocre i cant still cant believe theyre part of an Al Stewart album -- then again youre allowed to lay an egg once every 35 years"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up......sorry Al","review":"With all due respect to all the Al Stewart fans out there, this CD is simply awful. As of Al's loyal fans since 1973, I can say with all due respect that this one is well below what he has done in the past.I found the music largely unremarkable and the lyrics to most of the songs uninspired.Take a listen to the \\"Immelman Turn\\" and \\"Class of 58\\" and you can't wait for them to end. The lyrics are repetive and the music just boring and very simple. I did enjoy \\"Katherine of Oregon\\" but to me this was simply the best of the worst. To my ears, these songs sound like someone is just trying to pay the bills.By all means sample some of the cuts before you buy. Better yet, pick up his \\"Between the wars\\",or \\"Russians and Americans\\". Almost any of his works are far better than this. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to hear Al again","review":"I agree with 3 of the 4 reviews thus far. This is a pleasure to listen to from start to finish. Gina definitely pulls you in from the first listen. Laurence Jubar plays some tasteful guitar licks throughout. Bottom line....listening to this cd, like with most of Al's work, brings you around the world, throughout the ages and introduces you to some interesting characters. all the elements fall into place on this CD. hats off to the Nash's for bringing this great work to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Need a Majordomo","review":"I've also been an Al Stewart fan since the mid-70's and probably have just about everything he's ever recorded. I purchased this CD at a 200 seat live show in Green Lake, WI about 8 weeks ago. It was my girlfriend's introduction to Al and we were both mesmerized throughout the entire show. One rather unlikely song became a source to total fascination, \\"Royal Courtship\\". Since then, my girlfriend is obsessed with finding her own Majordomo (a word we had to look up to make sure we knew what it meant). The originality of this one is worth the price alone. Lyrically, this disc is amongst his strongest ever. Musically it's not bad either. The highlights for me (aside from Royal Courtship) are The Immelman Turn, Mr Lair and Catherine of Oregon (both of which he previewed at the show). Judging from the amount of fun Al was having on stage, I would anticipate even more creative output in the coming years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Album By A Real Pro","review":"I've been an Al Stewart fan since I first heard his Past Present and Future album in the early 1970's. (I still have my vinyl copies of all his 70's albums).His more recent CD, A Beach Full Of Shells, is excellent. It has the great guitar work, great lyrics and the very high quality of songwriting that made long time Al Stewart fans like myself become fans in the first place and remain fans - in my case for nearly 40 years.Guitar players take note - apart from Al Stewart's excellent guitar work, this album was produced by former Wings guitarist Laurence Juber, one of the best acoustic players around today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"Stewart remains relevant in the 21st century with well crafted songs and superb melodies. A little gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying hard to like this one","review":"I am a long-time Al Stewart fan, and have seen him in concert many times. I have most of his CD's (except for some of his earliest works), but I have to say that\\"Beach Full of Shells\\" is my least favorite. With the exception of a few songs, I am having a tough time liking this one. The music is OK, but some of the lyrics are so obscure that I feel \\"left out\\" by Al's story-telling. At least with his previous CD's I know what he's referring to. (Who the heck are Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon?)Musically this CD is inconsistent. Some of the songs leave you with a melody that stays around (\\"Immelman Turn\\" and \\"Gina in the King's Road) but others like \\"Beacon Street\\" and \\"Anniversary\\" are quite forgettable and just left me uninspired. I hear that Al is supposed to be releasing a new CD in early '08 with Laurence Juber. I always look forward to new material from Al, and hope this one coming up is better than \\"Beach\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Records of 2005","review":"If for no other reason, buy this record for \\"My Egyptian Couch\\". It is the best song Mr. Stewart has ever produced, and manages to take the central themes of his career -- nostalgia, historical perspective, intimacy, and bourgeoise malaise -- and boil them into one masterwork. Not a word is wasted; not a note is out of place.It's a brilliant record (with the possible exceptions of \\"Mona Lisa Talking\\" -- kind of a poppy throwaway -- and \\"Class of '58\\" -- \\"Gina in the King's Road\\" covers the same territory much more effectively), but \\"My Egyptian Couch\\" stands supreme.Al Stewart is the best of the post-Dylan singer-songwriters. Approaching late middle age, he is at the peak of his skills. It's unfortunate that he is so little heard, and so unappreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebrate The Great Troubadour","review":"Al Stewart is a treasure. Every new Al Stewart album is very welcomed event. A Beach Full of Shells is no exception. This one works beautifully on so many levels. As with every album by Al, there are great thematic lyrics, tasteful and catchy tunes and great production work, once again from Lawrence Juber. The use of strings on several songs works very well. Highlights for me: \\"Mona Lisa Talking\\", an achingly gorgeous call for the lead character to return from street action to the one waiting at home. \\"Gina in the Kings Road\\" is a classic and worth the price of the album alone. There is a wide variation in song writing styles here from elemental rock and roll (\\"Class of 58\\"), to the folky \\"Immelman Turn\\" to the classical \\"Katherine of Oregon\\". Upon repeated listenings, each song on the album works individually and as a whole. Al Stewart remains the greatest troubadour of our time. This one is not to be missed. Bravo, Al."},{"rating":"2","title":"A THING OF BEAUTY","review":"The lilting singing, the shimmering timbre, the byzantine melodies, and the intimate yet grand visions...they're all here. While most aging singers struggle with range and tonality, Stewart seems to have slipped through \\"time passages\\" and come out at this end brand new.A Beach harks back to classic Stewart songwriting: theatrical yet rootsy with stunningly tasteful arrangements that evoke the darkly human and romantically mysterious world of The Year Of Cat. And it's no less ambitious.Al is a model to follow to all his contemporaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture Perfect","review":"Al Stewart is a master of songcraft like no other. For all of something like 45 years he has been painting portraits, landscapes, and historical scenes in impeccable English prose set to the most exquisite music. This album is no exception. But it is in fact an article of exceptional artistic quality. I have all of Al's albums and love each one of them. I would hazard to say this is my favorite of the lot. It is a polychromatic effort that comes off effortlessly. Everything just works seamlessly, beautifully. As the master himself has said \\"if it doesn't come naturally, leave it\\". A Beach Full of Shells is a perfect natural and a piece of work you most definitely don't want to leave unexamined."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is horrible!","review":"This is the worst mess I have ever seen.

The title track, like Silverchair's \\"Greatest View\\", has raw, fun, and exciting energy with catchy melodies. \\"Thinking In Reverse\\" starts with a very experimental techno feel and goes into a simple rock beat, in a very appealing way. \\"Goodnight\\" has an incredible jazz feel to it. It has the brushed snare, glocks, rhodes, bass, and with Paul's effects, makes a unusually pleasent effect on the listener. I am excitedly awaiting the CD to come out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak ending.","review":"This is, overall, a fair to middling Star Trek story; the action is good, the characterizations are better than average, the plot fair if not terribly original. The problem is, it is mostly spoiled by a rather wishy-washy, unsatisfying ending. Since I can't say much more about the ending than that without giving away major plot points, suffice it to say that I found both the climactic point AND the post-climax epilogue to be very implausible and to be a cheap out for the major focus of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly predictable","review":"I was quite disappointed with this book, as most of Dillard's other Star Trek novels have been excellent. This one was sadly predictable; neither the dialogue nor the narrative sustained my interest for long. I gave it two stars because she does some good work with a few of the characters, but overall, this is not a book I can recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enterprise Spirit!","review":"Surak's Soul I think stuck to the spirit and feel of the Enterprise show. While it could be more accurately named, Wanderer, I think it is a good idea for anyone looking for Enterprise material to read.Wanderer -- I suggested this title because the whole plot of the book revolves around a character of this name -- I won't reveal and major plot points but I take it you've read the summary? So T'Pol kills a alien and feels guilty -- the truth is, little of the plotline deals with her internal guilt over this act. So if you are expecting to recieve a deeply rooted story exploring T'Pol dealing with guilt over murder than don't expect this.Surak's Soul is a good book but really deals little with T'Pol's guilt -- her guilt plays a part but not as much as I had expected. Surak's Soul has Hoshi as one of its key focuses, so, if you are like me -- a Hoshi fan, than this is an very good book and deals more with Hoshi and T'Pol than previous Enterprise books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring novel","review":"This book was really dull, in my opinion, like many of the Enterprise episodes that have aired thus far. The only unique hook is T'Pol referencing Gandhi's stance on non-violence. Other than that, this book is a slim adventure typical of many of the troubled episodes we've seen on TV the last two years. This one's strictly for the completists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, folks! It's not too late!","review":"This book deserves a zero. Unfortunately, there is no rating that low, so I am forced to give it a one.Suffice it to say I've read fanfiction that was less contrvied and boring. It barely has anything to do with T'Pol at all. She just has ONE meditation about the issue at hand, and says \\"OK, let me give up using violence in any form because it's always wrong.\\" And we get to see nothing else about it until about page 205 (near the end of the book).And the whole Alien Mystery thing wasn't that great either.

The acting on the other hand wasn't that bad but I think it could have been better and the writing seemed a bit weak. Although with the audio it seemed like that it was a on a bit of a low side cause I had to try to figure out what sound on the TV to have it on and turning it up a bit to hear.

Comics as illustrated stories have always had to work to shrug off that ZAP POW WHAM! coat of action empty or subsumming the impact of the characters daily struggles. Some might say it was merely a bold mirror of those struggles, but still, it lacked the subtlety except in rare instances (Sandman, Bone, Y, Watchmen). In prose format, the superhero as human with just some extra skills comes right through, and no more than The Swan, who, like batman, doesn't even really have any \\"super\\" to his name.

That the real heroism is in attitude, and determination, and making the most of the abilities you have.If you're a superhero fan, this is a must-read.

Extension slot is cumbersome, and quite useless apart from 8Mb memory extension or backup of system memory modules. Which would not be necessary if unit had extra memory and NVRAM in the first place.

It has a rechargable Lithium-Ion battery instead of the hassle of AAAs. It can play MP3s without the need for a Springboard expansion module, and you can just buy a 64 MB CompactFlash card for it for $100, instead of the $250 one for the Visor. All of the Springboard modules are WAY too expensive. Who would want a phone for $300 when you can buy a better phone for $100-$200! Overall, the Aero 1550 is a great PDA that runs Windows Pocket PC.

Handspring wants its customers to buy a new Visor instead of upgrading OS.3) Visor's expansion modules (wireless phone and MP3 player) are too expensive so that you rather buy alone products with less half price.4) My computer of 2 1/2 years old doesn't have a UCB port.

There are other Visors out there with 8MB ram, but no compatability with Omnisky.If there is a way for Handspring to deliver a Platinum in a Palm V form factor, that would be great.I don't mind there not being a rechargeable solution to the Platinum because i often go on trips and when I had the Palm V, the batteries would run down.

I'm knocked out by Monk's Dream and Straight, No Chaser in particular. He plays such pretty melodies on the piano but always with a touch of dissonance (although not too much). It's as if Monk is saying, ah, it's a beautiful world but some things aren't quite right so I'm gonna add a little edge to this chord--which he does. Monk is mercurial, with swing. And the band swings right along. The interplay between Monk and Charlie Rouse is especially satisfying.

This is stride piano at its best. Almost every time I play this CD I play Bright Miss. two or three times.Bollivar Blues is one of my favorite Monk songs.

The correspondence between the two characters is very well thought out, simple and touching. These are books for all ages, entertainig and charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intriguing Read. A Memorable Experience.","review":"Reading Griffin and Sabine is a bit of a guilty pleasure, as if you are secretly reading someone else's love letters. The concept of reading postcards and peeling open letters is so unique and at once memorable. The illustrations on every page are beautiful and provide an insight to the main characters, Griffin & Sabine. This first book in the trilogy is my favourite. An opening to an intriguing, romantic and at times, heart wrenching love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular","review":"This book is incredible. The format and plot of the book is intriuging and the pictures and art that is manifested is amazing. Worth every single cent. Griffin and Sabine are understood better through their writing then could be possible through a description of them. Bantock displays his creation and depth through this Extraordinary Correspondence and becomes his characters, describing each emotion with the utmost care."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare combination of beauty, art and writing.","review":"How many times have you heard the expression \\"It has everything in it\\"? Well, this book is closely related to that phrase. In an original format of postcards and letters, you have to take out of their envelopes, the book reveals to you the mysterious story of Griffin and Sabine. It all starts from a postcard sent to a lonely and strange artist in London, from a woman he never saw before in his life. To all you chat-loving who enjoy the idea of chatting with strangers you've never met, see how it really becomes magical. The book is brilliantly illustrated and you can always go through it again, discovering details you missed the last time. I can give you my word, that finishing it will live you with wide opened mouth, crying for more, and buying copies to your love ones, so that they can enjoy it too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"I loved this...everything about it appealed to me. What a wonderful sense of mystery! The illustrations are fantastic, and it is such a pleasure to read the letters and postcards, pulling them out of their envelopes. The first two books were given to me by a wonderful friend...thank you, Dorothy :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative Story Telling","review":"I have been recommened this book by an online friend of mine. Griffin and Sabine was my very first experience in off line interactive reading. I very much enjoyed it. Great idea and such an innovative way of presenting a love story between two artists. Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of a different color","review":"This is the second epistolary novel I read this week. This one is far more aesthetically pleasing--both of the writers are artists, and the letters have tiny envelopes glued to the pages. It makes you want to read this book very carefully, to treat it reverently. I found this book very emotionally satisfying, although I want to read it through a second time and decide how appropriate each of various endings are. It's Magical Realism with a British bent, and although it's not a terribly long read it can still be involving. Take your time--savor it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"After hearing people rave about this book I finally shelled out the dough to buy it. What a stupid book. The art wasn't \\"great\\" or even intersting and the story was dull. BORING, don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I ever disappointed.","review":"I belong to a collage artist group and everyone talked about these books and altering them. Now I see why they wanted to alter them, to give the pages & story some character. The story was simplistic and without imagination and the pictures, we all do so much better. There are much better books out there, don't know what all the fuss is about this one. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird, not worth your money","review":"These books are too weird. They left me feeling dark and strange, like reading about possession (isn't that really what they're about? Be honest!). Don't bother to waste your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voyeur's dream; beautifully written and hauntingly illustrated.","review":"The other reviewers have done a fine job discussing the content so I won't regurgitate that. But, this interesting book and its subsequent volumes are the bread and butter of any voyeur who likes to watch and think about the actions that are unfolding while staying a safe distance away. The details of the story are fleshed out nicely in little bits and pieces that you ascertain while reading the letters and postcards and as one reads it you discover just how sophisticated the characters truly are.Being a scholar of film, I admit that the voyeur comes with the territory but these books take that to an entirely new level and as an owner of the entire series, whenever I find myself feeling worn out by the insipid storytelling that seems so typical of current literature (both written and televisual), I turn to these texts and feel mentally, and even somewhat spiritually refreshed."},{"rating":"2","title":"an intriguing correspondence with a mysterious ending","review":"As I read other reviews of this book, I am a little confused as to what everyone thinks of the ending of the series. Especially whatever person said he didnt care if he understood it or not. I loved the books, I just wish there was some other kind of commentary on the conclusion of it besides my own...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one goes up to 11","review":"I wanted to rate this book at 11 but the computer wouldn't let me. Nick Bantock is a brilliantly imaginative author and artist. I LOVE the GRIFFIN + SABINE books. They are the sort of thing you can look at over and over again and always see something new. The combination of art and imaginary mail makes these books richer than I ever thought was possible.Why is there not more great stuff like this out there?"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than five stars. Unique and wonderful.","review":"I've never seen anything like this book and the others in the series. It's been years since I first discovered this book and it is still just as stunning and delicious as the first time I read it. If you are adventurous and imaginitive and just a little bit 'out there' you will adore this discovery in letters."},{"rating":"1","title":"In My Opinion","review":"I was very pleased with the movie when I received it. It was in excellent condition and played perfectly. The movie was suspenseful and the actors were great. I highly recommend you to purchase this movie and/or others from this seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising!","review":"I watched this movie mainly because I like Guy Pearce. However, the young actress Ruth Bradley is unknown to me. The movie was interesting and very shocking at the depth of hatred and jealousy of Ms. Bradley's character toward the actress that played Guy Pearce's daughter in the movie. I don't know who she is either. But Ms. Bradley's vitriol was so shocking to me in scene where she strangles and you could see the saliva dripping from her mouth. I didn't expect that. I don't know what else to say. I only know I couldn't watch that scene again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I heard 10 seconds of it and loved it","review":"Though it may only be 38 minutes long, Our Point Of Departure is a real good album. This entire album is one continous song (it's an instrumental), all at the same tempo, split into 6 different tracks. What i enjoyed about this is the drums (african voodoo drums are an influence) and the amazingly crazy horns. This is a CD truly worth the money. And i'm not sure about you, but it gives me a certain feeling of power knowing and liking a band which nobody's ever heard of."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Not Sure About This","review":"I am a little sceptical about No Doubt having a box set because I feel a box set should have the music spanning the bands career or the prime of their career. I like the No Doubt albums(except rock steady)alright. But this band seems a little young for a box set just yet. It all seems a plan to get a little more ca$h. I would think the set a little thin on material since they have only had five album releases. This would have been kind of like The Beatles realseing a box set in the mid sixities. Some great music?yes, career/prime spanning box set?no"},{"rating":"1","title":"missing soooo much","review":"as a no doubt fan since 93, i find that this set hardly lives up to it's name. where are the singles from \\"beacon street\\" ? (and their b sides?!?), where are the early tracks from the various ska compilations they appeared on? where are tracks from the early demo tapes?? certainly these things would be of great interest to all no doubt fans to have compiled but no, it seems this only packs what the mainstream audience already has, with a few things - an 80's cover and a few remixes - disguised as \\"bonuses.\\" the videos and the live stuff salvage it somewhat, but all in all \\"boom box\\" is only scratching a really big surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Entertianing Games, Nice Graphics,","review":"I love these Hoyle Games. I have the previous versions of card and board games. Besides the fun games and pleasing graphics I like the fact that you don't necessarly need the CD to play. You won't get the music (which can be a little annoying like most games) the opponant characters don't talk (they can be repetive and annoying too). The games are fun though and you can play them all with or without the disc. Also, if you play on the internet the graphics stay the same. Big, bright and colorful instead simple and boring. I just ordered casino after playing the demo from the disc. The best part about the new releases for 2000/2001 is the face maker. You can make your character look like you or fun and crazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"why was this book published?","review":"words can't describe how much i despise this book. I actually threw it against the wall before it made its way to the garbage can. I read 3 pages. If you want to hear inane commentary of every single cognitive process this guy had over the course of his childhood then go for it. I doubt the author has recovered at all from his abuse and seems to desperately try to turn his tragedy (whatever it was) into something interesting. Very self indulgent. I felt as if he was dictating a psychotherapists cold analysis of himself to the reader. If you are looking for insight into the patterns and recovery of abuse, look elsewhere. Read Judith Herman's \\"Trauma and Recovery\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"These stories are polished like eight Zen poems by a haiku master. They shine, and should not be missed. In each story something AMAZING happens in midair... that's all I will tell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The Lost of Pie Making Made Easy is another gem with more historic black and white photos, old-time advertisements, tips from pie makers and of course, recipes, Swell shows us another winner!With Swell's passion and knowledge of the simpler times, or so we believe, she has created this book filled with wonderful recipes, such as: Shoofly, Louisiana Peanut and Concord Grape pie.For all pie lovers and historic cooking lovers, pick up this book too. Swell's pie book is sure to please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even I can make pie!","review":"I purchased this book several years ago. Being a pie-phobe, I figured I might have a chance with this title. I have made MANY pies from this and they have all turned out GREAT! Try the Lemon Sponge pie.... outrageous. Another fun one is mock pecan. Watch people's faces when you serve it. I like that it gives some good basic recipes and sugar ranges, in case you don't like your pie as sweet. I'm still in search of the perfect pie crust technique (the problem is mine), but the crusts here are a great place to start! Terrific book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for grandma!","review":"Looking for the right gift for the children's grandmother who loves to bake especially pies.

It makes my bathroom smell wonderful all the time without being lit. This is a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now for something quite the same","review":"No better way to celebrate 32 years of Python with this set!! For me, the second tape is best. New skits, the Mayday special (for some reason, the Fish Slapping Dance is so much better on here than it was on the Flying Circus), and a look at those musical masterpieces. What disappointed me was they didn't take a look at \\"The Penis Song\\" from \\"Meaning Of Life,\\" but they did spend time on The Lumberjack Song, so I cannot complain. Now stop that, that's silly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PhDs only need apply","review":"I appreciated this book for the insights it was able to give me on a city that I will soon visit, but I found the writing style dry and overburdened with unnecessary details. Several times, I fell asleep trying to make it through the reading. Other times, I would lower the book in exasperation and say to myself, \\"Is this Grandin's dissertation?\\" The book is very informative, but it is not an accessible read for the layperson."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only cops looked like this!","review":"Tokyo Blue plays out like any buddy cop movie with a pair of mismatched partners. It just so happens that those partners happen to be two drop dead gorgeous women. As an anime fan I noticed how Mika and Rin acted a lot like Kiyone and Mihoshi from the Tenchi Muyo series, but with a decidedly sexier twist. Mika's the more serious of the two while Rin is the entertaining goofball. The plot isn't anything to write home about but the verbal banter between Mika and Rin alone is unquestionably worth the price of admission. On the technical side of things I wish a DVD version of this would come out with the original Japanese language track (though the English isn't bad). The sound needs work because I found myself having to turn up the volume significantly. I'd recommend this one over the sequel. Mika and Rin are definitely the two sexiest cops I've ever seen. If you love cop movies, action and beautiful women, then this one's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could give it zero stars","review":"Where do I begin with the rating the Fiesta diet? For starters, it is junk food, feeding your rodents garbage may be healthier. Kaytee attempts to make their diet \\"nutritionally complete\\" by providing a pellet mixed in with all of the nuts. However, just like small children, most rodents eat the fattening nuts and corn (which holds little nutritional value) before eating the healthy pellet mixes.If you have rats, guinea pigs, or other small animals, feed them Oxbow. I have fed my rat girls Oxbow for ages and it is much better for them. If you insist on buying Kaytee brand food, buy their forti-diet pellets. At least that isn't as fattening, though it is still not the highest quality of ingredients. Rats also do well on Harlan Tekland, yet it is very pricey and difficult to find in stores.If people disagree with this harsh but true review, ask any local vet or true rat breeder. They will tell you that any of the Fiesta diets are terrible for any animal."},{"rating":"1","title":"3/16\\" diameter?","review":"This hose is extremely thin and has an outer diameter of 3/16\\".

I still listen to it quite often. The criticisms one may have read of it not being very worthwhile because it breaks no new ground strike me as...well, as snobbish. Yes, it has some older songs on it, but \\"Thelonious\\" (for example) still sounds good and Monk has rarely hammered a keyboard like he does on this rendition. These are Monk's own songs, for crying out loud, and he obviously felt he had more to explore. Thelonious was such an innovator and so far ahead of his time, I don't understand how someone can criticize his last few Columbia discs because he wasn't breaking new ground when he'd been doing that very thing for close to 20 years.This CD still swings, and for my money, that's the highest praise possible. Monk was a tormented genius who gave us wonderful music. I for one appreciate his gift. Listen, swing with Monk and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nightmare","review":"The software for this scanner is a joke. Tech support is no help.

The story, called A Riot of Goldfish, is both beautiful and bizarre at the same time, and not to be missed. Many of the photos are printed across both pages, which is somewhat annoying at first, but the binding on this book is really strong (stitched) so don't be afraid to really reef on it and open it up so you can see the beautiful pictures.

The plot is superficial, the novel not deep, but the writing style is enchanting.One chapter - and all are short - is a wonderful description of the decaying building. Closing my eyes, I could picture this edifice along one of the small Roman streets.This is a book to keep and re-read for sheer pleasure from time to time. It is fun.

Van Adler was sadly, a waste of time. The only redeeming quality to the book is the plight of preserving the artistic treasures of Rome. All too often because of corruption, greed and apathy, many of Rome's finest artistic landmarks and works get lost to oblivion. Another illumnating aspect is you see how depraved some priests are and all the cases of priests abusing children don't seem as far fetched when you read this book. The plot was convoluted and the characters totally un-sympathetic.

I got this book because I thought the title seemed clever. However, the title is about as clever as this thin, little book gets. The author is self-absorbed, nave, and not a very good writer. I thought it seemed fishy when there was no publisher listed but now I understand that Norton's book is merely the work of a bitter college student. It saddens me that in a time when it is so hard to get published; the works of child are being sold on Amazon. Moreover, it sounds as if all of Norton's friends wrote the reviews on this website.

It would also have been useful to have more example templates and processes.What also annoyed were the basic mistakes e.g. How to correctly number a branch revision (it should normally be parentRev.BranchNumber.RevisionOnBranch, not parentRev.RevisionOnBranch).I think the editors must take a significant portion of the blame for failing to help the author deliver a more readable book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth the money","review":"If you are working for a company that makes software, chances are you have a guy who is assigned the task of release management. Do yourself a favor and go talk to this guy -- you'll probably get better insights than this book has to offer after draining $50 bucks out of your pocket. I only gave it 2 stars since the author touches on the right topics but fails to deliver useful content.He delves into one specific style of release management and engineering (probably what the author's company does) and does not talk too much about alternate styles at all -- and the release methodology suggested by the book is less elegant than some of the release processes I've seen.And as a bonus, a few blank pages serves as the index for the book.

I have searched on numerous occasions for texts that provide a unified perspective on these fields. Now I finally have it. The book does a great job of stepping through the mine-fields of SCM, defect tracking, and project management which have collectively been nothing but a disaster in my experience in about 6 software companies. While the book does not go into a low level of detail on the SCM models, as I would like I believe that it does a good overall job of the fields. Hope we can see more from this author in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview","review":"This book provides the clarion difference between much \\"evangelical\\" thought and the biblical basis and truths of salvation of Jesus Christ and Him Crucified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babies are not sinners!","review":"I was surprised to learn that the author believes that babies and young children are sinners, and needed to be sprinkled with water to enter Heaven. This is not what the Bible teaches and is not a true reflection of the character of God. Sinners are those who are capable of believing and repenting, and not innocent infants. Sin is not passed on through Adam or anyone else, but we are all responsible for our own sin (Ezek.18:20). Baptism is by immersion is clearly taught in many passages such as Romans 6:3-4 and Colossians 2:12."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is lovely and I am sure that my daughter will love her for Christmas!","review":"She is very cute!

Works great for 4-6 months (our typical use is once a week)and then just fails to turn on. Oster replaced the first very promptly, no questions asked. However, the wife is so fed up we don't intend to try to replace this second one. I did not buy on Amazon, but checked their web-site to see if there were similar problems. No reviews on this model, but we all had a laugh when we read the review for the Oster 4721. Same experience and frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacco and Vanzetti are a Lesson to All","review":"These letters are extraordinary, the narrative along with the letters paint a picture of the times in the early 20th century. They are so relevant, even today. These letters make us think, and examine our lives and our prejudices. Their guilt or innocence is irrelevant; the real question is, can two Italian immigrants who are self proclaimed anarchists, in a Country that claims to defend all beliefs, get a fair trial for a murder they claim they never committed? Read the book, the answer is painfully no. And it makes you think, can certain immigrants today, perhaps wrongly accused of terrorism, get a fair trial? I am afraid of what the answer might be. This book is a must read for anyone who claims the Constitution and Bill of Rights are the most important documents ever written in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"read more like a sampling of anecdotes than a literary masterpiece","review":"I enjoyed the throwaway tidbits about life in Flushing Queens and adopting babies in Nahtzee-infested Paraguay (I had NO IDEA!) but I bought this book because the blurb promised an incisive look at Upper West Side culture and that was not the case at all. This book was kind of nothing so why would there be so much hype about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was alright","review":"I didn't really like this book 'coz I felt it was far too \\"planned\\".

You are left hanging, trying to figure out what is going on.In addition, random words are capitalized and it is written using short sentences, like that in some childrens' book or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a very confusing book.","review":"This was the most confusing book I have ever read. I don't recomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing..","review":"After a long time I read a book by an Indian author and it was really disappointing. Initially, the characters are not described well, there are too many of them, and it seems like it's all over the place. There is no constant train of thought and it's very confusing to follow the book in the beginning.The book is about a girl, who travels to America after the death of her husband and meets people while she lives in America. Its does not show the true picture of ones struggles and suffering - she seems to meet someone all the time that is willing to take care of her and help her. I think the author was not able to get the message across to the readers, if there ever was one. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mukherjee wrote a disgusting, bland and worthless book","review":"Jasmine, at points, sounds like a soap opera that no one watches because it is so aweful. This book makes everything sound so miserable and blown out of shape. If a man and woman meet, then they are secretly in love, the woman is pregnant, or they kill each other. This book is pointless and rambles on about how different America is from India as if she expected them to be exactly identical. As for Jasmine's character, who has about 10 names in the book, she is a bland fool. No characters are ever developed in this book and they all die prematurely. To add to that, the ending is unrealistic, and reminds me of the end of Pearl Harbor. Jasmine's final decisions are without reason, and seem faulty even to the SIMPLE READER! The only reason this book didn't get one star is that she didn't make any spelling mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"I had to read this book for school and i hate itIt had to have been the most pointless immoral book ever.The women just sleeps around and runs from her problems, and she killed a man and got off with nothingWHAT THE HELLDont ever read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"The only sections of this novel that are worth reading are the those that take place in India when Jasmine is a child-bride. The rest of the \\"novel\\" reads like a diary entry...nothing much happens after Jasmine moves to Iowa and I found myself not really caring about the characters.It seems that Ms. Mukherjee should try and write more than one draft of her novels before sending it to her publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top ten.... worst books I've ever read.","review":"Jasmine is a quirky unspectacular novel that completely failed to capture an audience. I just couldn't help but not like the main character. It comes off as a sob story, of a woman who simply bounces from whatever can make her life easier to the next sucking the life out of everything she encounters. The two word sentences and abysmal flow of the book makes it a surprise that I ever finished it. A terrible novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daring, Colorful, Compassionate Novel","review":"This is definitely a delightful novel to read. It provides a compelling mixture of east and west. The underlying theme of the novel is that life moves on and time never stops. Mukherjee has done complete justice in delivering this message acorss. Jasmine is an absorbing tale of human struggle in an alien environment. A Good Read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex telling of the east-west culture conflict","review":"This book was really amazing. I am an Indian woman, who has lived in Queens and I have to say that Mukherjee's telling of the story, even while being fantastical, seemed so 'real' and plausible. Excellent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defines 'American'","review":"I agree that a ten is a lofty rating...but this book deserves it. Mukherjee writes with such emotion and such power that certain scenes from the book will stay in my mind forever. This book examines the American experience with wit, heartbreak, love and fear.

I've never been in need of a more powerful printer until now. I decided that the HP double-sided automation was attractive and the quality would be needed. I've also never heard of paper jams until I bought this either. The print quality was great, although getting paper jams every third print is ridiculous. I fumbled with paper, different weights, the paper travel through the machine, everything that they didn't feel you should be warned about in the handbook. Well, the printer would've been nice, but I don't have time to fix jams every third page or consectutive page. Something else is better out there and I'm sure I could pay $... for it without dealing with getting jammed! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has some problems","review":"The print quality of this unit is great.

But, he is the opitome of commercial rappers, people who believe that swearing alot and talkng about weed smoking and shooting people is art. It's pretty much what his earlier albums were about. It's not bad for him, but there seems to be no artistic growth. The only song I like is \\"la-la-la,\\" it's a ganster-turned rapper tale that DOESN'T take itself seriously. He's honest and doesn't look for pity, like DMX or BIG. That's what Redman does best, telling gangster-type tales in a joking manner. But still, it gets old and like most rappers, he needs to expand his mind and subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redman must have smoked too much weed since his last release","review":"Redman used to be capable of a tight rhyme.

I will tell you why because people over the past ten years have lost there taste in music. Ever since rap became some popular pathetic fad everyone what's to be a rapper now. And the music is by far the worst I have ever heard. Take Redman for example......how does he make music? Just like all the other immature rap artists out there. (That's if you want to call them artists) They simply don't have any talent or any brains. Anyone can program an electronic drum beat them speak in tongues real fast.If you want my opinion I think this album is by far the worst piece of crap I have ever heard, but then again all rap albums sound the same so they all sound like sh*t!!If you want music that has talent and style buy a Yanni or Puya cd.

It sits now. Nobody is interested in it.Another trophy to mistakes I've made."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a thoughtful unbiased account","review":"I think that this is a biography worth reading whether you are a Gore supporter or not. The author has done extensive research and writes an evenhanded account of Gore's life. Gore comes out as a man like any other with his own share of conflicts. He does not come out badly. This is not a puff biography or a book intended to villify. It is well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good background reading","review":"This biography does just give lip service to the politician's childhood. The author explains the world in which Al Gore grew up. It describes pieces of his father's life in a way which shows you where Al picked up many of his mannerisms. You will see where the candidate came from.After reading through this, I know that Al Gore is not as Green as his book would lead you to believe. He does listen to businesses and has accepted money. This is no different than any other candidate. This book brings all of this to your attention so that you can make your own informed decision.The tone and flow are good. I had no trouble following the narrative or understanding what point the author was trying to make. Too often, an author has his own axe to grind and steps away from informing the reader so that the reader can make his or her own decision. Turque's style makes this a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT fairly written","review":"If your an Al Gore fan, you probably won't be able to finish this book. While its historic component is detailed and its research seems thorough (hence, two stars), its written in a completely biased style. The title itself suggests that Al Gore is merely a man that's calculated to the point of having no sincerity; he's invented his persona, he hasn't 'earned' it, according to the author. This book is not non-fiction in its writing style. It makes presumptions that lead the reader to believe that the author knows what Al Gore was actually thinking at the time. Do not read, certainly, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bone house blues","review":"As I sailed along through this book I found it most enjoyable until the end. The bitter end.

Monitoring of the bandwidth and voltage indicates switching between 0 and 1 volt is occurring quickly and within specifications. The wires are different colors than the OEM harness, this is common with aftermarket sensors. The buyer should note that it will take a little while (few days) for your car to adjust to the new sensor readings, especially if your old sensor was slow in response or broken. Our car ran rich during this break-in period while the ECU adjusted to the new readings.The longevity of this sensor should be comparable to OEM. Time will tell, and this review will be updated accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla goes to kiddie land.","review":"This film marks a period of sharp decline in the G series. Stock footage is used extensively and does not mesh well with the new spfx scenes. Minya looks as awful as ever and the new monster Gabera is one silly creation. The score plays pretty harshly on the ears(calling Akira Ifukube!) as well. That said, the story works pretty well for children. There is much that they can find to enjoy in this film whereas, most adults and older G fans will be left cold by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY BOTHER!!!!!!!

This is more of a kids movie than a part of the original Godzilla story until \\"Godzilla 1985\\". It has absolutely nothing to do with any of the other Godzilla films. About half of it is used footage from previous Godzilla films such as \\"Son of Godzilla\\", the rest is just set around some day-dreaming kid and not the \\"Big-Guy\\" himself.

It won Best Picture of 1969. No bad dubbing, Buy it. Treasure it. Feel it. Feel the compasion. It inspired George Lucas to do Star Wars. It gave ideas to James Cameron's ALIENS and Titanic.

This movie has little to do with Godzilla, except for appearances in a boy's dream.The boy dreams he sees Godzilla and his son, Minya. Godzilla is teaching Minya how to fight. It's supposed to be heart-warming and funny, but it's just painful to witness. The boy learns from Minya to be courageous and resourceful and, in doing so, defeats a pair of foolish criminals. It's sorta like Home Alone, without Joe Pesci or M Culkin -- and it's hard to sit through this one, even for Godzilla fans.Here's what you need to know:Godzilla's Revenge has gained distinction by being ranked as one of the worst films of all time for its shameless use of stock footage. The new footage consists of a fight with Giberah, but this new kaiju is lame and looks hastily produced. Not enough Godzilla, too much Minya. One star seems harsh, so...two stars for you, Minya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla's Revenge","review":"Godzilla's Revenge was not a good Godzilla movie.

If you think Godzilla is cheesy then bring some crackers, 'cause this one is full of fromage! The entire movie (plot, characters, music) is extremely annoying! My 4-year old loves it though. My main critique (besides the obvious) is that there are some disturbing scenes when the bank robber chases the little boy with a knife.

If you can find a cheap copy somewhere, it's worth a laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ranks alongside most Saturday morning cartoons.","review":"Summary: Godzilla and Son help show a little kid how to stand up for himself.Certainly the most different of all Godzilla's films.

The worst one, but great fights!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total misfire...and that's putting it nicely.","review":"This movie is an enormous letdown after its magnificent predecessor, 1968's \\"Destroy All Monsters\\". While the idea of seeing the world through the Godzilla Universe via the eyes of a child is an interesting one, the overabundant use of stock footage from previous films frankly kills the movie outright. This is an unfortunate waste of the talents of a director like Ishiro Honda, who no doubt was looking for a way out, especially when his close friend and SFX genius Eiji Tsubaraya died midway through production. Very young children who have not seen any previous Godzilla movies might enjoy this, especially since the protagonist is in their age group. Other than that, this flick has very little appeal at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny but great for children","review":"When I was a child, this movie was the junk. Me and my friends used to love watching this movie. Now that I'm older, I look back on it and think, \\"What was so good about this movie?\\" The fact is, this one was more child-oriented, which explains why it was so cheesy. The only thing that sucked about this movie, even for a family movie, is the fact that they used a lot of old stock footage (every battle is taken from older Godzilla movies. On top of all that, they really slaughtered the battle between Godzilla and Spiga, which originally ended in Spiga being burned to death by Godzilla and his son).

Only in The beginning with some stock footage from destroy all monsters and it wasn't even that long. It was no more than stock footage and poor special effects.

It slides in and out easily, and as others have said previously, can simply fall out of it's mount inside the bar, rendering the device completely useless. So, after adjusting the bar to the proper height, I drilled two holes through the bar and bolted the inner tube in place. Now, even if the original peg fails, there are two bolts to take the shear stress. Also, the bushing on the inner tube (to keep it from wobbling) is only loosely press fitted. I applied adhesive and reinserted it, now it remains in place firmly. With these changes, I attempted to break down my front door without success.

To top it all off, the extending pipe has so much wiggle room that it unlocks itself when I nudge the bottom of the device against the door to secure it. I have to re-lock the thing and carefully push it against the door, otherwise it unlocks itself again.I'm honestly surprised by the numerous positive reviews for this product.

If you forget to lock your door, you can force the door open even with the bar in place. The pin will not hold.Continuously wedging the tool between the floor and your doorknob causes the doorknob to slide up on the door - you may need to tighten the entire mechanism.Finally, the concept is flawed - I won't post how, but it can be defeated in seconds.Overall while this product does give you some confidence, it is not really very effective due to the flaws - you may want to look at a competing product such as the Door Club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product.....but","review":"I thought this was a good product but it arrived with a part missing so I had to return it.

However after only a week's use, the black plastic ring that the inner tube rides in came out of the larger tube. This allowed the upper tube to cant over on an angle, and as a result the small pin (used to adjust the height) would barely hold on in the adjustment hole, and often would actually not hold. This renders the product useless as sold.I had to figure out what height I wanted to set the bar at, then drill a hole completely through and install a bolt and nut. It works now but.... no more adjustability. Small changes in the manufacture of this item would create a GREAT product.

For example, during the day, as my home faces the street, it is not likely that anyone would try to gain entry to my home while I'm away. But, my back door is hidden from most people's sight, so securing that door is very important. And, that's what I do with it. Have bought 4 of these, given one to a family member who travels away from his family on occasion. Received one recently that arrived with a broken yoke that fits at the door knob.

It is made of plastic on each end, that was cracked. I attempted to repair it so that I could have some use of it, but it was made with such inferior material, that I felt that it would probably not secure a main door enough. In order to put the mechanism in the locked position, there is a silver pin that goes through a hole. The base of the bar is made of metal.

I have something similar and all my old roommates would borrow my door jam when I was gone. It just adds a little extra security which is comforting. This is by far one of the cheapest prices I have seen for this product. It shipped extremely quickly - it arrived before I expected.(Wrapping this item is tricky. Have the wrappying extend about 2\\" from the bottom foot and then about 4 - 5 inches from the top. Wrap the paper around several times - it won't look extremely smooth. Fold in the bottom paper - like a normal gift - so it can stand flat. Then time a ribbon around the top and fringe the exta on top.

My next door neighbor has one, and her 300lb dad couldn't get through the door when it was engaged! Now that's not to say that with enough determination, strength, and time that someone can't at some point get through the door - but it will give you more than enough time to call the cops, get a weapon, and hide or exit from another entrance. No one will want to make that much noise to get through your door or take that much time. I love this product, it definitely gives me a piece of mind and I highly recommend it - especially to those in apartments, dorms, or live alone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Does What I Need","review":"I gave this four stars instead of five, because although it does what I need, it's not perfect. It is certainly not a substitute for a triple-bolted steel door. And I agree with another reviewer that if someone really, really wants to get in, they will.Both my doors are of heavy construction and dead-bolted. I wanted a second line of defense in case the would-be intruder defeated the dead bolt. This unit does it. What I'm hoping for is, now faced with another line of defense, the guy will just go away, since he has no way of knowing if there's also a third line.Can this unit be broken by brute force? Probably so - I don't know. But I do know that in the process, he's going to have to make an awful lot of noise.In short, this unit isn't a total solution in and of itself. But's an inexpensive additional line of defense. After I tested my first unit, I immediately ordered a second one for the other door."},{"rating":"1","title":"only works on tiled floors--and not too well","review":"We purchased a LOT of these, in order to protect our many exterior doors. We tested them out on every door, and both myself and my husband were able to push through the doors with these on every door but the one with a tiled floor--and even that didn't seem like it would hold up to much more force. I had really high hopes for this product, so needless to say, I am extremely disappointed. I weigh 120 and I was able to push through this thing--it is pretty much worthless. The problem is that the button that holds the bar at different heights is too short and flimsy--when pushed against, the button goes in and the bar collapses. The foot is also not large even to provide enough surface area to evenly support the weight an intruder will place on it. I would use this in a hotel room as back up (although I'd feel just as safe with a chair), but I'm looking for something else for my home--unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"These bars work!","review":"I bought five of these after reading other positive reviews. I add mine to those. These are light, solid, adjustable and easy to use. I have them protecting two doors and three windows, for which they work equally well. It took me about 10 minutes to install them all. They are made of aluminum so they are light a very strong. They appear to work equally well on carpet and hard floors. The rubber boot seems to grip very well. I believe it would take a lot of force to get through these. Hopefully enough for an intruder to think, \\"I'll go someplace else easier to get in to!\\" I recommend this product. Fair price, good Master Lock quality and they do what they advertise.

I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The pieces at the end of the bar is made of plastic, the part where it sits under the door handle breaks off easily. The locking mechanism of the bar is just a tiny metal knob you press into and fits it into multiply holes. It doesn't work well with carpet. Don't bother wasting money on this door jam, spent the extra money on the higher end bars.On the other hand, it works better as a charley bar for sliding patio doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOOR GOT KICKED IN - USELESS - cheap construction","review":"I braced my door with this and had the stopper braced properly. A solid cement step held the bottomw firmly in place. Sure enough, the same person who broke in came back 5 nights later and kicked my back door in with this device in place. I'm not happy at all. I trusted this device to protect my home and now I've lost another $1000 in belongings. If you want to brace a door, get yourself long bolts and brace your door with a 2X6 and screw the hardware in on each side to hold it up. I'm not sure the name of the metal pieces but they simply are used to baricade the door."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 251D was better","review":"I looked at the new and improved 265D model and it does not compare to the 251D that has a pressure lever. Someone mentioned that a 2 x 4 or a piece of oak cut to fit in the sliding patio door track was better. A 2 x 4 can be stained to match the door trim.The 251D could be inserted in the sliding patio door to keep intruders from lifting the patio door out of the track. That was a nice feature of the 251D model.Someone at MasterLock did not test it very well.The 251D was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE READ: Retired MMA, had to really try to bust this","review":"I read all the reviews before I tried this product. I am very concerned and picky shopper. I thought I would give this a try. I believe the key to this product is the flooring you are using this on. The foot on the lock works excellent on title or wood. I would not recommend this product on carpet.One key point to remember...the farther away you have the base from the door the less strength it has. Try to get it between 70 degrees and 80 degrees. I was able to knock it out of place at 50 and 60. I normally do not worry about safety; however, I am a heavy sleeper. I can fend for myself but I have to hear it first. Let me know if you found this helpful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely useless !!","review":"The silver button that locks the bar length in place slips out of the hole VERY easily, allowing the bar to collapse. I tested this bar by simply leaning with my full weight (220 lbs) on the outside of the door, and the button gave way, allowing the door to open freely. This little button BARELY makes it through the hole on the bar. Rather than return this thing, I am going to use my drill to make some modifications, and use another metal pin to lock the bar in place. Also, the foot of this thing slips pretty easily, even when moistened and pressed against a high-friction floor.Master Lock should be very ashamed of this piece of garbage. It will negatively influence my future security purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"ITEM FAILED TO WORK - Door got kicked in - Security bar BROKE.","review":"I bought this after my house was broken in to. Sure enough a week later they kicked in my back door and I had this brace firmly planted so that it could not slip out and they broke it with a few good kicks to the door.

I am glad I did as one string of the carousel lights did not light up and there is no way to fix this yourself. Also for $113 this was very poorly made. The entire music box is cheap plastic and some of the plastic on the top of the box was deeply gouged and scratched.

I specifically went to the web to find this two-disc collection that I found was much more indicative of their career together. I am no Simon and Garfunkel expert. I cannot spout about certain tracks left out or others added that to someone else do not make the grade. I found this collection to contain all the hits I could run off in my head.

Their father was Indian, apparently, and taught them lots of things, like how to gather and smoke loco-weed, which their new friends rather like, actually. This has some odd and spooky elements to it which are unfortunately overshadowed by an innate goofiness that keeps creeping into the film at all the wrong times, and that includes the kazoo/vaudeville/jaw harp music that will leave you wanting to rip your hair out. In short, I don't think this film knows exactly what it wanted to be, therefore I really wasn't sure what to make of it. 2 out of 10, had potential but squandered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My families 1st computer pinball experience","review":"Being the only computer pinball experience my sons and I have-its absolutely fantastic.

The mulimedia section is a farcical - 10 songs and some pathetic games.

Tails is the reason I started playing Sonic videogames in the first place, so I think it's great that he plays a pretty big role in saving the world (though of course you have to give Sonic most of the credit, since he's the title character). Knuckles fans will be pleased to see that he helps out as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is awesome!!!!","review":"I have always been a huge fan of Sonic. And when I heard about this movie I couldn't wait to get it. Once I finally had it I was so excited and watched it that night.When the movie was over one side of me was saying \\"That was super cool\\" and the other side was saying \\"It wasn't really what I expected.\\" First off, the Movie itself is really good, if you watch it a second time you will probably like it better because then you pick up that it is supposed to be a funny and action-packed movie. The voices are pretty cool, But I kinda wish they had Ryan Drummond doing the voice of Sonic(voice actor for sonic games)All in all, if your a huge fan of Sonic, this one is a keeper"},{"rating":"2","title":"About this movie :)","review":"This movie had everything a slightly weird-but-funny comedy needs: A crazy guy, explosions, super glue, and hats. Knuckles's expression was so funny when that robot blew up in his face! The only bad part was the voices. I almost choked when I heard Knuckles's voice!I reccomend this movie for ages 7+ or else they won't understand half of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"sara the sayan","review":"how could they not put sally acorn in this movie.if all the smart people noticed sara,they must have saw her tail (whitch is the tail of a sayan from the show dragon ball z) <LONG LIVE PRINCE SONIC AND PRINCES SALLY ACORN,MAY THEIR KIND HEARTS BEE WED FOR ALL ETERNITY> L.N.S 777"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay...","review":"It's not anime. I can tell you that. It represents more of Kid's WB or FOX Family than something from Japan. It's not that bad, don't get me wrong, but it needs better dubbing...by far. Tails kinda sounds like a Rugrat, and Knuckles sound too hick. The story line is...bad. The end battle is great, having Knuckles and Tails take turns flirting with the Presidents daughter, but the action scenes need help. Sonic appears to need help more than Tails does, and Knuckles does lots of fighing. It's reccommended for Elementary aged kids, but pre-teens may find it childish. However it goes, anyone who likes Sonic the Hedgehog video games or the animated series will find it somewhat entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fun of it","review":"When I looked at the scene of the city of where it took place itlooked like an old Rio de Janerio, brazil where this sonic the hedgehog movie took place.

The animation isn't the best but it's not as bad as the \\"Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog\\" series. The English dub isn't that good at all. I don't think Sega ever intended on having Sonic sound annoying at all. Sonic and Knuckles are NOT best friends, they're rivals. The fact that Tails is a technical genius is addressed as well as him being immature. The whole rival angle between Sonic and Knuckles does get addressed at the end of the movie making for a rather humorous ending. I did catch an adult oriented joke in the movie. The reason that I still give this 4 stars because it has a well thought out story behind it. The Japanese voices seem more natural than the English dubbed voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Time for All","review":"Okay, let me start this review by ssaying I'm not an anime fan. Having that said this is a fun, fast and cool movie with great backgrounds and character designs(despite the President) and some decent action sequences. While the movie should be a little longer it still works well. It was great to finally see Knuckles animated even if his, Sonic's and Tails's voices are off. Well Knuckles doesn't bother me but Sonic's did a little and Tails became annoying right after, \\"Sonic!\\" his first line in the movie. And then there's the fact that in the movie they call Knux a mole. He's an echidna but thats to be expected of our translators and dubbers. Anyway I own this movie and like to watch it over and over. Plus there's a good scene of innudeo with Robotnik and Sara. AHEM.....anyway it's a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie is GREAT!!","review":"I saw the movie and it's great!

I have seen this take a few times now, since we borrowed it from the videostore 2 weeks ago. I really don't see why some people are giving it 1 or 2 star ratings... it deserves better than that. If you like anime such as Dragon Ball Z you should go for this - it's the same kind of thing, \\"action\\" scenes and serious plot developments broken up with comic relief. Sara, for example, is clearly there as comic relief. As for the much-maligned voices, yes, well, Tails does sound like he has a cold, and the others sound a little... different from the American cartoons, to be sure. I do get the nagging feeling I've heard some of those voices in other cartoons... (Sara sounds a lot like Princess Vi from Samuri Pizza Cats)But I digress. This is a great cartoon - Anime fans should get it NOW, if not sooner, and the rest of you should at least rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAFU'S REVIEW","review":"i was very hyped out to seeing this movie, and have been waiting a long time for it to come out, and it was also by the makers of tekken and i thought that this movie would be totally great.

I think that best sums up this piece of DVD. Watching it in Both english and japanese, I came to one conclusion. ... even for a show based on a video game.Sonic, Knuckles, and everyone else's voices sounded like they spent the day in a william shatner reading studio, after breathing heluim for six hours.The plot: An interesting idea, with a few minor twists, but it just never seemed to get going, and before you know it, the show was over. Plus it was hard to note just how evil Robotnick (Eggman) was supposed to be. He had a love interest with the presidents daughter, despite the fact she hated him, and at times he appeared quiet comical. It seemed that everyone had trouble staying in character.The only reason I give it two stars, is that the battles between Metal Sonic and Sonic were decent, and the parts where it was meatn to be funny were. but as I said I wasn't ever sure if the anime was trying to be serious, or goofy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the coolnesst Hedgehog movie !!!!!!!!!","review":"o.k.

I thought that was a fantastic product, except for the backlight and the batteries I found the Platinum perfect. It was those exception that led me to the prism.The color is impressive and lovely, but it's NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL. Most of the apps that you use for productivity don't take advantage of it and those that do don't do it tremendously effectively. I am sure those apps are coming, however.But it beats the heck out of the backlight and the rechargeable battery is a lot nicer thatn the 2-AA's.

I recently cracked my screen and decided it was time to upgrade to the color device. After one week of use and constantly having to strain to see the screen under normal office lighting, not being able to see it in sunlight at all; and finding its only real improvement over the black and white models to be an improved version of Solitaire and Klondike-I returned it. I have another 8Mb Visor, in black and white, on its way.Unless you're truly intending to use this device as a digital photo album, which in conjunction witht the digital camera is a pretty cool feature, or doing serious wireless surfing, I wouldn't reccomend spending the extra dollars. The typical user who relies on their Visor for calendar/contact management will hate the difficulty seeing the color screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good PDA with some flaws","review":"I had a Palm for years and recently switched to the Visor Prism because of positive reviews on the color device. I am a designer and I care about how these units look. All visor including the Visor Edge are no comparison to Palm devices. Palm V is beautiful but I was disappointed by Palm customer support and the high price.Visor Prism does have a screen flickering problem but it goes away in a week. I guess it is either I got used to it or the screen has been \\"warmed up\\". The color is great and many software enhancements work better with color. Although I didn't think much of the Springboard idea, it makes upgrade so much easier. It transforms your pda into a new device. I have the digital camera and the Visor phone. All work great.One more thing about the screen is although it is crisp, you can see each pixel. The B&W pda's look sharper than the color ones but it is still impressive and great to look at color."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't count on it","review":"I have now been through two of these, I might be silly but I expect to get more than a year and a half out of my investment.

Charged the battery the recommended interval. Setup routine was as far as I could get -- unit went black every time I removed the stylus from the case. Put it back on the cradle, it powered up on its own, into the setup routine again. At one point, the backlight stayed on with no screen display, and the unit locked up. Repeated soft resets finally restored the Prism to what I hope is normal operation. If it keeps working, I'll gladly keep it. Nice color display, screen very readable. I hope I only need to come back for more purchases, not a replacement Prism!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prism Display Makes All the Difference","review":"My Prism replaces my Palm V, and I'd never go back.

While this is a great deskweight, it does little to increase the \\"mobility\\" or portability of data that cannot be moved from the Handspring to my computer.I have had a very hard time getting the device to work on my system with the USB cradle. I don't know if it is because I have Win2K, SCSI or what. I've tried to HotSync it on several other systems. It seems that if there is SCSI, the USB cradle won't rock (uh, work). Without SCSI, it Sync's OK.Wouldn't it be nice if it somewhere it big bold letters that the Handspring w/USB is not compatible with SCSI devices and you should steer clear?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Device","review":"I've had the Prism for a few weeks now and have to say it really is a great device. Combine the thousands of programs you can download off of various sites and you've got yourself a great PDA. My only reason for not giving it a full five stars is that the seprate cover/lid could be better. It protects the Prism perfectly but can be clumbersome when you want to do the quick lookup...However, I read recently there is a third party company out there that is selling attachable flip covers for the Visors to eliminate this minor difficulty. Soooo! that is the exact reason why I went into purchasing the Palm O/S and the Visor specific. You see, being in the Palm family (which dominates roughly 80% of the PDA market) these devises always have solutions right around the corner for \\"problems\\" that us users are pointing out. If first party manufactures don't do it then a third party will. As in the seperate cover/lid situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love my new toy.","review":"Before I bought my Handspring Visor Prism, I was seriously considering a Palm, but luckily a co-worker told me about the Handspring. For several weeks I researched all my choices looking for all the pros and cons that were associated with each model. And for the money, I choose the Handspring Visor Prism. I never have to worry about keeping AA batteries on hand, it has enough memory for now (8MB), which I can expand to 16MB, if needed. It has excellent resoulution, and creates over 60,000 colors, which make any of the 60 games that I now have on it look so incredible. It doesn't weigh as much as my Franklin planner and can slip into my purse, where it makes waiting in line bearable, and even helps me with my grocery shopping, thanks to PalmBasket.

Show me a decent springboard module you can plug into this. To date, the idea of expanding your PDA is great, but the modules haven't lived up to the promise. The Blackberry does a way better job of receiving wireless E-mail. Other MP3 players are better than any springboard mp3 player. The list goes on. That said, you're better off getting a different color PDA. Although the 65,000 colors is great, no one is going to get to look at great pictures on such a tiny screen. Also this PDA is big and clunky. While that may not be an issue for you now, it will be in the future. Over time, you want things to get smaller not bigger. The modules you can get are expensive and they don't really offer a whole lot. Plus when you outgrow the module it doesn't expand. Great idea, but poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"No manual????","review":"The Prism was my first PDA purchase.The Good: The color screen sure looks snazzy, and the system basics are easy to figure out.The Bad: Where is the paper manual???

I don't want to have to connect online to tech support everytime I have a specific question about some nuance of my PDA! And, when I'm on the road, I've needed a manual several times to figure out some things about the prism. I guess this PDA will help me manage my time eventually, but Handspring sure is making me waste a lot of it initially by having me \\"hunt\\" for info.In contrast, my brother bought a TRGpro, and they provided him with a 268-page manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Sony Clie","review":"I bought the Prism because of the color screen. Unfortunately, the resolution is so low that it hurts my eyes to look at the screen. The Sony Clie has the best screen on the market.The Prism has 8 MB of memory, which gets eaten up pretty fast, especially if you subscribe to AvantGo and Vindigo.It is also much larger and heavier than most PDAs. However, that could be a plus for people who lose things easily ;-)The first Prism I bought was defective; it would not charge. I will say that I was able to have it replaced easily.The best part about the Handspring Visors is their Springboard modules. You can make the PDA into a cell phone, an MP3 player, hook it up to a modem...obviously all of this comes at a great additional expense.According to what I have heard, Handspring is really focusing on their Treo combination cell phone/PDA...that may be the Handspring product to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't upgrade OS, color screen is pixellated","review":"This Handspring has 8MB, but no flash-ROM. The flash ROM is what allows you to upgrade the Palm operating system on the device.This is a major oversight in design in the rush to market. What good will this PDA be in 3 years when nothing is compatible anymore because your OS is outdated?Another major drawback, in my opinion, is the color screen. It's lousy. There's this funky grid that overlays the screen and makes things look pixellated. Once you see it you'll notice the grid every time you look at the device. Gives me a headache.The worst thing about the whole Prism is that it doesn't work with my machine. I've got a USB and I just can't get it to work and the manufacturer won't take it back. I'm really stuck with this thing and loathe it the longer it sits here.The technical support didn't fix the problem and kept referring me to someone else who never called me back.

The color, when the bacckround in a app is white, the white has a pinkish hue. The durability of the Prism is auful. I dropped it one in a padded case by mistake, and the screen breaks. (Handspring's technical service is 10x worse than palm's)Screen cracks are not not covered in warrenty. The price to have it fixed is US$135.00 (EUR 137.50) palm covers screen cracks in warrenty.

I got it last week and I just love it, and I'm not even using it fully yet. The color screen is very nice and crisp and the hot-sync is quick and easy...just set it in the cradle and push the button...you're synchronized.A tip for AFTER you've bought it...don't go out and buy software, download on the net and try before you buy.

This is possible with the number of colors you can display at once (not so on the Palm III/c) and I can easily download maps into the unit for later retrieval when I'm lost.I also insist on rechargable batteries (I hate replacing batteries) but I did manage to run out of juice when I had several alerts and didn't recharge for 3 weeks.Love the calculator (its actually useful vis a vis the Palm standard one) and DateBook+ is an improvement as well.

If you can get past this, the book is very helpful. Whats really helpful (and what most of our students use) is the tooth CD that comes with it. It is a series of cartoon picures that summarizes paragraph-long descriptions into something as easy as an arrow. Its just that easy.

This wrist monitor is a useless item that will not work for you. It is very difficult to get an accurate reading at the wrist unless you are lucky enough to place it just right. I have since dumped the monitor in the trash and believe this type monitor should not be even sold. I bought an Omron 10 series arm monitor that works great. Please don't waste your money on any wrist blood pressure monitor. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irregular Readings","review":"I have high blood pressure and I need to monitor it daily. With all the mixed reviews it was tough to decide on which one to buy. The LifeSource UB-512 was recommended by a friend who has one. It seemed to be as accurate as my doctor's, but after a few days with it. I noticed the readings were too inconsistent from reading to reading all within a minute of each other. I returned it to my friend and purchased the number one recommended unit out there, The Omron HEM-650, I give it 5 stars for accuracy and the Advanced Positioning System it uses. I get consistent readings each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The monitor gives erratic readings","review":"I recently purchased this Lifesource BP monitor and had to return it immediately because the readings were erratic and the product isn't reliable at all. I tried it on my wife and myself and the device wouldn't give reasonable readings.

We are very satisfied with this product at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanna lose some sleep?","review":"If you do, buy this album. I've listened to it at least twice a day since I bought it a month ago. The songs are so good, you'll be up all night with one of them in your head. There's not a dud in the whole album, from \\"Loving Hannah\\" (which I'm buying for a friend and his new daughter Hannah) to \\"Song for Ireland\\". \\"School Days Over,\\" \\"Men of Worth\\" and \\"Ellis Island\\" are heartbreaking, but \\"Colcannon\\" will lighten your spirits. She's one of the few singers I've heard of any genre who can sing passionately without sounding artificial. Get it and GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"At her best!","review":"This is by far my favorite Mary Black album.

Edge is trying to find the Mexican bandits who robbed him and as usual runs into an assortment of characters in his quest. Along the way, he meets a pair of bounty hunters and their woman. Edge's treatment of the woman must be one of the most disgustingly degrading portrayals outside of S&M pornography. It ruins an otherwise exciting Western.

My son, who up until this viewing had never met an anime' he didn't like, walked out about halfway through this one. I *forced* myself to watch it. The animation is sub-par, the plot is incoherent and the voice acting (English-dubbed version) is a pain to the ears. You will read here the 5 star \\"allegience\\" ratings given by the Macross purists, but save your money and get Macross Plus. Like any form of art, anime' has it's low end.

Put aside all that talk that this is not a true sequel to Macross. It really doesn't matter. This is entertaining. On its own, this a pretty good piece of anime. I certainly liked it. I even want to watch it again.I am even thinking it's a little better than the Macross Plus 4 part series, because the plot, though very similar to the original Macross series, is a lot better.Rent it, buy it...just try it... the fast paced action you are looking for is still there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Let's get one thing straight, Macross II is NOT a true sequel to Macross. Why? Because Shoji Kawamore and Studio NUE (the creators of Macross) were not involved in this project (unlike Macross Plus). The story is about a purehearted young man, Hibiki, who meets (and falls in love) with an alien singer, Ishtar. The two try to stop an alien invasion with the help of a tough, attractive military woman, Silvy (which starts a love triangle). They find out that Ishtar's songs has the power to confuse the enemy. Sound familiar Macross fans, it should, because it is almost the same plot of the original Macross. But it does'nt come close the paragon of storytelling that Macross was. The animation was OK, but the dubbing was terrible. I would have rated this VHS higher if it did'nt have the name Macross written all over it. Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow and boring for extended periods of time.","review":"The plot is overused. It's another \\"guy meets important alien girl who thinks are customs are strange\\" movie. It doesn't start off bad, but after the first battle and maybe another 10 mins, it became extremely boring. The movie just drones on from one slow, boring scene to the next. If you are going to watch it, just fast forward to the siege of Earth at the end, which isn't even that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mech are great, plot isn't there","review":"The mechanical and space craft designs are great.

It isn't supposed to end after 92 minutes. The total actual length is 160 minutes. Given two stars because of the missing video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Macross","review":"In all fairness, people should know Macross II was made during a period where the Japanese Animation industry was in a bit of a slump. Titles produced during this period saw a marked drop in animation quality coupled with so-so scripts. Macross II's storyline simply followed the Macross formula--a love triangle, clash of cultures, and space battles. Macross Plus is also more or less cliched in this regard. However whereas Macross Plus has spectacular animation which makes forgiving its tired plot extremely easy, Macross II is saddled with laughably inconsistent animation quality, and hence has virtually no redeeming value. (Sidenote: for the OVA version of Macross II, only two episodes--4 and 5, can boast decent animation) Perhaps, if this were made just a couple of years later, it would have been better received..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sequel","review":"How bad is Macross II?Well, I had the Macross II tape, I sold it off after three or four viewings. As a comparison, I have Macross Plus: The Movie Edition, watched it more than 50 times, I can still feel the \\"magic!\\"The plot for Macross II is confusing and incoherent, to say the least. To be fair, at least Macross II looks okay for the 1st hour or so in several battle scenes, but frizzle off miserably at the end.Avoid Macross II at all costs. Buy Macross Plus instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great smooth sound","review":"I enjoyed this CD immensely.

It is organised in 24 chapters subdivided in small paragraphs each one dealing with a particular problem in molecular biology. The book covers the basics first and then deals with more specific matters like immunology, cancer, development, etc all seen from the molecular biologist point of view. Although the approach is purely mechanistic it uses a clear evolutionary orientation, well explained at the beginning of the book, that helps to give a dynamic framework to the whole subject. This is not a book to be read in only a few weeks but roughly a year's time, given the detail and amount of material exposed."},{"rating":"2","title":"an outstanding book but somewhat outdated","review":"This book is the most comprehensive book of cell biology I have ever read.

The few girls in thefilm are beautiful, but considering that it was a horror film and itwas the 70s, there should have been more skin shown, at least tojustify for the poor story line and bad acting.This film is nowhere close to any other 70s horror gems. Another factorthat disappointed me was that the movie is all spoken in English. Sincethe title is La Noche de los Mil Gatos, I thought it was going to bespoken in Spanish, so that took away my interest since the beginning.I do not recommend to serious horror film buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Are With Your Hair","review":"There really hasn't been a whole lot with classic traditional R&B; these days. Still there have been a couple of bright spots. India. Arie made that a great staple within the past several years on her tracks like Perfect World with John Mellencamp, and The Little Things. That also is said well with the latest single from her music, I Am Not My Hair. This track is actually very catchy, and delivers her tone and her songwriting quite well. I actually like this song, because it is something I haven't heard in awhile. While there are those acts who seem to be more about the image like Beyonce', or Rihanna, there are some who are what they really play. I just hope for India, is that she keeps up her appeal as a performer.Song: B"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake.","review":"The only thing Huot about this index is a sticker.

I use it with the skin that comes with it which is pretty cool as it is a translucent white skin on iPod.

I saw Balance Buddy at a store for about $15 and figured it was worth a try for just a little money. In our case, it took time and patience, with short but frequent trips to an empty school parking lot for practice. Eventually, the day came when I knew he was balancing 100%, so I let go. In minutes, he was taking laps around the parking lot on his own, and very happy about it. Honestly, without this product, my son's bike might have ended up gathering dust in the garage permanantly. It was the best way to help him gain the confidence he needed. It was also much easier on my back than trying to hold onto his bike seat.

I have never believed in training wheels, and her new bike is just not built where I can hang on to the seat well. My back was killing me and it's hard to run hunched over. It only took me about 5-10 minutes to attach this to her bike and worked perfectly. The padding on the handle makes it very comfortable, and the ability to adjust the handle makes it comfortable for people of all heights to run along behind the bike.I will caution that the nuts need to be tightened pretty well and often. Her chain started falling off because I didn't tighten things down enough, but that's not a fault of the product. I would HIGHLY recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!!!","review":"My 4 year was getting too fast for her training wheels. This worked great and really saved my back.

I tried raising the training wheels method, the 1 training wheel method, and the no training wheel method with me running beside and letting go and watching him fall again and again and again, etc.... No success. This weekend I put the Balance Buddy on his bike and with in 2 hours he is now riding his bike with no training wheels by himself. It was easier on me because I didn't have to hunch down to hold on to the bike and run beside him. It helped him learn the balance basics and he didn't get to see me let go of the handle and watch him ride by himself. The look on his face when I ran past him while he was riding the bike by himself was priceless.

It is very loosely based on the Reso kidnapping of 1992. The histories, characters, settings and motivations,although amusing at times, bear little relationship with the real life of the people involved. Keith Scribner gleaned a few facts from newspaper headlines and created a fast moving imaginary tale which tries, sometimes unsuccessfully, to rise above the meanspiritedness of his descriptions and characterizations. I was disappointed with the author's insensitivity and lack of true research. Read as a novel \\"The Goodlife,\\" is interesting. It should not be used as an insight into the mind of a criminal or as a social commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"provides a very entertaining and yet disturbing read","review":"This novel contains well constructed characters and a plot obviously drawn from reality.

The band plays in nearly top form, with a minor exception in the first song which has a very brief touch of off-harmony vocals. This, however, seems to add to the overall enjoyment this video provides. The band plays with determined ease and craftmanship as they informally figure out the format along the way.

That is how I ran into this album, a fan of Peter Gabriel as I am, and an expecting father, too. All I had was the opportunity to listen to the opening track, about which all I can say is: it's not Gabriel singing, indeed, but you can sense his influence in the music (no doubt about David Rhode's unmistakeable guitar in the back as well, for instance). From his US musical period, this beautiful song with some Japanese koto on it might very well be worth the entire album, but I cannot evaluate the rest of the album as well as the other reviewer. In any case, there's not too much that can be done about it, because -as of this writing- it's out of stock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky and Useless","review":"This keyboard is horrible.

I've never had any problem with any other software running with Etrust during the past 8 years, so this is a first.

I am a bit overwhelmed (and I'm very technically oriented)by the bundle of software that comes with it (photo scan/copy/pdf-color-BW-grayscale, etc). I have utilized most of it, but it seems too many windows/programs/utility choices pop up when you simply push one of the buttons on the scanner. The programs are robust enough, but what they do with 3 separate programs, they could have accomplished within one solid piece of software. I am working on black and white photos from the 1900's to about 1945 and the touchup utilities work pretty well. I would recommend this scanner, great for the price and good quality reproductions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This scanner replaces an HP 5370 that was over 10 years old and no longer supported by HP.

Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than I Expected","review":"I had hoped the Canon CanoScan 4400F Scanner would meet my expectations as a good scanner that provided an accurate image. This scanner was so far better than the one I used to have that I was stunned. Copied photographs are EXACT duplicates of the originals - plus you can enhance the image to a more pleasing result. It's so simple to use, and in most cases a scan, from beginning to end, take just the press of a button. I'm more than pleased with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, when it works","review":"I replaced another failed Canon scanner with this 4400F. I used it 6 months.

Admittedly, I haven't used it to a great extent yet, but I have used it for a number of varying projects, i.e. newspaper clippings, color photos, 35mm slides, and regular ol' documents. Thus far, it has performed flawlessly and quietly. One feature that I have found remarkable is the ability of my Corel Paintshop Pro software to restore my faded slides (some are more than 40 years old)with one click of a button. Of course this scanner is not going to perform as speedily as one priced at \\"the top of the line\\" but I would recommend this scanner to anyone, especially considering its economical price."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as promised","review":"I checked the other reviews before I bought the CanoScan and wasn't disappointed. My main purpose for this purchase was to copy old slides (40-50 years old) and it does a good job. There are several steps but it can handle four slides at the same time, so it's not so bad. It is slow--about a minute per slide--but everything else on the market seems to be, too. It also scans and copies with a one-button touch, which is really nice. Quality is pretty good just with the standard settings. For the price, it was a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I had to buy a new scanner when I couldn't get VISTA drivers for my old Visoneer scanner. I was drawn to this one by the chance to scan slides my parents had taken. It does very well with this. I am still learning the ins and outs of the Canoscan 4400F, but have not been as impressed with its ability to copy black and white book pages, or things I wanted to scan so I could print out a copy. But it may be a matter of keeping at it till I learn better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cano Scan 4400F Scanner","review":"Quick, easy set-up. Scan quality high.

It took me almost 30 minutes to scan two years of tax returns w/supporting documents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect scanner for me","review":"For less than $100, this scanner fits my purposes exactly. I have about 1300 35mm slides, some more than 50 years old, that I need to transfer to digital format, both for convenience and to preserve the images. The 4400F was relatively straight forward to set up and is easy to use. I do very little editing during the scanning process, mostly just fading correction and some cropping. If I choose to do so, I can do more sophisticated editing later. I will admit, however, that taking full advantage of all the editing features is somewhat daunting. Also, be prepared to spend a lot of time staring at your monitor. The scanner only handles four slides at a time and takes 10-15 minutes for each batch, depending on how much editing I choose to do at the time. Nevertheless, if you need a capable and economical scanner at a reasonable price, and are prepared to spend some significant time scanning slides, the CanoScan 4400F is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well with Windows Vista...","review":"I just setup the 4400F on Vista Enterprise Edition system and used the Canon driver and tools from their site. The fact that Canon had a Vista driver since December and the other reviews were the two main reasons I purchased this model.Everything is working as advertised. The 4400F is smaller than my previous Acer flatbed but the Canon model is much faster and the quality has been excellent!My only question is where is the power button? I'm betting that it puts itself in sleep mode - I will break down and read the manual :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I purchased this scanner as a replacement for a Visioneer that quit after two years and with very little use. I decided to purchase the CanoScan 4400F based primarily on the favorable opinions expressed by others who had used it, and knowing that I was not going to purchase another Visioneer. I am not a technical person and have no need to use all of its capabilities, nor have I, so my opinions of it are limited. My only use for a scanner to the present has been to make personal copies and to, on rare occasion scan something for forwarding as an E mail attachment It was a piece of cake to hook up and program with absolutely no glitches. More than I can say for Visioneer. So far I am really pleased, and the copies are first rate, but it is sooooooo slow compared to the Visioneer which was very fast. The slow speed brings it to a 4 star -- otherwise I'm tickled pink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickly obsolete","review":"I did like this scanner for the price. But Canon has this bad habit of not creating new drivers as Operating Systems change. Since switching to Mac's Leopard OS, the Canoscan 4400 doesn't work worth a lick. Blurry, bad detail with inexplicable white speckles. My Canoscan 8000F at work is basically dead because they won't make a driver for it. Nice scam, Canon. I won't buy another Canon product."},{"rating":"2","title":"very happy with product","review":"I am using this product to scan in several thousand of my father-in-laws slides. (yeh a huge project) I have done the first 400 now with no flaws no problems, no hasels. I discovered I can import directly from paint shop elements (most likly other adobe also) this is a big time saver. the include software has a fair amount of flexability, both in size of files, and some cleanup options. (but not the detail cleanup such as spot healing and the like so further clean up is needed) I am making fairly large files for each slide, with the 4 slide option it takes about 18 minuits to scan all 4. much smaller files will be quicker, but I'm going for quality. I played around a bit with the other functions and they seem to work well also. the oct did import into word as text that can be edited.

After I blanched at the price, I read the reviews and took the plunge. If you're like me and mainly need a scanner for docs, this is the one. It is fabulous. I'm running Vista 32.

It's a movie about making a movie on an island where the locals are none-to-pleased that \\"hollywood\\" has taken over. Needless to say, the locals retaliate and hyginks ensue.

I don't plan on purchasing more from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quality, a bit bulky","review":"These are just as pictured, arrived in perfect condition.

They look great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They look and feel promising, so far.","review":"I just received my order for these yesterday. They arrived in a huge box (because of the packing material I guess). They look expensive and well manufactured, so I hope they stand up. I plan to get alot of use out of them. The joints were a little stiff upon opening up the chairs but I expect that. The seats were very comfortable and feel sturdy. I did notice that the armrests were on the narrow side and may be a problem for folks on the plus size or wide hips. I am about a size 16 and they touched my hips.I would have given this item 5 stars, but this is my first Strathwood purchase and I read the reviews of the other people so I'll come back in a few months to update my review when I have sufficiently used them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strathwood Folding Chair - very pleased!","review":"Just sorry I didn't buy two more!

On a positive note,they are good looking and are holding up well.(One of them has been outdoors under a tree this summer.)

We were very impressed with the first set, but unfortunately, the second set has not been as good. Within 2 weeks and little use, 1 chair developed problems in the folder/slider in the legs. The peg came out of the groove that it should slide it, and the horizontal bar that stopped it broke out and collapsed. We tried to screw the bar in place, but there is too much pressure on it, so it did not work. And then after about 4 months, the other chair developed a problem in the right arm....it too collapsed.

I kept the chairs out of the sun, applied teak oil twice to keep the wood in good condition, and just after owning them for a year had both chair break within a few weeks of each other. The seats cracked at the back where they attach to the legs, and there is no way to repair them. The people that used them only weight about 170lbs and there is no reason the chairs should crack, but I noticed upon looking at the construction that the pins that secure them only go in about an inch, which is a very poor design.

They arrived loosely attached, so I took a hex wrench and tightened up all of the attaching bolts. That made the chairs feel a little better. After having them for one and a half months with very little use the seat broke. I glued it back together and now a different part of the same chair's seat has also broken.

The writing is very good, but the Scottish nature of these stories is near to non-existent. What connects these stories together is their theme of adultery, a theme that is fairly common to mainstream literature these days (I've an aunt-in-law who used to complain that it was a criteria for Oprah's Book Club), but one that I had heretofore avoided in my own reading diet. Unfortunately, the saliciousness of these short stories was fairly mild, and while I found Kennedy's writing quite admirably, at the end of each story I found myself saying, \\"So what,\\" a common complaint I have with modern short stories, which tend to be heavy in style and character and light in plot or substance. I did end up reading every story, so that's something of a recommendation, in the sense that if plot isn't necessary for you, you might find this book quite worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious series.","review":"Saw this the first time years ago on Fuse network. Really pretty funny, rap / hip hop stars doing voiceovers on old kung fu movies. Some hilarious stuff in here.

I started with the cardio tape. There was no explaination of the moves and they went so fast it was impossible to follow for me ( a person with no \\"aerobic moves\\" experience). If you have a hard time following moves or are not coordinated this video won't work for you. I'm sure over time I could figure it out, but the workout/instructor is so boring, I won't bother. I then tried the body sculpting and it was just OK, again pretty boring. I have yet to try the abs tape. I was really disappointed with these tapes. I do love the Fanny lifter and use it with other Firm/Fitprime viedo's and I think it's great. I recommend trying the old Firm tapes or the Fitprime tapes instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"like the workouts but not the format","review":"I love The Firm workouts, and the instructors are quite good at what they do. However, the company that distributes these videos needs to work on their consistency. First off, you can get these same 3 videos all on one CD if you buy from The Firm Direct, for a much better price. However, their customer service is in India, so don't expect much help if you want to figure out what is happening to your order.However, when I returned this 3-pack video set to Amazon, they charged me a $22.00 re-stocking fee, which is half the price I paid at first. What is that all about??????????????? The total was $45.00, as opposed to the $20 I paid The Firm Direct for the all-in-one CD, and then Amazon goes and charges me a restocking fee, which I've never experienced before.Wow. I'm not buying from Amazon nearly as much as I had before, especially after this little re-stocking fee incident. Cya, Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I disliked these new Firms because the pace Body Sculpt was too fast, there was hardly any Cardio in Cardio Sculpt and Ab Sculpt just wasn't interesting. Pass on this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dunno...","review":"At first, I got this system and was encouraged by their concept of adding weights to aerobics. If you count it up though, you're not getting a whole lot of cardio in any of these tapes, I don't think. Also, I read something from a dietician who said it's wiser to do your toning seperately. Also, it commented that they have you do lots of reps of weights, and when you hit 15 reps your not boosting your metabolism, your building endurance. Building metabolism is how weights help your weight loss, so I'm getting skeptical. Don't get me wrong, I was a Firm believer and I did use it faithfully, but I haven't been impressed. Also, don't EVER order from the Firm's website, they are idiots who I agree, DON'T CARE about their customers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IMPORTANT-PLEASE READ ABOUT THE FIRM!","review":"I have to get word out that if you order from The Firm, you better hope that you paid for what you wanted and no more. I have had an ongoing battle since March of this year to get refunded 3 times through them after being charged extra for stuff I didn't order. After several phone calls and letters, I got no response and empty promises. I reported them the the better bussiness bureau to try and get my money back and they still didn't follow through. I am beyond angry and very upset and wanted to let everyone know before it happens to someone else. Even though it has nothing to do with the workout, there are so many other workout routines and tapes that are just as effective. I hope this at least lowers some of their sales and gets a message across and lets people see that THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THIER CUSTOMERS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible workout","review":"Wow, where to start....This workout is horrible! The stopping every minute to grab your \\"fanny lifter\\" or put it aside or grab some weights or change weights or set weights down is ridicolous!

Buyer beware of injury. if you aren't careful with this workout, you can easily tear or strain muscles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Firm is the most effective on the market!","review":"You cannot go wrong with any of the Firm's workouts. These new tapes are slightly different than the \\"classic\\" Firms, but still very effective. The moves are simple, the music never obtrusive, and the instructors are very personable. You do need some equipment, but I substituted a Rubbermaid 13 inch step for years with great results.To respond to the reviewer that said she got bad customer service from the Firm: The solution is clear -- this is Amazon.com. Just buy the tapes here and you can be sure to get these great workouts AND excellent customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective all around","review":"I love this system, I finally found a video that combines strength and cardio, because I cannot afford a gym membership and following magazine strength moves can be confusing if you don't actually see it. The Firm is very effective, my butt is getting very shapely!! The only problem I have is that the first few times doing this, the moves cued happen immediately and they don't tell what they will be, so after 5 times, I know what I'll be doing next, but at first you have to stop and realize what they want you to do.(...) my Fanny Lifter fits perfectly together and taking it apart and moving it out of they way incorporates more squatting and even just a slight, but hurried, break from the strength moves.

It's only $19.95 on firmdirect, don't know why Amazon charges $44"},{"rating":"1","title":"Going down hill","review":"I have many of the other THE FIRM tapes, and I must admit THE FIRM has really lowered its standards in this new DVD Body Sculpting System. The production is of a lower standard (there is no scene index, for example), the workouts are not as intense as they once were, and there does not appear to be the seriousness that the tapes once had. Nothing wrong with trying something new, but THE FIRM missed the mark on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Firm","review":"These are not the best Firm tapes that I own, not by a long shot! The music is beyond un-motivating, entering the realm of \`WARNING DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS MUSIC AND WORK OUT OR USE HEAVY EQUIPMENT'! The set is post industrial ugly, like working out in an air conditioning duck, a sad departure from the nice sets they use to use. The workouts them selves do not flow well, the moves made up by instructors looking for anything new, even if uncomfortable and stiff. A much better choice is \\"The Firm Total Body- Maximum Body Shaping\\", and \\"The Firm Cross Trainers: Super Cardio\\", those are great videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Firm - A great workout","review":"A great workout - one that covers all major areas of the body - allows for progress i.e. you may not be able to do everything initially but you can watch your progress as you keep using them. The best thing is that the work outs deliver the results - even if you don't do each exercise to the level and with the weights demonstrated A downside - there is a piece of equipment used similar to a step - it comes in 2 heights that is used - I assume that can also be purchased on line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Challenging Enough","review":"These new Firm series, are just not challenging enough. By the end of the tape, I barely worked up a sweat. It felt as though I wasn't working hard enough. I much prefer the older Firm series, they are more challenging. The new Firm series are good for someone who is a beginner. I swear by the older Firm series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Firm is the best!!!!!","review":"I have about 20-25 work-out tapes, my first being Jane Fonda's very first one. Of all the work-out tapes I have, The Firm is the best. I have several of the older ones, and while they are different from the new ones, I still think the new work out is tough and very effective. I have been telling people about The Firm for years, and those that have tried it agree, they are tough, but that's the only way to get results. I would recommend this workout to anyone. One of the best things about The Firm, is there isn't alot of instruction that you have to get thru at the beginning. You just learn it as you go, and everytime you do it, it gets easier and easier. Because if you are doing a work-out several times a week, you don't want to see the instruction everytime, and that's what I like about The Firm. It's still the best around. By the way, I'm from the South, and don't have any trouble understanding the instructors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these workouts!","review":"this is a great purchase! I love doing these workouts.... the cues are on task when it comes to identifying with each muscle to be worked. I appreciate this aspect of these workouts. It will take all y'all some time to find this out, because you have to view any workout routine that you do to become accustomed enough to listen. Hopefully you know this. Anyway.... I liked them, and I've been working out my whole life. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Was skeptical but...You will see results!","review":"I have always been skeptical about at home exercise videos but have always liked Tae-bo. I bought the BSS and I am absolutely in love with it. The mix of weights and cardio is great, it gives you a great workout and you will see your body start to change in 10 workouts or even less. You have to make a comittment to work it in these videos, if you slack, you will get nothing from them. Also, watch your form, with ANY exercise you will strain or pull if you dont preform good form but its easy to watch yourself with this workout. Imediately after doing the first video, I felt stronger and leaner and I would recomend these videos to anyone who wants a workout that will kick butt, build muscle, tone your body and get you in the best shape of your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THEM, YOU WILL GET RESULTS!","review":"I have been using these videos for about 10 weeks now and I must say that I am very pleased with my results so far. The first few weeks were very difficult, but I perservered and it paid off. Being in my forties and having been inactive for several years, these tapes proved to be quite a challenge. Luckily, I was determined NOT to turn into a marshmallow person and kept using them faithfully. I now look forward to my workouts and the resulting feeling of wellbeing. And yes, you will see a transformation if you do these tapes in rotation. I noticed a difference after 10 workouts, after 10 WEEKS a much more dramatic one though. I can't wait to see myself after 10 more weeks! You really should have a fanny lifter if you want to get the maximum results."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Firm is not what it was","review":"What has happened to The Firm? Their videos used to be the best--the best production, the best sound quality. the best music. Now they look and sound like copies taped on a cheap VCR.

When I saw this in the store, I was immediately drawn to it. The fit is great. Most of the baby bag straps don't stay on my shoulder but this does! I love how comfortable it feels as a cross-body too. The color is great and the feel of the outside fabric is wonderful - most bags now feel cheap and plastic-like.

As much as I tried to like this album I couln't, the playing has no energy behind it almost like they were experimenting. How can you play this type of music when you have no soul to pour into it? This was supposed to be a tribute to John Coltranes ballad album but if fails and fails badly. Unless you like good background music at a party save your money and purchase something else. If he keeps putting out music like this I'm afraid we have lost another jazz artist who tries to be things he can't be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Michael Brecker is one of the world's greatest jazz saxaphone players -- he is easily in the same league as Parker and Coltrane, and has more technical proficiency than either of them. But his sense of music, his ability to communicate, and his taste have gone over the edge. What we have here is a wonderful musician playing the horn with ruthless disregard for his listerners.

Unfortunatly Bob has joined his peers, but that doesn't mean I won't enjoy reading many more of his books now that I've read this one.I chose it based on the Vincent Di Fate artwork on the cover. As a rule of thumb, whenever I see his art, I enjoy the book.Not the best ever, but I did miss a lot of sleep because I couldn't put it down. If you like classic science fiction, buy it cheap.

I also felt more attention could have been given to garment construction instead of assuming we would automatically all know how to do it. In spite of the everything, the artist's love of her craft, expertise, and pleasant personality were evident and I will attempt a bear in the near future but I am nervous about ordering any other vieos in this same series.

Some of it is always going to be better than others. But this collection was particularly poor in quality of writing, originality of ideas and general feel.I read the first six, and really have no desire to continue.The stories are negative (for the most part), whiny and really lack erotic merit -- ie, I never got turned on. I mostly spent time reading about vindicitive people or others who were un-balanced in their sexual orientation and burdened with hang-ups.Missing were unique, clever and moving sensual descriptions of physical and emotional erotic pleasure.Is this really the best American erotica there is to offer?I'm so sick of this apparent trend of cynicism and crankiness in contemporary writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This book wasn't what I was expecting.

Reuben Levy's prose translation (The Epic of the Kings: Shah-Nama, the National Epic of Persia, Mazda, 423 pages) is more condensed: it's quite poor on the later historical period.

It may have cost her in the end as she hints. Sometimes there is a high price to pay for freedom.

This film acknowledges the dictum that \\"talking about music is like dancing about architecture\\" and it opts for a different approach to telling its story. The film, Thirty two Short Films... invites you to go on a journey with it, musing and meditating about Glenn Gould, about genius, about normality, about the impossibility of being totally known by others, the universality of loneliness and the direct, immediate connection to and among disparate souls that music makes. I have quirky taste and I love this film.

He was also an isloated person who had difficulty being a social being. He is justly famous for the first fact; the second was a difficulty he had to endure. This film is not about Gould as a musician(there is actually very little music). Rather it is a semi voyeuristic attempt at drawing a picture of his personality using a mixture of acting and interviews with real people. The mixture doesn't work, and is, I believe, pointless and perhaps cruel. It is neither fish nor fowl, but rather, that most misleading of \\"art forms\\", the docudrama.If you love Gould's music this will not inspire you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Artsy for me","review":"I tried my best to get into this, but about halfway through, I gave up.

I didn't care for this movie however.1) The actor does not look like Glenn at all in my opinion, which I find distracting.2) Its very disjointed, and a lot of the components offer very little insight about Glenn or his life. One scene was Glenn simply going into a restaurant and listening to other people's conversations. Big deal, this is not interesting. I know this was supposed to offer a subtle insight into his personality, but it's boring and it comes across as pretentious filmmaking. Another example; Glenn is listening to a record with a cleaning lady. Thats it. Why is this interesting? Someone could film my uncle in Wal Mart, but would you care? Hey, look...My Uncle Carl is buying batteries. Now he is putting his change in his pocket.

And \\"Slippage\\" is a page-turning, mind-bending collection of stories and sundries which should be on everyone's must read list this year. (copyright)1997 Des Moines Sunday Register"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Ellison","review":"Harlan Ellison proves once again that his introductions are far more momentous than his short stories! Slippage has destroyed my faith in Ellison as a writer of fiction once and for all. The stories are, by turns, smarmy, self-indulgent, unfathomable, and worst of all, boring. The introductions to the stories are just the opposite: enlightening, thought-provoking and entertaining. They share an obvious reality the stories sorely lack. Nowhere is this sad dichotomy more evident than in Ellison's account of his stormy separation from the New Twilight Zone TV series. To take a do-or-die stand over the insipid, predictable piece of fiction in question proves beyond a doubt that Ellison is simply no longer in touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing designed to impress a white-hot poker in your brain.","review":"Such a fine, fine, fine collection. From beginning to end I found every aspect impressive, not only the writing, but also the author's vast knowledge of every subject imaginable (that he would describe something so obscure as the workings of the Dodge Main plant in Hamtramck, Michigan, circa 1950, with such insight and accuracy, leads me to believe that he knows everything about everything... and that he can convey that knowledge in such a way as to advance his stories...). One story in particular, \\"The Museum on Cyclops Avenue,\\" I have read, and read aloud to great audience reaction, and read again. A book that is a pleasure to read, and a pleasure to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, will entertain absolutely everyone!","review":"Well, what can I say about this book. It's Uncle Harlan at his best. Every story grabs you with it's intense narrative and demands that you will read it, NOW! I myself cannot praise \\"Mephisto In Onyx\\" enough. At the end I was laughing, not only with mirth but also with shock. Also Ellison's desciption of Glasgow Central Station in \\"She's a Young Thing and Cannot Leave Her Mother\\" is the best I have ever seen or heard. I should know I work there. So if there are any doubts in your mind, take it from me, buy this book if only for these two stories, but be prepared to be blown away by the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author's Comments","review":"The manual was the first publicly available presentation the Forth computer language at its source code level.

In the process, The murderer tries to run Nicole over. Back at the commune farm Nicole calls home, Gus falls under the spell of the cult and Nicole while Shawn investigates the murder with the help of his father, Juliet and Lassiter.

The storylines are awful...nothing to them...just boring.It seems to be an ego trip for Sean and Gus and I am sorry but the other characters, along WITH Sean and Gus, is what MADE the show great!

This has been a great show to watch with my family up until now with the exception of a few episodes. I've only let my kids watch 2 out of the last three episodes and I haven't found it nearly as funny. The producers have touched on agenda issues in the past, but now they are starting to push them. I loved the emphasis on family and the importance of families staying together in some of the intial seasons. Now we have Lasiter climbing all over a girl in bed and I am supposed to be excited about Shawn and Juliette possibly moving in together. Forget viewing this as a family movie.

Absolutely love James Roday! He is the cutest and funniest person on TV. He is also a very very good actor. Along with the laughs there have been some tears with his performances. I have really enjoyed the evolution of his relationship with his dad. As for the rest of the cast - Fantastic! Gus - adorable, Lassie - a riot, Woody - a complete riot! They all play so well off of each other. The writers are great! \\"Last Night Gus\\" has to be the funniest episode ever! The season finale was amazing and Henry better be ok!

I started watching Psych only a few weeks ago, and it has changed my life in every way. Simply the best thing to ever happen to the world. If you have never seen it, do what I did...buy every season on DVD and watch every episode in succession until you pass out (for me it was about 21 episodes, give or take). Wake up a few hours later and do it all again. If you have to work, quite your job. Just do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good season","review":"I had some concerns about what the writers would do with the Shawn/Juliet pairing, but for the most part it doesn't appear. When it does, it actually makes sense.The writers do have a stroke of brilliance with Lassie's girlfriend. Really well done, and feel good for Lassie.The catch phrases for this year seem off to me.Another reviewer referred to Late Night Gus being the best episode of Psych - it really is up there in the list of best episodes. However, the 2nd appearance of Blackapella isn't as strong as the first. Really missed Joon.Quite pleased that the finale did not have anything to do with Yin or Yang or his new blonde apprentice. We do get a cliffhanger. Wojo, Wojo, Wojo. As soon as I saw an old Barney Miller cop, I knew what was going to happen.If you like Psych, easy recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me!","review":"I in no way share the feelings of the last reviewer.

Some locations would show roads and some would not even show interstate-this at the same zoom level. The software also does not use standard GPS language like waypoints.

However, the volume of the male English speaker (left channel) and the female Greek speaker (right channel) are at such different volumes that one can clearly hear the English but fail to hear the Greek.

Only about 2 or 3 of the songs are worth anything. the rest are just really really played out, tired reggaeton beats, and his voice oversinging the songs. its surprising because he has relatively good producers and guest artists appearing on the album, but the song structure and his lyrics and his rapping and his singing on this album can't pull it together. if i give it 2 stars its because its not COMPLETE crap... but i definitely would not recomment others to buy it. the few good songs on here don't make up for the rest of the crap on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera - Love the Anti-Shake","review":"I have had this camera for about 6 weeks now and love it.

With the HP, EVERYTHING that I wanted to do was within one piece of software. With this Canon Scanner, there are MANY pieces of software (CanoScan Toolbox, Easy Photo Print, Omni Page SE, Presto Page Manager, Photo Studio), and to do a simple scan requires at least one of them, and sometimes TWO!!!

It doesn't claim to be fast, and it isn't. At 300 dpi (which is probably all most people need), its speed is definitely acceptable, but not blazing. At higher resolutions, scans take quite a while.

I was wrong. This stand is barely worth $5. It appears to be height-adjustable, but there is no way to lock it into the desired height (only the boom angle), meaning that the smallest bump will screw it up. Even if you let it rest at the lowest height, there is still a lot of give in all the other joints. I will be returning this stand.One other point: if you plan on using your stand with a Shure SM7b, or a microphone with a similar bracket-system, you need to buy a stand where the threads on the stand point either up (simple stand without boom arm) or down (overhead boom), but not straight at you, like this stand.

All was great, except one of the thumbscrew caps on the bolts used to secure the legs to the stove was partly broken off. I chalked it up to shipping damage and carried on.We went on a two-night camping trip with it. We cooked on it four times over the trip. The stove performed fantastically - lit right up, provides good even heat, and plenty of BTU power. As another commenter mentioned, however, it is a bit difficult to get down into the burner area to clean up blown-in dirt, pot-overboils, etc.The thing that made me write this review though was that one of the thumbscrew caps broke while I was setting up the stove - the \\"wings\\" completely crumbled in my fingers - thus 4 stars instead of 5 for the nuisance factor of having to replace them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality","review":"Chinese made product.

This EX60 model comes with a round metal wind-shield attached to the bottom of each 30,000 BTU burner. Hence, the EX60 provides better wind protection than the EX170, which curiously didn't have any round metal windscreen at the bottom of the burners at all. Further, with the EX60, gas control knobs are marked with hi/med/low/off positions. In order to turn on the gas, the knobs have to be pushed in then turned. The EX170 curiously had no such safety measure and markings. With the EX60, two burners can burn at the same time without any problem. With the EX170, we couldn't get the 60,000 BTU to burn on medium or high at all, and the 30,000 BTU burner was therefore provided more heat than the 60,000 BTU burner on the EX170.

Don't plan on cooking with a 6\\" skillet on this thing, it is designed to hold big pots and pans and only big ones. One big one and one small one would have been better for me, but I guess most folks that do outdoor cooking are fixing large meals for several.

Most irritatingly, there is very little usage included (i.e. idioms, examples of usage, linked prepositions, etc.). Much better to rely on Hugo's or Hipolet's (sic). If Hugo's et al is too limited for you, then you're ready for a Dutch Dutch-English dictionary of which many good examples exist, e.g. Prisma which is complete with extensive usage and cheap.

I will leave the reader to remember from history what occurred on that day at that location. What will happen to Adam? And, perhaps more importantly, what happened to his father?

The second family did not have infertility issues and they do a private U.S. adoption but not a foster adoption. The first story is very good, we will probably just show our family that part of the DVD. Foster adoption as an option is left out of this DVD. For those interested a foster adoption is usually free to very little cost and is where parents adopt a child out of the foster care system in which case the child has been taken away from their family and put up for adoption by the state.

Perfect addition to any movie collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful film","review":"This is a masterly adaption of E.M. Forster's novel. The film begins in the beautiful city of Florence, where romantic tensions begin to develop between the young and inexperienced Lucy Honeychurch and the radical George Emerson, and takes us on to the British countryside, where Lucy struggles to resolve her longings. The tale of a young girl breaking free from the protective shell of her adolescence is an endearing one, scripted and played with a comedic edge. The humour flows naturally from the situation and the characters, and is therefore gentle and unforced. The cast are outstanding, particularly in some of the supporting roles: Daniel Day Lewis is deliciously pretentious as Cecil; Simon Callow and Denholm Elliot also shine in minor roles.Nothing here is overstated. The beauty of the locations and the characters are allowed to speak for themselves without heavy-handed direction or overly lavish treatment. Forster's story is brought to life in an uncluttered and lasting way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming romantic movie","review":"I remember seeing this movie when it was first released.

So parents, if you don't wish your children to see as Archie Bunker once said 'full nudal frontity' :)don't watch this movie with kids. That being said, the dialogue is brilliant, the acting superb, and Lucy and George are two lovers you will champion from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of hte most PERFECT films ever made!","review":"This film is one of the most ravishing ever made, and worth viewing over and over. For me, it represents the true definition of love. Period. *ALL* the actors and their performances are *PERFECT*. Unlike some previous reviewers who have had the great fortune of traveling to Florence and experiencing the beauty of the Italian 'scena' for themselves, I and my best friend, on other other hand, literally *accidentally* strolled into the English village where much of the rest of the film took place. Imagine our initial, eerie feeling of deja-vu (\\"Gosh, have we been here before?\\"), and then the sudden realization that we had walked right into into \\"A ROOM WITH A VIEW\\"! It was glorious; we even had lunch across from the Rev. Beeb's church.

I watched the movie and it was a promising film. I had made my decision to buy the DVD before the end of the movie. That was until I saw the bathing scene. I'm not one to enjoy watching frontal nudity especially male frontal and I couldn't understand why it was added in the movie to beginn with. I'm still trying to understand it since it didn't seem important to the storyline. That scene destroyed the movie for me and I decided not to buy the movie after all. Should the scene not appear on the DVD or is removed from it in the future then I will consider watching the film again and probably buy it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!! ...FULL NUDITY IN THIS FILM!","review":"Unless you're a fan of seeing full grown men run around completely naked (full front and back) for about 5 minutes, don't watch this film. The rest of the movie is great, and this one scene completely ruins it for those of us who like to keep our minds free of these images. Disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crucial moments missing from DVD","review":"ROOM WITH A VIEW is one of my favorite movies. I've seen it several times and was ecstatic that it was going to be released on DVD in widescreen format. The color and sound on the DVD are glorious. I was however very disturbed to discover that at least 30 seconds at the end of one scene is entirely missing from the DVD. It was not any of the nudity so I can only conclude that it was a processing error that was never caught. To make sure I wasn't imagining it I retrieved my taped copy and forwarded to that scene and sure enough 4 lines of dialog are missing. It happens in chapter 4 at 41 minutes and 36 seconds. 4 lines--lines later referred to--are cut off and a rather abrupt scene change occurs. So fair warning to all who buy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars to the movie, two to this DVD","review":"Any viewers who have a heraing-impairment, viewers who do not have English as their native language, or viewers that simply intend to watch this movie with a low volume-level, please be aware -- this DVD lacks both English subtitles and English Close Captioning. I had so looked forward to including this movie in my DVD library, but for some reason which is beyond me, the Image people were ignorant enough to leave out English subtitles/captions, rendering this film almost useless for me, and probably a lot of other people as well. All I can hope for is a Special Edition in the future, perhaps by another studio who takes the fine art of video production -- and us viewers -- more seriously.However, if you have no need whatsoever for English subtitles, then go right ahead and buy this movie. It's romantic, it's fun, it's wonderful, and you will not regret it (see other reviews for more indepth content commentaries...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really beautiful film.","review":"It tells the tale of true love conquering over Victorian/Edwardian convention and was one of the first films to display the delectable talents of Helena Bonham Carter.Lavish costumes, stuffy Victorian English convention (personified in Day Lewis's performance), Rebellious new thinking as displayed by Sand's and Elliot as his Father, Idyllic British Summers and stunning shots of Florence.A gentle tale by today's standards but shocking and provactive in Forster's time. There are some scenes of complete male nudity so not entirely suitable for small people or Granny's film club afternoon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the romantic","review":"I received this for my birthday a few years ago. I've always loved classic literature, particularly Regency, and more recently into period films as well.I wasn't expecting very much from this film going into it, but it was surprisingly good--or perhaps not so surprisingly. The cast is superb: Maggie Smith as the prim maiden aunt, Judi Dench as the slightly scandalous novelist, Daniel Day-Lewis as the somewhat stuffy fianc��, Julian Sands as the free-spirited admirer, and of course Helena Bonham-Carter as the heroine.I'd recommend this to anyone with a romantic side, lovers of period pieces, and fans of any of the cast. It was much funnier than I expected and thoroughly enjoyable.Notice: there are a few scenes of male nudity--not full frontals or anything, but there's this swimming trip... It's not obscene or anything, just be prepared."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Beautiful Movie Ruined on DVD","review":"This is the worst DVD I've ever seen. The tragedy is that A ROOM WITH A VIEW is one of the most beautifully photographed movies ever made. The scenes of Florence and rural England, not to mention the interiors and the close-ups, are magnificent. But some [person] at Cinecom or Image Entertainment got the idea of superimposing a pinkish sepia gauze over the entire movie. All the beauty is gone. One can only hope that a later, commemorative edition of this movie will start from scratch and do a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD flaws","review":"I'll agree with the other DVD reviewers and add another failing that I noticed. Near the end, during the carriage ride with Ms. Honeychurch and her mother, the audio track gets a little out of sync with the picture for a couple of minutes. That, and the missing 40 seconds in the rather crucial scene in the Italian pension after the picnic, were things that bothered me the most. A Room With A View is my favorite movie of all time; I don't have to have special features on the DVD, like director's commentary or \\"making of\\" segments, though they would have been nice, but at the VERY least I expect them to actually give me the entire (!!!) movie without leaving bits out. Quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've ever seen","review":"I would have given this film 0 stars if possible. This film was long, boring, and painful to watch.

I had a shower, made a cup of tea, put in the video - and then experienced about 40 minutes of complete boredom.I only kept it on so long because I was hoping it would perk up, but it didn't.I usually love this kind of costume drama, so I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A finely honed piece of work.","review":"(...)This film is a finely honed piece of work, correct in every possible detail. A lot of careful work must have gone into the casting and I can't imagine a cast more perfect. But I must just mention the brilliance of the late Denhom Elliot, who makes his Mr Emerson so very lovable, with his simple wisdom and his permanently pained and anxious expression. What a loss he is to the profession. And within its limitations this film is so marvelously true to the book. You just have to turn a blind eye to the many coincidences."},{"rating":"2","title":"If there was a 10 star rating-THIS WOULD BE IT","review":"What can I say about this magnificent movie? The only thing that comes to mind is SEE IT. The Italian scenery alone is worth it and the score, oh my lord the score!! If you want to know what love is supposed to be like watch this movie. Lucy and George(grrr) are the perfect couple and I laughed and laughed at Daniel Day Lewis playing Cecil-who would have thought that sexy Daniel Day Lewis could ever appear unappealing! But he's wonderful! Just wonderful! Charlotte will make you scream with frustration and Mr. Beeb's bouncing belly (among other things) will make you hold your sides with mirth! Room With A View is the most romantic, beautiful film I have ever seen (a close runner up would be Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect film","review":"Is there any cinematic experience more perfectly pleasurable than A Room with a View? Many films induce a good scare, a good cry, a good laugh: this film induces the something much rarer -- pure, unadulterated joy.

For me there were no legs to the romance, it was just attraction as far as I could tell. There were very few actual scenes with the hero and heroine.

The complexity she brings to Lucy Honeychurch is wonderful. But Helena is only one of the reasons this film is a winner.

You should too."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with the soundtrack?","review":"I have seen this movie many times, so I know what it should sound like. The audio in the disc is bizarre.

You will be disappointed, especially if you've heard the original soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing second disk","review":"I am very disappointed in this two disk set. The packaging and presentation is excellent. The movie itself is of course, wonderful. Until now, I have always enjoyed any additional data added to DVD movies. However, the second disk is more than disappointing. I had high hopes of actor interviews and discussions about the lovely music selections and scenery in the movie. Instead, the second disk mostly contains bad morning-TV footage of the stars saying nothing of substance and very dull interviews of people who knew the author. The second disk is worthless - having the most inconsequential and unenjoyable addenda that I have seen on any DVD. Save your money, buy the movie DVD alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best British Film Ever","review":"I have seen this film about 10 times. The first time was right after reading the book when it first came out. The film does great justice to the book. There are actually only about 2 differences from the book and they are useful in their symbolism. First, the hair color of her fiance and new love interest are reversed in the movie. The symbolism in the book is that her new love is darker and more brooding, while the fiance is the fair haired boy. Second, when Lucy first kisses George in the field, in the movie it looks like a field of grass or wheat. The book has this as a field of violets, which of course, is symbolic of their passion. I know I sound like a complete snob, but this film and the underlying book were so fabulous, I remember these bits of information from the book as if I had read it yesterday, when, indeed, I read it 15 years ago. This is enduringly romantic and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible _film_ horribly mastered DVD","review":"I have seen this film dozens of time since its release in theaters.

Anyway, I just ordered a new iBook for myself and will simply order a new scanner rather than hassle with this scanner again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It dosen't work","review":"To say that I don't like this product and the company who made it is an understatement! I purchased it new and have never been able to make it work. Furthermore, numerous calls to the company's tech support line go unanswered and they have not responded to my emails. As far as I can determine, customer support simply does not exist. After exhausting all troubleshooting hints (both in the manual and online), I simply had to give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got it to work","review":"I bought the updated software.

On the Macs (G4 running 9.2 or G3 running 8.6), the system freezes and has to be rebooted regardless of what I do. On the PC running Windows 98, the scanner can't be found. I have tried every possible combination to fix it, including downloading newer driver software, with the same dismal results. I have read every piece of FAQ published about this scanner and tried everything. This is my second piece of hardware from UMAX that came with such buggy software as to make it impossible to work. Support was also, as others have stated, non-existent. I'm cutting my losses and trashing this brand-new, never been used scanner and moving on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hardware delivers but the software is horrible","review":"This scanner provides beautifull scans on my MAC G3 when it works, but the software is very buggy and causes serious system crashes (which were confirmed by ConflictCatcher).

Why? Mainly because they are wanting more money if you dont have an older operating system. I am running XP like most other computers are, and had this scanner for a year on a 98 machine. I tried installing the software which is incompatible with XP, to make things worse, I go to the Umax website, and they do not have ANY updated software for free. But at a cost of 15 dollars. 15 dollars for scanner software that should be supported by XP, its a joke. I already paid for the scanner, and they expect me to fork another 15 dollars? No free software for those with newer operating systems. Every other computer product I have bought has free downloadable software for XP users, and not a single dollar was charged out of my account. I have already told this to everyone I know, we will not be buying any Umax products, and I suggest that you dont either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good quality; be patient w/bundled software","review":"This is a very good scanner at this price level, and thesoftware packages are really not all that bad as indicated by thefollowing complains.At first, I was very impressed with the quality of scanned photos and documents, but I was having some frustration customizing the software applications which came with the scanner. Well, the reason I was frustrated at first was because I was expecting the same level of user-friendliness you would find on other software such as WinFax, Microsoft Word, and Other popular commercial software. Well, I decided to spend some time and be patient to learn to use the software, understand the configurations and some try and error. I have now master the VistaScan (Beginner), Presto! PageManager, and the three push buttons.So, I can now scan the way I wanted it too, and the scanned result is very good. I am happy with it now after using it the second day!

Then I contact Gateway and was told that the USB port is working and that the Software for this product is the problem. Umax stated unless I change the IRQ they will not help me. Right now I am going to return the item and purchase a different scanner.

UMAX customer support has always been pretty much non-existent but their scanners had a good following so one could always find a solution to their screwy driver problems if one looked around on the web. With the advent of Windows XP however, you might as well throw your UMAX gear away. Their parallel port scanners are not supported at all and the SCSI and USB scanners are supported only if you buy the new drivers at a cost of [money amount]. What is worse is that the XP drivers that they sell you don't work at all. Don't get sucked in!! UMAX is trying to rip you off by selling you driver software that won't install and they do not provide any useful support once you paid the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kamp Rite Tent Cot Original Size","review":"This thing is really very comfortable and convenient to use.

In the web picture you see a clear contrast between the dark background and silver which is what attracted me to this item. The product that I received, however, had a barely filled 'gray' background instead of the rich black shown in the picture. Only when the shadows caught the item making it look dark, could you see some resemblance of what it's actually supposed to look like. So if this is any indication of the type of product quality this collection brings, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overshadowed Gem","review":"Iolanthe is often overlooked in the Gilbert & Sullivan lexicon by Pirates, Mikado, Pinafore, etc. But to my taste Iolanthe is one of the most bouncy scores and this production does not disappoint. It greatly helps with understanding to know something about the British government and the staging helps clarify some of that. The singing is good to excellent and the humor comes through. I showed this to three mid-teenagers and they all thought is was \\"good\\" to \\"cool\\" to \\"awesome.\\" That is not to say it's for an unsophisticated audience, it is to say it is accessible to all -- I enjoyed it as much as they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This was my first \\"Iolanthe,\\" and I was totally captivated. Having been a professional dancer all of my life, the dance world really lost out on not having Arthur Sullivan compose ballet scores. \\"Iolanthe\\" screams to be danced, and in this production, much of the Fairies staging complies.The production, though a bit shaky at times, is a joy from beginning to end. The tongue in cheek campiness is just perfect. Wonderful sight gags abound, most memorable being the Fairies wings hangning out to dry before they are summoned by Strephon - hysterical.But!!!! It is the music and those AMAZING lyrics that just overwhelm you. It is truly a wonder that the human mouth can sing/speak at such lighting speed as required in the act one finale.It is simply wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iolanthe. Hammond Stroud,Mills,Collins,Opera World.","review":"This production leaves much to be desired, and was ill conceived. The singing is adequate, but the film's direction included far too much irrelevant 'business' which detracted from the singing, and the theatrical presentation. The ballet and the stage 'blocking' appeared to be under rehearsed. Also, the colour is weak. As W.S.Gilbert said (Mikado) -- 'Modified rapture'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"On the whole I very much enjoyed this, though, as many of the reviewers say, there are some dreadful lapses in judgment in the staging, especially the Finale to Act 2. The standout performances, I thought,are Anne Collins as the Fairy Queen and Derek Hammond-Stroud as the Lord Chancellor. They are formidable as well as absurd, and their confrontation at the end of Act I is very impressive. The invasion of Parliament by the fairies in the Act I finale works very well, I thought; there is something quite eerie about it as well as ridiculous. Tolloler and Mountararat are a little weak. The transformation of Strephon from innocent Arcadian shepherd to self-satisfied, sneering Parliamentarian is astonishing; he's barely recognizable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and unimaginative","review":"I found this performance lacking in many things but above all energy. This production clearly had severe budgetary constraints, but part of the magic of theater is the extent to which an imaginative director and an energized cast can overcome limits of production. That didn't happen here. While the individual cast members were splendid, the production as a whole never came together."},{"rating":"1","title":"frog backpack","review":"you can't put anything in the backpack because it is too small, therefore, i bought it for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item never Delivered,","review":"My bracelet went back from (apartment complex office) and never got to me.

A must read if you struggle with addiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you are looking for recovery help...","review":"This book is more like a theoretical exploration of what promotes addictive behavior, and will be of no real help to you if you are trying to help (or are yourself) an addict.

Unfortunately, there are some other songs on here that aren't Pillows songs and that makes me mad. So then I listen to one of The Pillows songs. Yay! It's good stuff. Just skip past the tracks by the Shinkichi guy (1-6, 10, 13, and 16-21 are all The Pillows songs).

Their virtues are unquestioned, and their songs are wonderful alternative/pop punk bliss. They've brought me musical joy, even if it's from half the world away. However, I have to agree with the other reviewer about the sound quality on this CD. Played at slightly less than normal volume, it sounds fine, but upon cranking it (like any fan of the pillow's music would), it does sound like compressed mp3s. Or something between normal CD quality and a brand new cassette tape (with no hiss). It's kind of a downer, and it takes a little getting used to. However, if that's the price we pay for a cheap domestic version of the FLCL OST, then I'm all for it.

Still, some things (his reaction to the first-time introduction of disposable razors and his worries about the environment) are really worth reading from a historical standpoint. he profiles famous men and women of finance (including a blind female stock-market whiz billionaire, and a male scammer with a pyramid scheme who made a mint and was never arrested) and comments on then-timely issues such as the battle over the King Kong remake between Paramount and UNiversal.

It is now been almost two months and the filters still look like new. Barely any odor either from the treament.

It seems to be quite effective in keeping any bacteria from building up in the humidifier. The only reason I give this product four stars rather than five is that given the rather scary warnings on the bottle, I am concerned about breathing this stuff in. Also, I'm always petrified when I go to refill the tank that my cats are going to try to drink out of the humidifier's base. I'm thinking that any chemical that is so corrosive that contact with it can permanently damage your skin, as the warning suggests, cannot be too great for your lungs. But then, neither is mold.

I don't believe that something that goes in your air humidifier and therefore in the air of your home should be so harmful, because I'm sure it can't be healthy for your lunges. I used it one time and won't use it again, also because I don't want to have to be worried that it gets in contact with my skin, what if the water spills and I don't notice and someone steps in it?

The album is chock full of some of that Louisana via Texas hoodoo blues and rock with highlights such as the Howling Wolf soundalike, Don't You Know That I Love You, Creedence type of rock such as Shadow Man, and You Ain't Fooling Nobody and tex mex sounding Don't You Rock Me The Wrong Way.

A turnip could play his part. Dunst is, as always, beautiful but has a rough time playing off the stone gosling.

I had vaguely heard of the story it was based upon, and was glad this film got me to look into it again. What a captivating, scary and polarizing person. An interesting story that is well paced with the timelines that it has to cover. The ability to show just how much a person's life can change, whether in an instant or over the course of several years, is always subject matter for an intriguing story. The special features interviews are also well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid movie, loved that I didn't hear anything about it before watching it.","review":"I liked this movie and can't believe it's a true story.

I'm glad I watched it on Amazon Prime because I would have been upset had I paid for it. The acting is decent, but overall fairly dull (a shame since they had a good cast), and the only likable character is portrayed by Kirsten Dunst.

I have to agree with the earlier reviewer who states that it appears that this is nothing more than a collection of fabrics that perhaps were gathered up and photographed to create a publishable book. It's certainly not large enough to be considered a pretty \\"table\\" book, and it doesn't contain much in the way of technical information.

(This problem has existed since purchase, but has gotten steadily worse.) Picture contrast is muddy and awful. The color-correction sliders built into the scanning software do diddly-squat, and whatever filter it comes with that theoretically removes dot-screen from printed material is a joke.I spend so much time in Photoshop fixing what the scanner did to the originals that it's actually become more efficient to drive to a friend's house, scan the pictures, upload them, drive back to work, and download them.That's sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"My kids love these DVDs - I highly recommend them.

As with most David Alvarado cd's, this one starts off mellow. When you get to track number four, \\"You Are Love\\" by Lovetronic, get ready for the perfect musical adventure. This songs mixes in house and Latin house to bring a unique sound that inspires you to dance. Track Number nine \\"Muneca\\" by Midnight Creepers is another example of a unique sound that just makes your feet move. I can't say enough good things about this album. Just cause I only mentioned 2 tracks don't get the wrong idea, this whole cd is brilliant. Play this cd at any party and watch the people just start to dance. This cd is unique like his other album Midnight Express, but very different as well. For all you House lovers out there: \\"this cd is the bomb.\\" Peace Out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From the Deep by Fred Everything","review":"Starting out the CD with some funky disco, Fred's classic vocal mix of Bran Van 3000's 'Astounded' establishes a unique sound that echoes throughout the CD. The next track is one that has kept us hitting the replay button. The deep bass, clear percussions and soothing voice of Debbie Clare enraptures a melody that is quintessential to house music. It only gets better as you go from one track to the next from the Montreal based Producer and DJ.

The first track started off mellow and I thought \\"cool\\", then it very ungracefully bumbled into track number 2 and I thought \\"okay-keep listening\\". Then I snoozed through tracks 3 and 4 and woke up quite pleased with 5,6, and 7. Then all hell broke loose and it turned into pop dribble and I thought \\"what the...?\\" A pretty big dissapointment unless you happen to like listening to just flat lyrics with very little house or funk whatsoever.

I purchased it and anticipated watching the comedy team I remembered watching in the 70's on our black& white tv. This version is taken from a 1950's early tv show that is very grainy and the sound is inconsistant. This Who's On First is part of a tv variety show and it is not the polished version I remembered from the Sunday morning movie or from the radio show. This is not worth the $. It was very disappointing! Try to get your copy somewhere else. This one is boxed with an Errol Flyn movie that I didn't even bother opening. The quality of the picture and sound was that bad.

He is in a class by himself when it comes to his own brand of artistic, atmospheric, ambient, creative, avante-garde free Jazz. There is much to love here as this album is an experience of constant textural changes and shifting aural collages! The other musicians on this disc are also of the highest order and overall I can't say much else other than YOU NEED THIS ALBUM!!!! Be sure to also check out other Alex Cline releases, especially Continuation, Montsalvat, The Other Shore and Sparks Fly Upward as He truly is a one-of-a-kind percussionist and songwriter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is My Favorite Concert DVD","review":"I concur with the reviewer who states that this is the best concert DVD that he owns. It is also the best one in my collection. Debborah Harry is at her best in this DVD -- which was recorded in 1999. Debbie's voice is full and rich, and she has more control of it than she did when younger. In the post-Blondie period, Debbie sang with a jazz band, and I believe this helped sharpen her vocal skills. The men play better than ever -- better than they did back in the 1970's. The talented drummer Clem Burke is particularly impressive. Much of the music from the late 1970's and early 1980's hasn't aged well, but Blondie's songs, most of which were composed by Debbie and her fellow band members, sound as fresh and new as they did during the band's heyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Quality","review":"This is very low quality.

I let my little one hold it for a few minutes and when I took it back the spinning part in the middle of the globe had come loose so none of it works now.

They included a whole mess of guests and so none of the tracks really sound like all De La Soul, but rather a joint project. I just miss the days of song after song of De La with a guest here and there, but not enough to take away from their style. This album also lacks a solid core like 3 feet and De La Soul is Dead had.. instead it ends up like a bunch of individual projects with other MCs... sorry, there just aren't enough of the Plugs here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for improvement","review":"I have always looked to De La for an escape from the average shoot 'em up rap garbage that is littering the airways.

Ouch!!","review":"I never know what to expect from De La, and I definetly wasn't expecting this. After waiting 4 years, they could have definitely done a better job. After hearing the first single, \\"Oooh\\" I was expecting great things from Art Official. However, that is the best cut on the album. None of the guest rappers seem to fit in. Originality was why De La was great. This album seems to just go by a formula similar to all other rap albums. They were once pioneers, now they seem to be just followers. As the first part of their so-called trilogy album, I hope they change things up on part 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"This new one from De la is blazing.....dont pass this up!","review":"I heard this cd through a friend and I have to say that after I heard it I regret not getting it for myself.

This album is the most commercialized failed attempt at being hip hop. This album is plain wack. I've listened to this album more than a dozen times, and I hate more everytime. Everybody is going commercial, and it makes me sick to my stomach. The only thing I can go over in De La's favor, is they have paid their dues in hip hop, and if the want to get extra chedda then thats their business. The down side is as more mc/groups justify selling out for more money, we have no more hip hop."},{"rating":"1","title":"no no no.............","review":"this cannot be de la soul it cant be.

And don't think I was hoping they'd be remaking another 3 Feet High or De La Soul is Dead. I was hoping they'd grown. Stakes Is High gave promise of a change, and that change has come. Too bad it's a severe digression. There is no longer anything that sets De La Soul apart from the ubiquitous hip-hop garbage that rules the radio airwaves in teenagers rooms. With groups like Blackalicious, Jurrasic 5, and Kool Keith's many incarnations, why couldn't De La come up with something at least as original as these? The answer, I'm afraid, is that they are tired of being creative and ready to start making some money.Reading the sleeve of this album, I noticed they plan to \\"remix and remaster\\" 3 Feet High & Rising. If they ruin that monumental album with anything close to the throw-away work done on Art Official Intelligence, they will also ruin all credibility they've ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"For tha inner soul, ya'll","review":"after all these years, de la soul proved that you could make true hip hop music without resorting to the same tired cliches. i like the fact that they have never subjected themselves to trends and have always made music that came from their mind and heart...their style of rap has spawned countless imitators: arrested development, digable planets, and most recently black eyed peas. but there is only one de la. listen to this and hear why they are still the bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The only reason I see why any true De La or Native Tongues fan would give this album a good rating is nostalgia. De La was incredible, but this album simply is not. It does not flow, and the beats are only beats. It is not the music that people who don't even like hip hop can fall in love with. I can only compare this album with Q-Tip's solo release last year. They are both incredibly disappointing and leave me wishing that they had not released them so that the wonderful careers of some of my favorite artists would not be tainted. Buy '3 Feet High and Rising' and 'Midnight Marauders' for the greatest hip hop ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"tight yo","review":"dang what can i say, this album iz off tha hook.

Too many cameos, but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many cameos...are you kidding me?","review":"This is the hottest rap album of the year by far. De la Soul shows that they can still put out great jams with songs like My Rights, I C Yall, Oohhh, and All Good. Okay, so they got a little help on those songs...big deal. That is what rap is about. Collaboration of talents. The cameos definatly do not take away from the De la Soul sound. This album is great for parties or cruisin in your car.

I assume that this is the \\"mosaic\\" aspect of this album, but it still bothered me. I must agree with one of the reviewers below and say that the \\"mosaic\\" has made this an uneven album, too much outside influence pulling the feel of it to and fro. (no pun there) De La, when they get a chance to really work, are still as brilliant as ever, though. So don't worry about that. Even so, too many cooks spoil the broth, ya dig? Worst of all were/are Mike D and Adrock from Beastie Boys, they just embarrassed themselves on this album; highschool lyricism and the same hallmark screaming-at-eachother style that I have grown to hate. Ugh. Please, Plugs, if you happen to read this, keep AOI's 2 and 3 \\"in house,\\" 'cos it keeps you from shining like you should!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mozaic thud","review":"De La ain't having very much fun anymore, and it REALLY show on this one. Better than it's predecesor \\"Stakes it High\\", but absolute poopy when you put it up against their first three disks. True, their lyrics still blow away 97 percent of the other acts, but they're even weak in that department this time around. Most of this record smacks of 'a desperate attempt to get their cruddy music played on the radio.'They've only got five records out total. It's much too early for them to tread water.Here's hoping volume two and the rumored reunion with Prince Paul will set them back on course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abide With Me","review":"I enjoyed Abide With Me. It has a beautiful pace and took me back in time. I would read other books by Elizabeth Strout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abide with Me","review":"Excellent. She demonstrates in this earlier novel the gifts that will mature in her latest book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I didn't even like this book until more than halfway through it. And then, I only went ahead and finished it because I was curious where the characters would end up in their situations.This novel was not satisfying; I did not finish the last page with a \\"wow,\\" or \\"that was a great book\\" and have no drive to continue reading about the characters. I really did not end up getting attached to any of the characters; I don't feel they were fleshed out enough.Meh."},{"rating":"2","title":"The muse was here","review":"A Jewish friend gave me the book with a hearty recommendation. She had read Olive Kitteridge and loved it while I was neutral about that novel, so I was surprised when I found that I couldn't put down ABIDE WITH ME. This rare novel of a clergyman-- privy to the secrets of so many but at a loss to unveil that of his child--felt authentic. I already want to read it again, to see exactly how Strout conjures her magic. I sense that Strout didn't plot the novel to the nth degree,but depended on the muse to help her out as she went along. The ending was satisfying--at once strange, in character, and plausible. I enjoyed the theological discussions, being an admirer of Bonhoeffer, but some readers might feel they go on too long and too admiringly although that is remedied at the end. The portrait of the minister's wife was a marvel! This book would make a marvelous choice for a church book club."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abide With Me Gives an Intimate Treatment of Village Life, and Ourselves","review":"Elizabeth Strout's Abide With Me is an intimate treatment of contemporary American village life--the gossips, the sinners, the sinners who believe themselves to be saints, and the flawed preacher trying desperately to point them all toward the light. As a minister's wife, I burst into tears more than once because of the author's ability to see into the burdens of ministry life. As a novelist, I laughed out loud for the joy of Strout's power over her craft. She is a gift to literature and deserves her Pulitzer.Patricia Hickman author ofThe Pirate QueenandPainted Dresses: A Novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perplexed by the glowing reviews","review":"I liked Amy & Isabelle so I looked forward to reading this latest work. I will give anyone credit for being able to write- it takes a lot of disclipine to sit down and craft a story (hence the two stars). However, this particular story really bored me. I found the overall tone to be pretty dark and depressing. Perhaps b/c I just came off reading a pretty inspiring book (Eat Pray Love), this book seemed really sad and slow to me.I'm really not getting all the strong reviews here. Its an easy book to read, but I ended up not caring about any of the characters, not liking the town, and overall tired of the book. I was glad when it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"As well written as Olive Kitteridge","review":"I have read two other books by Elizabeth Strout: Amy and Isabelle and her award-winning best seller Olive Kitteridge. They were all exceptionally well-written books. All 3 had \\"mini-stories\\" going on around the main plot (in the case of Abide with Me, the plot is about a minister and his family). After reading Olive Kitteridge, I sought out the other books by Ms. Strout. I read Olive Kitteridge without knowing it was a best seller. Halfway through, I looked up Elizabeth Strout on the web, because I was sure it was Pulitzer-winning quality.Some of Strout's characters are likeable, some are horrible. But they all blend together to create exceptional stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after Amy and Isabelle","review":"A letdown after her first novel, which to me was a real page turner. This book is VERY slow starting; I was half-way through and I really didn't know where it was going! Very unsympathetic characters in the townspeople with Tyler's character not very clearly drawn, apart from his reglious beliefs, which he didn't seem to have a strong hold on. I would have liked to know more about Lauren and her early life. Not much better than an OK read, I'm afraid - won't keep you up nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Describing a whole world in a few words, as someone said, and such a resonating world - this is what great literature is made of.I couldn't put this book down. This is a writer with a sure grasp of the relationships between men and women, our foolish and guileless hopes and disappointments, how the landscape of our lives is reflected by everything around us. Every word in this book is true, even though it is fiction.The ending of the book doesn't disappoint, either. Truly a marvelous work that will live in my mind for quite awhile.I think it deserves 6 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the last third of this book.","review":"I adored this author's \\"Amy and Isabelle\\" from cover to cover;I didnt start to love this book until the last 1/3. At first the characters were, to me, unlikable, and the cruelty across the board hard to take. If you can hang in there, the story of this minister's painful journey becomes beautiful and inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful novel","review":"This is truly a great book. This book is about life and human nature and it so well written and has so much meaning. I think Elizabeth Strout is on par with Fitzgerald and other great writers who delve into the grittiness of life. But this is in no way a depressing book. It is just the opposite. One of the best novels I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This book was among several on the \\"Free-Help Yourself\\" table at the library. The blurbs on the back cover made it sound interesting and I wondered if it had been placed on the table by mistake. Au contraire. The writing was uneven and, in places ugly. It reads as if Ms. Strout had resurrected some old papers from a religious history course and tried to incorporate them into a story sequence while visiting a locker room. She seemed to be striving for \\"holy\\" with many references to Bonhoeffer and cheap vs. costly grace, but her plot was weak with threads that went nowhere and the result was more \\"holey\\" than holy. Characters were wooden, not fleshed out and inserted awkwardly. Search elsewhere for grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I love Elizabeth Strout and very much enjoyed this book; read this after Olive Kittredge. Highly recommended; a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and insightful","review":"I love this author and all 3 of her books. She has clearly drawn characters and intelligent plot development. I am anxious for her next novel due in the Spring."},{"rating":"1","title":"No redeeming features","review":"This is a very bad book. It is poorly written, the characters are caricatures in misery, and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter, who suffers in silence after the devastating, and, to her, mysterious, death of her mother. Her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter. He is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child's behavior, which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response, rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion. He fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break. I couldn't finish this. It is drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have read in 5 years","review":"After reading the accolades about Amy and Isabelle, I was truly looking forward to reading Abide with Me. But I can honestly say that it is the worst book that I have read in years. Here I was hoping that perhaps it was a Jodi Picoult or a Sue Miller....but it ended up being a hard-covered Harlequin Romance. The story was shoddy...it was written for someone in a nursing home. The best page was the last page. Thank god....I am done the book. Definitely do not recommend...except for someone born in 1920."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very interesting character study...but...","review":"It goes nowhere...and I mean nowhere.

Pick up a different book...life is too short to read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"cold and boring","review":"Wow, the rave reviews were puzzling. I do respect that other readers have differing opinions and taste in books. I read about 2 novels a week and about all sorts of different subjects. Obviously there is no need to repeat what the story is about, but the bottom line is what an incredible bore the story turned out to be. I forced myself to finish it because I kept waiting for it to get better and it didn't. Not really anyway. The end was annoyingly predictable, also.Ms. Strout, I've no doubt you are a good writer. Just that this time this book wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed!","review":"What could have been a wonderful read, and a well-written story, was interspersed with detailed, pornographic accounts of one man's sexual infidelity. Stout is a good enough writer to have gotten her point across without the obscenities.I would love to be able to recommend the book to others, as the story was otherwise nicely done, but those sections have made me choose to not recommend it.What a disappointment.

There needs to be a fresh documentary from someone that wouldn't have just worshiped FDR like so many people did. This excuse for a man hurt our country in so many ways.Roosevelt either wanted to start a Stalinist revolution or he just didn't have a clue.

Sure enough when I received the scale and opened the packaging, there was no needle on the dial. A slight shake confirmed that the needle dislodged and was loose inside the scale. As I am stationed in South Korea, returning the item would have been more of a hassle than just junking it. I opened it up (thus voiding the warranty) and retrieved the needle. After some painstaking problem solving to figure out how to reattach the springs that hold the two pieces of the scale together, I was back in business, or so I thought. The scale needs to be massively adjusted every time someone gets on and off of it. I just placed a water bottle with exactly 24 ounces of water in it, 1 1/2 pounds, on the scale and the needle didn't even attempt to move. This thing is worthless. Save your money.

I've had it and used it daily for over two weeks now, and it returns exactly to zero every time.I agree with some other reviewers that the per-pound lines are a little difficult to read, but even in dim light without my glasses, it's not hard to judge where the indicator lies between the five-pound lines and get my weight to the nearest pound. If you need more than one-pound precision, you will have to go for a digital scale.I would definitely buy this scale again, especially at the price it's going for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this scale!","review":"This is the best scale we have ever owned! It is big and sturdy, it doesn't tip over sideways when you put your first foot on it. I love scales without batteries, and it seems they are less common these days.

Brad Knight should never have been allowed to print this book of bias and his editor should have known better to help in this projects.

I couldn't care less about when and where he bought his home, what he would have said or done if he were Scott Peterson, or how he would have handled the defense differently. Besides, the fact that he was not only picking up women during his volunteer work in the search for Laci, but that he was dim enough to share this less than admirable fact with the reader speaks volumes.

This should still be in print!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FEEL the Sound of Masayoshi YAMAZAKI","review":"It's my favourit CD album, \\"transit time\\" (releaed on '01) by Masayoshi Yamazaki. He's one of the most famous Japanese singers. I REALLY like him! Because the sound he makes by the acoustic guitar is so nice & cool and it makes me relaxed as if I were flying inthe sky. In addition, it makes me excited! Of course, his voice is also col! The highlights for me are 02 & 09. No wonder you will share the same feeling of me once you listen to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus Seminar Gone Deconstructionally Amuck","review":"Yikes! Scott's aproach to the parables of Jesus is part commentary on IF there are His parables, and part deconstruction of said parables. How many people are comfortable with the idea of Jesus telling bawdy stories?Scott, like so many of his colleagues in the Society of Biblical Literature, are so interested in seeming \\"objective\\" in approaching Scripture, they treat it with less respect than they would any other peice of ancient literature. When was the last time you heard of a Q source for Homer? Or of multiple authors for The Republic? Or a discussion of which lines of The Frogs are original to the play's author? These guys want to look intellectual, but end up looking petty."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing childhood","review":"This is such an interesting book.

I've had error messages and jamming for 3, even after they \\"repaired\\" it. For the last six months, it'll freeze up once a day, sometimes after I make one espresso, sometimes before I can make any. Now it doesn't work at all. The metal puck part is jammed up high inside. Not sure if it's bad engineering or inferior materials or both. But for $1200, it should last more than four freaking years. You've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love our J-5","review":"When we have already owned or used several Jura Capresso Automatic Coffee Centers, it is difficult to come up with more superlatives. This machine is at or near the top of our experience with many European coffee machines. It grinds fresh coffee beans, tamps automatically either one cup or two cups worth, then brews the coffee to our own taste and measure, then disposes of the used coffee grounds,in less than 30 seconds. From bean to cup espresso, coffee, cappucino, cafe latte, and even makes hot water for tea, faster than a microwave.What a great Swiss invention. Completely programable and infinitely adjustable for coffee fanatics. Simple enough for the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This movie is one of the best I've seen yet. It's goteverything from stunt screw ups to supercross crashes to homefootage. At the end it has some real hard-core riding that makes you just want to stop the tape and go riding yourself. I especialy enjoyed the raw home video footage that made me look like pro...LOL! This tape combines some real hard-core action with a great soundtrack and a touch of humor.

There have been few series that combined casting and script together such as Band of Brothers, Deadwood, that you plan ahead to catch the next episode. The change by Mr. White and Jesse (aka: Dumb & Dumber) from the start is hilarious and dark. I hope that the second part of the series is offered by Amazon soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkest yet!","review":"The story line in season five is probably the darkest of all the seasons. Walt and Jesse, who have always managed to maintain some sense of morals and values, - a quality which has kept them likeable and real - are close to losing touch with who they were in season 5. Am particularly troubled by the \\"say my name\\" episode in which Walt exalts himself into some kind of meth cook god status.

It's hard to believe that it's only been eight months since the season four finale yet every important plot point, every dialogue still remains fresh in my mind. It's a testament to how well written this show is. I've purchased the past four seasons with the season pass from another competitor but have been leaning towards getting season five from Amazon simply due to the poor customer service I've experience with \\"the other guys\\" in the past (episodes being 2-3 days late without explanation). For me, the season pass is the way to go. No commercial breaks, HD quality, no space taken up on your DVR, and the accessibilty to watch it on your laptop next to your bed or at the airport.

I have a copy I burned from the DVR, so I am set for now. If you notice, the season 4 price is under 20 bucks now for a NEW set. I am just going to be patient and scoop one of these up when it is a DEAL!!!!I am still smoldering over this show (or Mad Men) NOT getting Best Series last time around--and no other awards ('cept Pinkman) for acting.

I do not understand. It was as well written, acted and conceived as all previous seasons. For me, it was hard to watch without thinking in the back of my mind, 'this is the end,' which sometimes kept me from really being in the moment with the show. I think the progression of Walt's character was very believable, as was Jesse's. It hard to contrive an ending to a series, but I think the writers did a great job of it. Definitely, if you've enjoyed the four previous seasons, purchase this final installment. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the DVD or Blu-Ray","review":"Great show!

I watched the first 4 seasons of Breaking Bad on Netflix and was completely satisfied. I have been unable to understand virtually any of episodes 1 & 2 of season 5, and have completely given up with even trying to watch the remaining 6 episodes. Additionally, I experienced frequent periods where there were 30 seconds of streaming followed by 15 seconds of downloading then another brief period of streaming followed by more downloading. These cycles often went on for 8 - 10 minutes. I would not recommend Amazon.com digital downloads to anyone. As far as the content of Breaking Bad Season 5, I gave it one star due to both audio and video problems which made the 2 episodes incomprehensible to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"The quality of Amazon's video is much inferior to Netflix on my Roku device.I opted for the more expensive HD version of Breaking Bad on Amazon Prime, but the quality was miserable.

I chose the standard definition stream because I live in Seattle and knew that the 9.5% sales tax would amp up my cost which it did and as a senior living on a fixed income I need to save where I can.

Now what?The only thing that sucks is that AMC is drawing this out until next summer. What happens if 2012 predictions come true?

I cannot say enough about Breaking Bad. Unless scrambled and/or misrepresented in some nefarious fashion, any Breaking Bad clippage is good Breaking Bad clippage.

Pro: The acting is excellent, the photography is fabulous (very creative), and the sound is outstanding. Con: Like the 007 evolution, the situations have (sometimes) morphed from earlier creative reality (or semi-reality) to later cartoon-like fantacy which, for me, disables suspension of disbelief. That said, all taken together, the production is is ground-breakung art, well worth watching (and I may be comparatively over-sensitive to the cartoonish aspects). I recomment Breaking Bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Show!","review":"I got hooked on 'Breaking Bad' after it was recommended on FB by a friend. i loved it from episode1. i watched the first 4 seasons on Netflix, but season 5 wasn't available but I noticed on the 'Breaking Bad' website that amazon.com had them so I purchased the whole season for a little under $14.00.

I just found out about this show over the holidays. I watched the first four seasons on Netflix. This is the most well written, well acted TV series I have ever watched. Absolutely amazing. I was depressed when I finished season four and there were no more episodes to watch. I went to AMC and figure I could watch the first part of season five. They did not release it and it wasn't on Netflix. I was desperate. I then found out Amazon had it and ordered from my laptop. It was then super easy to pair up my TV with my Amazon purchase. As of this writing, I'm through episode four. Got four more to go before depression sets in again. If you have not seen this show, start at season one and go through them all.

Instead of illustrations it uses photos (except for the whales, some illustrations). I almost passed on it because I wasn't used to seeing these kinds of photographs in a field guide: they are digitally edited and have the appearance of being cut out and pasted onto the white pages. However, it soon became clear that the photos are of exceptional quality and could beat out the competetion as far as completeness of subject matter. For example: there are about fifty photos of chipmunks; there are photos of both morphs of the Arctic Fox in summer and winter. Two variations of the blue phase are shown in summer coat. The pups for both colors are included.The book is designed well, with the text most of the time to the left of the corresponding pictures. Fun, interesting, informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This product is a raw list of vocabulary words accompanied by a reading of them on the CD. There are three main drawbacks to this program:1. It is an ineffective way of learning vocabulary. Try a program that combines vocabulary with dialogue.

The vocabulary words are antiquated and far from being commonly used... or so say my Korean language exchange partners.3. The vocabulary lists switch from English-Korean to Korean-English.

Great characters, great romance, a nice minor suspense storyline. Just an all-around enjoyable romance read.The romance was by far the biggest aspect of the book. Zane and Tamara are a great couple. And their scenes together are very, very hot. This is definitely one of the better erotic romances that I've read. It's sexy and sensual without being crass or just about sex. It's about the characters connecting and being drawn helplessly to each other. True, Foster doesn't quite do justice to the emotional bond, but I don't think the story suffers all that much.I loved the side characters of Luna, Joe and Tamara's family. They were great, and I enjoyed the cameo's from the other 3 Winston brothers. Also, the small suspense angle gave the story some nice added depth, making the book more well-rounded.Overall, a good read if you want a sexy romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Is Right","review":"Steamy hot love, mysterious, and at time funy plot line makes for an extrordinarily delicious novel.Also recommended: Fire In The Ice by Katlyn Stewart,Born O'Hurley by Nora Roberts and Impossible By Danielle Steel"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I LOVED this book. I loved it so much that I had to reread it as soon as I finished it the first time. I'm especially gratified to see a heroine who knows what she wants and goes after it instead of waiting for things to work themselves out. Go Tamara!The love scenes are steamy and the general chemistry between Zane and Tamara is wonderful.I find that I either hate books by Lori Foster (ie. 'Casey'-- what a huge disappointment) or love them and I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed 'Wild' and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY","review":"This was my first LF book, and definitely the last. A shallow plot, with Zane getting ...page one and stayes that way until doomsday, boring ang sometimes very stupid dialogues and a very s-l-o-w progress on the story line convinced me to give up after about 150 pages. True, there was a lot of talking and thinking abouy sex, and usually I like it very much in a book - but the problem here was there wasn't anything beside it, and I prefer something more in my heroes [it's a little habbit of mine...].To sum up: Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is SOOO Bad","review":"This truly is one of the most vapid romances I've ever read.

The three prior short stories about the other brother's were very fun reads. I love romantic suspense, which at times can be very enveloping. So, for a nice light read, the short stories were perfect. But \\"Wild\\" took me right back, having been a great balance of romance and suspense. It's jam-packed with both. The characters were outrageously wonderful; you'll fall in love with both of them. One of the things I love about this author is you don't have to forge through a number of paragraphs to get to the actual couple's interaction in the story. And her books seem to make you feel like you've spent every moment of the days passed through the book with the characters, being able to learn about them thoroughly.

MWNG continues on in their tradition of taking pop based songs and infusing all different styles.The album is written in the groups native tongue Welsh. At first I thought this might take away from the albums appeal, but SFAs hooks are so catchy that it makes little difference. The albums songs tend to be generally alittle slower than their past efforts. They have replaced much of the house music influence of past albums, with slower grooves, accoustic guitars, and trumpets. This change is a welcome one since it allows the brilliant songwriting to shine through.This really is an amazing album by an amazing band, defently worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Placid Casual","review":"If you aren't a follower of super furry fuzzy logic Mwng isn't the best place to start. Sung entirely in Welsh Mwng is SFA continuing down their different river. Mwng is however sonicaly beautiful. It runs the gamit on what SFA can due with sound, which seems to be limitless. Fans of past SFA albums should find Mwng, as with anything SFA seems to due, a very rewarding listen.on a side note I had the chance to see em' live in Detroit.... These guys aren't considered one of the best live acts in the UK for nothing. They played alot of tracks off Mwng which i found just as enjoyable as the English songs they did. SFA are simply stunning live see them if you have the chance. Studio perfection is one thing, but to see them pull it off live was a real thrill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best album so far!","review":"Mwng is a masterpiece!

Calimero in particular is one of their biggest anthems, and is good enough for me to name myself after it. As for the actual album, it is their most delightful effort so far, despite being sung completely in welsh. the blatant pop songs like ymaelodi ar ymylon and ysbediau heulog are like beach boys on acid, but the last song which i won't even attempt to type in here is the best one here. which is quite some achievement.PS: I want $50"},{"rating":"1","title":"they've lost it...","review":"I bought this record hoping to receive a bit of weirdness and originality and having now listened to it I have to say that it really labbs big time! For a start (sorry to all you Furries followers out there), it's almost entirely unoriginal and just seems to copy so many other albums (most notably \`Mezzanine' by fellow Bristolians MASSIVE ATTACK) and from start to finish it's totally LABBING MAN!!!! I just don't see how they were signed to Mo Wax in the first place. The Furries' sound is very overdone and I think they spent far too much cash on the production. They are clearly trying to be a part of the scene pioneered by Mogwai/Blink 182.

Take into account Clarence Reid's hundreds of writing & production credits on Southern R&B and Miami Funk hits of 1960's & 1970's and you have yet another look at an American Original; a talented, quirky, ground-breaking artist paid too little and unsung for way too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have piece of collection","review":"If you are really a Blind Guardian fan, you definitely think \\"Imaginations from the Other Side\\" is one of the best albums this band ever recorded.

I actually thought that the band must have undergone a huge lineup change, the music was so different and uninspiring. Unfortunately this is the same lineup from \\"Born Tired\\", so I can't explain why I found this CD so lacking.One thing I can say is pick up \\"The Wierd Set\\". That disc smokes. Then if you like it you can pick up \\"Born Tired\\" and only then would I pick this one up.

My daughter walked away with nothing new, and was totally bored watching it. It is definitely not fit for anyone over 3 - saying it's good for up to 5 is crazy - my 5 year old was bored to tears. And frankly, I'm not sure anyone under 2.5 would be interested in watching it either - so it's just not fast paced enough nor does it provide enough information to be worthwhile.

Unlike the previous book I had just read (\\"Old School\\" -- blah!), \\"The Year of Ice\\" had substance. The narrator, Kevin, an 18-year-old, came to life immediately. He enjoyed dark humor and sarcasm -- two of my favorite traits! -- and it was readily evident from the \\"get-go.\\" His observations throughout the book (in thought and verbalized) felt so real. He would think one thing, but say another. The entire book felt like watching a movie made from a book by Bret Easton Ellis -- \\"American Psycho\\" and \\"Rules of Attraction\\" -- because of the detail of observation. The writer, Brian Malloy, captured the 70s to a \\"T\\" and went into painful -- yet humorous -- detail about what it feels like as a teenager and feeling like you're the only one who has feelings for the same sex. I can't wait to read Malloy's next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Wonderful first person point of view, great dialogue, and the stakes are always high. With just the right amount of comedy as the action rises, you have a truly brilliant novel. Once you're done, you'll hope for a sequel...Trust me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I grew up in the 70's and this book feels so real!","review":"This book is so true to the era, the music, the expressions, the drugs and the parties. The fact that Kevin is a gay teenager adds even more complicated dimensions to the already complicated task of growing up in a dysfunctional household. This book will touch you without being sentimental or full of cliches. The humor is just right, even in the midst of serious issues. It also gives a voice to gay teenagers all over the world, who struggle with the same issues that straight kids deal with and then more. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop reading this and ...","review":"... scroll back up to \\"Add to Cart\\". This is a terrific novel with wonderful characters, witty dialogue and an interesting plot. Warning: you will be hooked on Kevin Doyle and will eagerly anticipate the sequel because Malloy leaves us hanging about Kevin's, uh, well, you need to read it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginner","review":"An almost unreadable first attempt by Mr. Malloy. Makes one wonder whether the publishing houses are lowering their standards these days. Unless you are a friend or relative of the author, I cannot imagine you feeling happy about spending the money to buy and read this amateurish work."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNDERATED GENIUS!","review":"People always associate Don Johnson as being the actor on Miami Vice. And most of these people will not even give his music a chance. They see him on tv with his short blond hair,Sunglasses and pink shirts and see a man in love with himself. But If they would just listen to this album (And Heartbeat) they would be blown away by his talent! He really sounds just like Freddie Mercury of the band \\"Queen\\"....If you listen to the sound samples for the \\"Queen\\" songs \\"A Kind Of Magic, Radio Ga Ga, Innuendo,etc\\" You will not be able to tell the difference between them! Don Has a Magical Voice...Just like Freddie!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet as honey!","review":"I defenetly recomend this album or any of DJ's CD's to anyone!! This guy just do it!!!

You woun't regret getting this album...I just luv every song on it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor follow up album.","review":"Don Johnson's second release here comes nowhere closeto being as good as his first album Heartbeat.Other People's Lives and Angel City are theonly very good songs on here.Don's first album is a 4 star release, so gobuy that instead and then this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly intriguing piece...","review":"This book was not what I had expected, but it turned out to be better than what I thought. I definitely enjoyed the characters in the story as well as the plot, as ridiculous as it may seem to some. Jim Whorton is a great writer and instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whorton's wise debut","review":"My feeling after reading this book is that J. Whorton will be writing and publishing books for a long time and that we probably ought to feel grateful. Approximately Heaven has a weirdo quirky voice that seems wise despite being slightly out of touch (which perhaps is an interesting comment overall on wisdom). The story is good and has lots of surprises.

It was well worth the time invested, particularly since it clarified some of the scenes in the movie. I was surprised to discover that the author's intention in writing this book was to portray the concepts he had researched about the possibility of life after death, and what the experience might be light. Although the author makes the point in the preface that his intentions were more to illustrate the many beliefs that he explored from various times in world history, I still thought the story was an entertaining read. Well worth my time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"get the book","review":"The movie is good but the book is so much better. But you already knew that.

After that, I re-read it many times, until a friend did not return the book. But now, thanks to Amazon...The experiences described in the book are so positive - therefor I am not surprised that this book is described as 'dangerous' from a religious point of view.However, that is not always the case - does anybody remember Jacob's Ladder?Thank you for a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and absolutely beautiful","review":"This novel was the first to ever bring tears to my eyes.

Thank you Mr. Matheson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives plausable answers to questions on the after life","review":"I am not a prolific book reader, this book I read nearly 15 years ago, and did not put it down untill I had finished it. The images it left have stayed with me all this time, I have recently tried to get another copy of this book so I can re-read it. I will keep trying."},{"rating":"1","title":"His view of Heaven is hellish","review":"After reading Richard Matheson's \\"What Dreams May Come\\" I must say that I'm glad his push for the afterlife is not based upon reality. Yes, he has an extensive bibliography, but it is not complete - it is biased.As I read this book I kept thinking, \\"If heaven were truly like this, it's awful\\". Chris, the main character, is tormented there by his thoughts about his wife and therefore cannot obtain any sense of peace. There was no homecoming, no greeting or welcome upon his entrance. He was alone with a dog.The way Matheson writes, the books come across more like he is trying to sell something rather than as a story. I really got tired of it quickly.While many criticize the Christian view of Heaven, at least there one can experience peace, freedom from torment, and enjoy eternal life with others who have been faithful to Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other Life-after-death explorations","review":"A previous reviewer already mentioned two of the books I consider superior/more entertaining to this, i.e., \\"Job:...\\" by Heinlein and \\"The Great Divorce\\" by C.S. Lewis. To this, I would only add some of Mark Twain's essays, available in \\"The Bible according to Mark Twain\\". You're better off with any of the three. (See the movie though...:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Poor Book Indeed","review":"I hope anyone with a taste for a well-constructed piece of literature with characters of some depth and interest will forego the waste of time that this book will entail because it really doesn't work. A hopeless hodgepodge of pseudo theology and philosphy wherein the main character is merely a mouthpiece for the writer's lame ideas of the 'afterlife'. No matter what the individual readers' wish list is for that land after death, a writer of fiction is reasonably responsible for a clear sense of some purpose and direction for the characters which this book has not. It is very boring and repetetive. The only imaginative section being the trip through hell which is very short and quite lame compared with Dante or even Larry Niven in their respective Infernos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blather","review":"This book was one of the most annoying I've read in a long time. The character Chris was such a whiner! He could not be happy - anywhere - not even in Summerland (Heaven), which seemed pretty awesome. If Chris and his wife were such soulmates, then he should have been more patient and willing to accept the fact that they would be together eventually.All the talk of 'vibrations' and 'spiritual transcendance' was just new age psycho-babble. And Mr. Matheson seemed inclined to describe them ad-infinitum.I believe in true love, and I do not doubt in the existence of a heaven/hell, but the description of these offered by Mr. Matheson does not ring true."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Personal Opinion","review":"Richard Matheson is a very talented and precise author. [If you're not a Christian, feel free to skip the rest of this review]. This book specifically and viciously attacks Christianity at the finale. It was not for me and I regret reading it. I recommend Heaven by Randy Alcorn for a far more positive image of Heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't as good as I hoped it would be","review":"At times, this book was intriguing and interesting. And I must give the author credit -- considering this was written in the 70's, long before the life after death phase. However, the book drug on and on and by the end, it had gotten a bit silly. Some people may enjoy the love story aspect of it. I found the \\"soulmate\\" love story idea to be a bit sappy and over done. I also found myself skipping through large sections of this man telling this woman how much he loved her and remembering long boring moments together. The first half is definately the best and the ending leaves you with a feeling of incompleteness. A good read -- worth it if you have nothing else to read and definately worth it for the bio list in the back. However, don't plan to keep this one on your shelf to re-read time and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting life after death...dream or reality?","review":"Richard Matheson hooked me right from the beginning. I devoured this book in a day. Easy to read, and a wonderful love story. The bibiliography at the back of the book is extensive, which shows Matheson did a huge amount of research on the topic of Summerland, and life after death.I've done other more recent reading of the afterlife, and its plausibility becomes more of a fact in my mind. The love story between Chris and Ann makes one long for love of that kind, on earth and in Heaven. A wonderfully uplifting read, though the end did not go exactly as I would have liked.I recommend this book to those interested in learning what may be waiting for us when we die...and in Matheson's words...it sounds wonderful. I give this book 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me cry","review":"I first saw this movie when i was about 17 or 18. Loved it, i mean, i would watch it everyday and not get sick of it. I mean the visuals are amazing, the love that chris and annie have for each other is what i want in my own life. Anyways, i just recently rented wdmc the deluxe verison and in the extras there was the this guy talking. Come to find out he was the author. So the next day i went out and bought it. I just finished it and i would have to say that the book changed my mind about alot of things. I think the book was well written. Sometimes to much detail, but thats not a bad thing. The only thing i would have liked more was if annie had more of a role in the book. I mean i know chris thought of her constantly, but she wasnt as big of a character as she should or could have been. But, other that than the book was definetly worth it. I will read it again and again. This whole book makes you sit back and think about what is really important in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Dreams May Come","review":"I was somewhat disappointed with What Dreams May Come, especially the way the book ends. Parts of it were interesting, but the overall tone left something to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think","review":"Only halfway finished, but so far so good. It's a book club read so it's been interesting! I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I can see why some people wouldn't enjoy this book but I think it is a masterpiece. You rarely find books that stimulate your imagination and make you think about what it is you believe in and what is important in life. It is a true love story without the usual beginning and ending. I found it inspirational. The movie is out now too. Don't miss that or this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was great but the movie was greater","review":"I saw the movie and loved it so much I wanted to read the book. I loved the book from cover to ... well, almost to the back cover. But when the Powers That Be send his wife into reincarnation I thought, \\"Oh, no! A loving God couldn't do that. The power of love is greater than that.\\" And this is precisely, in my opinion, why the screenwriters abandoned the author's ending and went with the Power of Love.Otherwise, the book and the movie both show what many ministers ignore: Can anyone forget his spouse after his body has died? Can I go to one place in the spiritual world while the one I love the most goes to another place? What worse hell could there be? So this book should wake up Christian theologians to think about what the limitations of salvation are -- or at least as they are commonly taught."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 STARS! 5 STARS! 5 STARS! 5 STARS! 5 STARS!","review":"I made a boo-boo on my review last time, this was a GREAT book! For anyone who read my review last time, multiply that one star by 1,000!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is one of the greatest books that I have evr read. O.K., so it's not Dante, or Moore, or whomever, but Matheson never claimed to be. Read it as a book -one that can enlighten your mind and help you look at things in a different way -not MAKE you look at things in a different way. One of the lasting messages in this book is that IT'S ALL IN YOUR MIND, HOW YOU THINK OF THINGS, AND YOU, AND YOU ALONE, DECIDE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO THINK. Yep, Dante was pretty damn insightful, but even HE didn't have the PERFECT THOUGHTS.... ARE THERE ANY?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A downward spiral into literary hell","review":"Oh, wow, did this book start off wonderfully! But guess what? The sheer joy ended about a hundred pages before the end, comparable to the sort of silence that falls after someone cuts a loud fart. Get it? Don't bother! I should probably sue for my money back and tack on damages for mental anguish. Ew, ick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes Itself Way Too Seriously","review":"This book is incredibly preachy and sees itself as the real authority on life after death. Even in the introduction Matheson asserts that the majority of the book is factual. It's more like Matheson developed some theories and \\"great lines of dialogue\\" that he forced into the mouths of his characters.The movie adaptation knew exactly what to pick up and what to leave out. The movie really is better.The book did have some captivating parts and a few interesting ideas, but it tried to tell the reader how the afterlife is rather than how it might be. Because who really knows? Not Richard Matheson, I don't care how much research he's done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Nearly as Good as the Movie","review":"It is a strange occurrence when a book is inferior to the movie, but this proves exception to the rule. I picked up this novel after experiencing amazing film starring Robin Williams.The first thing that struck me is how Richard Matheson seems to believe this story is true and also how many people were quoted as breathlessly claiming that this book changed there life. To consider this anything more than interesting fantasy, it to relegate this book to New Age psycho-babble.To make matter worse, the characters aren't nearly as developed as in the film. Matheson also removed the subplot about the death of their children. That makes the wife's suicide more selfish and disrupts the emotional power of the story.Matheson's descriptions can't begin to describe the amazing visuals the film supplied. So in my judgement, by the DVD. Not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"New age make believe religion","review":"The author has the audacity to quote verses out of the bible, but then ignores all other references to it. He never once mentions Jesus. The thing that really is scary is that he trys to convince the reader that this is the true after life. Give me a break! If you are going to quote the bible then stay within the guidelines that God wants us to use. Jesus talks about getting to heaven by belief in Him, not by our actions and deeds on earth. Our earthly deeds will be a direct representation of our belief in leading a life as similar to Jesus as possible. The only redeeming value of the book is his description of hell. I suggest that if you want to get to heaven that you read about Jesus and leave the new-age junk alone. Try reading Left Behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEATH IS A CONTINUATION OF LIFE ON EARTH!","review":"I saw the movie first & my initial reaction was \\"Ok, cinematography was GREAT but plot is so depressing\\". When I decided to read the book, I discovered that there were a lot of areas not fully expounded nor explained in the movie. It's different when you READ -- you see what Chris is thinking; you feel what Chris is afraid of. You know his character & understand why he is where he is. I am a Catholic & believe in Heaven & Hell -- it is something we have been taught in home, school & church. Similar to Matheson's story, there is LIFE after DEATH. It is living accordingly to HIS will & reaping what you sowed during your lifetime here on earth. What's amazing to note is one person's unflatering belief & conviction to transcend boundaries of spiritual locations to save his partner... & in failure to do so, his strong willingness to suffer altogether just to be one. A true depiction of REAL & LASTING LOVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disillusion!!","review":"After having read almost all the reviews of this book I simply had to have it but frankly, I do not understand all those lyrical works. The book was a disappointment from the start with a pathetic, all-time low end. Even if Mr. Matheson likes us to believe the depiction of heaven is based on scientific research, in my view it is pure conjecture and a subjective portrayal of what perhaps he would like it to look like. As far as the book being a support for people recently bereaved as others have suggested; I think a shoulder to cry on and the loving friendship from those around us will prove to be more effective! Oh yes, like one or two others I stayed up late too to finish this book but for an entirely different reason: to be able to start reading an exciting book the next morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane and very poorly written.","review":"I listened to this on tape and only made it through because I had nothing else during a long drive. What an unappealing, one-dimensional concept; his heaven sounded like Stalinist Russia, run by a bunch of unpleasant bureaucrats. nor was his devotion to his wife convincing or moving -- an impression confirmed when he began an endless litany (one of so many in this book) thanking her for the things she had done for him-- and keeping herself clean was one of the top items. Huh? This is an unparalleled love? Please. And where were his editors? The amount of repetition he got away with was really sad.Altogether a chilling and dull book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My search has ended.......","review":"I read this book (recommended by my sister) when it was first published. Over time, we lost track of the book, and eventually forgot the title and author's name, but we never forgot the story. I've been searching book stores, flea markets, and garage sales, hoping it would just \\"show up.\\" I was more than delighted to open the recent \\"Parade\\" magazine to see Robin Williams starring in this same story. Can't wait for the movie (and my two copies of \\"What Dreams May Come\\" (one for my sister, of course)."},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining","review":"Richard Matheson is nothing if not interesting and entertaining. What Dreams May Come is very interesting and entertaining because it deals with subject matter (life after death) that is not often put into the form of a love story. Actually, the subject of life after death is not often discussed in fiction form at all. So Richard's story is refreshing. I don't buy the theory that there is life after death because I've yet to see any credible evidence for it. But I do enjoy good storytelling, and Matheson is simply as master at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definintely gives a new perspective on death.","review":"About a year before I read this book, I went through the grieving process for the first time with the death of my grandmohter. This book really helped me understand what that all means, \\"to die.\\" I also read \\"Talking to heaven\\" by James Van Praagh, and it's like the 2 authors were sitting together when they wrote their books! Even if life after death is not so, these 2 books at least make grieving a little easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite book!","review":"I first read this book in the winter of 1997 and I find myself reading this book over and over again. I was disappointed with the movie though. For once could they make a movie without changing the storyline?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ONE BOOK THAT CHANGED MY LIFE","review":"I first read this book in the early 80's while in high school. As a local hoodlum at my school, I was never interested in reading much. For reasons still unkown, I found this book in our school library and picked it up and read it. It had a strong influence on my belief of life after death and on the complete importance of life itself. I'm sure other books could have had the same impact, but this was the first one to touch me so much. I have told many people about this book and for years was unable to find it, due to being out of print. I will get a copy and keep it to pass on to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read","review":"This is simply one of the most important books I've ever read. Anyone who saw the movie might be surprised by that, but the book is a very different creature. For many people it will provide a very surprising view of what happens to us after death. While it's in the form of a novel, and a pretty engaging one, its intent is to present a compilation of a wide range of research and near-death-experience reports. Whether one believes what this research suggests or not, its ideas are worth contemplating, and it has the potential to offer great solace. As one who has worked for years in the field of the death and dying process, I think it provides an important orientation both for those caring for people who are terminally ill and for all of us who must eventually encounter life's most profound transition."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You've Seen The Movie","review":"If you enjoyed the movie then you will want to read the book. The book is much different than the movie and both are a worthy experience. Complex, detailed, and down right frightening it really gets the wheels turning as to what happens after death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad at all","review":"I bought the book after I read the great reviews here. The book was up to my expectations but there are some loopholes in the story and I agree totally that the ending was abrupt. The storyline was great with all the details of Heaven that one could possibly think of. But i sincerely think it does not deserve the full mark!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"A friend lent me this book about ten years ago. I was floored then and rushed out to buy it, only to find it was no longer in print. It's one of those rare gems that should be on everyone's shelf. The movie got the visuals right, but there wasn't a single reference to \\"Summerland,\\" only to the tired versions of heaven and hell. The scriptwriter made some significant changes to the book, some that improved the story, and others that definitely didn't. Kudos to Matheson for writing the story. It's a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two lovers torn apart by HEAVEN and HELL.","review":"WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a very out of this world,romantic book. It's about a husband and wife seperated because of the forces of heaven and hell. Chris, the husband, dies in a car accident and is sent to heaven where every thing is perfect and he could do anything, like fly and jump off a cliff and he would still be alive. To read this book you need a very big imagination because of all the descriptions of the beautiful scenes and artwork. I read the book then watched the movie and every thing was nothing I have ever imagined. If you love to read and have heard about or believe in rebirth after death this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof that \\"the book was better than the movie\\"","review":"I was reading the book when I saw the movie, but it did not spoil the ending....the movie was so Hollywoodized it failed to portray the true power of the written word. The book is outstanding! For me, I thought it helped put the existence of something greater than us, be it the traditional notion of \\"God\\" or some other named higher power, into a form that has the reader believing before he makes the conscious decision to do so. Why? It speaks without preaching. The movie is so bad I wouldn't even recommend renting it on video, but the book is so good I have several copies so I can lend it to people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book! Eye opening, tear-jerking, thought provoking!","review":"\\"What Dreams May Come\\" is perhaps one of the best books I have ever read. First, if you have seen the movie, then read the book. Though the screenplay took some liberties with the original plot, it helps to have the visual cues provided in the movie. If you haven't seen the movie, then read the book anyway! The story is very theological, giving new ideas about Heaven and Hell (it is not for the overzealous religious fanatic, because such a person would surely think the book is the work of a heretic, what with \\"auras\\" and \\"reincarnation.\\") Have an open mind, and read the book, I can promise that if you're a romantic, you'll cry. 5 Stars, no questions asked!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the Movie ! An unforgetable novel !","review":"\\" What Dreams May Come \\" is one of the best novels I've read in years. Extremely thought provoking concerning what happens to us in the afterlife and how maybe we should think about what kind of life we are living right now. If you saw the movie but didn't get much from it, you have to read the book, it is so much more than a vehicle for Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY THOUGHT PROVOKING","review":"After seeing the movie I decided to read the book obviously thinking that the book can't be as good as the movie particularly after seeing the movie first; well I was wrong, the book was far more thought provoking and you know what? I would give almost anything to see my dog again, after almost twenty years after his death I still dream about Abner and I still miss him. And for those of you with this theological pre-conceived notion about life after death; loosen up and enjoy a really really cerebral book and if you get even a little misty eyed reading it because you thought of someone or something..........then the book touched you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"A love story that transcends life.

Chris dies at the beginning of the story and we get to follow him through being earthbound, traveling to Summerland, and his ultimate journey through the depths of hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matheson did his research","review":"The bibliography in this book is very extensive. That, paired with good writing, creates an interesting sci-fi fantasy. One which could very well be closer to what happens after we die than we might think. I'm a romantic and a believer in soul mates and of true love and eternal love. I did like the movie better than the book though and I can't say that for many books made into movies. I think that the story-line in movie was actually a bit better, but good book none-the-less."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Love Story that Transcends Heaven and Hell.","review":"Richard Matheson was a very enlightened writer to come up with such imagination writing this book. The book is so much better than watching the film adaptation believe me. Reading this book was so much more entertaining and less confusing than viewing the film version. It's a good thing I read this book first. The author talks about the possibilities of life after death and tackles such issues as reincarnation, astral travel and mysticism as he doesn't have any religious biases, such New Age thinking, huh. A most unusual love story of two soul mates destined to be united forever across the ages. Do Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, LONG, drawn-out Story","review":"After reading I am Legend and really liking the author's style, I picked up this book.

Hey, Amazon...","review":"Amazon lists the father's books under the son's name. What's the deal?

Up until then, it was a very entertaining and interesting read. The story is very heartfelt and I sensed that most of it came from Matheson's relation with his own wife.
