He sometimes breaks into straight off-the-dome flowing at the ends of some cuts and he covers ED OG's 1990 classic I Gotta Have It. The beats are stylish California but never like Zapp or Snoop, just bass and keys done by several producers, including Joey Chavez, who is emerging as a worthy opponent to Dr. Dre as the West's next great beatman.

Other subsequent attempts at recreating the original scoring of the Music for the Royal Fireworks has been made, even by Mr. Mackerras himself - in more modern sound, but never with the same overwhelming exuberance and sheer volume of sound. It must have sounded truly fantastic live. For years I had a really terrible pressing of this on a British Pye LP, and longed for the day when somebody would do a proper job of remastering it on CD. Thank god for Testament. Though the age of these recordings are betrayed by a bit of tape hiss and an ever-so-slight graininess to the sound, the performances in and of themselves are enough to knock your socks off.

I rate the Fireworks by how many goosebumps it raises and this performance takes the cake. The horns are brilliant and the twenty-six oboes twitter away magnificently and the kettle drums rumble on, but the snare here has the snap of a magnum in a J-frame.

One thing I will note is that the setup software tells you to look for the 'cable ready' LED to be lite. Make sure you give the unit some time to communicate with the cable company. That cable LED will not come on right away like the power and LAN will.

Do not buy it if you have children, I wish I had thoroughly read all the reviews before I purchased it. I am from Portsmouth and know the poverty issues they deal with in Scioto county, and they were accurately portrayed. The bigfoot pictures were interesting and thought-provoking, if you lean towards a belief in Sasquatch anyway. I do wonder if this was a money-making ploy, though. All in all, I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real...","review":"I felt that this doc captured the plight of the Appalachian man perfectly.

The \\"various artists\\" on this CD appear to be a couple of guys in their basement with a MIDI and ProTools...and they're not very good even at that. These are cheap sounding cover tunes, and I feel like I was ripped off by the promise of a true \\"tribute\\" CD that featured \\"various artists.\\" These people should be ashamed, and Billy Joel should sue to stop distribution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Not an instrumental CD!","review":"I too was disappointed with this CD. I didn't realize these songs are actually sung by the \\"piano men\\", as they call themselves on the CD. Although the guy's voice does remotely sound like Billy Joel's with some massive reverb, I'm not sure why anyone would want to listen to anything but the origninal recordings.If you are looking for a REALLY GOOD tribute CD, the one called Piano Man, A Tribute to Billy Joel by Jeff Michaels is in fact all instrumental and I believe that's the CD the reviewer below was saying is great. It has some really nice versions of his songs on solo piano, and then some with violin and an English horn. And it's got all of Billy's classics on there - including Scenes From An Italian Restaurant - my personal favorite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i threw this CD away","review":"The person who wrote that this was an instrumental was mistaken.

If you disagree with Neil Gaiman and think poor Susan got what she deserved, this book is for you. I'm not a member of an organized religion (in fact I have a distaste for them) but I always saw a real spiritual beauty in Aslan that made me hope God is that deep and full of love. This book, though, reads more religion into the books than is justified. I recognize that religious philosophy is a valid area of thought, but this book offers little else, which is a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worldview so much as Christian View","review":"I've enjoyed several of the books in this ongoing series of culture and philosophy. I have to say that thus far this is my least favorite of the series. Most of the essays are Christian philosophy rather than ecumenical, a disappointment to anyone who has read any of the other books. While I realize that the Narnia books are deeply Christian, there are different ways of looking at the series over all, as Karin Fry's essay in this book proves. Unfortunately, her essay is the exception to this poorly edited volume in what is otherwise a good series. If you are a Christian, you will likely enjoy this book. If you are a Christian looking to learn more about other schools of philosophy other than theist, you should look elsewhere. If you are not a Christian and find ecumenical discussion tedious or boring, don't even bother with this book. There are too many other books on philosophy out there to bother reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"None","review":"Sadely worthless without drawing or figure.

The plot is nothing special and the idea has been done before, but the actors are very good and the film seems very honest with it's atmosphere.

He's no Robert Plant, but he's got pipes. Unfortunately, he's the best this album has to offer. The entire disc sounds like the singer is doing his thing over synthesized backing tracks, the kind of robotic noise you'd get on a CD with a \\"How To Play Guitar\\" book.

Never expecting the band to disappoint, when the new album did come out I can say it was a tad different than what I anticipated. True to the music industry, they did tone down their edgyness a bit and add more pop. Bands are ever evolving, however, and KH did an amazing job, regardless. Using synth with heavy guitars and bass adds a unique quality the band is adored for, and Mat's voice blends in amazingly well with the music. Songs like \\"Believer\\", \\"Lips Like Morphine\\", and \\"Crazy Angel\\" gave us what we're used to, and others like \\"Love You to Death\\" gave us a bit more of a pop sound from the guys. My personal favorite is \\"Scream\\", which is a beautiful track that uses vivid imagery.Good job, KH! Can't wait for the next one =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"truly spectacular","review":"extremely well put together! it's great to put on and take a break from the world. the intro \\"Life in the arctic\\" sets a real mellow and relaxed mood and then the opening of the first song \\"Believer\\" picks you back up and tosses you around a bit (or at least it does if you get too into it; maybe i shouldn't listen to music in the shower? oh well..) the ending of the album is my favorite section though. the way that \\"Scream\\" matches up with \\"Sleep tight\\" it just makes it all come together.

I randomly ran into it on Amazon and decided to buy it. It's a fun little book with pages of things to do. In the back of the book there are stars you can mark the pages.

Nikon is an icon for people who either want to burn money or demanding professionals who understand that a *professional quality* lens costs thousands of dollars--not hundreds.Nikon has lenses that sell for $4,000 to $20,000.

I eventually got it to work but it did not work with my sound card. Be sure you have Windows 95 or 98 with the proper soundcard (they should be listed somewhere).

I enjoyed myself there but understood that I could have had a better time if I knew how casinos worked. This book is great at giving a basic knowledge of how casinos work and educates you on the many different games and how to enjoy yourself for entertainment purposes. I highly recommend this book if you a planning a trip to a casino for the first time or if you've been to a casino and you would like to expand your overall knowledge and enjoyment.

I bought a pair off the internet, and as I was not able to feel them beforehand, was sorely disappointed with them and even more so when the leather cracked after the first month of winter and allowed water to seep in.Nostalgia aside, I did wear the boots long enough to remember the feel and texture of the leather when they where made in England, and it is nothing like the 'leather' used now.

Heck they are still wearable, but the leather is looking really worn, and they aren't as comfortable as they once were. Two years ago, I picked up a new asian-manufactured pair and wore them only intermittently, maybe a couple times a week to a couple times a month. They did not become attached to my feet like my first pair. I rarely wore them in the winter this year. After two years of minimal wear, the weld cracked, causing the outsole to pop off between the heel and the balls of the feet. Whatever happened to their touted goodyear welding? This is unacceptable, and Dr. Marten lost a customer until their manufacturing standards return.

Not only have the craftsmanship and quality of materials plummeted, the design is not the same either. The new boots are narrower than they used to be, so think twice if you don't have narrow skinny feet. The sizing also seems off -- I wear a size 11 (US men's) and have no problem with slight variances across different brands but my feet were slipping around in these. As a result, my feet were rubbed raw and bloody after only a few blocks of walking. If you decide to buy yourself a pair of these torture devices, please add a large pack of bandaids and some Neosporin to your cart right now.If you know DMs from the 80s and 90s, these will make you cry.

They looked like imposters even at first glance. I am not a shoe or boot connoisseur or snob but I do know I like quality. Examining them confirmed my unexpected let down. The leather is a lower grade that doesn't ever break-in and the soles feel to be of a stiffly cheaper rubber that wears faster. I took a look at the label to find unsurprisingly that they were made in China. Buy a new pair (made after 2003) if your after the name without the same quality.

It is roughly 4-5 mins warming up, then starts to the first aerobics section, moves on to some toning for the legs for some 10 mins then moves to aerobics section 2, then again to some more toning for the legs and arms, then back to aerobics 3 and so on, till the end there is a 6-7min abs section.The aerobics sections, eventhough they are short, they bring the heart rate up.The video is a great change of pace video for those days that you want to workout, and want a little of aerobics and a little of toning the whole body.Although, the video is roughly an hour long, time flies rather quickly.I would highly recommend this video to anyone who wants both - aerobics and toning in one video who is a beginner/intermediate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout CD","review":"I love this workout. I lost my old one and I was glad to see they still sell it. I lost 20 pounds in about a month (diet and exercise). Karen created a workout that uses every part of your body, and I never felt healthier afterwards. In two weeks, I was addicted and I can't wait for my dvd to arrive so I can start again. My abs, arms, and legs looked amazing. Best of all, Karen isn't annoying and perky and doesn't have that annoying techno music, so if you are into that, then this video will not appeal to you. However, if you just want someone to kick your butt, it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time favorite!","review":"I used this video for almost ten years until the tape finally wore out and broke.

Fast paced aerobices, focusing on results, not tricky dance steps. Interval training to create muscle and tone as well as burn some fat. Perfect for intermediate skill level looking for a change of pace. May not be intense enough for advanced users.The only \\"negative\\" is sometimes Elle MacPherson doesn't exactly come off as the brightest bulb on the tree. (...)

THis CD sounds fresh, emmotive, hard. New vocalist Pete Goalby (who would later join Uriah Heep for their 1982 album ABOMINOG)fits perfectly and even contributes with three songs (one-third of the album).Mel Galley's guitar is still great and sharp. Dave Holland's drumming is also very good, but he soon went on to play something totally different in Judas Priest.HOLD ON is great, even with this uninspired title (there literally HUNDREDS of songs with the name \\"HOLD ON\\"....)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight rock does not get much better than this","review":"This is sheer hard rock. Pete Goalby is a great singer, and here he is replacing Glenn Hughes, not an easy task.All the songs flows effortlessly, this album is very pleasant to listen. It has a hard edge. Dave Holland's drumming is also much more inspired and imaginative than it would become when he went to Judas Priest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"I'm a Peter Goalby fan from his three albums with Uriah Heep, so I figured give this album a try, Excellent album, it's a little differant then those three albums he did with UH, more rock and roll oriented and a little less commercial, I liked it so much I just ordered \\"Trapeze - Live in Texas\\" from Amazon UK, the price wasn't too bad, can't wait to check that one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dog only ate my GOOD books","review":"I had a Dalmation that ate books and records.

That book was my first introduction to software engineering, it was funny, it was extremely helpful, it was to the point, and it was NOT excessively pompous, boring, or lengthy. Of the books I have read on how to tackle complex problems in an organized effective fashion, this much missed book has been rivaled only by Gyorgy Polya's \\"How To Solve It\\" which for anybody who knows is high praise indeed.

Very disturbing and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, negative book","review":"...this author is so negative; yes, a doping problem exists in cycling. No, we don't need this sour apple to spell it out for us. Every sentence in the book is bleak, painting a terrible picture of professional cycling. I kept asking myself, if he sucks so much in racing or hates it, why does he continue? No wonder no other teams would give this droll, morbid guy a chance. Reading it made me feel dirty and hopeless, losing all confidence in the sport. Have the author's efforts helped the sport any? Of course not. Armchair criticism and whining does nothing to improve anything. Just what does runny diarrhea down Greg Lemond's leg have to do with the story? He should be ashamed of himself (Paul Kimmage)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul - Shame on you!","review":"Reader and potential reader of this book, please note the following:From Feb 13, 2009 Los Angeles Times:\\"In a strongly-worded radio interview last September, Kimmage said the sport that welcomed back Armstrong was heading backward and took a swipe at cancer survivor Armstrong's passion for the cause of raising money for cancer research.'This guy, any other way but his bullying and intimidation wrapped up in this great cloak, the great cancer martyr . . . this is what he hides behind all the time. The great man who conquered cancer. Well he is the cancer in this sport. And for four years this sport has been in remission. And now the cancer's back.' \\"Paul, your pettiness and hatefulness is pathetic. Next to Lance you are nothing.

He details in the book the means taken by some cyclists to climb out of the shadows into the sunshine by taking drugs. His book was brave at the time, he was accused of 'spitting in the soup' and lost the friendship of many of his cycling peers for his writing about the drug taking. He was called a liar. But time has revealed through the 'festina affair' who were the liars. A good read, but leaves one feeling a little sad to think that sport in general, not just cycling, can be so diseased."},{"rating":"2","title":"very insightful, pulls back the glossy veneer","review":"Very hard to put down, even though I am strictly a recreational rider with no racing experience I found the story painted very vivid images. Paul Kimmage pours it all on the table, sometimes trying to be neutral, other times being very judgemental. The book feels very honest in presenting the history of drugs and cycling. I would definitely read more of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for understanding of the workings of the pro-peloton pre Armstrong","review":"Paul Kimmage's suing by the UCI is a good sign the man has the dirt.

Sidney Poitier, the author of this book, is a man that I highly admire. His experiences that he shares with humanity in his book does truly reflect the measure of him as a man. The only problem I had with the book was that there were too many foul language that I personally did not like. However, his story is provocative and captivating and also gives you a little glimpse of an actor's life. I encourage aspiring young actors to read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horses for courses","review":"This book just proves that actors should stick to acting and leave writing to the writers and autobiographing to the autobiographers.

I'd rather watch that again than read this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Measure of A Man - A Spiritual Journey","review":"Mr. Poritier star shines brighter for me after reading this very well written book.His words and thoughts came together into a sincere tribute to his parents, his own moral fiber he brought to his craft, his strong will, and that character does count. I sincerely believe that the world is a better place because of men like Mr. Poritier -- with a voice that speaks softly and loud enough to form a message that translates univerisally.I liked this book so much that a purchased a few copies of the audio version for friends. Sincerely Susan Hutton"},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind the Mystery","review":"I was intrigued to read that Sydney Poitier was almost illiterate. He explains that he is a self-made person, which clarifies why Mr. Poitier stands heads above his fellow actors. The lesson he learned from his father that \\"the measure of a man is in how he treats his family,\\" is deep yet simple to understand. It is a lesson both sexes could learn from. A good read for a soulful glimpse of the mystery behind Sydney Poitier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I am almost finished with this book and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not that the writing is brilliant or his insights exceptionally original; but I appreciate reading the story of a man who has accomplished a lot and been a role model for many.

I think this book really defines his position and his character.Very good reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I actually bought three copies of this book. The book wasn't holding my interest from the start. I never put a good book down. It was also strange that Mr. Poitier felt the need to use so much foul language. Although I admire Mr. Poitier so much, I couldn't seem to get what the purpose of the book was about. This is only my opinion. He is more than obviously a phenomenal actor. I have always had an extremely high opinion of him. For me, I just didn't gel with this book.And I feel sorry that I sent the book to others as a gift, without reading it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great man; poorly written account of his life","review":"I could not finish it, and, with all of Oprah's hype, I thought it would be so inspiring. I read about 1/3 of the way through it, and the story jumped from idea to idea with no substance in between. Big spans of time were jumped over with little explanation of how he got from one point in his life to another. He was a dishwasher, and then he owned a restaurant and was married with two children. He hints at interesting topics, but never develops them, such as his reference to meeting with the army pyschiatrist and the event that led up to it. Neither topic was developed. I never even understood the little story of why he tried to get himself killed in the ditch that was near his childhood home. Maybe the book just needed a better editor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"There are many positive reviews by Amazon readers of this book. I \\"read\\" the 7 CD version of the book with Sydney Poitier reading his own book in his own voice----of course! Either the book or the CD Book are well worth your time. For a guy with scant years in school, he certainly is smart and he even has quite an \\"educated vocabulary\\" to boot. One thing the reader should probably know is that Mr. Poitier wrote an earlier book in about 1980 called, \\"This Life\\". \\"This Life\\" is VERY hard to find but it deals more with the \\"life story\\" of the artist and less with his \\"ruminations\\" and \\"philosophical\\" ideas. I think BOTH this book and \\"This Life\\" are BOTH worth reading---but I actually enjoyed reading the first book somewhat more than this later book.

It began as an exercise in self-questioning, an exploration of his life. As he looked back on his long and celebrated life, he wanted to understand how well he had done at measuring up to the values he placed on himself and the standards he had set. As he reflected on his simple life growing up in the Bahamas, one of the most memorable of all of the teachings of his father was the one about the measure of a man, which you will enjoy discovering within the pages of this book. If you are not already a fan of Sidney Poitier, you will be after delighting yourself in his memoir.

Sidney claims to be a spiritual being and a Visionary. In the film \\"the Secret\\" Sidney Poitier is portraited as a person who uses \\"the Law of Attraction\\". A Visionary who has understood a few things. In \\"The Measure of a Man\\" he clearly writes like a person who has no idea how \\"the Law of Attraction\\" is functioning.The movie \\"the Secret\\" made me soooo happy, but after this it makes me doubt if the people in it knows anything after all.There was a few good parts in the book, like how he finally got hold of how to act and I was hoping this would bridge over to something more spiritual.

He displays such character and beautiful morals in his own findings and conversations. Excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found it rather hypocritical in prose","review":"The book states on the cover that is is a spiritual autobiography. Mr. Poitier speaks of his high values and morals, while at the same time using offensive languange throughout. I felt that Mr. Portier's life experiences where based upon strict family pride, I could not see any outstanding spirtuality other than a man trying to do his best in making life choices as most of us attempt to do. I did not find this book remarkable or extraordinary; lest spritual. It was a fast read, yet not due to it's excitement or interest. I just wanted to get to the point that gave it the title of \\"New York Times Bestseller\\" - Possibly because it was recommended by Oprah Winfrey? It's very disheartening to spend the money on a highly recommended book that turns out to be untouchable to the soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the page-turner I'd hoped for...","review":"I stopped reading less than half-way through. I get it,Mr. Poitier,you were a victim of racism! There was little else this book had to offer and I got bored silly once I realized it was going nowhere other than racial issues. How in the world does Oprah pick her book selections? This is the second time I've been thoroughly disappointed by one of hers. From now on, if it says \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" on it, it's going to alert me to select something else. Like at least one of the other reviewers, I was totally put off by the author's use of \\"ya know?\\". It just seemed, ya know, so ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought the audio book to listen to Mr. Poitier reveal some deep secrets on life but was disappointed on many levels. There is an arrogant thread that runs through this and to call it 'spiritual' is a little deceptive. Mr. Poitier does not believe in God but in 'nature' and 'galaxies'. Also, he tends to romanticize his adultery and breakup of his home as 'being in love'. A native of the Caribbean, I can understand how being placed in a box when you are coming from a culture where you are majority can be jolting. But there is a difference between being confident in one's ability and God-given talents and arrogance. On the other hand, the book does give insightful information on what race relations were in the US and in some part still is in Hollywood. Overall, I would not recommend this book unless you want to hear of someone who is clearly in love with himself and his talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"It took me awhile to get to this book--it seemed a little off-putting for a summer read, but I've loved it.

Thank you Mr. Poitier for reminding me that \\"anything worth having is worth complete dedication to integrity and principles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise Enough","review":"Sidney Portier is not your typical \\"wisdom gleaned from life\\" philosopher. He does an entrancing job of describing the amazing story of his rise from dire poverty and lack of formal education to the polished intellectual that we all admire. The story is a good one that is hard to put down. I would recommend it to anyone. Toward the end of the book he falls into a period of philosophical meandering that seemed a bit too self-involved for me. He describes an attempt to do a one-man show in recent years. It's failure may be credited to this same problem. He takes on an air that I find hard to describe, but it did not lead me to contemplate along with him. I just wanted him to return to his previous style. He returns from that short part to bring the book to a good finality that left me glad I had picked it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A black man in white society","review":"Just looking at the man in his starring roles by his gait, his countenance, gives away the nobility of his soul.

As much as I love Mr. Poitier, I am disappointed with this book. I agree with Diane24, Mr. Poitier is holding back. I've gone from page to page hoping that he will reveal more of his experiences as an adult and child on a more personal level. He has left out some important things that his fans want to know. I'm sure he did that intentionally. I hope that in the future there will be a book that will reveal more of who he was as a struggling actor, as a husband, a father, etc. I still haven't finished the book, but I am close enough to the end to know that I am disappointed that Mr. Poitier didn't go in to more detail about his actual life. I thought the book would be more revealing. Instead he analyzes and summarizes everything and everybody else. I still have great admiration and respect for him.

Mr.Poitier struggled as a teenager in New York, then decided to join the army to be off the cold streets of New York in the Winter. After his short stay in the Army Mr. Poitier was back on the streets of New Yorktrying to survive as a dish-washer.

For instance, if you shoot both of a mech's legs out, it should fall over, not blow up. Also, if you disable a mech by knocking it down, the game should not force you do totally destroy it before the scenario is over. You can't get any salvage from something that explodes. And salvage, for a mercenary, is highly important. The original version of MechWarrior knew about this, why not in this version? Some other \\"fun\\" problems are where it doesn't let you decide how many mechs you can take on a mission. If you are the Merc company commander, you should bloody well be able to decide how many you want to bring along. There are also some scenarios that automatically destroy the legs on your lance mates before they even move.

It illucidates wonderfully the symbolism Crolwey wished to convey through Lady Harris' art. The history section is sane and avoids dogmatic pronunciations about the ancient history of the Tarot. Two things, however, marr what is otherwise a wonderful book. First, the technique given for reading the cards is likely to stump one's intuitive flow. Second, Crowley barely touches on the system of Elemental Dignities upon which the deck relies. Both of these gaps, however, can be filled in by reading elsewhere. Reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok for tarot","review":"this book is a little hard to understand if you are buying it simply for better tarot understanding. quite frankly i wouldn't recommend it and regret buying it. it's not bad, but it's almost useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good source but a little dated...","review":"Most of of this book will go right over your head unless you already have a good working knowledge of Egyptian & Greek mythology, magic and esoteric lore of both the East and West. If not, it's a good source for finding out what you DON'T know!It has become dated to a certain extent, but it's still probably the best source if you are serious about the Thoth Tarot. Some of Crowley's information is faulty, due probably to the limitations of the time in which he lived but also to his own ignorance. Furthermore, Crowley writes with an air of authority and certitude that only serves to complicate matters if you aren't able to sort out fact from fiction.To me this book does not reveal anything close to genius as some have suggested. While it does contain a vast amount of information on a lot of different subjects, many of its ideas are not that organized or very well thought out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarot - NOT!","review":"Inaccurate history, murky symbology, minimum usefulness.

It exhaustively outlines the symbolism of the Tarot while describing in complete detail the designs of Crowley's Thoth Tarot deck as it was painted by Lady Frieda Harris in the 1920s. Sometimes verbose, the text can overload the novice with information but generally the information is of great value to the beginner and the master of the Tarot alike.Essential reading for all occultists and for those who study the mysteries of the Tarot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of Thoth","review":"A Great Reproduction of a Classic.

Beyond that I would appreciate other modern translations, but not be too picky.It has a good search facility, synchronized scrolling between Bible versions as well as commentaries, a good GUI and a wealth of resources, many of which I may never get around to using.My only quibble is navigation -- it is not always intuitive how to get back to a previous view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't have the feature I wanted...","review":"I like the NIV translation and I have been jotting down many study notes besides the relevant verses in a hardcopy NIV bible.

What attracted me to this software of course the NIV translation but more importantly, their mentioning of the ability to take notes. I thought that's exactly what I was looking for. After I installed the software and looked at the \\"take notes\\" functionality, I discover that the content of notes can link to different documents but you could not link your note into the verses of the bible.

The singing, where lip-synched, is not always completely in synch, but that is a minor fault.Many of the scenes - in glorious Technicolor, of course - are simply breathtaking. This version of the presentation of Olympia, from Act 1, is a favorite of Classic Arts Showcase on PBS, and rightly so, for it is performed with an inspired humorous touch.Yes, I know the film deviates quite a lot from the original opera, but it is results that count.

The book also included discussions on built-in hooks for tight integration with the Active Directory, which is due to ship with the final version of Windows NT 5.0 or Windows 2000 as its called now. The book really focused in on how SMS 2.0 is the ideal migration tool because of its sophisticated software distribution capabilities.

However, at the point of this review, (March 19, 1999) Microsoft Press doesn't even have a book about the product. This book has many references about features of the product that were changed from the beta to the release product. Crystal reports as stated in the book comes as version 4.5. However, it comes with ver 6.0. Many screen prints also come from version 1.2 not 2.0. The worst part of this book is the CD that comes with it. It is even labeled as ver 2.0 on the cover of the book as well as on the CD itself. However, it is the CBT Systems SMS ver 1.2. Prentice Hall knows about this and were very helpful on their 800 line.

The differences between 1.2 and 2.0 are significant. Example: SMS 2.0 distribution servers can be Novell or NT only.

Either that or the reviews that give 5 starts are written by the author's friends and family. This book is a complete shambles. As the reviews say, it is a book based mostly on version 1.2 and not a very good one on that. I have been using SMS1.2 for a number of years and although I accept there are a few helpfull hints on 1.2 there still remains the fact that this was meant to be V2. If I had wanted a V1.2 book I would have bought one that covered the topic more thoroughly that this did. I feel conned by this book and feel it should be withdrawn. Some of the reviews written here seem to think this is Ok. They say Ok it is not a V2 book but it is Ok as a V1.2 book.

When I purchased this cd, I bought it on the assumption that it was advertised as \\"For Shania Lovers, Complete Your Collection.\\" Hello? It's not even in the same genre as her current musical style which is Country or Country Pop. I am kicking myself for buying this cd and now I can't even give it away - no one wants it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad.","review":"It's funny how Shania's career has come full circle, as we can hear in these super-cheesy, independently produced, demo-tape-y synth-pop tunes, recorded in the late 1980s, when it seemed her greatest aspiration was to be the next Tiffany or Sheena Easton. Well, a decade or so later, that dream came true, as the post-millennial Twain returned to her prefab pop roots. Anyone who thought Shania had \\"sold out\\" by \\"going pop\\" owes it to themselves to check out these early tracks, where nary a twang is to be heard. It ain't country, but then again, neither was she."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real Shania?!!!!!","review":"Unlike Madonna's \\"beginning\\" albums (where Madonna actually shows a hint of her future greatness). This beginning cd by Shania reveals how much or rather how less of a talent Shania really is. These songs sound like third-rated 80s tunes that was left off a Stevie N. or Pat B. album. Shania believe that her songwriting made the difference for her success during the 90s. However she wrote all of these songs and they do nothing for me, even if they were released in the 80s!!

I really wish Mutt would produce her again in this rock style instead of her psedo country which rakes in the bucks.

This cd shows how bad of a singer Shania really is and how talented Mutt is. Mutt can record a baby goat or a howling wolf, edit the sound and make it sound like music.

Alas, it proved to be a disappointment.This is an uninspiring look at the battle of Antietam and the search for the identity of a fictional officer who died in the battle. Mr. Lehrer's writing is flat and leaden, his tale predictable, and his characters either too obvious to be interesting (Spaniel) or too far-fetched to be believable (the modern Albritten). Though he writes in the third person, he uses his characters to carry the burden of describing the battle, the history and the surroundings in dialog. This results in \\"speechy\\" prose and wooden characters. Situations move slowly and seem contrived. By the end I was far less moved by what seemed to be a subject of real interest of Mr. Lehrer than I would have been by a straight reading of history, or a book like \\"Unto This Hour\\" by Tom Wicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I wonder if Mr. Lehrer thought about the implications of the ending of his story. I enjoyed the modern parts of it with its descriptive forensic analysis, but the supposedly old part didn't sound old. He didn't catch the nuances of 19th Century prose. And the ending was disappointing. Is he saying that the proclivity to murder is an inherited trait?"},{"rating":"1","title":"sloooooooow!","review":"Excited at first to read the book, I quickly became disappointed. The plot seems great. The character development is simplistic. Most reviews say this is a good read for civil war buffs. I disagree. The historical aspect of the book is basic. The fictional part is imaginative, but the characters become annoying and the plot lumbers along. It is a quick, easy, thoughtless read. (try Landscape Turned Red by Sears for a great factual interpretation of the battle)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Book At Best","review":"This book is weak in every aspect. The characters are are shallow, the prose terrible and the story line predictable. It will have you wanting to read ahead so you can put it down that much faster. The main character in fact, figures out none of the mystery. He is terrifically wonderful at confirming all that is revealed to him however. As I was reading this I was astonished that something this bad would be published. Honestly, the writing style is simplistic at best. If you must read this, visit the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Certain Rest","review":"When I first heard of the storyline I rushed out to find the book. Being a smalltime civil war buff and a heavy mystery and intrigue reader, I thought the book would be perfect. I finished the book very disappointed.

I will use his words...\\"it never should have ended this way...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTMENT AND THEN SOME","review":"Jim Leher's novel was a great disappointment to me. An individual so accomplished, articulate and engaging left all that behind when he sat down to write this novel. The story line could have been interesting but I was greatly distracted by the simplistic character development and somewhat implausable series of events. If Lehrer chooses to pursue this avocation I urge he seek ways to enliven his characters and develop a more pictureque manner of writing. Frankly, this novel was less gripping than a poorly cast and directed high school drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"High school character development","review":"The characters were totally fake.

Cardboard cutout characters, leaden dialogue, implausible jury-rigged plot...avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cruel surprises","review":"Lehrer presents two parallel stories, a contemporary American Civil War description of battle events and a modern archaeologist's attempt to decipher those events. (This is a technique also used to much more spine-tingling effect by Beverly Connors in her archaeological mystery stories.) Unfortunately the archy character is an excitable scatterbrain and mere day-dreamer, whose pursuit of the past leads to a cruel modern tragedy. There are passages of incantory violence found in an \\"original\\" soldier's confessional narrative.Lehrer knows how to plot and has a good premise here, but his prose is jarringly rough, wheezy, and simplistic (e.g., he concludes far too many descriptions with the incredibly lazy phrase \\"and whatever\\"). Of the old McNeil-Lehrer PBS News duo, McNeil is the better writer of fiction. This could have made a chilling short story but it went long and whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just a Civil War Novel, but a Darn Good Read","review":"This is a very interesting novel that captures both the ferocity of the Battle of Antietam and intensity of feelings that people have about the Civil War. Although at times No Certain Rest feels like it was written by an intellectual news commentator for PBS (which Lehrer is), the book is easy to read and the story becomes increasingly intense as the protagonist gets closer to his conclusion. The ending also catches you by surprise. You don't have to be a Civil War buff (I'm not) to enjoy this book, merely a fan of well-written mystery/suspense novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little thing","review":"I have this unit for a year and a half.

Not much rinses out in the prelim rinse which gave me hope, and it didn't stain my skin as other colors have. Unfortunately, I find I have to redye it every week to hold any color.If you are looking for a vivid pink that lasts - use Atomic Pink.

McNamara uses his personal experiences especially during the Kennedy and Vietnam era as an argument for a lot of his arguments. While these serve to give a first hand view of the problems they add little to the arguments presented. The problem lies not as much with the overly idealistic and optimistic desires of the authors but with the lack of any constructive method to reach those ideals. The fact that you want peace and think that if everybody else would commit to wanting peace too then that would solve the problem does not make for a serious discussion of how to bring peace about. In the beginning of the book McNamara says the ideas presented are to spark discussion and debate to bring about a change for a more peaceful world. I don't know if this book adds much to the discussion other than an idealistic desire.

It seems to have been scanned with an optical character reader and printed without any proofreading at all. There are numerous and confusing typos in the text, but the worst part is the mangling of headings and footnotes. These are scattered at seemingly random points throughout the text. One moment you're reading a paragraph of the text, and the next word that comes up begins a line from a footnote or chapter heading.

Having lived in France for a decade or so, I can attest to the authenticity of both the characterizations and the sentiments. Nary a word is wasted and his ability to create a thoroughly believable, utterly human, gently humorous character is a marvel. Some readers may not be entirely satisfied by the ending, and its Chekhov-like unresolved note, but I wasn't bothered. I do recommend, however, that you DON'T read the introduction by PD James in this edition until after you've read the book, since she gives away FAR too much.

Instead I got a chapter on tense and point of view. He puts down other authors who load their writing books with their own writing, then he does exactly that himself!

Sadly, the rest of the album isn't good, except for 2 or 3 songs, no more than that.Talking about Vertigo, is short song, just 3 minutes of repetitive guitars and catchy chorus. Bono is not at his best, that's clear, and the rythm section is lazy. The most annoying and dissapointing thing is the overall sound and production.

They have truly been known as one of the most dynamic and influential band ever from Europe, and their music still packs a punch. Their latest single, Vertigo is a very hard and upbeat Rock song that really is U2 at their best. The song is their first new one since Electrical Storm from their Best of 1990-2000 collection. The feeling of this is purely fast and hard, which is mostly remarkable since U2 used the song with Apple and their itunes commercials. Nevertheless, the song is really very good, and if it is this good, I can't wait to hear what How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is like.Overall: B"},{"rating":"2","title":"Legends","review":"Not moving away from their distinct originality that makes them one of the best rock bands around today, the legendary U2 give their fans a preview of their forthcoming album with 'Vertigo'.

(Can you say, \\"Elevation-Part Dos\\"?) The Jacknife Lee remix of \\"Vertigo\\" is OK, as far as remixes go, but is nothing earth-shattering. Finally, the cover version of the Kraftwerk tune, \\"Neon Lights\\", is atmospheric, but a bit droll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oak Ridge Boys","review":"This is a great CD.

Frequently, with large scale romantic comedy type films, you can tell that (similar to the Doug Douchebag character) the whole project is just trying \\"too hard\\" in order too win favor with a bigger audience. I didn't feel that way with this film, it didn't feel like a forced rom com that was completely devoid of thought and soul. Rather, I felt pretty touched by the development of characters and how the plot unfolded. Although it stuck with some of the standards of the genre, it didn't feel inauthentic. Having a crush on the male protagonist didn't hurt either. A-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anguished failure","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

The concept of the mechanical man is uninspiring, and he really is not a catch by any stretch of the imagination. He would need to figure out his life before attempting to involve a significant other in it. By the end of the movie he appears to simply have found another woman to support him."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Cigar","review":"It's like an indie movie by someone who doesn't quite get indie movies.I can't quite suggest it's a spoof of indie movies, because a good spoof can only be made by someone who really gets the target of the spoof. It's more like an embarrassingly bad knock off of a Louie Vuitton handbag. Or a counterfeit $100 bill with a portrait of Donald Trump on it.I wanted to like this movie, I really did. Good actors, great music, solid cinematography. But every dialog fell flat, and the movie just didn't deliver. A waste of 90 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly well directed and well acted movie!","review":"I started watching with a notion being it a romantic comedy or something but it turned out to be a very good movie. I loved the plot, characters, and direction. Its a good watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking and inspirational","review":"This movie was an excellent pick. It explores the themes of isolation and loneliness that so many people feel in our modern age of materialism and technology. When we focus on acquiring \\"things\\" and accept the modern false promises and definitions of success, we lose touch with who we are. This movie reminds us of what is real - love, genuine friendship, encouragement, and productive work that gives meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Sigh*","review":"Chris Messina, you are my king. Completely loved this film, Chris and Jenna's onscreen chemistry could not go ignored. Awesome"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish this Movie","review":"I was ready to watch an unknown romantic comedy starring some familiar faces, but I just can't finish this movie. It's so formulaic that I just can't. I don't know if the script is to blame, but the situations are just so predictable and there's no chemistry on screen. They go a little too far trying to make EVERY other character in the movie a stereotype of some person the ubiquitous \\"we\\" don't like very much. This movie might make a front office receptionist feel like a quirky individual with a bright and creative future, but that's a small demographic to win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very beautiful, well executed","review":"I had been gearing myself up to seeing this film over the last couple days, in the end I was very pleased. The story is very beautiful and simple. With few characters, but all well developed characters. The connection between the two main characters was completely believable and natural. I am not a huge Jenna Fischer fan, I thought she maintained her trademarked quirk in this film, but at times her acting and speech was beyond tolerable awkwardness. That being said it was a great watch, and I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking an out of the box rom-com."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth watching","review":"Shows what alot of folks are going through today. There is light at the end of the tunnel.You feel good at the end. Worth Watching"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful film with depth and humor","review":"I loved this film. The cadence of this film worked beautifully with the imagery, the characters, and their struggle. The humor was understated which made it feel real and relatable, their redemption was believable - nothing was forced. Very creative but accessible story line and script, a reflection of the struggles we all can relate to. No overwhelming soundtrack to force emotion which somehow to me made it more memorable for me. What a wonderful film, I definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick-flick, predictable storyline","review":"Some top-notch actors in the film; however, I found the movie very predictable and rather slow - interesting that it has 4.5 stars. I did complete the movie in one sitting but I wouldn't watch it again. I thought Jenna Fischer (The Office) did a good job keeping the movie moving along but I wouldn't rate her performance as anything more than decent. I was ready for a little comedy but there was none in here. There are much better movies to watch so don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching!!!!!!!","review":"Yes the start is a bit slow, but it definitely picks up.

He simply doesn't get it, and I don't think many people do, on EITHER side of ANY argument. In keeping with my \\"third position\\" thinking, I have a third position here...I believe that the potential societal collapse Mr. Bennett discusses here could be easily averted if only society would be more accepting of those who choose to live without children. I believe a great many people have children almost because they feel like they don't have an option not to. They aren't bad people by any means, they just aren't parent material for any number of reasons, and unfortunately their offspring (and the rest of society) suffer as a result.I know many children of divorce, and I know people who cohabitate. Some of these people are my friends. Blaming them for the downfall of society is something I take personally. There's more to the story than what the morality police will admit."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS A MORAL COLLAPSE!!","review":"Mr Bennet says nothing every other right wing looney has been sceeching for a decade! The Gays will destroy us! Divorce will ruin us! The Liberals are taking this country to H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS!! The Founding Fathers Mr Bennet is so fond of were Radicals, aka Liberals, not Reactionaries, aka Conservatives. Jefferson, Washington, Madison and Paine were the people who started this country,they believed in the rights of the accused, seperation of powers, division of church and state. The conservatives went back to England!! Please Mr Bennet, go back to England: The England of 1777, where your prejudices and narrow mindedness can find a happier home than here in this awful, liberal, radical, wonderful country!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The de-evolution of thought","review":"Bennett book is underpinned by fear and loathing. He blames parties not responsible for the so-called collapse of the family and of morality. Self-righteous myopic heterosexuals like himself need to take stock of their own role in what ever de-evolution they perceive. Stop scapegoating minorities!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor scholarship; A waste of time","review":"William Bennett wastes about 20% of this book in an absurd rant against gay marriage. He bases his criticisms on his pathetically out-dated and scientifically disproven belief that gay people choose to be gay. Evidently he wants gay men to marry his daughters, since he allows no other options for gay men in his world. This book is little but empty-headed ranting, scape-goating, and spreading of unfounded myths. To see the basis of this foolishness, readers would do well to see David Brock's \\"Blinded by the Right,\\" which reminds us that William Bennett once called Rush Limbaugh \\"possibly our greatest living American.\\"The happiest families in America, with the warmest hearths, are those that reject Bennett's demagoguery, ignorance, and hatred disguised as morality."},{"rating":"2","title":"for serious beginners","review":"Anders does a fine job of explaining and demonstrating the basic hand/finger techniques for playing the doumbek. The video is well paced in that his demonstrations are at an easy pace for beginners, while it is, also, useful for experienced drummers to pick up a few pointers. Anders has a relaxed manner of instruction and encourages the intuitive side of drumming as well as technique. All in all, one of the best instructional videos I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film Noir","review":"Very effective direction, beautifully constrasted photography and solid acting make this one an instant classic.Widmark is terrific as a hand-gun on the psychotic side (his breakthrough role) and Mature is dead-on as Nick Bianco : manly, natural, a tough-as-nails-with-a-soft-spot kind of character that suits him perfectly.The girl is good looking but her acting is so-so... which doesn't make the film any less enjoyable with its mixture of realism, sensitivity and hair-raising suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited for TV version?","review":"I saw this film in a theater as a youngster, and I remember it clearly. I can't tell you how disapointing this truly hatcheted version of that film is. The clumsy scene changes could be over looked, but to edit out the most memorable scene in the entire film makes me wonder why even produce this version. Richard Widmark would have never gotten his Academy nomination if this were the film version shown in theaters in 1947. The scene when he pushes Riso's mother down the stairs does not end with her landing at the bottom of the stair well, but it does in this chopped up TV version. What a disapointment this poorly edited version is indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy Udo steals the show.","review":"This is a solid movie, which has attained classic status simply on the strength of Richard Widmark's unforgettably over the top portrayal of the psychopathic antagonist, Tommy Udo. It would rate acceptable marks in any case, due to it's fine direction, solid performances, and gritty dialogue. Ahh, but Tommy, he has rescued the film from almost certain obscurity...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Gangster Movie","review":"Victor Mature is superb as a jewel theif turned informant.

Yet this is a dual-layer disc!As well, the print is >bad<. Notice the walls when Richard Widmark climbs to the top of the stairs prior to the film's most famous scene, as well as the walls in the room before he ties up the old lady and pushes her down the stairs -- there are what look like water blotches on the print. Terrible!The obnoxious ad for video piracy at the DVD's beginning accompanied by loud, ugly rock music also doesn't make a good impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kiss of Death = Classic Noir.","review":"I have seen this movie several times over and over again.

This stuff is clearly called \\"Valerin.\\"Now that I have that off my chest... It works. It helps a lot, anyway. I still have extra tense muscles sometimes, but since I began taking Valerin, I have not been incapacitated by the resulting neck, back, and shoulder pain. Also, I notice almost no side effects. My stomach is not crazy about valerian root--and there is enough of that in here to make the tablets smell of it--so I sometimes notice some (very mild) stomach upset. And I do feel slightly woozy a few minutes after taking it. But nothing that would, say, interfere with driving or caring for my child.I would recommend this product. I wish I didn't have to take close to the maximum dose daily, because that will work out to the large size (two bottles, 340 tablets total) being just over a one month supply.

I was so desperate at one point, that I actually bought the \\"entire 59 episode series on DVD\\" from some E-Bay store. What a waste of 80 bucks that was. I do believe that those folks on E-Bay will not be selling anymore of these bootlegged DVD sets to poor suckers like me. Now, I only hope that this sells well enough to allow Universal to release the second and third seasons as well. Lindsay Wagner is timeless, and she was awesome then and continues to be.

Parriott are very informative and entertaining. The episodes themselves never looked so good and finally the uncut Bionic Woman parts one and two that started it all. The featurette includes Lindsay Wagner (still as attractive as ever), Richard Anderson, Martin E. Brooks, Robbie Rist and others involved in the series.Nice menus and a fold out case for all four discs.Kenneth also tells us he has done a commentary for season two's Doomsday Is Tomorrow, so I look forward to hearing that one when season two is released next year.Grab yourself a set now.

Director Anthony Waller keeps the pace a little slow, but does manage some great camera angles and a few plot twists to save the day. Devon Sawa, Gabrielle Anwar, Joanne Whalley and Angela Featherstone provide good support and the ending is a real doozy!A nice change of pace mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone loses","review":"The only performance I enjoyed was from Devan Sawa (Final Destination).

Bought this based on the Amazon auto part selection saying this one would work. First with the tire, the opening is too small to get in because the blade can't be angled enough. After overcoming that, the blade doesn't lock into the wiper bar - tab too wide.

I went with the originally installed length. The orginal blade connector is offset (which I did not notice before and which is apparently why Amazon recommended a shorter blade,) therefore none of the blades will fit correctly. The recommended blade does not clean a big enough space while the orginal length contacts the passenger side blade making a noise during operation.

I like the Rain-X ones, but these were rated a little higher so I thought I would give them a try. The first time I used them they streaked quite a bit. When I got home I cleaned my windshield because I thought that might help. It did help, but there was still a little streaking. It was not very bad and I would not return them for it, but I expect no streaking at all from new blades so I was a little disappointed, especially since they were a few dollars more than other blades.

I ski once or twice a week in the winter. The wipers preformed above average for the first snow season here in Idaho. They also performed well through the spring rainy season with little streaking or chattering. They work as well as possible running through mud on dirt roads in wet conditions. I definitely worked them in the mud. They mostly lasted through the hot summer sun in southern Idaho. After 1 year they definitely need replacing. I usually buy better than average wipers and these performed very well. But don't expect them to last more than a year. I gave them 4 stars because they did not substantially outperform other good wipers and they are a bit expensive. My most important relevant review is that I have just ordered another set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great for the rain, but not great for cold, cold weather","review":"These are the quietest blades I've come across and they clear the windshield perfectly.

They still work great, but for cold cold climates winter blades might be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad experience on first use","review":"Like many others, I have been in an ongoing search to find the \\"perfect\\" wiper blades. I guess they don't exist!I installed a new pair of these blades before we took a 300-mile driving trip to Minnesota. On the way, we drove through rain, sleet, and snow. The temperature was in the 30s the whole way (never below freezing).The blades chattered and streaked. Yes, I did install them properly. These blades are not listed as \\"summer-only\\" so I assume they were designed to work in cold weather. For us, they did not.So, it's back to the drawing board. I have used Bosch blades in the past. They are OK. I will also be trying some Rain-X."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not recommend","review":"I bought 4 of these blades of various lengths (20, [2] 22s, and a 24). Most (not all, mind you) of them smear already. I wouldn't recommend this blade, and definitely would not buy again. I bought due to the other overall good reviews, and the fact that at one point in time, Consumer Reports also recommended them. Considering several of these blades smear already, either Amazon sells blades that have a really old manufacture date and the rubber has worn out, or the product isn't up to par. I'm not sure which since I had a similar experience with some Rain-X blades too (also purchased from Amazon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wipers I've used","review":"I first heard about Valeo wipers from Consumer Reports. They had the highest rating so I decided to check them out. I've been very happy with them and they are all I buy now.

Unfortunately, I had to return them for a full refund just two days ago.The wiper blades worked perfectly when I first installed them. Installation was a breeze, took about a minute to install both. Simple tug and snap on.A few days after the install the driver side started creating streaks while the passenger side was perfect. I tried cleaning out the driver blade to no avail, I even returned it for a replacement blade and I still experienced the same streak.The blades got so bad that they had long streaks from one end of my glass to the other end which wouldn't come off with normal washer fluid. I had to wipe it off with a towel otherwise it would sit there. Both blades started doing this about a week ago.So as I said in the beginning, I returned these and then I purchased Valeo 900 blades, so far they're working even better than these 600's.

Great in rain or snow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great rear wiper for Saturn Vue","review":"I have a 2004 Saturn Vue and have struggled to find a decent wiper for the rear glass of the vehicle. My last wiper was a Bosch and it did a poor job. The ends of the wiper weren't even in contact with the glass, which made the cleaning area even smaller. This Valeo wiper stays in contact with the glass for the entire sweep, and makes a nice, clean pass of the glass.Great product and highly recommended for a rear wiper.One thing to keep in mind though is that the adapter that comes with this wiper won't work on the Vue. You will need to pop off this adapter and the adapter off of the old wiper. Then re-install the adapter from the old wiper onto the new wiper. It's a pain, but will work out in the end. I got the adapters off by prying them off with a small flat blade screwdriver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I am disappointed with the Valeo wipers.

We do not get much rain in CO so I have only recently gauged how they work. The answer is poorly; they streak like year old blades. The driver's side blade is so bad it obscures vision, the passenger side blade is ok but NOT like a new blade should be. I bought these based on the recommendation of a certain consumer magazine and I am very disappointed. I decided to call Valeo for help. I followed their three or so prompts only to be \\"transferred to an agent\\" which actually meant get hung up on. I tried several times to no avail so I finally sent an e-mail. I am still waiting on a response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to offer superior performance","review":"I have tried many different wiper blades for my car. For whatever reason, it seems that even expensive blades such as the Rain-x Latitude and others even more expensive work pretty good for a while, but seem to deteriorate just as fast as cheaper blades. I have also found a lot of variability in blades, e.g. a given brand works pretty well for a time, but replacing it with the same brand and model yields a blade that streaks even when new. It has been frustrating. I decided to try these blades because they received the top rating in Consumer Reports. I have to say that they have performed as good or better than any others I have ever used, at least up to now (about one month of use). I will have to see how long they last, but my impression is very good at this point.

The Valeo 600 wipers are rated Consumer Reports best value and have had very good reviews so I gave them a try. I've had them for about a month now and I dont know if they will get better with age but so far not very good. I use 24\\" on the driver side and 20\\" on the passenger side as well as one 20\\" on the rear. The 20\\" wipers seem fine but the 24\\" never wipes clean. It leaves a huge 5\\" wide unwiped streak on my windshield. Maybe these 24\\" dont fit my car very well (Acura RSX). I'll probably go back to using Icons but it was worth a try considering these are supposed to last a good long time and cost less than half the price of the Icons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves streaks","review":"I bought these wipers because they were top rated by Consumer Reports.

A number of years ago I bought a pair that had three layers and were great for snow and rain, and I was trying to find something comparable.Of these Valeos, The one that is recommended for the driver's side completely sucked on my 2000 Celica, although the passenger's side blade works fine. It was actually hard to tell what was a worse choice when it rained - using it or not using it - because it somehow left a streak of water right in front of my line of vision when it went into the downward position. So it was a constant \\"I can see - I can't see - I can see - I can't see\\", when they were on. Of course, it didn't rain right after I received them, so time went by and I didn't find out about this problem until it was too late to return.

The stories were weak at best, and my main gripe is the pictures! The pictures are intended to show some sort of paranormal activity, but all you really see is either nothing, a big cloud of mist or smoke (which is not distinguishable from fog or cigarette smoke), or orbs, orbs, and more orbs. Which may or may not be dust, considering they are snapping pictures in dirty old abandoned buildings most of the time. I am sure the author is a very talented ghost hunter, but she should stick to hunting, and not writing books.

Once I changed my passcode successfully I have never again able to get into the safe without a key, which defeats the entire purpose of having a keypad enabled safe.The quality of the keypad and cover make the average happy meal toy look sophisticated and the instructions are wrong. Just flat wrong. I tried following the instruction manual to no avail. Then I tried using the instructions found in a review here, which probably work if this hunk of crud doesn't think you already changed your code. I actually threw it out the second story of my house and the door still opened, so there is that.

If people are worried thieves could easily take this safe and run that's hilarious they would need some time that's for sure couple that with an alarm system just not feasible. Sturdy product lots of room, the clear plastic cover over pin pad to protect from dust so it's better to have one then not.

The size is just right for the amount of valuables we store in the safe and it seems very sturdy. I did not bolt it to the floor and while sturdy it is light enough that I can move it around if need be. I\\"m sure it could be carried off but it would take some effort. Some of the reviews expressed concern about moisture getting on files, etc. if you left the safe closed for a long time. The instructions clearly state that you should open it for about 20 minutes a week to prevent this from happening since the seal is air tight since it is water proof and fire resistant.

I found a split in the plastic seam on the side of the door and all I can assume is that damp air some how got in there and in the dark, the mold and all started to grow and it set up it's own environment in there.

I used it as a text in a leadership workshop and most of the fixed minded accountant types in the room were lost. OK, maybe lost is a strong word. The sentiment of the book was lost on those who wanted a list of 10 things to do to enhance their leadership style. Written in \\"common speak\\" this book takes you on a journey to \\"outside the box\\". It challenges you to think differently and analyze those things that are spoon fed to us in the corporate world.

MacKenzie's delicate tightrope of allowing just enough of the corporate bureaucracy to balance your freedom-loving creativity to keep you in orbit (hence the metaphor) is good reading for both bureaucrats and creatives. MacKenzie understands that both sides need each other to truly accomplish something in business or in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Tom Robbins wrote a business handbook","review":"Judging by the evidence of this book, Gordon MacKenzie is a twinkling, Merry Prankster-esque holy fool, a cubicle-farm Patch Adams, out to shake up the grey-carpeted halls of corporate America with his own blend of studiedly random wackiness. As other reviewers have said, there is little in the way of practical, take-away advice in this book, and that might well be how MacKenzie wants it -- telling people how they should be is such an authority trip, man. But it leaves you with very little in the end, other than MacKenzie's self-satisfaction and a lot of fake-amateurish scribbling and marginalia. A few nuggets float to the surface here and there; I noted with interest how he told a group of timid executives to \\"make marks\\" on paper instead of draw on it, as \\"drawing\\" prompts anxiety in people not used to acting creatively. If MacKenzie could've deigned to offer a little more in that vein, this would have been a valuable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing, but not helpful","review":"I was really disappointed after reading this book - I should have paid more attention to the negative comments.Any book that bills itself as a \\"guide to surviving with grace\\" should have actual advice for how to do it. \\"Hairball\\" adoringly recaps the author's career path with little practical advice on how to replicate any of his success. (Unless I want to work in dim lighting and pretend to be a mysterious.)Like \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\" this book dumbs down any good lessons it could make. And like WMMC, it had my teeth on edge by the end. The illustrated stories started out as whimsical and amusing, but became irritating after the 50th messy, run-on sentence-filled, stream-of-consciousness page.If you want to learn why Gordon was the man at Hallmark, this is the book for you. If you want to learn how to survive with grace in your own corporate hairball, sorry - you're out of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This is my first time to write a review on Amazon, after buying books for years based on reader's reviews. This book is more like an haphazard biography of the author, especially what he has achieved and how successfull he has been.

But as someone pointed out earlier, part of the problem is the modern management structure that stifle creativity. Until the structure changes, problems will cotinue. I would suggest that the author reads the free manifesto 'why your boss is programmed to be a dictator' at changethis.com - the real barrier to creativity at work is revealed.

Motivating creative people is tuff, but Gordon makes it seem like a dream ride. It was refreshing to see a creative person's point-of-view for a change. Finally, someone has the guts to tell it how it is! I read this book during a major power outage with a battery powered book light. In total isolation and in the dark I couldn't stop reading and experiencing this great book. In the dark, I became the creative guru that has been buried inside of me for years! In the next few days I was asked to attend a meeting with my fellow employees. To the horror of my boss, I burst forth telling them I was a creative genius and if given the time I could show them the total genius I really am. Everyone looked at me like I was loony, but I felt exhilarated and ready to take on anything that came my way. Gordon, thanks for waking me up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Everyone","review":"I'll first admit something about myself; I'm not a creative person in the traditional sense.

Perhaps because we never have had to survive in a really major corporate hairball, MacKenzie's observations and explanations became much more a personal issue.Would that all our psychologists and psychiatrists be as adept at observing people's behaviors, discerning their states of mind and explaining it for one and all without jargon or gobbledygook.

I have been diligently reading it for the last week. At first, I noticed an abundance of typos. I just finished reading the OSPF chapters. Too much effort is wasted trying to figure out what the author is trying to say. The typos are now showing up in very critical areas. Information isn't consistent. After spending a very long time trying to understand the material, I realized that it was the authors presentation and typos that I was trying to work through not the actual material. Rather than waste anymore of my time, I'm going to purchase another book and start again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a waste of time to read the book","review":"I totally agree with all of the bad comments on this book. I spent more than a month to read through it because I trusted it to be a good book. However during this period too much of my effort were spent on struggling with those misleading presentations and mistakes in the book.

When I eventually understand everything, I concluded that the studying experience would be much much less frustrating and time-consuming if I chose a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I totally agree with the bad comments below. This book is a disaster. As someone says before: 1. There are a lot of mistakes. 2. Many diagrams are not very accurate. 3. It's too long. I'd want to add that is't incredible that 4 CCIEs (Clare Gough, Jorge Aragon, Steve Gifkins, Martin Walshaw) are involved in this work. What happens Cisco Press ?? The old-ACRC book (Laura Chappell)was definitely a good book for a long time in the routing theme. Hey Laura !! Could you teach these guys how to write a readable, useful and accurately book ??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best, but it did help","review":"This book made so much more sense to me only after I read Todd Lamels CCNP Routing book. It has about the same info., but Todds books are so much clearer and easier to read. This book just jumps from one thing to another, it does not flow. I used this book for the new BSCI exam, I know it dosn't cover IS-IS and yes IS-IS is heavily tested on the exam, I got at least six questions. I would suggest using this book as only one of your resources. there were at least three questions I can think of that I could only find the answers in this book.

I plan on using another study guide, along with Routersim software to pass the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is by NO means from hard work","review":"I totally agree with folks that gave the criticism to this book before me. The book is1. Full of typos and errors! An incredible and inexcusable number of them have been seen here and there. I've been in US for several years and have NEVER ever seen any book, any book published in this country with that many mistakes!2. Written in obscure British English. I really don't understand why they picked an Englishwoman to do this job. The English she uses in this book is technology-wise non-standard and unclear.My conclusion is, you grab any CCIE in Silicon Valley who is conscientious for his job and speaks American English and he/she can do a much better job than Mr. Gough. The book is NOT worth to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your money until a 200 page ERRATA comes out","review":"First, I will start with the one positive thing about the book. It attempts to take an in depth look at routing.Now the negatives:1. So many errors and typos that it is barely readable and will leave you wondering what is correct and what is not.2. Too long and wordy!3. The author states that some things aren't on the test that are on the test.4. NO ERRATA FOR THOSE OF US THAT DROPPED [a lot of money] PLUS TAX ON THIS BOOK!The bottom line... I hope this book isn't going to be the new standard for the Cisco Press books...."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing quality","review":"For a book endorsed by Cisco, and specifically targetted for preparing CCNP, you would expect good quality, at least I was. Unfortuneately, it is not like that. The book has some good points, like the quick quiz before each chapter, and the comprehensive answeres and notes. However, when you look at the example configurations and the corresponding diagrams carefully, most of time, they are messed up. Just look at the Chapter 9 example 9-5 and figure 9-9, and its corresponding text!Hopefully, a revision will make this book more useful.BTW, I do like some Cisco books, like \\"routing TCP/IP\\" by Jeff Doyle, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good protein supplement.","review":"I ordered the natural flavor because most flavored drinks are too sweet for me.

Each story focuses on characters of different ages and genders, but they share the same struggle to survive in New York's lower east side.

However, if I live on, everything that was once confused will eventually strighten out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curiously cold and inert","review":"This synopsis of this novel makes it sound as if it would be moving and contemplative. It's unfortunate that it was staid and boring. The characters' confusion frustrated me because I couldn't understand it and they didn't move forward. They just wallowed in this muddled despair and stayed in it. Plus, the failed attempts at closure for the characters was completely lost on me.Ultimately I just found this book boring and completely without suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere characters, nowhere book","review":"Like many others, I thought the premise of how a plane crash impacts a disparate number of characters in a small town held great promise. Of course, the problem wasn't with the premise. I think it had much to do with the characters that made up this sad group. When you center a novel on a group of characters whose common trait is the inability or unwillingness to act, you create a story that is annoying. My annoyance was replaced by irritation when each character's storyline ended with some small, lame act that, I suppose, is a sign that each is finally on his or her way. In fact, the only character that I found interesting was the kidney transplant patient befriended by one of these \\"nowhere\\" characters. Unfortunately, she was just a small part of this book. I suppose that's because she wouldn't need a plane crash to make her get a haircut, like the most annoying of the characters, Paul."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT???","review":"I can't believe that all these people think this book is bad. I loved it. It's a delicate blend of narrative and dialogue giving us something magical. A post-Orwellian tradgedy tinged with hints of Shakespeare's wit which shows even in the saddest moments.The characters the author chose to pick out showed us the different facets of a plane crash - how it affects different people. How can anyone say that this is not a subtle masterpiece laced with a hint of almost satirical wit. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only word that comes to mind is \\"disappointment\\"","review":"This is one of the first books that have left me dazed. Lennon's writing style is easy to follow, but the 'bits & pieces' which make up the story are chosen rather randomly. Though i loved the idea of the tragic \\"plane falling from the sky\\" and enjoyed the beginning of the book, i felt that Lennon has left out a whole chunk of his story unexplained. Also, Lennon only concentrated on the lives of one or two characters in the story, and not all of them, which made me wonder why he introduced the other characters into the story in the first place. My final words were: What was the whole point of that? -Perhaps this just isn't my type of book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters disappoint, so not much interest in their stories","review":"There are many stories trying to be told in thisnovel which reads to this reader like a project for a creative writing class. The stories might be worthwhile if there were anything interesting about the characters at all, but there isn't --without exception they are crashing bores. Andhow can we believe that following a plane crash which takes off part of a house, the owner's learnthat they are not insured for the loss and justtarp over the gaping hole. (Is this a symbol thatwent over my head?) The setting for the book isa small college town in Montana, and the author seems comfortable describing life there.Before I read this book, I thought I'd like to visit Montana. Now I think I'll just stay home."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to throw this book out the window","review":"Okay, I understand that this is a first novel and indeed the writer was in his twenties when he wrote it, but all I can say is: it shows! The first chapter was great, but it went way down hill from there. I just didn't buy the characters. It was clear to me that this writer has not experienced even half of what he writes about (the death of a parent, a divorce, estrangement from one's children, the loss of a lover in a sudden accident). I am not saying that a writer must always write from autobiography in order for it to be good, but a writer certainly must be able to convey the human truths of these events if he expects anyone to read this as anything approaching quality fiction. There were many moments that I admired. Lennon may have some wonderful books ahead, but this one, I wanted to throw it out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like its characters, this tale lost focus and direction","review":"Based on the premise, I really thought I'd love this book -- and after the first few pages, I was sure I would. But it lost focus and direction. Characters were introduced and dropped -- for no apparent reason. I wasn't looking for a happy ending, but I was looking for some sense of closure. The book doesn't have any. I can only say if it was a gimmick setting up the premise for a sequel...I'm not interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"read a review before you buy","review":"I was highly disappointed in Lennon's novel. I found it disappointing, lacking in narrative and down-right boring. The characters he uses have no depth, no ending and no real beginning. I thought the novel had a real chance at the beginning and was disappointed when it ended just like any of his other chapters. I can understand wanting the readers mind to wonder, but the only thing I was wondering was the whole point to the novel. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget This One","review":"I was really bummed after reading this book. It was to slow and did not seem real. It drove me crazy reading chapter after chapter about someone different. There were several main characters, that by the time I got to a chapter about them, I forgot who they were and where they left off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is missing...","review":"I like the idea of writing about people who have left behind the plane crash---how it affects people who somehow involved. There are several main characters in this story, and I was expecting something would happen to connect all (or at least some) of them, but nothing really happened. Even after finishing the book, I still feel like \\"unfinished.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I kept forcing myself through this book to try to discover the point...there isn't one. It's a rambling tale of a bunch of losers caught up in inertia...and I'm afraid that the same inertia kept me going. Also, I didn't have a good cereal box to read instead. The characters have all totally ceded control of their lives, but the dialog and narration would have you believe that they are taking control. As my father-in-law would say, \\"S--- or get off the pot!\\" Lennon thanks people for their contribution to his material on the Indians and plane crash investigation...yet the book contains no detail on either of these that displays as much knowledge as a casual TV viewer might have. There is simply no substance or point to this book.

The trio of longer cuts - Art of Destruction, Timesquare, Jungle Journey - provide a solid venue for the music to percolate.Tangerine Dream shows that there is fine art when things go \\"boom.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for experts, off-putting for beginners","review":"Ironically, the \\"Introducing\\" books always seem to be least useful for those who really need an introduction. Introducing Postfeminism (an awkward term if ever there was one) is no exception - it's overly stylish and short on transitions, organized paragraphs, and clear explanations of specific figures and ideas. If you already have a solid grounding in these matters, the book may be a handy pocket reference - however, as an actual introduction it's a mess. The ideas jump off the page in the worst kind of buzzworded style, and we're scarcely five words into essentialism when structuralism barges into the picture. Even a reader eager to learn (me) finds hirself skimming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Kurt","review":"Hey Addison Godel, are you in any way related to Kurt Godel ?Just wondering. \\"Introducing Postfeminism\\" is a good book except the part on psyhcology i didnt really think it was too introductory.

Within a few tunes it's obvious that Doucet is a master of both his instrument as well as the musical language he's passing along for posterity. His vocals appear sporadically throughout, but the focus remains on the solo guitar. He sings the melodies and words completely without ego, with reverence that does not require technical perfection -- it speaks from the gut. His instrumental skills are expert, as he makes the melodies cut through on top of strong rhythm played flawlessly in tempo. This is an album that is alternately haunting and quietly evocative; a stark wonder that is as powerful as it is serene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the next one!","review":"It's so wonderful to have this delicious recipe collection at last.

But not so. In one story arch, Conan is living off the land, drawing on all his survival skills in the wilderness, sort of like Les Stroud in \\"Survivorman\\" on Discovery Channel. This, I thought, is a great idea for a story setting. It fizzles when Conan meets a forest maiden and basically settles down and gets married! Conan's relationship with this maiden is not keeping in character with the Conan created by Robert E. Howard. The other story arch is about a girl, her god-possessed doll and her rise to queen of Brythunia. It is pretty dull, cliche in many ways. The archs intersect in the last few pages. It's not an anticlimax, but it's not a terrific climax either. It just sort of happens. Then it's over.

Sometimes I have a problem getting into undergroud hip-hop because of sub-par production... but on this record, (along with every other Anticon record), the music is gorgeous.My favorite tracks are: Respect Pt.3, Plutonium, Pawn in the Game Pt.2, and Selling Live Water.I'd recommend this album to anyone.

For all its dense, breathless wordplay and thick, stewy production, you'd be forgiven for thinking that there's a surfeit of content here, threads to untangle, layers to peel through. The disappointing reality is that all these five-dollar words and murky sonic tapestries are impressionistic at best, a fact that wouldn't be in the least bit troubling were Sole's more lucid moments not filled with blazing rhetoric in deference to some sort of hidden insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Sole verse found in Bible Code","review":"Absurd long-words perform surgical intrusions,Impeding the brain with cranial confusions,Convoluted metaphors create pompous delusions,Leaving cyberpseuds with paranoid illusions"},{"rating":"2","title":"raw & inventive","review":"Think of this album as a genius engineer building a masterfully powerful machine...out of an erector set. 'Selling Live Water' has powerful, very raw and clangy, beats. Sole's voice is that of anger, frustration, and insight, but overall you can really here a guy having fun. He creates incredible lines without using any proper rhyme scheme; his formula is to be dead on with the beats, and at that he is incredible. While Sole's rapping skills cannot be argued with, I must say that the beats are the star of the album. Of all the hip-hop albums to emerge lately this one is 2nd only to El-P's 'Fantastic Damage'. Exceptional songs include 'Da Baddest Poet', 'Salt on Everything', and 'Plutonium'."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Civil War Day By Day","review":"Wonder what was going on on this date during the Civil War?

The struggle between the conservative,experienced Munro[perhaps a fictional Jennings],who prides himself on examining what he sees as real news & issues,and the forces of the market such as the increasing amount of tabloid journalism present on the main networks[perhaps a swipe at Brokaw],is presented in an entertaining dialogue. The intersecting issues,such as the rise of new talent,political infighting,and the role of media intrigue,adds to the reality of Munro's dilemma. Macneil's obvious inside knowledge of the tv news divisions and the stuggles they face with cable,news magazines & the internet make this book even more compelling.

At first, I was really excited to be using it. However, I found that it takes quite a bit of the conditioner to get a good lather going and to evenly cover my hair.After I dried it with my towel, I noticed that my hair wasn't very moist and it was left feeling very dry. It was even worse when I tried to comb it out. My comb would keep getting caught in my hair and wouldn't run smoothly through it. I think it might have to do with the fact that I have thick, long hair. I definitely don't think that I'll be buying these products again. I'd prefer to use a shampoo and conditioner that's made just for colored hair of any kind. I feel that, for a product that is supposed to be moisturizing, it doesn't do the job. If you have thick hair like me, you might want to pass this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dried my hair out!","review":"I have long brown hair that is in healthy condition.

It was wrong on removing a door panel, and fortunatly I figured it out before I ruined the panel. My current project is replacing the radiator and water pump. The book did not mention that the front skid plate needs to be removed (minor) as well as the entire front facia (not so minor). The drain plugs need to be removed from the block, I just haven't been able to get to them with conventional sockets/box, or open ended wrenches. hopefully the crow's foot I just bought will do the trick. It stated that the special spanner you need to remove the fan clutch is readily available at most parts stores, just not the major store chains we have here in California(Kragen, Auto Zone). I've replaced a few radiators, and this one has turned into a nightmare. If the book had been straight up, I would have had a pro handle this. Jeeps suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat useful but disappointing overall","review":"These manuals have become fairly common. I bought it to help with some upcoming work on my Jeep. I have quite a bit of experience working on cars but none on this vehicle. I found that the manual has a lot of pictures and description of steps of work to perform but details of sticky situations, tools required and specs on clearances, tightening torques, adjustments, etc. are non-existent. These details are what makes a shop manual worth buying. Without this additional data, you cannot complete a job cirrectly in many cases. Haynes just doesn't offer that information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haynes ripped us off. I am very disappointed in them.","review":"Over the years, I have owned dozens of Haynes books and still have 5 for my and my children's other vehicles.The 1993-2004 Jeep manual is by FAR the cheesiest Haynes manual I have ever had. It is almost useless; had I bought it directly from Haynes or an autoparts store, I would have returned it immediately with this writeup included.In order to sell more books to a wider 'year' of audiences, Haynes merely changed the years on the book's cover and did very little else. Most of the sections are applicable to 1993 thru 1998 but totally drop us off the cliff for the 1999 thru 2004 data.And yes, much did change in those years. I believe a full vehicle tear down was done once upon a time but not recently.I am going to have to pay the piper twice to get a decent reference manual. Haynes, really failed us with this book.

The questions are poorly worded, if your answer is wrong you are insulted and for a book based on the teaching of reading - it was full of typos.

Tried five different brands of blank DVD's with the same result. Never got the chance to record anything. The playback mode with pre-recorded discs gives a mostly fuzzy picture. The built-in channel tuner didn't recognize 12 cable channels so the unit just bypassed them during setup. I have never in my life been so disappointed with a purchase.

My recorder kept freezing up and I would have to restart it all the time. I finalized a dvd the other day and it froze, then after I turned it off it came back on and said formating and then said no disk. It won't let me eject the disk. Even after unplugging for a day or two it still won't eject the dvd. So now it is a completely useless dvd recorder. And of course it only has a three month warranty and I look and it has almost been 4 months. It seems that they put a 3 month warranty on it because they knew it would go out right after the 3 months. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD RECORDER or any other one of this brand. Don't make the same mistake I did. I only wish I had checked these reviews before I bought the stupid thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cyberhome 1500 DVD Recorder Doesnt Work Bad Design","review":"I had a Cyberhome 1500 for less than a week when it started to lock up the disk drive and need reseting to do anything. This was the case for several weeks until it began to lock up for hours at a time and COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE TO THE DISK DRIVE.As the last straw...if failed completely. After several phone waits exceeding 45 minutes each, I was told I would get a new one if I sent it back. WRONG. Instead I was contacted by a RUDE and EXEEDINGLY DISTASTEFUL individual who said I need to send $89.95 to get it REPAIRED not replaced.

Good for me because I saw how big of a waste of money this was within the first week that I had it. You get what you pay for, this I know, but still - if you're gonna shell out $245 for something, it should atleast give you a little bit of quality. First, it records everything in a dark, kinda black and white tint. You don't get full fledged color at all. Second, it cuts off automatically while taping things and the quality isn't that great.I HATE IT.

I can't turn it to standby."},{"rating":"1","title":"good recordings, but a lazy DVD player/recorder","review":"Sure it's a DVD recorder, and yes it can transfer your old time VHS classics. But it's lazy. what I mean by that is that the player works when it wants to, he accepts only certain types of blanks, you can only use DVD+R all other's will not function, if you want to watch a movie it takes an eternity for it to load. Plus it has the worst fast forwarding feature I have ever seen: instead of fast forwarding the picture it lags even more. The player brings 3 DVD+RW blanks that records but can't be used in another player. The finalizing process to make your DVD recordings compatible with other players takes an eternity as well. Sometimes while finalizing it erases everything; basically everything you recorded is gone. Sure it works, it records, and it has good picture quality. But it sucks and it's slow and lazy. Simply put.MY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"bought this thing from hsn about 2 years ago. i could never get it to work. had my son work his magic and got it to work for about a year. could only rec on rw discs. week ago took a recorded disc out of the tray and it hasen't worked since.willnot respond to any comandes except on and off by the rear switch. what a piece of ----"},{"rating":"2","title":"Working well after a replacement","review":"It seems that the Cyberhome 1500 had some kind of defect with the power supplies that caused the unit to lock up permanently with whatever disc you had inside at the time. Cyberhome has an offer on their web site to replace defective units with the same or a newer model. I chose the 1500 because I like the editing features on it. Since I received the replacement unit I have had no real problems to speak of; all dvd's play fine, it records fine to dvd+r's and dvd-r's, the recorded discs play in my stand alone dvd players.

Much to my disbelief this thing even looks bad on the inside with some very sloppy assembly (I bought it new with a factory seal).

Apparently Cyberhome self destructs just about the time their warranty is up!

I used it for about 4 hours a day so far, some days 11 hours, trying to transfer the family videos before machine started to act like the one I returned. I usually use the hq setting as I want the best possible results for archiving videos. I did not do any firmware updates or anything else.

The Vampire as Hero formula isn't original, nor is the idea of a beautiful girl discovering she's the child of a vampire prince, making her something of a princess herself. Neither is the idea of \\"bad\\" vampires as murdering maniacs with a leader who wants to marry said princess while killing off the father, so that he will be the new Prince of Darkness.It may not be a particularly scary horror flick, and it has a lot of popular cliches, but it still managed to be enjoyable.

The combination of Guy Marks's words and James Morris's pictures tempt the mind and the soul to wander the globe in search of the ancient histories of this fascinating place.

There was nothing on errors, debugging, system errors, dump files, log files ... anything that would help me understand the problem. This has been my experience every time I open this book.

Once you get to around level 8, you realize even when you hit every dot you're only just above red. That's when you notice your screen is scratched up from playing this gift from Satan, and you have a final exam tomorrow that you've barely studied for because you can't get the song Skater Boy out of your head and every time you close your eyes you see circles.In other words, if you are the type of person who has to finish what you've started, get out while you still can."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing game","review":"the game is disappointing to me. its hard to keep up with the beat in any song in the beginning but since there's only 19 songs... it gets pretty easy. its super boring, and me and my family stopped playing it for years. i don't recommend this game to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the original","review":"I bought this game the other day and all I can say is this version is pure garbage.

This is primarily due to the fact that the soundtrack for Elite Beat Agents was terrible. The songs in Ouendan were popular Jpop, and had fairly catchy tunes. Elite Beat Agents uses either unheard of or ancient songs such as YMCA. Basically, it seems like they just looked for the cheapest music licenses they could find.

It is a musical game that has you tapping the screen in time to the music. The varying levels of difficulty insure that you'll enjoy the game, whether your rythmatically deficient or played percussion since you were 6.The game is somewhat short, like many of the DS games, and gets somewhat old after you've beaten it once. There are increased level of difficulties (two, after you beat normal mode), but I ended up putting it down before I completed the next level of difficulty. However, it's still a game that I'll pick back up on the rare occasion.All-in-all, a great game, but somewhat short on the replayability."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs a new editor!","review":"The spelling and editing in this book is horrible. No book should be allowed to be printed without having a professional proofreader review the pages. While the story was interesting in parts, it did slow down and got rather boring by the second half of the book. This became more of an homage to the author than what was happening around him in the world and its effect on his and his family's life.Supposedly this is a novel, but in reality it is an autobiography masked as fiction (and not written very well)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man Alive (again)","review":"A nice latter day official \\"bootleg\\" Contains a few old favourites plus a few from recent albums.

I saw them several times with the original line up and nothing will ever top that. Regardless who they have help them live anymore. But in 2004 Head and Fieldy were burnt out from drugs and Korn were showing signs of burning out as well.Korn still rules in my opinion, but this is not there best. Buying this is for the \\"Head and David\\" factor. In the show you see a few mess ups by the band, that during there best they wouldnt of done. Fieldy looks tired and and out of energy the whole time. JD is awesome, but his voice isnt as strong as it is now, IMO.For the price it is worth it for any true Korn fan. I did enjoy watching the set with all of the 5 of them like back in the day. I think that Korn has improved since Head and David left for the right reasons and continue to rock and rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Effective for darkening toenails","review":"My toenails had begun to darken. My doctor thought this could be cured with a prescription product that could have a negative side effect on my liver! So, I searched the internet for a cure. Two suggestions were a daily soak in white vinegar and to take wild oregano capsules. Using these two remedies together, I could see clear toenail growth within a couple of weeks. At that point I stopped the white vinegar soak but continued to take 2 or 3 of these capsules per day. After a few months, all off the new nail growth was clear and a year later the toes are fine. I keep taking the Oregamax because it seems also to help with digestion and perhaps general health (I read somewhere that oregano also has antioxidant properties). There have been no negative side effects and my liver hasn't been damaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Natural Antibiotic","review":"This natural product is extremely effective as a natural antbiotic...first symptom of illness I take it...and never get sick, I ve never had a cold since I have been using oil of oregano...I eat at restaurants often and always take some before I eat restaurant food and never get food poisoning like I used to.

This book has taught me the basics and beyond. I recommend it because the tone marks and pronunciations are easy to understand and the book teaches you the rules so that you can figure out different variations of a word. There is also an English/Thai, Thai/English dictionary in the back and the book is small enough to fit in your pocket. Thai script plus phonetic thai is included. The only downside I can see is that the words are so tiny that it's sometimes hard to see thai script vowels and tonal marks."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not for the serious learner of Thai","review":"I've been studying Thai and living in Bangkok for over a year now. This book has useful street Thai phrases and might be handy for those doing a vacation. However, the phrases taught in this book are mostly slang or low level Thai. Thus, it's not very useful for the serious learner. Many things could be spoken and written in a more proper or grammatical manner. Thus, I found this book a hinderance in study rather than a benefit for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pocket Perfect","review":"This is an excellent phrase book, easy to carry, easy to read and broken into easy to find section.

My 19 month old daughter loved it, but it's sopisticated enough for older children. I'm buying my second! In addition there is a VERY generous amount of REUSABLE stickers.

I couldn't feel sorry for the \\"heroine\\" or fear the \\"badguy\\". I wanted the cops to put them both in a room together to watch this movie and put them both out of their misery. What were supposed to be serious scenes had me at a loss because I wasn't sure if I wanted to laugh or throw a brick at the TV! There were times that I could almost see the actors trying not to laugh while trying to be serious. It is labled a \\"dark comedy\\" but the only thing funny about it is how someone thought it should be made into a movie. The only surprise in it was how awful the movie was.

It was a challenge just to get to the end of this movie. I believe if this film was given the time to produce it right, to re-shoot some of the acting flub-ups and perhaps re-write some of the scenes this could have been an okay movie.

Reese Witherspoon, probably the greatest actress of her age, gives the performance of a lifetime as a girl who, despite the many difficulties, will do anything to get what she wants.

The thing that sets her apart from the other actresses her age is her ability to pick good roles that really allow her to showcase her acting chops. This bizarre but hilarious take on \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" is well worth watching. As a white trash heroine straight out of the trailor park, Reese's character starts a trek the leads her straight in the path of a killer played by Keifer Sutherland. Vanessa Lutz is a fun character and you can tell Reese relished playing her. Luckily, this dvd is affordable priced so you can see a movie by the star of \\"Legally Blonde\\" and the upcoming \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" for a decent price. There are no extras but the movie is well worth the price. Highly recommended and a must see for Reese Witherspoon fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of Cult status!","review":"Freeway was a little idependent film that came out a few years ago with little fanfare. Do not be fooled by its lackluster debut, however, because this film is a true revelation. Reese Witherspoon is brilliant as a foul-mouthed white-trash heroine and Keifer Southerland's face is a classic. The movie works wonders as both a superficial comedy and thoughtfull satire, and stands on its own as one of the best social comments of the 90s. It's Clueless on acid!

I am not one to view movies more than once, however this is one that I have seen several times. Reese Witherspoon's performance is mind-blowing.

All I can tell you is that I found this movie to be ugly and depressing and to have no humanity. Reese Witherspoon is one of best actresses to emerge from Hollywood in the last several years -- she was great in \\"Pleasantville\\" and downright brilliant in \\"Election.\\" I have to wonder why she agreed to make this film -- her performance is daring, but it deserves to be in a much better film than this. It's not surprising that this movie was produced by Oliver Stone -- like all of his films, it celebrates violence, vulgarity and the degradation of women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reese makes me cringe...","review":"I could feel no remorse or empathy for Reese's character.

I always have to know the ending of any movie, so of course I sat through the entire duration of Freeway. Reese Witherspoon was amazing, but the movie's plot left a lot to be desired. This movie is jam packed with graphic violence, an extreme amount of sex talk, and depicts women as pieces of meat. I'm not a conseravtive movie watcher, but come on, did they really have to show Vanessa's grandmother strangled and naked on the floor? I think this could have been a great movie if the writers/producers/directors showed a little bit of taste.

Kiefer Sutherland comes along as the \\"caring rebound\\" from her dilemma, portraying a helpful child psychologist who has all the answers to her problems. This is where the film takes a turn to the bizarre and demented.Skeptical of Reese Witherspoon's starring role? Thinking \`Legally Blonde'? Well put those assumptions to rest because this chick is not the one to screw over.

Maybe that's how they wanted it, but this seems to be the growing trend with all digital music - to see how much headroom can be squeezed out of digital levels to the point of low level distortion. Bottom line - the songs rock, but the audiophile in me says they sound like c-r-a-p.

Yes, juniors. We are studying a unit about children's literature, and I thought that this would be an example of great writing. They loved it! Not only did they love the change of pace for the day -- they all sat on the floor and just listened to me read -- but they enjoyed discussing how it was based on the Midas Touch. Even children's books can be great for high-school students."},{"rating":"2","title":"A greedy boy gets his 'just desserts'!","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was in third grade, and recently bought it for my niece who is currently in fourth grade. It's a cute story about a boy named John Midas, who loves chocolate so much that he'd rather eat that alone than anything else in the world. One day, he finds a special coin in the street and goes to a candy shop where the storekeeper sells him a big box of the sweetest, chocolatiest chocolate he's ever tasted. I won't give away any more of this story...all I'll say is that John Midas quite literally gets his 'just desserts'. I liked the book a lot, both then and now, and I think your children will, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophisticated Ladies","review":"This musical extravaganza will get you off your couch!

Her presence on that stage was like she belonged there and had been there all the time. To hear her sing In A Sentimental Mood, she put her whole heart into it and I could feel what she felt. It was chilling. Phyllis stole the show. She made the stage her own. Sophisticated Lady is exactly what Phyllis was on that stage. I'm sure when Duke wrote the song, \\"Music Is A Woman,\\" I'm pretty sure he had a woman like Phyllis in mind.This DVD is a definite must have for any Phyllis Hyman fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Broadway magic!","review":"I've been a longtime fan of \\"Sophisticated Ladies\\", ever since the Broadway cast album came out. I was never blessed to see the production. I was very excited discovering the existence of this DVD and it is quite magnificent. Great performances shine throughout, but the unquestionable highlights are every appearance of the legendary Phyllis Hyman. She takes command every time she's on stage with her mesmerizing stage presence and heavenly jazz influenced vocals.The only thing that keeps this DVD from perfection is the absence of original cast members Gregory Hines and Judith Jamison, but it's real, real close.

Carol grew up in an era where many people with physical challenges lived their lives in institutions. Carol, with the love of a super family and intelligent insight into herself, not only stays home and blesses her family with her presence but strikes out to live on her own as a valued member of society. This is a remarkable story of courage, faith and intelligence. It truly teaches us to look beyond the physical to see the soul. And Carol had a beautiful soul.

In time, you'll find that the powerful Brother Can You Spare a Dime is as much a favorite as the more raucus, gritty work by Benoit and Gatemouth.

Tab is consistently at his best here, and there are so many great tunes I've never heard before, all rendered to perfection.

The cinematography and graphics are all done very well, the orchestral score is powerful, and the scripture narration (by John Rhys-Davies and Karen Scheeland) is amazing. Therefore, this is a great introduction to a beginning Christian. However, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to an atheist friend, nor a seasoned Christian, because it is very basic in its presentation. Popular author Lee Strobel and pastor Greg Laurie are good at presenting the basic position, but are certainly not scholars, and the scholars present do not give enough background on the issues to fully flesh-out the argument the film wishes to present. I would have liked to have seen more scholars and more in-depth investigation.

He leaves the house with his wife near the movie's beginning to get away from their two raunchy worthless sons, and except for a brief scene here and there you'll not see him again. Instead, the bulk of the movie focuses on the two \\"young adult\\" sons. There is absolutley nothing redeeming in this movie if you have half a brain, and what little humor there is falls into the category of crude, raunchy, unintelligent, 10 levels below the Three Stooges.

The songs on \\"Welcome\\" are just not up to par in my opinion. I find them boring. The execution of the songs are of course top notch- I know of no finer singer/guitar player than Doyle, he kicks ... as usual- but it just doesn't cut it for me. One problem with great players is that they often get away with mediocre song writing. I think this album suffers in that way. \\"Jelly Cream\\" is a much superior album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"I am a huge fan of Doyle's songwriting, and his contributions to the recent B.B. King/Eric Clapton CD were the best songs on the project. However, like the recent Double Trouble CD, this is the most disappointing effort of 2001. Amazingly, there isn't a memorable tune on this CD! Like Jon Tiven, Desmond Child, and a lot of other great songwriters, all this CD proves is that Bramhall is only about 4000 miles away from being anything close to a decent PERFORMER--and that really hurts. If you want a lot of ... Hendrix and SRV imitations, buy this CD. Otherwise, avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the real Doyle Bramhall","review":"I don't really need to say a lot, except that the blues-based, lyrical Doyle Bramhall that I know and like, is nowhere to be found on this CD. Sorry, but to me it was nothing more than a bunch of un-inspired genre-neutral ramblings. It got to the point that half-way through, I just started skipping track after track, each of which sounded no different than the one before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talent galore, needs song writer.","review":"I'm a fan, but not enough so that I could recommend this CD. It seems that with every passing effort, Bramhall gets a little worse. He's got a great voice, he plays a great guitar,....but the songs are just out and out mediocre.If you don't own anything by Bramhall, get the Arc Angels first, his debut solo second, then flip a coin over the two most recent. I'll continue to hope that he fulfills his potential with the next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, well-rounded album. Buy it!","review":"Doyle has been trying to shake the SRV wannabe moniker for some time, and I think his last two albums have done just that. The album starts out with his single \\"Green Light Girl\\". The first thing you'll think when you hear it is Lenny Kravitz. It has that kind of a vibe to it. Nothing extraordinary or new...but not bad at all. I can just see the record execs telling Doyle to at least put one song on the album that sounds like something you'd hear on modern radio. \\"Green Light Girl\\" is that song. \\"Problem Child\\" is very good. My kinda guitar. The song goes from slow, blues-inspired, Hendrix-like guitar riffs to an all out guitar frenzy..and then back again. Probably my favorite song on the album. I'm not going to go on to describe each song...but it is mixed bag of a variety of different styles. Very good, solid album. It's a shame that it'll probably not sell over 500,000 copies. It's not the type of music that radio will give a chance...and that's a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it loud and play it often.","review":"For those among us who feel rock is a feeling and not a movement; for those among us who feel the only statement rock should make is \\"Hell, yeah!\\" and not that cutting down trees is wrong; for those among us who like our music blunt like a sledgehammer and loud like an F-16 screaming across the sky, pick up this album. It won't redefine the wheel, it won't make your cheerios stay crispy in milk, and it won't cure your male pattern baldness; but it will make you smile and will make you more than once consider learning to play guitar (or picking up your guitar and trying to wail along with the music contained herein).Bottom line: this is a fun album and Doyle's playing is more than competent.

I don't think there is a smoother voice in rock and roll today and Bramhall definitely can play some blues guitar.

However, \\"The Potter's Freedom\\" is not what it is said to be - a review of Geisler's \\"Chosen But Free\\" book. One can easily test this by trying to match up what White claims Geisler says/believes with what he actually says. You'll have a difficult time. I'm wondering whether or not White even read Geisler's book.Also, many Strong Calvinists who are set in their thoughts about Salvation Theology continue to be elitist and condescending by triumphantly claiming their superior scholarship. All the reviews (and theologians themselves) that dis Geisler's scholarship are foolish. Personally, I don't believe everything Geisler advocates - however, he is one of the most brilliant theologians of all.If Strong Calvinists wish to influence the thoughts of the rest of us, they should drop the \\"we're smart - you're stupid\\" routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single Minded","review":"James White writes with a single minded attitude: Defend the reformed position at all costs, even if it means throwing out Biblical truth. This whole book is about refuting Norman Geisler's book CHOSEN BUT FREE.

He can't seem to understand that God, by His sovereign grace, has given us a free will- or at least it's a point he has never pondered in Scripture.

I came across this book from the book recommendation from my son's school. While reading this book, I realized that the school is following a lot of the concepts in this book, which actually built up my son's reading skills. I would say that this is a book that all parents with small children should read. The area for improvement lies in the answers to the questions in the book. Simply put, the answers are not skimmer friendly. You really need to read everything she writes instead of using skimming skills. In this era of information flood, people appreciate a book that allows skimming for information.

The cover was not the Powell cover that Amazon shows. Instead it was done by a different artist. This development lead quickly to more disappointment as I found that all of the art was done by this same guy. Now, he's not a terrible artist or anything, but I would have much rather seen Powell's art carry the story. I didn't care for the actual artist's style much.More disappointment came when I found that the story had none of the Powell humor I came to love by reading his Goon series. And with a name like Billy the Kid's Old-Timey Oddities, you expect a bit of that humor.I quickly turned around and sold the book to someone else, so no harm done.

This movie is funny, timely, and intoxicating. The music lingers in you mind days and even months after you have seen this movie.

I loved this movie! I like really unique characters, and this movie is filled with a lot of awesome characters. In this film an assortment of odd balls band together to rob a small casino. As in all of the other Coen Brother's films, you never know what is going to happen next. That is what I love most about their films. A lot of insane things happen and the characters all do crazy things, but it remains believable throughout.

I always question why remakes are made when the original is so good. This movie has none of the heart or humour of the original"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should be","review":"A movie starring Tom Hanks as a verbose con man, renting a room from a sweet Mississippi lady, and using it to tunnel underground to the counting room of a casino, should be funny. Unfortunately, this movie misses the mark and never becomes the comic force that it should be. Hanks does not inspire many chuckles for his portrayal of a silver-tongued crook and his henchmen are foul-mouthed, hugely sterotypical, and not particularly funny. The only thing that earns this movie any stars at all is the portrayal of the church-going landlady by Irma P. Hall and the gospel music in the background and the church scenes. This movie goes to show that just because it stars Tom Hanks, it's not necessarily a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Hanks what were you thinking?","review":"I'm really not that picky when it comes to movies but c'mon--this movie is AWFUL with a capital A.

Tom Hanks is a pretty good actor but in this film I'd have to say his acting was about as good as a retarded old man trying to play the title role in \\"The life of marilyn Monroe\\". The language used in this film is horrendous to say the least. Every other word was the \\"F\\" word and in some films it fits. But in this film it fit about as good as the elephant man in a motorcycle helmet.

If you want a funny or deeper Dark Comedy I'd reccomend Election, to Die for, or Heathers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duped!","review":"This movie was a letdown. I was duped into thinking that it would be comedic and laughable. However, the movie was crass and full of foul language. The two main characters were misleading in the trailer.

I watched about 40 minutes of it, but almost turned it off after 20 minutes. There are 2 reasons I didn't watch it all: the first and main one is language - there was one character who cursed so often that it was unbearable to even listen anymore. The second reason is because the plot was very S L O W. Please notice that I didn't say boring. I would like to know what happened in the story; unfortunately I probably never will find out because I refuse to listen to more cursing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Hanks Worst movie and Not Funny","review":"We didn't even bother to finish watching this movie, it was that bad.

Please run far away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for Tom Hanks","review":"This movie was probably one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. There are too many curse words, but probably only 1/100 of how many there were in the big lebowski. Tom Hanks was good in the movie as usual but even his accent seemed forced and hard to understand at times. The movie is about a group of crooks who stay in a sweet old lady's house so that they can dig trough her basement wall to steal money from a bank. She thinks that they are musicians but she's smarter than they give her credit for.The movie was terrible, delivered probably 0 laughs, and I don't even know why Tom Hanks would have agreed to be in this movie. Oh, and also, why is Marlon Wayans in this? Sure he's funny in Scary Movie and stuff like that but in this, I mean, he wasn't good for the part. All he did was check out girls' buts and cuss. F this, F that. Well, enough said, buy Fargo and don't watch this one EVER!!!!

I'm normally a Tom Hanks fan but after seeing The Green Mile, then this movie, I have come to a decision that I need a break from his movies.The course language was uncalled for, it wrecked the film. Even my favorite movie characters Jay and Silent Bob don't talk like that..hehe.The only thing good about this movie was the soundtrack. All in all I wouldn't waste your time or money on this film. Yes Tom Hanks may be a great actor, but he certainly hasn't been choosing great scripts these days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I am not sure what has become of the usually masterful Coen Bros., but this film simply sucks. First of all, it is a completely unnecessary remake of an older and much more elegant film, and second, its over-the-top portrayals of typical stereotypes (from \\"Southern gentleman\\" to Buckwheat/angry black man to soulful-yet-clueless black mama figures) reeks of audience pandering.And will someone please explain to me why Tom Hanks is chosen to play such a wide variety of characters..? C'mon - he REALLY ain't that good...see this film as proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Hanks Owes Me $16.50","review":"Two friends and I went to see The Ladykillers while travelling through Florida. It was my turn to treat. We walked out after giving it a generous one-hour viewing. The only redeeming quality was that the popcorn was tasty. Why didn't his wife, Rita Wilson, who was responsible for getting My Big Fat Greek Wedding to the big screen, slap him across the face and say \\"Snap out of it.\\"? Woe are we who tried to see, The Ladykillers, and ended up disappointees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Brothers, Where Are You??","review":"A mildly enjoyable comedy/gangster movie, \\"The Ladykillers\\" tells the story of five frustrated criminals who pretend to be musicians in order to foul an old lady and use her house as the HQ for a big steal. Despite some funny moments at parts, this movie is too uneven, predictable and flawed to truly recommend. Ok, so Tom Hanks and Irma P. Hall are good on their roles, there are a couple of black humour scenes with neat dialogue and the directing is competent, yet the overall result is still forgettable and a bit disposable. Not really a bad flick, but not a particularly convincing one either. Good to watch once as it presents some entertainment value, even if the Coen brothers have done much better in the past.Decent, yet too average to impress and surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Hanks is great! That said, read on.","review":"I personally feel Tom Hanks is a really fantastic actor. With the exception of this particular movie, I've enjoyed every movie I've ever seen him in. I don't understand what went wrong with The Ladykillers, perhaps it was the director, the editor, the script . . . I don't know, but this movie was so awful I couldn't sit through it. I purchased a copy of it just knowing I'd absolutely love it because Tom Hanks was in it but I ended up pawning it off on some unsuspecting co-worker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost, but not quite.","review":"As a fan of the Coen brothers I was very disappointed by this film because it was almost good. The snappy and perfectly timed dialogue they usually have never quite materializes here. The wonderful characters you would expect to find here are mostly hollow and not quite original or sharp. Add to this the fact that the original is a classic and in no way needed to be remade and it's a swing and a miss.This movie seems less like a Coen brothers movie than it does a movie made by fans of theirs that were stealing from them in uninspired ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing...","review":"I'd have to say that this is the first Tom Hanks film I found to be disappointing. In fact, I didn't even watch half of it. Hanks, as usual, does a good job on the acting of his character (for what I saw), but what I couldn't get past was the massive amount of swearing in the film. I was totally unprepared for it when I sat down in front of the TV.For those who want a family comedy, this isn't it. I would have given it 1 star, but Hanks' acting brings it up...a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slight Coen","review":"A film re-make of a classic has a hard way to go, and this one does not make it. Surprisingly it is Hanks who is the weak link. His weak and unconvincing role in this film dooms it to second class status. See the original!This may well be the least of the Coen Brother's films."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the original -- it's simply better!","review":"The Coen brothers are brilliant filmmakers but they are inconsistent. Fargo and Blood Simple are certainly American classics but too many of their films are simply...loopy. This is a perfect example of remaking a film that was perfect its first time around. Before you see this, do yourself a favor and see the British version directed by Alexander Mackendrick. Then see Mackendrick's other films such as \\"The Man In The White Suit\\" (also with Alec Guiness) and \\"The Sweet Smell Of Success\\". You'll have spent your time -- and money -- more wisely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever of 2004","review":"I just watched the movie and wished that i hadn't. The movie was absolutley horrible. No plot the acting sucked and the use of the F word constatnly was a major turn off. Tom Hanks is a vary talented actor and i cannot beleive he choose to do this role although he played it excellently it still did not make one bit of a difference because the movie was a mess. Do yourself a favor save your money and go watch something worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceedingly Low Expectations","review":"This film did not even live up to my low expectations. I went to the film for an afternoon of entertainment. Within ten minutes,I was checking my watch and looking towards the exit door. The characters were caricatures and stereotypes that I found not funny,bordering on insulting,unsympathetic and inane.I'd give this zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"The two people who reviewed this movie so far must be either blind or stupid! This movie was great! There was a plot, and the acting was great! They must have a personal ax to grind or something. I plan to buy this DVD when it comes out September 13th. There was only one problem, which I overlooked. I was born and raised in Mississippi, and live here now. In the movie, Tom Hanks' character said he was from Hattiesburg, Mississippi where he worked at the University of Mississippi. U of M is in Oxford, MS. Hattiesburg is the home to the University of Southern Mississippi, two completely different universities."},{"rating":"2","title":"We must have waffles forthwith","review":"Who are these people that couldn't hear the 'curse words' or were 'bored to tears?'. If you're looking for a funny, quirky movie, this is a great one. I'm a huge Coen bros. fan, and I enjoyed this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAD REMAKE OF A FUNNY FILM","review":"Tom Hanks, a most appealing actor, is locked into a most boring role. His verbal acrobatics as a Southern Gentleman seemed endless, even though no longer than a few sentences at times, The other Ladykillers, his fellow criminal conspirators, although intended to be comic stereotypes, mostly fell on their faces in sad pursuit of a laugh, the lady of the Ladykillers failed ever to evoke the necessary sympathy, being so clearly never in danger and so (deliberately) drawn as a caricature of Aunt Jemima. All in all, it was a sadly unfunny waste of talent.For those who do not find street-language or the use of racial epithets and caricatures acceptable, it is well to repeat the warning: most of the comedy is built on these twin pillars.My suggestion: download or go out and rent, the original minor classic, the British Alec Guinness film."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment","review":"Very disappointing - escpecially for a Tom Hanks movie.Had trouble getting past the fact they every other word was #$%@$@$&%*&On top of the the plot was plotless, the story was storyless.They should have just dumped everyone into the garbage barges at the beginning of the movie and called it finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Film!","review":"There were plenty of mixed reviews on this film.A lot of people didn't like it- but I sure did!For a re-make, it's actually pretty good!An eccentric professor- and his groupof crazy con-artists pretend to usean old woman's basement for band practice,when really they're pulling off the mostbrilliant robbery of all time!They work together, to dig a tunnelfrom the old woman's basement...right into the vaultof a near-by casino, where they will steal all of the moneyand leave without a trace!The Coen Brothers did an excellent job writingthis movie- and I found Tom Hanks' performanceas the very eccentric Proffesor G.H.

My wife and I are normal hard working white collar people who love all sorts of movies. I don't think we've ever missed a new release together on DVD. My word speaks for those like us out there, please have trust in my comments. Fargo was great...O brother was a little less than great....Ladykillers is not so great. Mr. Wayans is funny at times but eventually you get sick of the abusive language. Tom Hanks tries to overwhelm us with his brillance and falls short in this one, sorry Tom big fan but no on LK. The characters were interesting if the movie was a short skit but two hours of the same babble from each character got tiring. The story lacked pace and excitment. Too slow and not enough action. We got the metaphor of the whole movie but by the end it didn't satisfy. I suggest you pass on this one even if you are a Tom Hanks or Coen fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I expected this movie to display the same sense of humor as \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\", but I was sorely disappointed. There are some funny moments, but Marlon Wayans' unnecessary profranity is so jarring, it disrupts the comedy before it can get started. The best scenes are the dialog-free establishing shots where you'll enjoy the excellent cinematography characteristic of the Coen brothers movies. Second best is Irma P Hall's performance. She's wonderful, especially in her solo scenes or those talking to the sheriff. You really wish the Coen's had thrown away the script, fired all of the \\"ladykillers\\" and just rewritten the movie around Irma and the Mississippi setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the \\"Ladykillers\\"","review":"Tom Hanks is one of my favourite actors especially after watching and appreciating some of his films like Gump,Road to Perdition and Cast Away.It's not often the man does a sub-par role.In the movie Ladykillers,he plays his role earnestly with elegance and reassurance. The movie however is disappointing.I felt all actors played their role adequately.It's just a little too mixed culture for me.The storyline is rather limited.It's like a dramatic comedy with a few laughs and lot of church. I didn't know what to expect.I heard someone say it's funny.I'm sorry cause this will go down as the one Tom Hanks film I don't recommend to anyone.Anyhow,watch this movie only if you're as stubborn as me and must see every movie by Mr.Hanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought Tom Hanks could never be in a bad movie","review":"...and I was wrong.

The story as portrayed was inplausible and the character played by Tom Hanks was an absolute waste of his talent. The only somewhat bright spot was Irma Hall, who was by far the most entertaining member of the cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"WACK","review":"In the words of my daughter \\"this movie is wack\\". It is not at all what I expected from Tom Hanks and it was quite boring. If I could rate according to my opinion, it would be a zero.

Little things will pop out at you when you least expect it. Irma P. Hall steals so many of the scenes you wonder how the rest of the cast kept straight faces during filming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"My goodness, what a strange movie! Oddball Professor Dorr (Hanks) and his \\"band\\" of thieves invade the home of a devoutly religious widow (played very well by Irma P. Hall) in order to pull off a far-fetched casino heist. The characters are colorful and diverse in their personalities, giving the movie a pretty offbeat feel. I have to admit I did not see the original 1955 version and was just expecting a good ol' fashioned fun slapstick comedy. There are slapstick elements to some of the scenes, but I would definitely classify this as more on the \\"dark comedy\\" side.Unfortunately, many of the so-called humorous moments with the gang of thieves fell flat for me, and the non-stop profanity from one of the characters got old fast. Aside from some amusing moments with the widow or her cat, I'm afraid I just didn't enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not that funny","review":"This just isn't in the same league as \\"O Brother\\" or \\"The Man Who Wasn't There.\\" Most of the acting was pretty good, particularly the performances by Irma Hall and Tom Hanks. However, there's not much anyone could have done with the \\"Lump\\" or \\"Garth Pancake\\" characters. The story just wasn't \\"heist\\" enough for a heist film, and sure as heck wasn't funny enough for a comedy. Uh, who decided that Irritable Bowel Syndrome was funny? Oh no, I might have spoiled the movie by mentioning \\"IBS\\" . . . but if that's a spoiler, then that alone tells you what type of movie you're in for.One last comment: bear in mind that I was one of the few people who actually LIKED Intolerable Cruelty, and still I wasn't impressed with this movie.My advice : wait for the DVD release or at least catch the matinee showing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cohen Bros: no longer a sign of taste in filmmaking","review":"I'm used to automatically seeing anything associated with the Cohen Brothers. The previews for The Ladykillers made it look like a charming, Southern US, caper film. Sure enough, there were plenty of grey-haired folks in the theatre. I can't imagine they expected the constant MF swearing from one of the chracters.This is a remake of the 1955 hit UK film of the same name starring Peter Sellers and Alec Guiness. The new version relies on repetitive gag humour and the clash between a conservative Christian woman and a foul-mouthed, \\"hippity-hop\\" criminal, to get most of its laughs. Some of the other supporting cast members are nothing but dumb cliches (big, dumb jock, quiet, sly Communist Chinese General, etc.) Tom Hanks plays the role of ring leader as if he were a cartoon character.There's really no intrigue or really good humour in this obvious Cohen Brothers sellout. Not a must-see film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's watching this?","review":"The audience for the 1955 Ealing Studios film of the same name must be just a few sentimental cinephiles like yours truly. A remake, therefore, has to do something to help the story march with the times, if it is to be a profitable product in a shabby age. This film, however - the second Coen Bros turkey in a row - exhibits some of the worst qualities of the cinematic art in our time: a self-referential irony that constantly rips the narrative fabric to shreds; overdrawn characters who are more like cartoons than like people; a smug and self-congratulatory visual slickness; and a relentless tendency to suppose that tiresome repetition of the \\"f\\" word represents something like humor, when it just doesn't fit into this tale at all. What happened to the Coens who made \\"Fargo\\"? What a sorry sell-out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Ladykiller is a Loser!","review":"I cannot fathom what Tom Hanks was doing in this picture other than to get it released into theatres instead of going straight to the video shelves. I was barely ten minutes into the movie when the trashy profanity started; inundated with uses of M-F'r, G-d-mn, N-gg-r, p---sy, and other assorted insults. I suppose I could get by all that if the movie was interesting or worthwhile in any respect. But this picture suffers from a terminal case of boredom, and aside from a few good opening moments, it's worthless. I wanted to see this Cohen Brothers movie after the tremendous success of \\"Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?\\" but this rendering of The Ladykillers isn't just a waste of time and money, it's just really, really badly done poor taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Turkey with Tom Hanks; Coen Bros. Strike Out w/ this Foul Ball","review":"My wife and I could NOT believe how AWFUL this film was. In fact, we stopped watching it with twenty minutes left to go. The next day, we watched the ending, just to see what would happen. None of the characters were likeable in any way. The character portrayed by Tom Hanks was too quirky to be believable. The other characters were rejects from \\"Dumb & Dumber.\\" The plot was a disaster, nearly everything spewed by the Marlon Wayans character was offensive, NOTHING IN THE ENTIRE FILM WAS FUNNY! Granted, there was some poetry recited by the Tom Hanks character and some fine music, but for me, it was not enough to merit two stars. Check out anything else by the Coen Brothers, and of course, any other film starring Tom Hanks, but do yourself a favor & leave this TURKEY on the shelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coen Brothers: Film # 11","review":"There was something deviously and devilishly fun about this film. The moment you see one person die and realize a whole line of people are about to die, your grin widens and you get more comfortable in your chair.I simply adored this film. I loved Hanks' southern gent professor character. I loved all the oddball hoodlums. I loved the church loving land lord. I loved the idea that Hanks and his goons were \\"played\\" in a band using instruments from the Renaissance. I loved how the sheriff thought the old woman was out of her mind. I loved chuckling. Yes, actually chuckling at this scene. (FYI:rarely do I laugh while viewing a film).I do not know why reviews were so bad, but I can understand that since this was the Coen Brother's first film that they directed but did not write, they may have lost some grip on the whole flow of the film. Perhaps I can understand this and I did see this in the film. Otherwise, what a great film this was."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real punch","review":"This remake is not even close to the original. It's long and not that funny. Even Hank's southern twang isnt that good.

WHY?What a falling off was there! Run, do not walk to the Alec Guinness version to see what was so foully trampled on here.Two stars ... because the professor and the lady are not always entirely awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladykillers... or are they?","review":"Hilarious! Perhaps those who hated this movie can be forgiven since they probably don't know anything about the Coen Brothers and their unique genius. Perhaps you don't appreciate the great and funny performances especially by Marlon Wayans and Tom Hanks. Perhaps you don't realize that a great actor like Tom Hanks may want to stretch and play different characters. Perhaps you know nothing about movies!But then again, I'm glad you hated it, because if everyone loved the Coen Brothers as I do, and if they were rich moguls whose every movie was a huge mega-hit, perhaps they wouldn't continue to turn out quirky gems such as this, and perhaps I'd be the miserable one, instead of all you jamokes complaining about a funny and rare film such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Disappointment.","review":"Well, my major problem with The Ladykillers is that it was made by the Coen brothers who are the finest filmmakers in the world this side of Marty Scorsese. This has to be the only movie they've made which I'd describe as being below average, and that's really all that it is. The Ladykillers is not a bad movie, but considering the quality of its creators, its mediocrity comes as quite a shock. I don't agree with the other reviewers in regards to Tom Hanks. I think he gives a credible performance. I think the production's real problem is a result of its low quality plot. The original film with Alec Guinness was not great and attempting to update it was not advisable. Personally, I hope that this movie is just a mulligan for the Coen brothers and not a reflection of their diminishing genius. Everyone is entitled to a mistake once in awhile and no better word embodies The Ladykillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cartoonish remake of the 1955 classic","review":"This cartoonish remake of the 1955 classic starring Alec Guinness has some hilarious moments, but the whole is less than the sum of the parts.All the characters are over-the-top caricatures, and the plot stretches one's credulity to the limit. And I have to agree with the others who note the excessive use of bad language by the Marlon Wayans character. I realize he's a caricature of the trash-talking black guy we've seem so many times before, but the movie would have been just as funny without his endless potty-mouth diatribes!I'd give this 3.5 stars if that were allowed; I went with 4 to bring the average up a bit.PS: The cat steals the show (among other things) in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the language?","review":"This was almost a good movie. Most of the actors did a good job, with the exception of Wayans. Unfortunately, it seems that all Wayans can do is swear. In a movie that had some excellent acting, fun quirky characters, Wayans makes the movie un-enjoyable to watch. Take the profanity out, and it could be worth watching again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best film.","review":"I do loved most of the films that the Coen Brother have made but this is just a huge mess from the get go. Tom Hanks does well but other than him, this is just not as good as it should have been. They should have just had a very good rewrite before they started to film because as the film is now, its a huge blunder."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like \\"The Audiencekillers\\"","review":"This movie has three types of scenes: boring scenes, horrible scenes, and scenes with Tom Hanks. Some scenes are a combination of two, others a combination of all three. Why in the world would the director put a 5-minute church sermon in the movie?

I might go as far to say that this is the worst movie I've seen in my entire life, but I stopped the movie 40 minutes into it and took it out of my dvd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've Ever Seen!","review":"I started watching this video, and had to turn if off after about 15 minutes!

This is a disgusting movie - a shame - because the original is so good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disillusioned...","review":"I went to see \\"Ladykillers\\" this weekend, hoping to have a good laugh with one of my favorite comedic actors, Tom Hanks, and to enjoy the silliness of Marlon Wayans. I was concerned after hearing the \\"N\\" word several times during the beginning of the movie from the African-American female star. Also, Marlon Wayans addressed everyone he met with \\"What's Up, (...).\\" There is a lot of unnecessary profanity in this movie, so it would not be suitable for youth. That aside, there are a FEW funny moments: the painting of \\"Otha,\\" the deceased husband of the female star, whose painted expression changes at different times in the movie, and \\"Pickles\\" the cat, a talented animal actor who ends up carrying off the severed finger of one of the criminals. Marlon Wayan's character is stereotypically the first to die in this romp... Take my advice and save a few dollars -- this is definitely a movie you can wait to see in video."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe Tom Hanks would even consider this!!","review":"Being an admirer of Tom Hanks' capabilities, I was totally caught off guard with this film. The profanity is unnecessary and almost embarrassing. It may be based on an old comedy, but by today's standards it seems ridiculous and just plain dumb.

I own The Baby Book and The Breastfeeding Book and cannot write enough good things about both publications.I purchased this book recently and was disappointed. I was hoping for a book that would help guide my husband and I in raising our son in a Christian manner. However, the majority of this book is dedicated to pregnancy and childbirth. Since my son is already 5 months old, I didn't really need this information. Very little of the book is dedicated to infancy, toddlerhood and the issues that come about during these stages.The book is well written, but much of the information regarding nutrition, health, discipline, as well as many other questions/concerns/issues is better covered in The Baby Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaging to Family Unit","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be a good health manual with a christian perspective but I was very disappointed.From a christian perspective, I found it shocking that it took several scriptures out of context in developing their permissive-parenting philosophies. Young babies are to be centre of the family (and marriage), rather than equal members. No helping babies to develope in the way they should go. I think this book could be damaging to the core unit called \\"family\\" if fully embraced.Try a more balanced parenting style (not the extremes of demand or schedule feeding) like that which is found in \\"Secrets of the baby Whisperer\\" or \\"Babywise 1\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant read","review":"The story of Terry had inspired me to keep running despite ongoing injuries.

While the book appears to be a simple, slim volume, this is a book one could read over and over again and come away with new gems of wisdom each time. The essays contain much more than mere philosophical insights, but rather knowledge gained from hard work and experience, which can be applied practically in real life.

But that's not why I rated it \\"poor.\\" It's because I figured out, almost from the beginning, who was behind it all and after that, I really didn't care. There were red herrings trying to divert suspicion, chapters that took you into the killer's mind, a massive government conspiracy, a romance for the protagonist, and I still didn't care.

When I read the author's review at the end where she noted that the book had gone through 7 (I think) revisions, I thought to myself, it needed another 7 more.

Mandy is a dull, unattractive, easily-influenced, self-pitying dishrag. She mopes, she wallows, she has sex with anyone with a pulse and then wonders why it doesn't work out. To keep her company, the author has conjured up a group of equally abnoxious characters, including an obese, hypochondriac mother to a \\"Praise Jay-sus\\" country preacher. They're all red-neck grotesques, and though fans of Ms. Brown will most likely claim that they're \\"taken from real life,\\" I suspect that they've been plucked from repeated viewings of Jerry Springer and \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape.\\" The last chapter is by far the best, but by then it's much too late to redeem this condescending, stagnant, and frequently scatalogical read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent entry in the Warhorse of Esdragon series","review":"While not quite as enjoyable as The Prince of Ill-Luck, The True Knight is a noticeable improvement over the previous installment in the series, The Wind-Witch.The True Knight possesses Dexter's usual sly humor and strong sense of characterization; Wren and Titch are well developed characters who remain themselves throughout the entire book-- no sudden and implausible character changes here!

It is overkill for this, but was the right price. I changed out the very thick line for some 6lb Trilene.

This made the difference and become a solid reel - preferring it over the cheap Zebco 202 by quite a bit. Certainly, there are nicer reels out there you'd want for bass fishing; but for a low end spincast, bober/sunny fishing - this one will work (consider changing the line out though)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BOB must have!","review":"Bought a couple of these for the bug out bags and tried them out for casting in the back yard before putting them away and am pleased for what they do for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lehane's Best Work Yet","review":"Having lived in Dorchester and being a huge fan of the earlier Lehane novels with Patrick K. & Angie G.

I don't want to talk about the story and give anything away, so I will simply say -- this is an excellent read!As much as Mr. Lehane's books would conceptually make good movies, I sincerely hope he refrains from selling any of his work for screenplays.

There was a sense of foreboding and maybe even sadness as the story unfolded. I like books that make you remember your own life. Even though I didn't grow up in this town, I grew up in a place like this town and I could relate to the sense of familiarity and intimacy that develops between members of a small, blue-collar community. I think, not the murder or the ugly tragedy that happens to one of the characters,( one that I'm so sick of seeing in every book--is this subject a prerequisite to be in print these days) but the feeling of community was probably what I liked the most about this book.

Despite the passing of 6 years, Mystic River still remains on the top of my list of favorite fiction. A heartbreaking tale, it's almost common place in real life sends a message to parents, children, and friends alike. In the blink of an eye a life can change and Lehane brings this point across time and time again in his portraying of the ties that bind. A true classic in the genre of modern day crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, unrealistic prose","review":"I could have liked the book if the prose wasn't so overdrawn. The characters are blue collar but the prose doesn't fit.For example, Jimmy is sitting alone on his front porch of his three decker the night his daughter was found murdered. The night was quiet. This is the way Lehane draws Jimmy's perception of the night: \\"The noise that normally ruled the daytime wasn't gone, it was merely sucked up, as if into a pair of lungs, and then held, waiting to be expelled. He trusted that hush, warmed to it, because it promised the return of the noise, even as it held it captive. Jimmy couldn't imagine living somewhere rural,...\\"Does this fit the character and the situation? It just gets in the way at best or undermines the reality of the character at worst.As a result, the characters weren't real to me. When that happens it's hard to get involved with the book. I ended up skimming most of it.If the movie removes this pretentiousness, it could be much better than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book drags","review":"Perhaps if I'd grown up in NYC I might find this work more interesting...as it is, I have to agree with the other reviewer who found the characters too two dimensional. Also, when a writer gets technical details wrong, it tends to put me off and the plot becomes as a cardboard facade - I begin to see \\"the man behind the curtain\\". For example, a female character decides she will destroy evidence by taking off the grease trap under the sink and cleaning it (wouldn't pouring bleach or something through the pipe do this?). She manages this with a LUG wrench. I'd like for someone to explain how one could use a lug wrench to remove the elbow from under the sink. Sheesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"I only got to 5% of reading and was so disgusted that I am trying to delete it from my Kindle. The language he chose for these 11 year old boys to use at the first of the book, was vulgar and just plain trash.

Unfortunately, this didn't happen. I started and stopped twice while reading the first chapter before making a commitment to myself to read the book through; by the end I was skimming so as to be done with it.

Just because an author can elaborate with thousands of words - it doesn't mean that he should, and this incredibly drawn out story made me wish for the exactness of gifted authors like Graham Greene. Clint Eastwood did the story justice though - and his portrayal of the characters was exactly what the audience needed to know..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a great mystery....","review":"I haven't seen the movie so I can't compare it with that, but the book is so good I really don't see how it could be as good. This story starts off a tad slow, once it gets going roughly 50 pages in.......it gets REAL good. The characters are very compelling and very real. The greatest thing about this book and what makes it such a great mystery is just that..............you won't know the ending until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"My oh My!","review":"I justed finished Mystic River by Dennis Lehane and all I can say is My oh My! The best thing about this book is that it is so well written. Lehane is a step above many other current mystery writers because is writes well and tells an incredible story at the same time. He, along with Crais, Connelly, and Coben really are a cut above because they write so darn well. Add Pelecanos to that same list as well.The bad about this book is the \\"heavy\\" content. I had forgotten how well Lehane tells it like it is. I haven't been so depressed after a book since I read Lehane's first A DRINK BEFORE THE WAR. There is no sugar coating here. Lehane's content is graphic, poignant, and at times upsetting. It isn't content that is hard to believe, I just hate to admit to myself that there really are some sick and disturbed people in this world. Perhaps the truth he tells, even when you know it is truth, is very hard to stomach.Not for the light hearted, but still a very wonderful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad dissappointment","review":"Prior to this book, Lehane was my favorite author, \\"Darkness, Take my hand\\" being my particular favorite. This book, however, felt incredibly forced and was, I'm sorry to say, totally predictable. I understand that the loss of someone you love is incredibly tough, but he milks that pain like you wouldn't believe. It was describes so much that the reader (or at least I), become numb to it. I'm sad to see such a great writer become so bogged down.As an interesting note, I've heard that Lehane's publisher likes this new kind of \\"stand-alone\\" novel and asked him what it would take to write more like it. So it appears we may not see Patrick Kenzie (his character from previous books) for a while (or, god forbid, ever). Here's hoping his next effort is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"In January I saw Dennis Lehane speak at a trade show. He was such a wonderful speaker that I was compelled to stand in line to get my signed copy of Mystic River. What a disappointment it turned out to be. The first half of the book was engrossing and somewhat suspenseful, but once I got to page 264 I figured out the whole entire ending. After that everything was predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 1st story","review":"I have only gotten threw the first story and will not continue to read this. the plot line is negative and of a black nature.

Fortunately I ran across some of his other work later. I recently tried again and same reaction. Rambling, repetitive, etc. Like listening to a drunk telling a long story meandering story. Try Shutter Island or some other of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary in Depth, Dissatisfying in Content","review":"Few novels of recent authorship have really been intended to linger in the reader's mind beyond the closing words -- which was why this story of such amazing emotional depth and maturity was as pleasantly surprising as it was to me. When nearing the finish, I honestly believed I was reading something deep and interesting, dramatic when the plot required it.Sixty or so pages from the end, however, it collapses on itself with all the weight of its own empathetic spirit. The story lapses into typing up the murder's mystery -- doing so in a rather shoddy manner that makes me wonder if Mr. LeHane didn't come upon his deadline in the midst of writer's block and hire an amateur noir novelist to finish it for him.In the end, the unneccesary details of the end feel poorly crafted and lazily drawn, the broad and introspective scope of the previous chapters moot. It's still worthy of a read, but don't expect an ending as dazzling as its brilliant lead-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Powerhouse? More like the Outhouse!","review":"This novel APPEARS to be a suspenseful powerhouse, however, the author fails (miserably) to tie up all the loose ends into a nice neat package. The so called element of surprise is a complete let down. Don't get me wrong, the book is fascinating up until approximately three-quarters through. It is here that the author begins to spin a web of characters and events so convoluted the readers head begins to swim. The climax is weak, juvenile, and truly disappointing. Ultimately a futile attempt at suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex Characters!","review":"This is my first Dennis Lehane book and I'm hooked! His characters were so complex (flawed, yet sympathetic) and the story line moves along at a rapid pace. Just the right combination of characterization and plot. I found myself cheering for the ex-con/murderer and feeling sorry for the child molester--now that's writing. I have recommended this to my book club and anyone who'll listed and I'm getting ready to purchase several others. Excellent read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lehane- Master of stunning character!!","review":"Mystic River is a dark novel that revolves around the lives of three young boys who are unlikely friends. Their lives begin to grow apart following the abduction of one of the boys.As adults, their lives have all taken very different paths, but their paths recross after a tragic murder draws them together in a spiraling whirlwind of heartbreaking sorrow.Dennis Lehane is a master of great characters, each one so clearly defined and so real. The writing draws you into the very disparate lives of these unique, dark men, into their homes, their thoughts, their fears and their loves. The book holds your attention, even when you want to put it down! The ending is stunning, not because it is not something you anticipated, but because of the deft way that Lehane crafts it and finely tunes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seller","review":"Book is in excellent condition and they shipped it lightening fast.

Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I really enjoyed this book and I am now reading another Dennis Lehane book because I enjoyed this one.I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"This book was just OK. To me, the plot was predictable, with none of the \\"twists & turns\\" that Lehane is supposedly so famous for. I wonder if this book would have received as much attention if it hadn't been made into a film ( which I have not seen). I stuck it out to the end, because it had received such laudatory reviews, but I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not on a par with the Kenzie/Gennaro books","review":"I am a big fan of Dennis Lehane's series featuring Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, and I purchased \\"Mystic River\\" the day it hit the stands. I was very disappointed with it, and so was a friend of mine (also a fan) who read it. The plot is slow, the characters are seedy, the ending is depressing . . . At the end, I was wondering \\"why did he write this book?\\"Save your time and read Mr. Lehane's \\"Prayers for Rain\\" instead; it's ten times better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment.","review":"I eagerly waited for my chance to take this book out of the library. I loved Mr. Lehane's previous books. I didn't like this book. I enjoyed the first 50 or so pages, and thought the book was going somewhere I wanted to go. I thought the idea of exploring the way in which a tragedy in childhood can effect the lives of the children involved over the course of their lives was intriguing. However, somewhere along the line the story lost interest for me, the writing began to become repetitive and the 3 main characters were never fleshed out into real people. The book became weaker more contrived as it plodded to the conclusion. The ending seemed as if it had been planned ahead and the middle of the story written to fit it. Or, perhaps Mr. Lehane couldn't figure out where he wanted the story to go, and threw in a twist for effect, without considering the continuation of the story line. I had a hard time finishing the book and started to skim pages. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, over-use of profanity, tedious and too long","review":"You could tell the author is probably a fairly good writer, but his extreme over-use of profanity (every other word is the \\"F\\" word!) is annoying and detracts from the story so much that after a while, I could hardly read it. EVERYBODY in his story talks like that - very unrealistic! And the whole story is so gruesome and depressing and goes on and on and on, that it became a real chore to read. I'll have to say NOT RECOMMENDED for this book. For sure I'd be too embarrassed to recommend this to anyone I know - it comes across as sleazy trash because of all the gutter language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy, boring surprise","review":"I was excited to see a new Lahane. Though never did one need to be Einstein to read his books, I always really enjoyed reading the last few books. This was just boring, way to long and I really just wanted it to end. If I were an author I would want to write different things too but this did not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Needs This Garbage?","review":"Does the world really need more books about pyschos and serial killers? First of all, it's become a boring cliche, and Mystic River is almost interchangeable beyond some details with too many other dreary and disgusting (non)mysteries. Second, does the world really need this theme perpetuated? Lehane may have made a financial killing here, but in spreading the \\"romance\\" of pyschokillers he's done us all a disservice. Maybe this is corny, idealistic raving, but you've got to start somewhere in trying to make the world a better place. And anyway, in the end, this book is dull. I've got to believe its success is pure hype and not based on its (lack of) literary merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fizzle","review":"Started out okay, but a puerile ending.And deceitful. Lehane strings us along, letting us think Dave bludgeoned Katie -- strings us along as, granted, all whodunits do. Trouble is, Lehane gets deep into Dave's head and allows the reader to know his most secret thoughts -- in which case we'd have known from the beginning the truth about what Dave did.Also far too much digression and explanation. Lehane should've borrowed Basil Exposition from the Austin Powers movies.But the ending (aka who killed Katie): just unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystic River Review","review":"Mystic River, by Dennis Lehane, is a tragic story about three boys and their later life experiences afer one of the boys was abducted. The book ended in tragic irony. It was very well understandable. Many points of view enhanced the story, allowing the reader to know things that caracters didn't, while still having the overlying air of mystery. It's a darker-mooded book, but the storyline will keep the reader wanting to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystic River is an intense read","review":"Having just finnished Mystic River by Dennis Lehane, I would like to share my likes and dislikes. I found the plot to be excellent especially for those who enjoy murder mysteries. Truthfully, I found the book to be too graphic, and some of the characters were not entirely realistic in my opinion. Also, one of the subjects discussed in this book is child molestation, and since it is essential to the plot, it isn't something someone could just skip. This bool is somewhat depressing which makes ithard to pick up and read, although towards the end the plot is so suspenseful that it is hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Lehane book. 4 1/2 stars.","review":"I had heard about Dennis Lehane before,but it wasn't until now that i decided to check out one of his books. It was worth it. It's kind of who did it sort of mystery novel but the characters are what makes this book special, they are all very realistic 3 dimensional people and that elevates this book beyond just a mystery novel. It's a study of the human mind, while still being an engaging mystery book. The last pages tug on my emotions like no other book has. There is a great scene towards the end with Jimmy Marcus and Sean that is sad and definetly unforgettable. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!","review":"To say Lehane's lyric is magical understates this brilliant piece. Beginning with the first page, the reader can not help but succubm to the reality and depth of each and every character. This book is sure to captivate not only your mind but also your heart. Breath taking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling murder mystery with a brain.","review":"Already being a fan of Lehane's Kenzie/Gennaro series I was a little leery about this book. After about three pages I forgot about Patrick and Angie and became completely engrossed in this story and it's characters. Lehane is an artist at creating mood and atmosphere. Every character is fully rendered. You almost feel like you know them or people like them.My only complaint about Lehane is that he doesn't write fast enough. I have PRAYERS FOR RAIN sitting on a shelf untouched. I'm afraid to read it because it's the only book of his left that I haven't read. If you're a mystery fan do yourself a favor and discover Dennis Lehane. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystic River- another Dennis Lehane winner","review":"Another excellent book by Dennis Lehane.I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates wonderful writing. Mr.Lehane's people truly come to life, as does the city.Beautifully plotted and while the end may surprise you, he doesn't cheat. All the clues were there for us to see. I hope we see more of Sean and Jimmy. I also want another Patrick and Angie. ASAp Mr. Lehane. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What goes around, comes around","review":"This is my first LeHane novel, and I don't think it will be my last. His writing is tight, clean and his characterization is sparkling. You really get to know these people in depth without chapters devoted to each personality. You know exactly what you need to know to flow with the story and the plot. There is no waste of verbage here. It is a story on a story on a story and a good ending. The neighborhood reflects elements that we all come from and can relate to. The people are somewhat more violent than most neighborhoods, but the politics of the hood are general to all. I kept thinking throughout the story, plots and plans we are part of early in life ALWAYS COME BACK TO GET US sometime later in life. These sad and violent occurences do just that to this small community and group of people intertwined with a story early in life, played out during their lives, and subsequently forming, destroying or solving their lifes's complexities. Fabulous read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"I'm not much of a mystery fan; I was drawn in by the promise that Lehane wrote prose that was as much literature as genre fiction, drawing comparisons not merely to Elmore Leonard and Springsteen but even Hemingway. Those raves must have come from the easily impressed. What I found was overwritten (so much for Hemingway and Springsteen), hard-boiled bluster from the life-stinks-and-then-you-die school. The problem isn't that the worldview is dark and depressing; it's that Lehane hits you over the head with this revelation over and over again, and the attitude is coming not so much from the blue-collar characters as an author who, despite his pose of understanding, is looking down on his creations. A good editor could have shaved this by at least 100 pages, and an author less impressed with the sound of his own voice might have plotted a mystery that contained a surprise or two. If you're looking for a literary mystery, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, come on","review":"lehane has intelligent things to say about the other side of gentrification. (thus the 2 stars). so why not write a real novel about it? wrapped up in this pedantic police procedural, where the reader knows everything before the cops do, so we're forced to slug through them figuring it out, his ideas lose all their force.By the way, does every victim need to have their face punched in so badly you 'can't even tell what race they were'?this is genre airport reading that shows promise, but has not achieved anything close to the ecsatic reviews above.But, police mysteries can be brilliant, with real socical inight and value.Want to see how its done? Read 'Clockers', by richard price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting!!","review":"A sad and excellent story, kept me guessing and had a good twist in the end. I was truly amazed!

A lot more information about the challenges that the three main characters faced while growing up in the Mystic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystic River -- it is not my kind of book.","review":"I read only the first 75 pages of Mystic River. There was too much profanity for me to enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, saw the movie, but book was better","review":"As is often the case, the book was better than the movie and the movie was EXCELLENT. Gread read, great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I am not done reading Mystic River yet but so far I like the story. It is now getting exc iting as you read further into the story. Would defintely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even If You've Seen The Movie....","review":"Even if you've seen the movie, you should still consider reading this book. I thought I was making a mistake by seeing the movie first thinking \\"I already know what's going to happen\\". While that may have been the case, the book still captured my complete and undivided attention. As with most books that have been made in to movies, this one is exponentially better than the movie itself. Definitely a page-turner and one you won't soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Mystery","review":"This is one of those rare mysteries where the author lays all of the clues in front of you and virtually wills you to solve the crime. Rather than hide the killer until the last moment, we are fed clue after clue and if you're good enough (I wasn't) you should be able to work out who done it.As well as being an excellent mystery which had me guessing until all was revealed, it was also a sometimes poignant commentary on how we might deal with loss - both through death and separation.I urge anyone who loves a good mystery to try to solve it before the author makes the revelation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Let This One Pass","review":"I couldn't believe myself crying over this book. The story is dark, sad and overwhelming. Hats off to Dennis Lehane for his clever way of making each of the main character a character that you'll end up either symphatising or liking it instead of hating it even though each of them has a deep dark secret lurking in the root. I could actually feel for the characters - Jimmy, Sean and Dave and I love how the book didn't make me feel that I was actually reading a detective story of a murder mystery. Instead, I was too engrossed with the turmoils, the love, the likes, the hatred, the feelings, the sad, the happiness, the memories, the laughter, the crying, the cruelty, and the kindness that make the characters look real, logic and alive instead of just characters from a novel. It's a gripping narrative and story, a thoughtful piece of writing. I couldn't put the book down and I recommend you to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So gripping I could not wait to get home each day to read it","review":"I have not read a book this powerful in a very long time. It grabbed on to me and would not let go. Just when I thought I had something figured out, the next chapter brought on something more. I went straight to the theater to see the movie after finishing the book. First off, I could not understand why Jimmy's last name was changed from Marcus to Marcum. Then felt that the movie left out so many key elements from the book. With only five minutes of the men as boys, it did not give you a chance to see their personalities. I give the movie a C, but the book an A+++++++. I now plan on reading future Dennis Lehane books. Thank you Dennis for a fine piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read and be deeply moved (or at least depressed)","review":"The mystery is peripheral to the incredible human tragedy that permeates every page with dark tragedy. I was able to figure out whodunit about halfway through the book but it didn't lessen my enjoyment of the novel in the least. There were plenty of horrifying scenes left for me to discover. There is a darkness here that has rarely before been so beautifully articulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!","review":"OMG! This book is incredible. I'm only 14 years old and it touched me so deeply, and it takes a lot to touch a teenager. I was a little bummed out about it being a little long, but you forget how long it is after the first couple of pages. It never stops grabbing you by the throat and giving you more suprises. Pick up this incredible book and be prepared to be amazed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a drag","review":"If you are looking for an exciting, relaxing mystery novel, you should skip this one. Lehane shows the grief and suffering caused by murder, but there is little payoff. For much of the novel, you are manipulated into thinking a particular character has committed the murder, but the narrator is rather overtly playing games with you, setting you up, in a way that feels intrusive. At the same time, you spend more of your time feeling depressed along with the victim's family members than you do following the process of discovering whodunit. The characters are carefully drawn, but the only insight this book tries to offer is that sometimes a person commits murder because they've been made to suffer themselves. After putting up with Lehane's lugubrious style and long passages that urge you to feel depressed, this is not enough to justify the pain. Not a very fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, disturbing, depressing, but........","review":"This was the first of Lehane's books that I picked up and I must admit that it was gripping and suspenseful. However, I was not ready for the brutal reality that hit me. This book is dark, disturbing, depressing and even made me mad at some points. But Lehane is truly a master. He pulls you in and won't let you go. His character development is some of the best I've ever read. I was still thinking about this book several days after finishing it. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I just didn't buy the ending. I've read Shutter Island since, a truly spectacular ending, and two of the Kenzie/Gennaro novels, and their endings are much better. If you haven't read Lehane yet, be warned. It will cause you to wince and squirm in your seat. I would compare his reads to that of Larry McMurtry, whose Lonesome Dove series spares no expense at capturing the brutal reality of the western frontier in the 1800's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely stunning!","review":"It is often that I read one book - possibly two in one day - so usually characters are simply \\"there\\" - they rarely seem totally real - the characters Lehane put together for \\"Mystic River,\\" however, seemed to jump into my life. Thankfully, I could not relate to the characters (as they all have horrible faults), but the way Lehane skillfully crafted together every single character in his book simply mesmerized me. I simply could not put this down -- it all seemed so real. It is nothing like any other novel I have read ... when I finished I was asking myself \\"Was that fiction?\\" More than ever before, this book honestly put me in the town it took place, see every character, and even smell the river itself. If you simply want a \\"thriller,\\" go to Patterson, Connelly, or Deaver -- if you are looking for something more in a novel that takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride that seems to last for a month in less than 400 pages ... go to Lehane, in particular \\"Mystic River.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Coarse, tough-guy fantasies","review":"I thought this one was probably worse and even more gimmicky than Shutter Island. I had a hard time keeping the characters straight and, worse, it didn't really seem to matter anyway. And what was with all that coarseness? Does this guy think he's David Mamet? Sam Shepard? What?I think that coarseness was really what did the novel in for me. No one really seemed to care about anybody else. Not that I need (or even want) a whole lot of love and emotion dripping from any novel, but there was no connection between these characters at all that served to pique my interest. It was almost an insult to working class neighborhoods in the East. The portrayal seemed to be more of Lehane's rough-and-tough-guy fantasies than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"This book is such a downer. I hated it. Could have been written in 400 less pages and been just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"His first 5 books were great, this one was not.","review":"I must have gotten used to the main characters in his first five books. I was really disappointed in this one. Please Dennis, go back to the first characters for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"grim - depressing - bleak","review":"I was a fan of Dennis Lehane and looked forward to Mystic River. Then I started the book and I realized he'd abandoned the Kenzie and Gennaro characters. I hated it; I didn't finish it; the unrelieved hopelessness and angst of these lives gave me a headache. Was this a movie-to-book commission? Hope the Hollywood money was worth it. I probably won't bother with another Lehane book. But, hey, Dennis - now the celebrities are gushing Mystic River is the very best book they've ever read in their whole lives - so who needs the readers who've been buying your books for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can put it down and did","review":"I made it through page 50 or so. It's excrutiating; almost every paragraph makes me cringe: Oh what melodrama, Oh sigh, foreshadowing alert, foreshadowing alert. I already know all the sterotypes: the abused child, the angry child. Lehane has nothing to add to those sterotypes - not a single engaging insight.I liked Lehane's first four books. Maybe when he returns to the characters he knows best, I'll read him again. Until then, I have categorized him as an author who has lost his edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tossed it in the garbage after 80 pages","review":"I purchased this book based on rave reviews, and the fact that it was a New York Times bestseller. It started off with a reasonably compelling premise, then slowly lost my interest. After 80 pages I realized I was totally disengaged. The writing is pretty vulgar, and the story wrapped around the goings on of a blue collar neighborhood that I found equally depressing and unstimulating. I soon realized I was investing valuable time into a story whose outcome couldn't have interested me less(inherant to a \\"mystery\\" novel is that one should care how it ends)On the other hand, if I was in solitary confinement and Mystic River was the only book available to me, I'm sure I would have finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"See story summary above.This was my first experience with a Dennis Lehane novel. A story of how the past can influence the future. I thought it was very good. A psychological thriller with great depth to the characters. Written in such a manner that you can actually feel how most of the characters feel. At times deeply emotional and compassionate, at other times, suspenseful and thrilling. As the editor says, 'It's not just a whodunit, it's a why they 'dunit'. After reading this novel, I intend on putting Mr. Lehane on my reading list.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystic River","review":"A cannot-put-down, extremely well written book. Dennis Lehane just gets better and better. Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Rolling","review":"Lehane captures Boston - again. It's especially gratifying when a writer shows warts and all - not a silly travelogue of \\"a city I visited after college.\\" Boston is splitting at the seams and Lehanes mystery follows the split. Buy this book and lose a weekend. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First Dennis Lehane book read- very disappointing.","review":"I have heard so much about Dennis Lehane that I felt obligated to read this new book. I'm kind of sorry that I did. Very convoluted, improbable plot; it tried the imagination. Perhaps the biggest fault of this book, however, lies in the main characters. Not one of them stood up as an admirable human being, and it was almost impossible for me (the reader) to develop any sort of rapport with any of them. For that matter, neither did the secondary cast of characters. They were all seriously flawed, and this set the tone for this novel. The reason that I gave this book two stars was because Lehane is obviously a very talented writer. From the way he handles words you can tell that given a different plot and a different cast of characters he could be one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"The mystery is peripheral to the incredible human tragedy that permeates every page with dark tradgedy. I was able to figure out whodunit about halfway through the book but it didn't lessen my enjoyment of the novel in the least. There were plenty of horrifying scenes left for me to discover. There is a darkness here that has rarely before been so beautifully articulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad and Soulful","review":"Bursting typical genre straightjackets of 'mystery' or 'police procedural,' the brooding, melancholy Mystic River includes elements of both, but puts them in the service of a gripping, fatalistic story.Deeply involving from its first paragraphs, this unusually potent crime novel manages to consistently lay bare the wounded hearts of its hardcase protagonists without ever dipping into sentiment or genre fakery. Not since the early days of James Ellroy has pop crime fiction been so fixated on character, but where Ellroy created lurid masterpieces of near-psychotic aberration, Lehane's people are unforgettable in their ordinariness. For crime novel characters, they're shockingly real.Mystic River isn't for the faint of heart, not because of its violence but because of its genuine despair and anguish. Pulsating with a visceral sense of loss, yet thrilling and compulsively entertaining throughout, this is hands-down one of the best thrillers of recent years."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Lehane novel","review":"This was my first Dennis Lehane novel, and when I was finished I immediately went out and bought his first few (A Drink Before War, etc.). I was addicted almost immediately and thoroughly enjoyed myself until the end. I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DENNIS LEHANE JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER","review":"I really loved this book. At first I wasn't sure I would. I thought I would miss Kenzie/Gennaro too much to enjoy this one. But Lehane proved me wrong. From page one it grips you and makes your heart ache. The suspense is so overwhelming, I couldn't stop reading to find out the \\"whodunnit\\". I don't want to give anything away... but note this: If it has Dennis Lehane's name to it- you're in for a powerful ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story & characters","review":"Great Boston based mystery with some interesting characters.

What a ride!","review":"That is exactly what I said after I finished reading the last sentence of this book.Mysteries are usually not my favorites, and I almost dropped this book after reading the first few pages(I'm glad I didn't). It's a slow starter, but it speeds up fast ( I usually read a book a week. I read this book over a weekend). Great story, great character development, great writing--I cared what was going to happen to everybody! The usual description of the book (one boy gets into a stranger's car, and two others do not) does not convey the crisis adequately. It's more that, our lives can change dramatically based on the everyday choices we make. This was my first Dennis Lehane novel, who appears to be at the peak of his craft. I really hope he wins some major awards for this book--it's that good. The characters in this book--Sean, Jimmy, and Dave, their families, and the choices they make are unforgettable. Grab this book as fast as you can and prepare to enjoy the ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystic River","review":"I liked the story line. It held your interest .

He really gets into the minds and emotions of the characters so you feel as if you have grown up next door to them. But he shows how the random events of that childhood can lead to unexpected actions as an adult.

I felt as tho I knew each character and could relate to each of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad but honest book","review":"\\"Mystic River\\" is a very good, solid piece of work. It is a murder mystery which seems to plod on and on until the final act throws all your opinions about who the killer is out the window, and does so with a grimy noir that shows the faults of all the characters in an unforgiving light. A great thing about this book is Lehane's ability to show the stark reality of his characters; there's no sugar-coating here, nor is there a happy ending where justice is served. This is a very powerful book, one to stay in your mind long after you're finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a page turner!","review":"Couldn't put this book down. Although you have a pretty good guess who killed Katie Marcus half way through the book, Lehane keeps the story twisting and turning and you are never really sure who the killer is until the end. Lehane is great at building his characters, especially Jimmy (father of Katie) and Sean (police investigator)who were childhood friends, and describing how lifes threads intertwine. This is the second book I've read of Lehane (Shutter Island was the other). He's become my new favorite author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genre of its own","review":"This book truly functions on each and every level. This book uses mystery, drama, character developement, fantastic prose, and magnificent use of figurative language to convey a well developed story. The fact that all of the characters have their own vices and virtues really makes it stand apart from the traditional mystery, in that their respective qualities affect their decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inutterably tedious","review":"Lehane is no Raymond Chandler. This book is short on dialogue and short on action. 90 per cent of the inexcusably long 400 pages consists of self indulgent and tedious narrative. Every stray thought from every character who wanders into the book is unloaded onto the hapless reader. It is full of teenage angst and false passion. Having purchased the audio book version, I had to further endure the over excited narrator's lapses when his 3rd generation Irish characters mysteriously developed Belfast Irish accents (BBC version)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great thriller","review":"Wow! An intense read. At time the subject matter can be difficult to handle, but the story is amazing. The movie does not do the novel justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE ENDING RUINED A GOOD BOOK","review":"I really enjoyed most of this book. It had a great story, interesting characters and was so easy to read. The last couple of chapters were so bad that it ruined this book. It's as if two different authors wrote this book! I was shocked and horrified at the worst ending I have ever read! Why did the author end this book in such a horrible way? It just doesn't make any sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible and irredeemable","review":"Too many loopholes and too many unanswered questions in a story that should have been tight. The three main characters bumble around, creating their own tragedies. The wives are pathetic, as are the police investigators. The story doesn't seem realistic, even if it is trying to portray the gritty underside of life. This is what's supposed to happen to people touched by child abuse? This is a new kind of vigilanteism? This is Boston in the year 2000?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soppy River","review":"Lehane's latest effort is a great disappointment. It is self-important, bloated and a waste of time. It lacks the wit and tang of his detective series and instead moves with a snail's pace through a neighborhood no one but a resident would find interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Dismal Depressing","review":"When this book first came out, I passed it by because of the subject matter. But then I read Lehane's Shutter Island and liked it very much. I took a look at all the glowing reviews and heard that Clint Eastwood was going to make a movie of Mystic River and decided to give it a try. Big Mistake. I just don't understand why dark, dismal, depressing stories pass for artistic writing these days. When one of the characters (Dave Boyle) recounts his take on how baseball fans react when their team looses, it was so far over the top I had to wonder at the author's sanity. I struggled through to the end hoping for an uplifting resolution, but I didn't find it. I realize I am in the minority here. I can not think of a single reason to recommend this book. I was not enlightened and I was not entertained. I feel like I wasted my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"This novel was in a word, gripping. I am new to the genre, having never read any thrillers before, and bought the book soley because the movie had such rave reviews (although I have yet to see the film).

When I found out that the series was coming out onDVD I felt the same thrill that I felt each saturday morning 40years ago. As an adult Fireball XL5 seems kind of silly and theproduction is far below Gerry Anderson's later kid's programsbut it's still the best series he did. This DVD boxed set features all 39 episodes in digitally remastered quality. Ifyou remember this show from when you were a kid buy this set. With the world in the state it's in today this program will bringback your childhood innocence for a few hours and make you feelyoung and happy again. To this day I have a model of Fireball XL5sitting on my TV. Thanks to A & E for finally releasing this great show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fireball XL5 - The Complete Series","review":"Another great blast from the past. Product in excellent condition. Service was great. I don't have to try and sell this one - anybody who remembers it would be most happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It wasn't a dream after all","review":"I saw Thunderbirds at a video store once and thought, \\"I thought the name of the show was Fireball XL5,\\" but I wasn't really sure. I watched this show when I was about 3 or 4 and I can only remember one scene, and I even thought it was in color. When I ran into it on Amazon I ordered it immediately. I'm getting some flashbacks as I watch the episodes, it used to be kind of scary. My kids were skeptical at first but they like it. I'm surprised at the very sharp image quality. Just because it is old and BW doesn't mean it is all fuzzy and poorly lit. The alien landscapes are awesome. It's a welcome analog respite from all the current digital effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"Horrible dvd. Picture quality is aweful, equivalent to watching a VHS that has been watched a couple of hundred times. Opposite of relaxation, I wanted slow motion but this whole thing is too fast. Also, I have never seen the northern lights look so bad, never. Don't buy this dvd. This was a one man operation, by an individual that googled a bunch of clips and pieced it together on his PC. They say there is a sucker born every minute and this time I was that sucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing clich��","review":"I teach film & video production & in preparation for a course I will soon teach, \\"Observations in High Speed & Time Lapse,\\" I purchased this DVD, hoping it wd be something I cd share with my students as an example. I am very disappointed. Even with vacuous music turned off, the edited structure of this video & the majority of the image choices are hackneyed & vapid. Definitely not a worthwhile purchase for the contemplative viewer. I won't show this to my students or ever spend time looking at it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best lotions I've ever used","review":"I've been taking steps to be healthier and kiss my face was one of the brands I wanted to try for lotion. The ingredients are high quality in my opinion and are well balanced. This lotion really hydrates my skin without feeling greasy. I have very fair skin and some freckles so my skin tends to be dry. I use this mostly on my face and neck and this lotion does need to be rubbed in a bit more than you would be use to with other lotions. The aroma smells so true and fresh to a peach, it's amazing. This really smells like I've just cut a peach open, very refreshing. I use this at night to clear dead skin cells so my skin can heal better while I sleep. It will sting slightly, but that let's you know that it is working to eat the guck off the surface of your skin, as well as work to start clearing pores. I absolutely love this lotion, and I will definitely be buying more when I run out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even come close to old formula","review":"You might as well be taking nothing. The original formula was the ONLY allergy medicine that has ever worked for me this new formula doesw nothing to relieve my symptoms.I have tried many meds over the past 25 years without success..then I found Original Actifed WOW amazing how well it relieves your allergies..then they moved it behind the counter...then only online....and Now I cant find it anyplace and the allergy symptoms are getting to the point where I am heading toward an asthma problem... with the old actifed my asthma never acted up for years!!!!! BRING BACK OUR RELIEF!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suzy","review":"I used Actifed for over 30 years -- it was a great product -- until the government said in 2006 that it had to go behind the counter & Pfizer foolishly changed the formula instead. The new formula doesn't work. Any company that produces the old formula, triprolidine & hydrochloride, can take Pfizer's business away. To put the name Actifed on Pfizer's now useless product is really a misrepresentation to the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, don't waste your money!!!","review":"This is not the original actifed and the new formula is useless. It would be worth the high price if it was the original formula, but the company has no guts and changed the formula.

I first had it prescribed for allergy symptoms in 1979, and although it is not \\"non-drowsy,\\" it's very effective. My favorite use is to avoid post-nasal drip at night, because it does such a good job of drying you up.After searching for the original formula and realizing I wasn't going to find it...not even \\"behind the counter,\\" I finally broke down and ordered 96 tablets from a Canadian Pharmacy. It cost more ($30plusshipping), but I got what I wanted.This is no way to run a health care system!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I've taken the \\"old\\" formula of Actifed (Pseudoephedrine Hydrochloride) for almost three decades - with great results.

USA pharmacy chain Walgreens' house-brand version of Actifed, Wal-Act, also continues to use the original pseudoephedrine/triprolidine formula,,,,,THE ORIGINAL FORMULA ACTIFED(the one that actually works) contains 60 mg pseudoephedrine hydrochloride as the nasal decongestant and 2.5 mg triprolidine hydrochloride as the antihistamine.Plus I think you can still buy the original formula from other countries."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dissappointed","review":"We can't get Actifed here in Canada anymore either even though pseudoephedrine products are still on open drugstore shelves. What a shame. I believe I have used this product for 50 years: is that possible? I used to rely on it for hayfever but now as a decongestant -- it seems to be the only allergy/cold medicine available without acetaminophen or tylenol. I can't tolerate acetaminophen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try this one guys","review":"I think it's Walgreens version of the old formula...definitely makes you drowsy.

Jacques descends into a lonely isolation as he disconnects with his son, two ex-wives and finally himself.Be warned, there's brief but very explicit sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"Pointless boring and uninteresting. Probably just about sums up this film. Pot bellied middle aged man who used to make porn movies wanders around babbling, chain smoking and in general trying to make himself look intelectual.Yes you may argue that it examines his relationship with his family, other artists in the business but the thing is, does anyone care? The characters are so dull and boring there is just no reason why anyone would want to know more about them. There is nothing 'erotic' about this film and nothing of any real interest.Watch this and you will be kicking yourself you wasted a part of your life even watching such rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"drop-dead boring, dead-beat screenplay, bad directing,","review":"poor editing, absent-minded acting, lousy casting....you just name all the bad things that could come up and put down here. only a few french movies could ever and never so bad. every role in this movie seemed like under nourishment, no energy, looked so tired and bored him or her self during the shooting.porno? nothing interesting and boring here either. i rejected the dvd after 30 minutes. i could neither get my money or my 30 minutes life back."},{"rating":"1","title":"stiff","review":"excuse the pun, but i agree with some of the other reviews that said the characters are rigid and uninteresting. Fasinating subject and I was intrigued with the setup: Over the hill Porno directer gets back in the buis. even though morally he has quams. I'll make this short, first twenty minutes pretty cool. Including a hard core sex scene that i found quite hot. But after that it goes to this french; anarchy, Political, extistential, (feel free to put another word here that i can't spell), deal. Maybe they should have put that scene at the end so that we had to pay for our dinner. If you buy it get for cheap. Best feature; scence selection goes right to sex scence making future viewings easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pornographer","review":"This movie did not have the scenes that I expected.

In many ways, this movie is as much a loving Bond spoof as the French OSS 117 films with Jean Dujardin...though not nearly as broadly comical. Everything about the film is brilliantly on-target, from the staging to the John Barry/David Arnold-esque music. The movie is structurally an homage to DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (stealing the teaser almost beat-for-beat) and yet surprisingly original, too. As a child, Mandrill sees his parents killed and grows up seeking revenge against their murderer. The clever twist here is that Mandrill intentionally models himself on \\"John Colt,\\" a cheesy 70s Bond/Shaft/Flint character. So you get a spoof within an homage. Cheeky. If you are fan of Bond films, Blaxploitation, and Eurospy movies, this is a must-see. Now I have to find the soundtrack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S WALDO?","review":"This film is so bad I thought it was a spoof of 70's action films complete with wack-a-da wack-a-da music and disco. Marko Zaror plays hit man Mandrill and is given a voice that sounds like Jason Statham. His parents were killed by a hit man named \\"Cyclops\\" who lost an eye during the incident. He has become Mandrill's target. Earlier we saw Mandrill looking for a guy named Waldo, asking everyone \\"Where's Waldo.\\" You can't help but laugh. There are flashbacks to his youth and his TV idol, John Colt, an oriental action hero who is also unintentionally comical.In order to get to \\"The Cyclops\\" Mandrill must get the information from his daughter who he woos.Terrible acting and dubbing.No f-bombs, brief sex? no nudity (arms in way). This film might be better to watch as an MST project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book - one of my childhood favorites!","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child. I read, re-read, and re-read this book. The illustrations and story are captivating.

I find new nuggets of information each time I go back to it. If I get stuck, or a situation arises, I know I can turn to this book for my answer. It took me a bit to get into this book the first time. I think it was because I thought his first bookUser Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development (The Addison-Wesley Signature Series)was so darn good.

It is the next best thing to having Mike there in person!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Agile disappointment","review":"I'm beginning to wonder how many agile books I can buy/read which say essentially the same thing. I bought this one because it looked like it covered some of the areas my team is struggling with in our 1 year/1,000 Story project. It is a light and easy to read, but it didn't ever seem to get beyond the basics and there wasn't anything I could suggest for our next retrospective...."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Reference for Estimating and Planning Software Projects","review":"Mike Cohn prooves once again that he is one of the best at describing software project tools and techniques in a very straightforward and easy to understand manner.

This book is a must read for all those project leaders and development teams who want to improve their effectiveness in estimating and planning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"Extremely useful book, filled with first-hand tips and thoughts. These pan out immediately when you have taken your first steps towards Agile project management. The book answers the mirriad questions you're faced with, or at leasts puts you in the right direction. I consider it a must-read for all team members. It helps, though, if you are already familiar with Agile and - preferably - Scrum. If that is so, I can' t imagine a better read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Practical Guide","review":"If I am able to implement a quarter of the advice from this book, I will be able to make a significant improvement at my work. The advice for estimating projects alone is highly valuable, and the pragmatic delivery of the information made it very easy to read and absorb. The little pieces of easily actionable advice was amazing. For instance he recommends not concluding iterations near the end of business quarters, and managers are going to need as much revenue as possible at that time and could increase pressure to \\"just get it done.\\" Very insightful, and the sheer number of \\"ah-ha\\" moments that I experienced was staggering.

The title is a bit misleading, as barring one song (morena), there is no bossa nova in the album. That being said, this is an interesting and very melodic album, reproducing lighter aspects of indian classical and islamic sufi music. Her kirtan tracks (first one and others) are good with great percussion and instruments. The bossa song is a nice blend of bossa chordings and tablas, with indian-influenced vocalizations.

Unfortunately, classical Indian music and Bossa Nova just doesn't mix well, or at least not in this album. These songs are howling, painful affairs that are sometimes utterly un-listenable. Even the cover of the album is awful. If you're a Bossa Nova fan, steer clear.

This book (along with the others in the series) is a great addition to watching the show. The best part of these books is that they catch the nuances that fly by the screen. Some of the best jokes are missed because they go by too quickly.This book helps us get all of the Simpsons humour without us having to play with the pause buttons on our VCRs.Even without all of the Doh's, chalkboard quotables and character write-ups, this book is well worth the money.I still can't believe what this show has become since its first start duing The Tracy Ullman Show (and the <Blank> Is Hell book series prior to that). Glad to see that some Hollywood writing still has merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egh","review":"By no means is this a step up or an improvement from the other outstanding guides to \\"The Simpsons.\\" In fact, a bit of a step down.You get your memorable quotes from episodes, your summaries, your \\"Movie Moments,\\" etc. But my favorite part about the other guides was the little box that pointed out the \\"Things You May Have Missed.\\" That box doesn't seem too thorough in this guide:There are always more and more \\"in-jokes\\" in the newer episodes...so why does this guide talk about them less than any of the others? It doesn't make sense; it was a little disappointing.What you'll find in those boxes in this new guide are a bunch of tidbits that waste time...they point out bits such as, \\"Bart is wearing his lucky hat in this scene, which he hasn't worn in two seasons.\\" It's too bad that the writers missed things that I, a regular fan, can find without even taping the episode and using the pause button. But everything else was up to par!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Reading!","review":"I love throwing parties and being the hostess, and I found this book incredibly entertaining and fun to read.

It has the puppets in it that the kids tend to dislike. Cailou is pretty whiny in this DVD too. (Not like the more recent ones where Cailou is super sweet). My son (two and a half) loves Cailou and loves this video, though I think I will limit the amount of time he watches it. I think he can notice the difference in Cailou's behavior too. He gets a very serious look on his face when Cailou is misbehaiving. I reinforce that Cailou shouldn't act that way to teach him that it is not acceptable. I'd say try one of the newer Cailou movies. Read the other reviews to be sure that it is the newer movie; don't go strictly on the year of the video. Some are newer versions of the older movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love this DVD","review":"I'm no child psychologist so I'm not going to try and determine whether or not this DVD is appropriate for your kids. Rather I'm just going to pass on this observation: Both my kids (ages 1 and 3) love watching this DVD; the oldest has watched it so many times that he even mouths the words as he's watching it (because he's memorized what's going to happened next). I suspect he finds this DVD so riveting because the story lines are so close to his reality (for example; having to share a toy with a younger sibling, or needing daddy to fix a toy). Irrespective; I've not noticed a change in his behavior when watching this DVD (unlike a Video on Monster trucks we once made the mistake of renting), and personally have no qualms letting my kids watch this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Parenting 101","review":"\\"Caillou\\" is one of my favorite cartoons for young children on television! My daughter likes it as well, but my main reason for loving it is the wonderful example of positive parenting it presents. As a firm advocate and practitioner of Gentle Discipline, i applaud the makers of Caillou for the way they portray Caillou's parents as patient, playful, encouraging, non-punitive, respectful of their children's feelings, and allowing them to express their autonomy while holding age-appropriate expectations of them. It is so rare to see this kind of gentle family dynamic in the age of such abhorrent shows as \\"Malcolm in the Middle\\" etc. How refreshing, and how wonderful that parents of young children who see this show are every day being exposed to at least half an hour of good parenting role-models -- even if they are animated!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Wretched Piece of Crap","review":"Bought 3 a year or so ago, ordered 3 more and found they were re-designed and perform horribly.

Luckily, I borrowed it because if I had actually spent the $13.00 that it cost, I would have returned it the same day and asked for my money back.I forced myself to read/skim about half of it, but it never improved. The setting of the book- a nuclear devasted future- was interesting, but that can't make up for a totally unlikeable and abrasive heroine who feels as cartoonish as the front cover.

This anthology introduces the idea of the cultural complex: a psychic pattern that can promote group identity but, when operating unconsciously, can seize entire populations with irrational impulses, stereotypical behavior, and dangerous forms of acting out. One has only to think about the hysterical and authoritarian reactions to 9/11 in America to see a cultural complex at work.A strength of this anthology is that it includes contributors from around the world, each applying cultural complex theory to actual examples drawn from immediate experience.Singer and Kimbles have bridged a huge gap in the depth psychological approach to understanding and dealing with collective trauma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon's Cultural Complex at work??","review":"A colleague suggested I read this book because I often critique psychotherapy's emphasis upon the individual without attention to group dynamics as they express themselves in racism and sexism. Interestingly, Amazon only credits one of the co-editors, Tom Singer, as the \\"author\\" even though the book cover clearly lists Singer and Sam Kimbles as co-editors.

It said 2 cups, but didn't specify cooked or uncooked, so I ended up with way too much rice and nowhere near enoguh broccoli, and the sauce was gross..way too salty.Also, many of the recipes call for nutritional yeast which is not easily attainable, even in the healthfood sections of large grocery stores.I'd forego this book if I had to choose all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unhealthy recipes","review":"While the recipes are vegan, THEY ARE NOT FREE FROM REFINED SUGARS AND HYDROGENATED OILS. I am guessing that 15 years ago, when the book was published, there was less concern about these sugars and fats.

While the content of the story is worthy of writing and knowing about, the manner in which this one was written leaves a lot to be desired. This story could have been told much more delicately and more suited to a younger audience, for which it is targeted. The author's choice of words in describing the young boy's fear of dying was crude and much too descriptive for younger children, especially those who have not given much thought to the subject yet. Not many children have. If I could rate this book at 0 stars, I would. I am very surprised that American Girl would publish such an unsuitable and inappropriate book for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST","review":"Cesar Millan is absolutely the best I've ever seen.

I highly recommend this DVD without any reservation and I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required viewing for all dog owners!","review":"I've been training dogs, and humans for over 17 yrs. This is not dog training, it's dog psychology. Before you train, you have to understand the species, and be a good leader. Cesar teaches leadership. I love this DVD!This DVD says all the right things, in a way that every owner can understand, and shows how a good leader shows authority in an assertive, but nonviolent way. I'm going to make this required viewing for all my clients!Cesar, thank you for taking the time to share such magnificent information with the World."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Cesar's Dog Whisper?

And the results are fantastic!Cesar was recommended to us several months ago and we began watching his TV series on the National Geographic Channel. It was a revelation. We have since recommended his show to all of our dog-owning friends and family.We've learned the power of calm assertive energy and how to be the pack leader when we go for walks. (btw, we do a lot more walking these days) Cesar's message is simple yet very effective.This DVD is a great companion to the TV series or as an introduction to Cesar's philosophy and techniques. A must-have for all dog owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Light Bulb Has Finally Gone Off!!!!","review":"This is the absolute best DVD I have seen in a very long time! It is so simple to apply his thoughts to your own dogs. I am a breeder of Coton de Tulears and have have used what I have learned on my dogs and we are ALL getting along marvelously well! It dawned on me that we, the people, are the ones entering the dog's world so it is up to us to figure out their language. This DVD is a \\"must have\\" for all dog owners!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Logic is always the best!","review":"Cesar's sense of dog \\"logic\\" is so well, logical that once you listen to him you realize that what he says is correct in dealing with dogs. We laugh as we think of them as our \\"kids\\" but in reality, we are not fulfilling them and their needs as dogs. I agree that this is a huge issue for most dog owners and it is great to see someone with Cesar's expertise not only tell us bluntly what we are doing to cause unwanted behaviors, but also showing us with simple steps how to correct OURSELVES. I found this DVD fascinating as I do all his weekly shows. Can't wait for Season 1 of Dog Whisperer to come out!

I've seen some complaints about the lack of dog interaction on the DVD, but the way I see things that is sorta the point. As he says on his show, he rehabilitates dogs....he *trains* people. Heck, the DVD title is \\"People Training for Dogs\\", not the other way around. My girlfriend and I just got our 11-week old beagle puppy (Carlin) over the weekend, and Cesar's messages ring lound and clear every time we interact with the pup. Calm and assertive....calm and submissive.....exercise, dicipline, affection....animal, dog, breed, name.....To be honest I was a little worried about getting my first pet dog at 33 years old, but following Cesar's advice things have been less daunting and more enjoyable than I ever imagined. The parts where he feeds his pack and places the kitten amongst his dogs were spectacular demonstrations of his method. We can't wait for the next DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanz in Atascadero","review":"I implemented Cesar's recommendations from the video and they made a difference in my dog's behavior on the very first day! It is such a simple concept but truely amazing. My little boy dog (from the animal shelter) was showing aggressive behavior. I started the training, that Cesar highlights in the video, on a daily basis and after that my dog became submissive and calm.

Quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This video was recommended to me but I was disappointed.

This didn't happen in this video. It was basically a long tutorial about dog family structure. eg. Alpha Dog... and heirachy. I've read many books and purchased many videos on training and dog behaviour. I must say that almost all the material I've purchased is more informative than this DVD. In my opinion it wasn't worth the postage.If you are interested in actually training a performance dog, try:1)Purely Positive Training: Companion to Competition by Sheila Booth2)Schutzhund obedience: Training in drive with Gottfried Dildei by Sheila Booth3)How Dogs Learn by Mary R.

Every week I look forward to see what wild dogs he is taming next. The \\"Dog Whisperer\\" is loaded with techniques and examples on how he deals with these animals. Unfortunately this is not the case with \\"People training for dogs\\". The DVD contains a few dog psychology basics, which Cesar fails to back it up with visual examples. A lengthy lecture is all that is provided. I am a visual learner and this DVD might be better suited for auditory learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for the book","review":"I like and respect Cesar. I wanted to support him by purchasing the DVD.The content is great. Succinct and to the point. Fine.The value of the product is not. For $30 I expected 2 hours of material but the 1 hour made me feel like I'd been ripped off. If they'd charged $15, then it would seem a balanced transaction.So if you want to support Cesar then make a direct donation to his Dog Psychology Center or mail him a $20 bill.... and wait for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money TV show is more in depth than this DVD","review":"As another reviewer I was very disappointed with this DVD Cesar takes 55 minutes to explain his approach which you can learn in 15 minutes from watching his show. I learned nothing new.I respect Cesar and his abilities and I hope that he will come out with a more comprehensive DVD in the future, so save your money and buy that one when it comes out. This one is not worth its 30.00 price tag. You will be better served by watching his show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"This is a must have for dog owners.

(Dumonde) is comprised of two artists, (Dj Jamx & De Leon), whom have remixed dozens of trance songs, and all are astounding.

Although crammed with information, much of it seems contrived, anecdotal and you have to expend too much energy digging deep to get to the core of the history of the spud.

It's national and global news and spreads awareness without ever talking down to the reader. You may not always agree with it (I take particular offense at a 1993 cover story perpetuating the ritual abuse scare ... and the fact that it seemed like every woman who wrote in had been a victim of ritual abuse, a statistical impossibility) but Ms. encourages dialogue and feedback. I find it unfortunate that a reviewer of this magazine had a bad experience with the editor-in-chief and I hope she wrote back and demanded an apology for being rudely dismissed.

Other than that, there weren't anything else. It's a mediocre tape with decent pricing IMO. I don't know how much these usually cost.

I checked its manual carefully, spent long time and tried all. But it did not turn on.Overall the TV stand looks just okay although at the front side it has about 3 mm noticeable gap at joints both ends.

Most items in this book are in verse and are too short in length to be of much use to the average actor. Also, the range isn't overwhelmingly broad and the written text is poor. The different works all manage to present women in a similar and clich�� way, somehow it is overly apparent that the \\"collector\\" of these pieces is a male. Some selections are interesting or by famous authors, however, they're out numbered greatly by B.S. wastes of ink and trees.

The story is wonderful, and is a great way to teach kids not to judge people based on initial impressions. The original edition was a cacophony of colors. The artwork deserved to win the awards it did. And while I'm glad the book is back in print (it has been out of print for some years), I wish the new version showed the care and magnificence of the original. The smaller format is disappointing, but is not my biggest issue. The colors on the art in this version are far more subdued. They lack that \\"boing\\" factor that stops you in your tracks and makes you look carefully at and appreciate the illustrations.Still, I'm glad the book can again be purhased for less than collector's prices.

With the latest installment (Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova) one can see the change dramatically. Stellar Dance Mode is for most a complete waste of time as it requires us to play songs we do not want to and in modes we do not want to just to unlock songs in the game. Some of the licensed songs are remixed versions that are below par to the original versions while other licensed songs are thrown on here just because they are already in other bemani games (Karaoke Revolution, Beatmania USA). There are many Japanese songs on this mix as well as instrumentals that seem out of place in DDR.We get songs from the arcade version (not the best ones in my opinion) and some new licenses (some which came out of nowhere it seems)but the feel of DDR has totally changed now and I miss what it used to be.The Double steps are quite good in this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the best but very good","review":"I've played some previous version of ddr and always loved them. as it's getting bigger in the states they are including some more american music, which isn't the best selection on their part.

Putting that aside, Mr. Niemeyer, as much as the mayority of journalists of our time, does not put aside his own political views and try to give us, the public, an objective analysis of what happened in Venezuela during those days of upheaval in April 2002. I've been trying to find a book in English that did just that but I'm afraid this journalist as much as the journalists of the Venezuelan opposition do not present an objective and thorough investigation of what happened. His statements lack factual support. There is no mention of any police investigation of the massacre just a simple sentence stating that Chavistas on the bridge could not have shot at civilians.

It worked fine for just over two weeks. Then it jammed. Now it won't work for more than a minute or two without jamming. The problem is with the auger drive.

He ended up murdered gangland style just prior to his being called to testify before a federal grand jury, a fact no one outside of the federal government could have known. Curiously, Aronow was also partners with Donnie Soffer (employer of Donna Rice of Gary Hart fame and the ill-fated \\"Monkey Business\\" yacht) as well as Ben Kramer, drug smuggler and nephew of Meyer Lansky.

I enjoyed Emily's character in the first book, but she did not hold my interest here. I did not think her a worthy heroine. And her husband truly did not deserve the title as hero.

I think that just takes away from the romance of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lady Delafont's Dilemma","review":"I was really disappointed with this book. I had enjoyed the first book so much and was really looking forward to reading Lady Delafont's story. What a letdown! I know that married couples can grow estranged because of a lack of communication, but this story was a bit of much. Did none of the more sympathetic relatives/friends never think of stepping in and shaking this couple (esp the husband). The only justification I can find for this story is that it seems to serve as a conduit to the next installment. Lady May, a character that crops quite prominently in the first two novels, is I believe to be the main character in the next book. And as she has proved to be a more interesting character than Lady Delafont, I will probably wait to read the next book, and hope that the story is worthy of the lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A LETDOWN!","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the first book. I enjoyed the first book very much but this book was very disappointing. The plot was extremely weak; it was the basis of the misunderstanding.

I only hope the next one is more realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars if possible","review":"While it seems that most romance novels, especially regencies, have one or two misunderstandings in the book to keep the central romantic couple apart, this book was just unending with the misunderstanding. For a couple to be so in love and not even discuss the situation in some fashion was just plain silly. And as a reader, very frustrating. And why did not any of the other people milling around in the story step in? It just did not work. Page after page it just baffled me that they were separated and for what?

Hands down.","review":"When I finished this book I could hardly bring myself to believe that this was Mr. Chandra's first novel.

The inclusion of Hindu myths and gods only added to the wonderful stories the simian narrator had to tell. I await his next book with baited breath"},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing and soaring book","review":"I started the book with some trepidation, because of its thickness. But once I was in the first paragraph, I was taken by Chandra's rich language, and the rolling waves of story that flow from his storytellers. This is a great book. It is unlike any other novel, because it tells stories in a way that a traditional novel doesn't. In fact it forces you to confront what you expect from a novel, and why. Read it and have your mind expanded, and your heart moved. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imaginative and challenging, but fails in delivery.","review":"Vikram Chandra's tale of mythic India weaved in with modern times is a very imaginative, epic tale , but it turns out to be too long-winded, rambling at times and unresolved in my view. He switches back and forth from the past to the present rather well, although, at times, I thought that maybe if you separated the times, they, in themselves, would have been very good books. The story on the whole lacked cohesiveness. It seemed that Chandra kept writing more and more without staying focused on the story at hand. There was too much to digest which didn't leave too much thought to savor. What I really disliked, however, was the latter part of the book where it didn't make sense with the bloodthirsty doctor and the bomb.

I was looking for a good summer read, an escape, something to dive into at the end of a long day at work. At first, it seemed that this would be just the ticket: colorful characters, interesting culture, history, and a novel premise... But it never got off the ground. I found myself turning pages just to try to get through them.I found the characters to have little depth and no matter how hard I tried, I found myself unable to empathize with them or care about what they were doing. The dialog is contrived. The stories--and there are lots of them--are diatribes. Two-dimensional characters + long, boring stories = an uninteresting book.I am a bit surprised by all the praise this book has received. Seems too congradulatory for something so unimpressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding !!!!","review":"What can I say. I read this book a number of time whilst travelling through South America and it was the only one I wouldn't swap. The characters are alive and you feel for them. The scope and vision are epic.

But after struggling through all its immense rambling length, I have no clue what the whole point was. The initial premise of stories within stories was novel and arresting. But I found the awkward jumping from past to present very jarring. It might have made the novel more cohesive if Chandra had stuck to the medieval India stories and not tried to work in the American experiences. The events that lead to the end with the mad doctor just came out of nowhere and I didn't get the sense that this novel was being led to its logical conclusion.

I wasnt expecting something like this since he is still considered a Nickolodeon star. I thought he would be more mindful of his audience and not have songs with lyrics youth shouldnt be singing. All the songs on his show are fine. My daughter also read me some lyrics that have ... in place of words.

You'll like it if you're into that style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for all!","review":"This is a great CD to buy, it's very upbeat with positive lyrics. The first song may have a line like this \\"....I sneak a peek to see what you were wearing last night, or what was left over from ripping off your clothes....\\" but that's the only song with content like that. The rest have lyrics like \\"So do what you want to do, be what you want to be\\". Not only are the lyrics upbeat, but the music behind them is feel-good and sounds very unique. Another great thing about this CD, is that anyone can enjoy it! I'm in my late teens, and I love the sound of this CD, but what's even better, is my mom likes it too, how cool is that? What I also love about this CD, and find admirable about Drake Bell and his band, is that they have written all the music themselves!

The author is clever, however, in disguising his pain. The style is an easy read, but that should not be a testament to any endorsement of a Pulitzer.Lesh would be better off writing a book on music theory. Saddly, he has nothing new to contribute to our knowledge, nor any wisdom one might expect from a mind expanding lifetime. Unless you are a librarian or independently wealthy, I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound almost found","review":"This is probably the most interesting and well written of the books on the phenomenon known as The Greatful Dead. Lesh goes into several areas not previously accessed, like sound technology and musical ideas. Space limitations prevented more details, which would have been even more interesting and revealing on many aspects of Dead lore. Overall, however, a masterful effort by the bassist and a \\"must have\\" for deadheads interested more in the intellectual than the partying side of this incredible musical unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not essential","review":"If you're a well-read Deadhead, you'll find very little that you haven't heard before in Phil's book. But since it's *Phil* talking, there are a few insights to be gained here and there, and some darn interesting perspectives. Phil is certainly a good writer, a fascinating guy, an astounding musician, etc., and he is as inside as it's possible to be on the subject... But there are very few blow-your-mind epiphanies here.Of course, it's a must-read for serious students of the Dead, but IMHO the single best book on the Grateful Dead is still Blair Jackon's biography of Jerry Garcia.

In China, where my organization is working to promote sustainable housing design, I use the book to explain to government officials and others just what straw-bale construction is all about.

It tells you of a few spells and such, but again, never gets too specific. But when I was starting out, it helped me alot. And I would always go back when getting started for reference.

I just can't help it, though... this book is missing some kind of spark. Basically the introduction is nice, but not deeply informative. The stories themselves are neither introduced or postscripted. While, as I say, you cannot fault the selection, the selections are all too safe for my taste. Lovecraft, Dunsany, Howard, Pratchet. Okay, safe ground.But there should have been some more risk taken here I think. James Branch Cabell instead of Dunsany, perhaps. Or Moorcock or LeGuin or Tanith Lee for Pete's sake.

There's enough plot to fill MAYBE a hundred pages, but it drags on for almost 400. The rest was fairly boring dialog, during which the characters re-hash already established arguments over and over again. Action? None. On the rare occasions that events actually happened, they were unrealistic in a contrived, unimaginative sort of way. Plus, we're supposed to beleive that there is real passion between these 2 characters when it takes them 365 pages to do anything but kiss? I also found the characters unsympathetic and one-dimensional. The father is such an idiot, and does some really awful things while meddling, but is forgiven immediately with a slap on the back and a \\"Well, you meant well.\\" Overall, a complete waste of time.

Over a week, I saw more and more holes!!! This really a piece of junks. Some one may think that because my water source may has too much pressure! No, I have a water pressure gauge that reads only 42 PSI which is low to nornal pressure. Comparing to the hose I bought at Walmart for only ~ $8, the Walmart's one is much better!Be aware!

After LASIK surgery, it became clear that it was this mascara that dried out my eyes. I might not have gone for LASIK if I knew this mascara was to blame for my dry eyes.

I was lazy and went online to buy it instead. It was the same price as I pay at the make up counter in the department stores so I went for it. But when it arrived, it was the WATERPROOF version of the product which is not what I ordered. No where in my order process online did it mention WATERPROOF. So the product was wrong.

When I read on a blog that this product was made by the same company and was, in fact, the same product in a different package, I quickly and eagerly made my purchase.It is not. sigh.Lancome DEFINICILS High Definition Black Mascara is just like any other mascara out there, but worse in that it is:-too expensive-too small a quantity-too 'quick drying'. contents of the bottle dry out too quickly necessitating more frequent purchases of said product and moreover-difficult to apply without forming clumps because it dries too quickly on the lashes which makes it difficult to control its application.I gave it 2 stars b/c yes, it is a mascara and works like a mascara and yes, it is black."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lancome Mascara","review":"The mascara was very dry and I am sure old.

As a QuickCad user, switching to AutoSketch was a snap. All of the menus are similar, drawing conventions are the same, and it has the same \\"feel\\". I found the changes to be improvements in the interface options. Layers can be turned on and off from the drawing page rather than pulling up the layer window. There are better templates for starting a drawing.I use this program for drawing up furniture plans for my woodworking hobby.

By the way I paid over $500 for that version. I've used AutoSketch to build a wheel chair ramp and it worked perfectly. This program is everything I will need to get dimensioned drawings for projects that require this type of work. I'm using it now to see how existing furniture will fit into a new house we're in the process of buying. So far no complaints - you will have to be familiar with principals of mechanical drafting to get the most from this, but out of the box I was productive and very proficient in a couple of days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Autodesk AutoSketch 9","review":"I bought this program as I have been drawing for years with Windows cad and Quick cad. They worked great on the older windows system but when we upgraded to 2000 xp we started having problems with lock ups. I took a chance (as Autodesk bought out those companies) to see if I could access my older .cad extension files. This program will load the old files and save them in a .cad format or the .skf which it normal saves files. The only caution is once you have loaded and saved in the Auto desk auto sketch, you can't go backwards. Your old software will not be able to read it.

It gave advice, and only good if you desire 'tough love' tactics.While I do accept Spezanno's idea that we are responsible for how we feel...he takes that too far and essentially has you blaming yourself for everything that happens to you. Sorry...I don't buy that at all. I can't see how a partner could accept responsiblity for being unfaithful, or how you are responsible if your partner just doesn't want to communicate at all. There is only so much one can take responsibility for in any relationship, and I felt strongly that Spezanno expected the reader to blame themself for their heartbreak.

But if you're a westerner who's ever spent an extended period of time trying to get around inside of northern India, I suspect you'll find this book as amusing as I did. So in that sense it captures some of spirit of the place, though perhaps it's only amusing if you've experienced first-hand the chaos that is India. It's probably not a good choice if you're looking for a traveler's introduction to \\"modern\\" India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I am a long-time fan of Eric Newby since stumbling upon his 1956 book, A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush.

Gently Down the Ganges, by comparison, I found monotonous and dreary, almost whiny.

One such scene looks a bit like the cover of the first Black Sabbath album--minus Ozzy. There's also a scene where the main character looks quite goth.Unfortunately, the end of my copy of the film cuts gets all fuzzed out.

The size is great, especially now that most people are used to cell phones. Someone mentioned in another review that they couldn't figure out some of the buttons, but they obviously didn't read the manual.

One needn't be clever to figure the thing out-- once the clues are in place, a six year old could untie this unsavory glop.

Particularly interesting are the glimpses one gets of everyday life - \\"terracing\\" (evening walks during the summer) by the Royal Family, the King's pleasure in interactions with common folks, suggestions of a sincere Christian faith, and pithy (sometimes snide) remarks by or about one person or the other.

The first leak was when the item was filled with water, so it dried; this time the leak is with coffee, so I have stains all over paperwork, which is annoying.

It's almost as if the Thermos is KEEPING the cold from the liquid, it is very strange. If you keep the Thermos and Juice out of the fridge, the juice is practically rancid by the afternoon.I tried so many things and of course, it's now way past 7 days to return the Thermos to the Amazon Seller and when I contacted Thermos, they only exchange.The design is nice.

And a big one for me--- it's easy to clean. I don't have time to handwash travel mugs every night, so I love that this is dishwasher safe.

I never did find the ring in the dishwasher, but when I called the company, they immediately sent me a new one.)

If you put ice into this in the morning it is very likely to be there the following morning! The rubber-like base gives it stability in addtion to protection from dings. The mouth is wide enough to hold all but large ice cubes, so there is no need for special \\"ice tube\\" trays. It looks rugged, and it is, but the most superior quality this product demonstates is the ability to keep your cold drink cold for a very long time. It fits my car's cup holder, but it might not fit all. That hardly matters because the easy opening click button means you can quickly sip and close, reassured that this never, ever leaks!

The box claims \\"Superior Clarity, Extended Range...\\" No... I don't think so. I hear a lot of static about 50% of the time, and the range does not even cover my home about 2,000 sf. I would feel better about the purchase if I did not spend so much. I should have waited for the technology to evolve a little. The head set is comfortable and lightweight, I will give it that. I would say if the phone is about $[$$] it would be worth it because it is convenient to be completely hands free when you can hear your caller.

It was much more comfortable and audio was tolerable. unique design that does not touch ears is great, very comfortable for extended use. But we wore it out, now looking for something else.

One of her comments was that the elastic band seemed kind of strange, but I can understand why it would be necessary to keep the suit from draping too much. She says that they were very warm and comfortable (which was the aim). Proportions didn't quite match in that the pajama legs were a little long for her stature and pj feet larger than hers, but overall not a major issue. I was happy to see there were anti-skids on the bottom of the feet. Overall, the maker did fine work in craftsmanship, however if leg length and foot size were tailored it'd certainly be 5 star. For the price though, can you beat it? This fun little gift turned out to be pleasantly practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Customer Service","review":"I am so frustrated with this company. I bought footed p.j.'s for my teenage kids for Christmas. When the p.j.'s arrived, I wrapped them and put them under the tree for Christmas. Unfortunately, Christmas was over 14 days away. On Christmas morning, one of the kids' p.j.'s were too small. I immediately wrote an email to jumpinjammerz, asking them what I needed to do to exchange for a larger size. Wait a few days, no response. I emailed again, three more times over the next 3 weeks. No response at all. Today I called them. I was politely told that since the order was over 14 days ago, I cannot exchange, I cannot have a refund, I don't even get a token discount on a pair to replace the ones they won't take back.

I find it hard to believe that Lamarque, a multimedia superstar for decades, was as bad as this so-called tribute makes her sound. There are too many tracks from late in her career, when her voice wasn't what it used to be and she couldn't hit the high notes any more. It's as if the folks at Sony rounded up a couple dozen rejects from other compilation albums, threw in a few bona fide hits, and called it an album. They didn't bother with liner notes, and the dates given in the track listings do not often correspond to the actual recording dates. Sony's treatment of this artist -- and the people they've duped into buying an inferior product -- borders on contempt.

The text is very difficult to understand, equations are not fully explained, and many terms are used that can be quite unfamiliar to engineers and scientists without prior knowledge of reciprocal space and crystallography. The book attempts to explain the entire concept of diffraction using Bragg's law, without providing the more intuitive view of photons and electrons in the Brillouin Zone.

The phone was not cheap at all, but I've had 2 Pannasonic phones in the past and they were absolutly the best... (one was a victim of coke spill, the other still works great but I wanted an answering machine). I quickly denied the service plan because of my great experinece with my other Pannasonic phones. But when I got home I checked out these reviews... I thought long and hard about what I should do but the absolute coolness and awesome features this phone offers I just coulnd't part with it. So instead I went back and purchased one of those 2 year service plan things.This phone is just too cool, but I agree for [the price]it shouldn't have this type of rep.My advise... get the phone. But buy a replacement plan if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - Don't buy this phone","review":"This phone has been a disaster. The reception drops off after 30 feet (line of site) and is totally lost after 40 feet. It doesn't work upstairs in my house. If you cradle the handset between your head and shoulder (while carrying children, cooking, etc.) two problems occur: a) your head presses the \\"hang up\\" button disconnecting the line and/or b) the phone is too short so when you cradle the phone your cheek blocks and covers up the microphone on the handset and the person on the other end of the phone call cannot hear you. The phone only works when you hold the phone with a hand and consciously hold it slightly away from your head so as not to hang up or cover the microphone. Even so, the ear speaker must be perfectly aligned with your ear or else you can't hear the phone. This is very annoying. AVOID PURCHASING THIS PHONE. CAVEAT EMPTOR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this terrible phone","review":"I have absolutely nothing good to say about this telephone. The battery life is ridiculously short. Conversations fade in and out. After a few months the numbers on the very small handset keypad have faded to the point of being nearly unreadable. The range is adequate, however, that is of little consequence, when one is speaking and the person on the other end of the line is fading. This is going into the trash as soon as I buy a different phone to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charging circuit kills the batteries","review":"The charging circuit on this phone will overcharge the batteries.The phone itself gets extrememly hot. This cooks the NiMH batteries resulting in a talk time of about 20 minutes.Panasonic does not offer to replace the phone. However, if you call their service number and tell them the battery won't hold a charge, then they will automatically and without question offer to send you a free replacement battery. They are cheerful and courteous about this.Expect to have to call them every couple of months for a new battery. I suspect that Panasonic figures this is cheaper than replacing. Eventually, you will get tired of calling them and/or will have replaced the phone with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the battery","review":"I have had this phone for about 4-5 months. The battery started not holding a charge about a month ago. I stopped by a Good Guys to pick up a new one only to find that a) they didn't carry the battery (though they did carry the phone); and b) \\"lots of other people had been asking for the same battery\\".I concluded from this, as well as the other reviews, that Panasonic has a problem in this area. I suspect that there may be a heat problem (maybe not monitored properly) with the charger.The reception is not that great; the controls are not that convenient to use, especially the \\"joystick\\" button. Programming requires the handset, rather than being done entirely from the base (for no good reason that I could tell). The button label are odd and not intuitive.Just not the great phone that it could be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Like everyone else, I've observed problems keeping a charge on the phone for more than 30 minutes.

Well this week it started cutting out during calls and making strange noises while in the call. I call Panasonic and they claim that they have had very little problems with the phone and would not help me in any way except for me to send the phone back and pay $70 for a referb phone that could also go bad in a year.

I did some research on which PS2 DDR was the best choice for beginners, and Supernova seemed to be the winner. That it came bundled with the dance pad was a bonus, and for the price, I am very happy. I am still very clumsy, but both my husband and I are addicted to the game. I like that the workout mode records are saveable and cumulative. I don't like that you're pretty much on your own for figuring out anything more complex than step--step--step--step--etc., but that's just a learning style thing. For beginners, the included dance pad is fine. Even jumping around futilely on the really hard songs it doesn't slide. (Putting duct tape Xes on each arrow might help with mat proprioception, though.)

Most of the reviews were positive. The reason I did not give the product 5 stars, it came with a broken O-ring on one of its elbows and the price was a bit high at $89.95. Customer service mailed me a complete set of o-rings which were easy to install.There are two elbows which allow for various positions, along with a ratcheting rotating clockwise or counterclockwise motion. The installation was a breeze. However, I found out that if you turn your wall pipe that comes out of the wall upward, this will allow the complete assembly head to have a higher spray inside of a traditional bath/shower enclosure.I would recommend this shower head to anyone who is looking for a complete overhead even spray experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"If you have well water and are having pressure issues, this is the shower head for to use.

I should mark it up with a black sharpie so they can't send it to someone else!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel gypped.","review":"Bought this because it was supposed to be a fabulous water-conserving shower head. But when I opened the package, the instructions actually advise consumers to install it WITHOUT the flow control first, to experience the full effect. Without the flow control, it is an unrestricted flow, and in my shower, that was upwards of five gallons per minute (yes, I checked). The flow control nozzle does, indeed, cut it down to 2.5 gallons per minute, which I thought was good, until I did some research online and learned that 2.5 g.p.m. is the maximum allowed by the U.S. for new shower heads. Most \\"water-saving\\" shower heads have a flow that is a full gallon per minute less than that. Yes, this shower head is marketed as a luxury item, but they're misleading folks if they suggest that it's luxury that's also good for the environment and your energy bills. ESPECIALLY if most folks are installing it without the \\"optional\\" flow control nozzle, as the instructions recommend.Can you tell I'm angry?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shower Head","review":"Purchased two, Great, nice pressure, very easy to install..however does not swivel as advertised, therefore had to return the one that was a gift due to shower head not being in the center of shower...didn't work properly for the dynamics of shower, something to consider, but still worth a try, the return was very easy & fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thunderhead showerhead","review":"It's good and easy to install.

From the pictures, I thought the seam in the middle of the extension arm would allow twisting, but it doesn't.Now, after about a year of use, it has started to leak. The problem is that the part that hooks up to your metal pipe is not metal - it is plastic. Over time, it has developed cracks (maybe from the heat?), and has started to leak, and trying to adjust it only makes it worse. So, this would be great if they would just have the joining part made of metal so it would last and you could tighten it past barely finger tight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longterm not worth it.","review":"I bought the Thunderhead thinking it would be the last showerhead I ever bought. Since the entire product is made of plastic and rubber -- it is supposed to be easy to clear the the hard calcium buildup by pinching the rubber water nipple. Well after less then 2 years more water comes from around those little nipples then come through them. Only a one year warranty -- hardly worth it considering the price. I imagine I could have paid 1/2 as much and needed to clean the head a little but I know the other heads I have used in the past lasted longer then 2 years. Be warned it isn't if you will need to replace the whole thing --- it is only a matter of when you will need to replace it. Steer clear of this -- look for a better warranty at a reduced price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not everything I thought it would be","review":"One problem I have with this showerhead is that in the picture it shows there is a middle pivot in the arm you can use to fold up or down, but the shower head I was sent has none; its just soldered in place.

Did nothing of the sort for my shower, just spread our low pressure over many nozzles with tiny spray streams and it actually really tickled my head and face. They were great about accepting my return request and I'm guessing if I had mega shower pressure this baby would be great, but...then...I wouldn't need to look for a product that is supposed to increase pressure.I wasn't expecting to not get my shipping cost back, since I had to pay 10 bucks to ship it BACK to them, and only got 80 dollars in return instead of the total 89.95 (w/ free shipping) That I paid for it....so for that SNEAKY move (and for it plain not working for me) I give it a one star.It is kinda cheap feeling due to plastic but it really seemed like it was soundly constructed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much bragging","review":"Spent too much time bragging about her clients and her accomplishments and too little time offering helpful advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying into a new life......","review":"Sometimes you need a new perception or new idea or just validation and this book captured those elements for me.

When I received this one, I was delighted tofind that not only did it have machined steel bearings, but that it could be tightened as needed. The real joywas to use it the first time.

Their wares are now made in China rather than the US, but that didn't have to mean abandoning all standards of quality. They must have sold the company to someone wanting to exploit their great reputation but provide much-lower-quality products. The pieces we recently purchased might have been acceptable if we had not had a number of the Armetale pieces already, but the contrast in quality was stunning to us. We expected the heavy, durable pieces we had always purchased in the past. These are much lighter gauge metal, and seem ridiculous on the same table as the \\"real\\" Armetale we already had. Too bad! One more great American company bites the dust!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another metal product MADE IN CHINA","review":"I just received this gravy boat and was dismayed to see a \\"Made in China\\" label. The company is supposedly a family-owned business in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania with a reputation for quality goods produced locally. I am a fan of Wilton Armetale products and appreciate the overall quality of their serveware in general, however, considering the questionable metal content of China-produced kitchenware (lead, cadmium, etc.), I cannot recommend this item.

The person who wrote that review obviously has no ear for music. This album is 100% awesome. It's an mix of 70's porn music and modern groove thick funk-jazz. Every song is a winner. Their limited use of vocals such as the \\"In my mind\\" chorus in \\"Minha Mente\\" adds the perfect sprinkle of seasoning to compliment the tight musicianship of the group.

So the video is grainy, sound not up to today's standards and not a dozen of camera angles. It doesn't matter to me. Their set list is from their greatest 4 albums, ever. Mick Taylor's guitar playing makes it all come together. So if you want to see the performances where the Rolling Stones became and were literally elevated to \\"The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World\\" here's the reason why in this movie.Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Rolling Stones Concert","review":"This is an excellent Rolling Stones concert. The sound and quality is very good, I think the digital re-master of it makes the difference. But what really made the difference as a whole is the lead guitar performed by Mick Taylor.

Many of those around me in attendance were in a drug induced state before the Rolling Stones hit the stage. I feared leaving my seat to get something to drink and taking the chance of having some idiot dropping something in it. That said, the show itself was an incredible experience.As this DVD brings to life the Stones were firing on all cylinders and in overdrive. From start to finish one awesome song after another. Mick Taylor was by far the best guitarist the Stones ever employed.His playing is clearly outstanding. Although at the time I believe he was only 19 or 20 years old and looks to be scared to death. The climatic ending will have you in a state of awe as the Stones tear the place down.Without doubt this is the best Stones concert DVD period!Warn your neighbors and turn this piece of rock and roll history up LOUD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stones never better","review":"Despite the graininess and the video quality, this show is the cream of the Rolling Stones performing career. Music and spectacle, optimally combined and without and before the often distracting stage gimmickry that would come in later years, delivers the primal intensity any music fan craves for. Each number is a killer, and the show builds into a frenzied finale. At first, the changing quality of the video, as well as the alternating outfits, might be disconcerting. However, the show is sequenced seamlessly, giving the garments, at least, a colorful changing visual attractiveness. The inferior quality of some of the video is undeniable, yet the power of the performance and the music triumph here. I would have liked to have seem a couple of seconds more of a a clearly-shot Nicky Hopkins; otherwise, the ensemble players are well-represented. Jagger is unbelievable--all four of him!

Everything the band plays (excepting one cover song) is from Let it Bleed, Beggars, Sticky, or Exile. Mick Taylor, Nickey Hopkins and Bobby Keys are equal players with the core of Mick, Keith, Bill and Charlie (even Ian S. makes a brief piano appearance).This is the Rolling Stones at their absolute peak (among many great periods).

The Stones were pioneers of great sound and lighting since Get Yer Ya Ya's out! It was great to see the horn section included on this tour! My only gripe, hardly any footage of Bill Wyman!

For those of us who had other concerns - the Vietnam conflict, the nuclear arms race, and supporting a family to name a few - the 'over the top' descriptions of the impact of this Stone tour need to be taken with a grain of salt...

I am buying a blu-ray player just for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-Have For fans of the Rolling Stones","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen, the Rolling Stones, released briefly to theaters back in 1974, has finally been released to DVD and Blu-ray. The movie was filmed in 1972 when the Rolling Stones were touring to support Exile on Main Street. Many people, including myself, consider Exile to be the Stones' greatest album and the early 1970s line-up, with Mick Taylor, to be their best. The song selection for the film was very good, most having become concert staples all these years later. The Stones' performances on each and every song is great and their fans will be glad to have these peformances for posterity.The movie itself is not perfect. The lighting is too dark most of the time and the directing could have been better. But dispite the flaws in the filmmaking, the music warrants a purchase and all Rolling Stones fans will want this disc in their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally we get to see the real Stones","review":"There's no doubt in anyone's mind that the Stones during the Taylor era were at the top of their game. Despite the fact that he did not write any of their music, Taylor's exquisite guitar playing to complement Keith's great foundation playing, the musicianship took precedence over the theatrics and Jagger's \\"one man show\\" performance.of the latter Stones. The big gripe I have (I knew it would happen) is the lower volume of Taylor's guitar where you almost have to strain to hear all the details and nuances. Unlike a bootleg cd I have from the same era recorded in Europe, where the master's guitar is loud and up front where it belongs. After all these years of professional jealously, give it a rest Keith. Let the fans enjoy the Stones before they became a caricature of their former selves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed Masterpiece","review":"Terrific performance by the band at their peak, but it is so frustrating when the cameras stay on Mick Jagger during Keith's or Mick Taylor's guitar solos. Notice how the audience is rarely shown; When this movie originally came out in the theaters in the mid 70s, much hype was made that it was filmed in a way that would make you think YOU are the original audience witnessing the concert (Hence the lack of audience shots that would spoil this illusion). Too Bad they went that direction in the editing room. It is always exciting to see Mick J. interact with the crowd, but there's NONE of that on display here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"This is raw power at it's best. Now additives, no gimmicks, just pure Rolling Stones at their highest energy. The selections are great and the 5.1. sound is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stones captured at their peak","review":"I've always wondered why there is so little concert footage available that documents the Stones when they were at their peak creatively as well as performancewise. The period between Beggar's Banquet and Exile from which this concert's songs were selected is represented well here. If you've been disappointed after watching other Stones concerts on video they are in fine form here. This was the time when they were \\"the real deal\\" instead of caricatures of themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!","review":"I have seen this in the theaters and this concert ROCKS.

This is the Stones at their absolute zenith, with their greatest lead guitarist (Mick Taylor), performing the very best of their vast catalog (from their first post - \\"Exile\\" tour, yet still including much from \\"Beggar's Banquet,\\" \\"Let It Bleed\\" & \\"Sticky Fingers\\") and Jagger's swagger & voice in peak form.I have a very raw bootleg of \\"Ladies and Gentlemen...\\" and even with poor resolution, the genius shines through. The Stones were never better - and that's saying a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"a super live concert","review":"Ladies and gentelmen by the rolling stone is fine concert featuring some of their big hits from terrific albums like beggars banquet let it bleed sticky fingers and exile on main street.mick jagger keith richards are absolutely terrific on this dvd which is very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's hope the transfer is good","review":"This filmed concert is suppose to be their best ever and yeah I got a crappy bootleg like many of us here.

I pre-ordered a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised it got so many good reviews!","review":"I anticipated a great concert with Mick Taylor's skills being a big part of that anticipation. It was OK musically, but very poorly videotaped. The only focus was on Mick Jagger, in all his glory. I hard every saw another band member in the video at all! Seriously, It also had an \\"old\\" look to it. I believe the film's quality was the main reason why it was shelved until now. I was really disappointed. Mick even comments at the end, explaining how the filming \\"back then\\" left alot do be desired.(?) I wish I knew that before I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me wish I was around in the 70's.","review":"This is a very exciting dvd to watch. The song choice is great as well as the audio quality. This would be a good introduction to the band for someone just discovering them for the first time. If you like Led Zeppelin's 2003 dvd release then you will definitely like this one. I have to say that it's too bad they didn't 'involve' Mick Taylor with the band more because he is clearly a great guitarist and perfectly balanced out Keith's loose/sloppy playing. Should have kept him around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if your dog likes to chew.","review":"Paid over $100 for this and my black lab chewed a hole in it.

It is not just a rehash of the movie you have already seen. The general basis of the plot is very similar, but you will find Carman's presentation different and takes turns in the story you might not expect. After reading the book, I rather wished there was a movie version that used the novel script.The message of faith couldn't be more clear to you or to anyone you might buy the book as a gift.

The first several track are very early, pre-Psychocandy noise hysteria, but the real revelation is hearing stripped-down acoustic versions of the songs on that album. They're almost more wonderful without all the feedback--pristine, melodic songs whose delicate music runs against their nihilistic lyrics. Things get a bit lame later in the disc with some of the JAMC's less distinguished later tracks, but the acoustic version of \\"My Girl\\" is killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green delivers good, solid fun.","review":"Good characters, well developed intrigues and flashes of blood, sorcery and rampaging creatures.

If you have a fantastic memory combined with a lot of patience, you migh actually learn to understand some french by this package, but otherwise there are many better alternatives.The Pimsleur products are exceptional quality but expensive. For a more hi-tech approach the \\"Learn to speak\\" series by The learning company may be appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are many ways to learn a new language","review":"Different people might require different methods for learning a new language. This method contains 40 lessons and 3 CD's. You can listen to the tapes while reading the book at the same time. Therefore, it is not a course you can take only listening on your way to work. You do need the book. Nevertheless, it is, at least for myself, a much better approach than other methods that say that you don't need any book. Considering the price, it is a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, even while it lasted","review":"I was looking forward to a caller ID device which my \\"old eyes\\" could read without reading glasses. But the display, while large, is no easier to read than smaller displays, because of a dark greenish-gray background which contrasts poorly with the black digits. There is a contrast control, but the two settings can best be described as bad and worse. Further, the pixel resolution is coarse, resulting in a pronounced staircase effect on diagonal lines, such as the letter N. Worst of all, the display developed defects after just two months of use -- the left sides of some digits and letters no longer appear. Battery replacement did not help this problem. Another oddity is that, if the same caller has called repeatedly, only the most recent call is logged. This is a good product to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"big ok but can't read in the dark","review":"I thought this would be a great thing for the TV room, so you could decide whether to interrupt a show by answering the phone, but you can't read the display in the dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"REVIEW","review":"I have 2 of these.

Best of all, if you travel you can take it with you and reset it for the new place. You have a choice of being alerted in a weather emergency by a red flashing light or by a loud-enough siren. The announcer's voice is monotonic because of the recording, but if you just want the facts, you won't care. It also gives conditions of weather in the ocean for boaters and fishermen. It works even in a power failure because of its backup battery. You won't have to wait until after the daily news report to find out the weather at any time! This is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Midland Products Dubious","review":"I own this weather radio, and it has great features...if only it worked properly! Mine has a tendency to come on anytime it feels like it, not just when there's an alert, which can be quite shocking in the middle of the night. I suspect a problem in the electronics. I recenty purchased another model made by Midland, and the buttons on it don't work right, so I'm going to have to return it to the store. I won't be buying another piece of electronics from Midland.

The information about Carolan is limited, and this detracts slightly from the biographical portion. To be honest, however, other biographies have prejudiced our thinking. Current writing has trained us into thinking that the writer must give a complete portrait and life story. This just isn't available due to limited records. What is presented is good. Just as important is that all of the 200+ melodies attributed to Carolan are included. This is a treasure for musicians, especially harpers. It also gives some background on many of the pieces (the \\"planxies\\"). A good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"This phone works as advertised.

They all seam to have lost communication with their base. No signal to or from headset. Replaced all 4 with Panasonic phones with great results.Also, the IBM 3455 has very low maximum volume, sound not amplified enough to hear clearly even on the highest setting. all 4 phones were identical.Found no support so far from IBM online so far as far as any recalls or known repairs. I guess they are bound for the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This is the worst phone I ever had. I returned it to the store the next day after having the battery charged and tested the phone. The clarity of the voice is non existant. I just couldn't hear half of the conversation. I had to switch phones the first time I used it. I tried all the settings and channels and locations without any improvement whatsoever. My 2 years old 900 Mhz Lucent phone is just so much better. The phone is sure cheap at [price] and has some nice features but it just doesn't matter if you can't use it. Also, some caracters on the display are so small that you need a microscope to see them. I do not recommand this phone to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"IBM Cordless Phone","review":"The phone had sticking buttons. For example when you were told to press 1 in an automated phone connection, you had to hang up and go to another phone as pressing the 1 did not work. Other problems were noted with the quick dial features and with static even when within a few feet of power source. I returned the phone as basically unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacking one feature to be perfect","review":"I've used a Panasonic 2.4Ghz phone for a long time now and was never happy with it for two reasons. It wasn't loud enough and I would get an out of range message atleast once a week even by the base. This IBM phone has great volume and range. It's also more comfortable to use and just fits your head better. The one feature it lacks is a backlit LCD. It's really annoying not to be able to see the LCD, especially for CallerID, in the dark. That's the only complaint I have, otherwise the phone is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality, poor battery connection","review":"I thought digital phones were the new rage, in part, because of the improved sound quality. If this phone is representative of digital phones, then keep your old fashioned ones. My analog phone has much better sound quality. Also, this phone has very temperamental battery connections, making a continuous charge difficult to maintain. And, why would they make the caller ID display on the underside of the phone so that you can't see who it is until after you've picked it up?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone is awful.","review":"We've had this phone for about six months now. I dread using it. I'll walk clear across the house to pick up another phone even if this phone is directly in front of me. Clarity on this phone is non-existent. If I am forced to use this phone, I can barely hear the caller, even on the highest volume setting; I always end up screaming at the caller to speak up, then they hang up on me. I have the same problems every time I use this phone. I HATE IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more from IBM.","review":"There is no way to turn off auto-answer. If the phone is in the cradle when it rings, you have to pick it up to see the caller ID. When you pick it up, it answers the phone automatically making caller ID useless.Sound quality, both receiving and sending is very poor. Makes me think I am using a cheap cell phone. Have used $9 phones that sounded better.Invest your money in a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standards - The Nelson Way","review":"This is a re-release of an original 1993 Willie Nelson album which features yet another beautiful collection of standards, done in that most unique Willie Nelson way.But unlike earlier Willie Nelson releases on which he concentrated on interpreting classic tunes (like his 1978 Stardust or his 1994 Healing Hands albums), this 15-track CD is a very laid-back affair with sparse instrumentation; basically just guitars, a little piano, a subdued bass & some gentle drums. Don't go looking for strings or grandiose arrangements here.Being simple is what makes this album so great! For me, this is among the top-five albums by Willie Nelson. Four stars only because I think that the song choices are somewhat uneven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great disc, bad disc","review":"As a latecomer to the millions who appreciate Willie Nelson's music, I was dazzled by this collection of standards. In fact, I was so dazzled I bought it three times. Not because I wanted it wherever I went -- at home, in my car and on my person -- but because all three of the discs, on the Justice label, proved defective. After replacing the first two discs with new copies, I gave up and exchanged the third for Nelson's \\"Spirit\\" CD, which is interesting but not nearly as riveting for me. I wonder if anybody else has had this problem. I played all the of my \\"Moonlight Becomes You\\" discs on different CD players and they all turned bad, after as few as a half-dozen playings to as many as two dozen. Generally, I have found, Nelson puts out music worth listening to. Too bad the hardware in this case doesn't measure up -- or is this a problem limited to CD stores in Roanoke, VA?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Willie Nelson","review":"Willie Nelson's \\"Moonlight Becomes You\\" is a wonderful cross section of songs with memories.

Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"williefan","review":"The music and songs in this album are terrific but Willie's voice is not. He really struggles to reach and hold notes.

I'm thinking of also purchasing the DVD and presenting a Secretariat set to her. She was disappointed in having missed seeing the movie on the big screen in a theater, so perhaps she'll still experience some of the joy of the story by watching the DVD and, of course, reading this book.

Thanks, Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nack for Writing","review":"I read this work some years back and considered it as I do now the most comprehensive work on the horse. Bill covers not only Secretariat's pedigree in great depth but also Penny's family ancestry, several generations. In so doing, he covers much of 'whos who' in the ancestry of American racing. Bill covers in depth many of Secretariats races, before and after, all the way through the triple crown events afterwhich he seems to soften up, as if the remaining were just mop-up. I wish he would have added additional material covering his days at Claiborne. If one wishes to become a Secretariat aficionado, this is a must read. There are a number of other works out there but this one I believe is the base from which to start. It is a long read so have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Book !!!","review":"This is one of the greatest horse racing story of all time.

It really is helpful only if you own the first book as well--though the style is essentially identical, and the book is of incredibly high quality, this book isn't the exhaustive compilation of Simpsons information that the first one was.

Bork's basic argument is that the government should control people's lives for their own good. He supports censorship. Most of his arguments are made up of quoting George Will and Thomas Sowell (i.e. people who agree with him.) He includes the lyrics of a Nine Inch Nails song to show how terrible America is today, never thinking that the lyrics were a comment of what Trent Reznor feels rather than a glorification of violence. I can't believe that a man of Mr. Borks intellectual stature would be able to seriously say that we only have rights \\"within reason\\" and that puritans like him should determine what is within reason. Read P. J. O'Rourke or Milton Friedman instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarier than the latest King novel for sure!","review":"This book, while mildly entertaining and interesting to read, makes me glad as an American that Bork is not on the Supreme Court.

The problem on campus was exactly as Judge Bork describes it. One could not have a rational discussion with the leftist students. They were morally superior, and just by dedicating myself to defending the Constitution of the United States, I was deemed their inferior intellectually. I was also less advantaged economically than they. We who served will not forget the arrogance we faced.

We can never forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bork's book is based on ideology, not thorough research.","review":"I am a conservative myself, and hoped that Bork's latest offering would provide some keen insights into what truly caused the perceived \\"moral breakdown\\" of society. Instead, Bork gives a hollow diatribe against everything from the Supreme Court to popular music. As an observer of our court system, Bork's findings on the judiciary do have some merit. But his railings against modern music, for example, are baseless. Who's to say, for example, that George Gershwin has more musicianship than all current songwriters? I recently heard Bork refer to Marilyn Manson as \\"gangster rap,\\" proving that his knowledge of basic popular culture is quite lacking"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read for liberals -- what conservatives really think","review":"As a liberal, I found this to be a very good read; Judge Bork sets forth the conservative viewpoint well without mincing words.

I think it was in the 1970's after Richardson and Ruckleshaus both resigned rather than perform the morally repugnant act of firing Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox.

The story was too short to achieve what it set out to do (I read all 3 issues in 15 minutes), with the result that it seemed weak & rushed. The regular characters weren't given enough face time to enable anyone to have a real character arc. And some not-so-regular characters who were built up as a big threat in the series were depicted as incompetent mooks here. There were a smattering of very cool pictures and bits of dialogue scattered throughout this-enough to convince me that a well done comic could do justice to the Firefly 'verse. However, this is not that comic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality bridge","review":"This book covers practically all the inconsistencies between Firefly and Serenity.

'Nuff said there. The comic is intended as a (shaky) bridge between the TV series ending and the movie beginning. Nicely done, excellent artwork, able to capture the look of the series without obsessing on matching them (ever see the Batman movie adaptations? they try so hard to match the movie they miss the opportunity to tell the story in a fresh way). With such a short life-span, Firefly didn't have time to create a market for browncoats with cash burning a hole in their pocket, so the few items like this are great comfort on those cold nights when you look up at the stars and realize Firefly was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. But we were there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic novel does hold its own","review":"Having fallen head over heels in love with the Firefly/Serenity 'verse, I naturally had to buy every book/DVD I could find. Despite the luke-warm reviews of this item, I went for it and was very pleasantly surprised. The art is utterly first rate. The dialogue is very typically Firefly. Both art and writing capture the personalities of the characters. I found the exploration of Mal's inner emotions via subtle facial expression to be most excellent. Perhaps the plotline leaves something to be desired compared to the best of the Firefly episodes, yet it does a fine job in wrapping up a few issues and introducing new ones pre-Serenity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but there could have been more","review":"This provided an nice seguay into the movie. However, it still left a LOT of questions unanswered. This will give you information on why Inara and Book aren't on Serenity at the beginning of the movie.

All in all it is worth the time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"No one is a bigger Joss Whedon fan than me, but I found the 3 graphic novels that supposedly bridge the gap between Firefly and Serenity very disappointing.First of all there is very little story there.

In the end I still didn't understand why Book left the ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, made for merchandising not fans.","review":"Again I have to say this seems to me Mr. Whedon is just putting out some \\"stuff\\" to get the rabid fans to buy and these darkhorse comics fit the bill.The stories felt forced and not up to Firefly standards.I again have to say if Mr Whedon wants to create new stories and real novels, Great!! I'm all for it, but this kind of \\"stuff\\" just leaves a bad taste for the verse he created, and a bad feeling in your pocket.So my advice to Mr.Whedon if your going to do it, do it right, if your gonna keep \\"plopping\\" out this kind of product then do us a favor and just stop the merchandising madness because eventually your franchise will be hurt.This is just my opinion it matters naught in the grand scheme of things, just a way to save some fans some cash and disappointment.seriously turn loose some control, start looking at perspective writers and atleast get intopb or your franchise will suffer.You can call this what you will but it's a comic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift idea","review":"bought these as a gift for xmas for a firefly fan. he loved them so much. got him the whole set the other serenity books as well. they were not as big and thick as I had hoped but he loves them anyway so we are both happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet collection of comic series, only smaller","review":"This is awesome, especially for any Firefly or Serenity fan...really any science fiction fan. The only dislike I had for the product is the size, it is smaller than I was hoping, but not tiny compared to the comic, and the heavier paper is durable, but makes it less like the comic counterpart.

Personally I didn't care for the story enough to care how it ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intro to the Serenity Movie","review":"For those of you who don't know, this comic was written to bridge the gap between Firefly (one of the greatest TV shows of all time) and Serenity (a great movie that continues the firefly story). This comic book does exactly what it is supposed to, it revisits some old familiar characters and leaves you wanting more. If you are not familiar with the Firefly Verse (world) then I suggest watching the TV series, then reading the comic, then watching the movie. The comic won't make much sense any other way and the movie will be much more enjoyable if you understand all aspects of Joss' wonderfully shiney Firefly World. Keep flyin'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Filler","review":"This fills in the gap between the unfortunately short-lived Firefly series and the movie Serenity, and it does the job nicely IMO. Despite a few implausible plot elements I enjoyed the story and would recommend getting this if your a fan of the series or movie. I only own volume 1 because I felt it connected the dots adequately enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect filler between TV series and movie","review":"Quick admission: I'm a huge fan of the Firefly TV series and \\"Serenity\\". I think both were horribly underappreciated, and can't understand why they weren't more successful.This graphic novel was penned by Joss Whedon, so the dialog, tone, and timing are dead on. In many ways, reading Serenity: Those Left Behind is like watching an unaired episode of the TV show. The story deals with the events that take place after the final episode of Firefly: Objects in Space, but before the movie. All of the Serenity crew are in fine form, and even several characters from past episodes show up.The only reason I can't give this book a 5 is the art. I'm not a big fan of the artist. While I can definitely understand the difficulty of drawing a comic based on real people, I've seen better.All in all, a great story, and a must-have for all Firefly/Serenity fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed Firefly fan","review":"Look... I'm a HUGE Firefly fan. It's my favorite tv show of all time. Seriously! However the comic just didn't do anything for me. It's not that it was bad, it was just forgetful and short and uninteresting. I wanted to love it... I wanted to find something to fill the gap since Serenity, but this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bridge story - nothing more, nothing less","review":"I originally got this before Serenity came out in theaters. I'd had people pestering me about Firefly, but never got a chance to see it. I saw the 8-minute preview online, and suddenly wanted to know more.I have to admit, it was confusing until I had the backstory. There's not a lot of explanation for those new to the universe. There isn't a whole lot of earth-shattering plot.There is, however, a bridge between the series and the movie. Why was Book not on Serenity? Now you know. What's with the blue-handed guys? And so on.Another reviewer here said it was like a missing episode from Firefly - and they may be right. This is the link between TV and film.

In my case I wanted a wall phone for the kitchen.This phone is really clunky, and it has a huge piece you attach to your wall jack, then attach the phone base to it. It looks ridiculous, and sticks way out. Very awkward and inconvenient.I even called the company to see how to wall mount this phone and they told me I must use the big piece that came with it.THIS IS NOT A WALL PHONE in spite of the description that says it is.I feel I was just ripped off for $20. It's not worth paying $8 to ship it back, but makes me hesitant to buy from Amazon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume problems","review":"This phone isn't all bad but it's verging on unusable for me. It's a disaster dialing with a headset on, because the touch tones you hear when you dial will deafen you if you set the volume as high as you need to hear the recipient of your call. In many cases the volume simply can't be raised high enough and you can't have a conversation without switching phones. My headset works fine with a similar phone by another maker, and the problem applies without the headset too. Major design flaws include the absence of a mute button and a one-touch volume control instead of separate +/- volume keys. The one-touch key cycles through 3 or 4 volume settings and doesn't display where you are, so you never know if the volume is at max, and so that if you hit the button to hear someone better they are as likely to grow fainter as grow louder, which makes you miss more of what they're saying and infuriates you in the meantime."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be ZERO stars","review":"I used the phone for a few weeks, then put it away for a few weeks. When I charged it up to use again, it did not work. I called the customer service number on the phone and got a totally unrelated company who never even heard of these people. So I found a tech support email address on their home page (tech support for the phone, not the page's webmaster, I do know the difference)After a week when there was no response, I bought a new battery and charged it. Still nothing. That was several months ago and still no response from the support email either. It is obvious these people will try to weasel out of the warrantee by not ever finding out what is wrong with the phone. While I pursue it, I bought and am using an AT&T cordless phone.

It does exactly what it says it does. I think it's especially useful when you also have the remington precision trimmer for the smallest details."},{"rating":"2","title":"so easy to use","review":"What a great product! It makes trimming so simple and easy. It is a trimmer, not a shaver, but without the attachment, it really does trim very close. No more razor bumps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There May Be Blood","review":"Pros: Cute, small, several length selectionsCons: There is only a guard on one side of the blades. That may be fine if you want a \\"long\\" trim, but if you're trying to get something a tad shorter, watch out! It's fairly easy to cut yourself - pain and blood in that sensitive of an area is UNCOOL. I would advise getting a trimmer in which the blades are fully covered by a guard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted through 2 battery changes","review":"At first this seems like an awesome deal: you get a product that works well for a very low price. The only drawback is that it only lasted through two battery changes, and it doesn't take long to use up the batteries.

I've been using it for 3+ years now and I couldn't be happier. I use it without the attachment for a close, but not too close, shave. It keeps the area clean but not bare. I paid full price back when it first came out and thought it was a deal then. I just noticed it on Amazon.com for $[...] and decided to buy a second for my boyfriend. He is constantly trying to steal mine. It works great on his chest and it's hastle free. It takes just seconds and the clean up is a breeze. Don't think about it, just buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"So far I have liked this product. The shortest setting allows you to cut the hair about 1/4 of a inch and the longest probably about 1 inch long.

The comb attachment keeps the hair kinda long. Without it, you can get a pretty close trim. Rememeber it is NOT a shaver but a trimmer. Its not meant to make you hairless. Its just what I wanted. It comes with a little brush to wipe clean the blades and a storage bag to keep it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"I have owned this model in the past (loved it) and recently bought a new one.

After a girl named \\"Bunny\\" puts mustard on her boyfriends hot dog (he deserved it), he chases her but she gets away, right into the hands of Jon Hall (former Ramar of the Jungle) who is dressed up as a monster. It seems he resents the surf set for distracting his son from the scientific work which ole dad had planned for him. This is hokey stuff with bad acting, bad writing horrible music (although written by Chairman of the Board, Jr.) and girls whose wild bikinis are sometimes a little too stuffed. Still, its worth a look just for laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book not to miss!","review":"The book opens a new way of looking into spiritual, mystical and stages of human development (history and order within society). It gives fresh comparison of the works of great minds and theories all throughout the history in the above mentioned 3 areas. This is done in subjects such as philosophycal, social, religious and political domains of knowledge. Its main source of reference is the Writings of Baha'u'llah (being studied more and more all over the world). The book is very condensed as it covers in a unified manner all of these areas. I highly recommend it to whoever has interest of reading in the themes mentioned above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Poorly written and unsystematic, this work is an attempt to analyse the Baha'i writings in new ways. Although there are some interesting sections, these are lost amongst rambling excursions into flights of hyperbolic fancy.

I like these liners so much I purchased them for my whole truck, front, middle and back. Just looking at the dirt I track inside I still haven't used the stock mats.UPDATE May 2011: I still have them in my truck four years later. They are still flexible and good as the day I installed them. Toyota recently did a safety recall on my truck. There may be potential floor mat interference with the gas pedal. Not with these Weather Tech mats. These mats are molded and lay flat on the carpet floor. No curling on the edges and no chance of interfering with the gas pedal.

I think I will just send them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased the G-30 hoping for increased range over FRS radios. Unfortunately, I found little if any difference. In fact, FRS radios (Motorola FR60) actually performed better from a range standpoint on some occasions. I even went to the trouble to send the units to Midland to have them checked. They did so and reported that they were ok.I can see only two reasons to purchase The G-30; advertised increased range, and gmrs channel capability. With range being most important on my list, I felt they were not worth keeping.By the way, I recently used the Motorola FR60's on a trip into the Grand Canyon. They provided line of sight communication at a distance of over 15 miles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Range","review":"I bought this radio because I wanted the 5 mile range.

I now have many times more the seeds to plant in the spring and I will be looking forward to another beautiful show of jewel toned flowers.

I live on a farm at least 7 miles away from any tornado sirens, so it's VERY important that my family is protected from bad weather. I don't feel safe with this product in my home.

The display is very large and easy to read, and it backlits automatically for a while after a botton is pressed, so the display can be read easily at night. It also has a digital time, date, and temperature display, and two alarm clocks. It also comes with rechargeable batteries and a charger, so there's no hidden battery cost.This radio is strictly a weather radio, which means it can't receive any other radio stations. It can't tell you the current weather or forcast up front: you have to keep listening to the local weather station broadcast until it got to the desired topic, which might take a few minutes. Also the button functions are not very intuitive, and it took me quite a while to get familiar with it.Overall, a must-have for outdoor people."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for picking up signals and being local.a very good item","review":"I just Got this Weatheradio from Amazon and its a really great deal, especially for the price that Amazon is selling it at. it seems to pick up the broadcast recption very well compared to my old all area alert Portable weatheradio that couldnt wher this one can. with this weatheradio I can set the weatheradio only to pick up an alert if its for the county I am in Instead of receiving an alert that isn't for my area. for instance, severe weather that could be 50 mles away which my old portable would alert me for. There was no need for me to have to hear severe weather broadcasts that weren't for my area . I am really glad I got this weatheradio.

One would hope that it would have been better edited technically. Still, it's better than the other choices out there, some of which I've been very disappointed in.The text was organized well, and was surprisingly easy to study, especially considering the subject matter.

Most importantly you will not be able to truly understand the material, much less apply it. In order to be able to do the job, read Bill Burton's \\"Remote Access for Cisco Networks\\". Bill Burton's book is excellent, very clear and coherent.One more tip, all remote access books I looked at miss one important piece - they do not explain the complete set of interrelationships between serial interfaces, asynchronous interfaces, lines, controllers, vtys, ttys, etc. Therefore you need to read introduction section from \\"Cisco IOS 12.0 Dial Solutions\\". It is a horrible read and you will have to fight through it. Read it five times, if you have to.

This item is the answer to our prayers. It works amazingly on MOST bagels. It works better on firm bagels or semi frozen bagels. The softer bagels tend to get squished a bit, but they still get cut. Another flaw is that there is no tray to catch the crumbs. This can make cutting bagels very messy (especially with poppyseed bagels). To fix this, we just put a few layers of aluminum foil around the base. It doesn't look pretty, but it works. If you cut a lot of bagels, this is for you! If you don't...

My husband claims they \\"moosh\\" the bagels more than cut them, but he does not heat his to a crisp crust (so keep that in mind if you like a soft crust). My complaint about this is that it is virtually impossible to clean if you do not have a dishwasher. I have tried every sponge and scrubber out there and nothing works. If it is flat and narrow enough to fit between the blade and the clear plastic around it, the blade catches it and stops it from moving. It literally cannot be hand-washed to any acceptable cleanliness (and we aren't that picky....). Fantastic item if you have a dishwasher to put the whole thing in every time you use it. Unless you have soft bagels."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 years strong","review":"On average we buy a bakers dozen twice a month and use our bagel guillotine to cut all of the bagels at once and then freeze them. The blade is still fine after 3 years, safe for kids to use, easy to wash (one poster claims to put it in the dishwasher but I thought it says not dishwasher safe on the box and I haven't risked it), I hand wash after each use. It would be great if they had a way to catch crumbs, but it already saves so much time and takes a second to wipe up 50 sesame seeds. I love this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not feeling the love","review":"I don't get it. We just can't slice a bagel with this w/o mashing it.

I needed something so my girlfriend or my son wouldn't hear the game at night. Now they can't hear it (and I can't hear here complain about me playing games!)The in-game sound: Nothing short of INCREDIBLE! The 5.1 adds so many levels to the game (I play 1st person shooters...COD4, BF:Bad Company). Sounds nobody else can here, you can hear exactly where the shots are coming from....Movies: I tested it also with a movie in my xbox.

I talked this over with tech support and apparently it works for playing DVD's, which I have tried and it DOES work for this, and sounds pretty good.

The surround sound works but the bass is terrible. I compared them to my old 50 dollar sony headphones and while they don't have surround sound I prefer them for my gaming. The guns and grenades in any shooting game sound pretty bad compared to my cheaper headphones, it's a shame because if these headphones had even decent bass they would be incredible...but they don't.If you have never played games using another set of headphones maybe you won't mind but I cannot recommend buying the AX360 5.1 as I completely regret my purchase, get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Directionality is there, but not really a \\"mini 5.1\\"","review":"Purchased this as a compact, wallet-friendly solution to my problem: I have an X360 console and an LCD monitor but no speakers. I wanted directionality and immersion in that order. This is a reasonably priced option in that you do get the directionality, but not quite 5.1 sound. Front left/right sounds like center. Rear left/right sound proper and center is center. I do like the active rumble that emulates bass. As you go lower and lower in frequency sound is more felt than heard and its that sensation that bassheads are after, so this is a natural and innovative solution. For the purposes of gaming, I like it.The connectors can be a little on the loose side. I do wish the connectors were a little tighter. The item isn't hefty and the DAC/AMP unit (the smaller box in the photo) is surprisingly lightweight. Not surprising though, seeing as how its just a single PCB in a plastic enclosure.4 stars.

On top of that the control box is lousy. Sometimes, even though you have adjusted the sound previously, when you first turn them on you get sound at full blast just about blowing your ear drums out. Setting the volume just right is hard too. The cheap plastic on the earphones are weak and these things broke pretty quickly too. I have gone back to the stereo sound of TurtleBeach X1 while I wait for a better surround sound headphone option. I miss the 3D sound, but there has to be a better option that this product. It is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones","review":"If you can't get these to work with your 360 you either have a core system or some other problem.

You will hear your friends through both ears now instead of having one ear covered by an inferior headset.

First and foremost the sound quality is outstanding compared to my turtle beach headsets, I realize I am losing the convenience of wireless but to me it's worth the better sound and comfort. I love the individual dials to control sound volume for front, center, rear and bass channels. The included mixer unit is also nice because of it's ability to decode the dolby surround sound from my xbox via optical cable and distribute that so I can use 5.1 computer speakers when not using the headset.All in all, very good bang for the buck here, I am officially a converted Tritton fan now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK!!!","review":"I have to admit that these headphones look nice.

I recall reading about significant delays with this movie being released and problems on the set with Rick Rubin. It should have been a better movie with the caliber of rap stars they had. But by 1988 Run-DMC's fame was wading and their careers were starting to fade out a little in the late '80s. Nowadays, 50 cent gets a 30 million dollar movie budget and top notch promotion on all these shows and magazines.

If you had a book that referred to having an all white movie weekend-only white actresses, only white directors, I think the author would be called to task.To say for example that Richard Gere is a perfect actor because he would never kiss a black woman. Yet it is ok if it is Denzel Washoington never kissing a white woman. A true example of a double standard here. I think this author can not get beyond her own racism to write the story.

OK, so her sister Joyce is different. Why not. But this book has the taste of so many other sequels - never as good as the first one. However, I felt cheated. Foul play, Ms. Cleage! You can't take us back to Idlewild and pretend that Ava, Eddie and especially Imani never existed. Why not make up a whole new character and place then? I haven't finished the book yet, have about a third left to go, but it is already too late, I've already spent too much time waiting for Imani and Ava to show up. There isn't even an explanation as to what happened to them, nothing.

I can't wait to get my hands on \\"Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do\\".Take some time and enjoy Cleage's brand of reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is a misnomer. Spoonfeeder.","review":"The title of this book makes you think you're about to read about a character that is attempting to feel a little more free - maybe adding some spice to the love life and other spicier thing - but that's really not the case. The character instead spends a lot of time trying to help troubled women in her community, which is quite noble - just not something somebody necessarily does with a red dress on.The reason the story must go this way is so that Ms. Cleage can take the time to spoonfeed the reader on how they should feel about the city of Idlewild, black culture, and black women. Some of the very uncreative dialogue among the characters is so overopinionated and irrelavant that I think even Ms. Cleage might have forgotten at times what her book is supposed to be about. The love exchange that happens (but never really goes far enough) is the highlight for me.I must also add that the rushed ending also does the book little justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reader reviews Red Dress...","review":"While the author states this is not a sequel to \\"What Looks Like Crazy on An Ordinary Day\\", she returns us to Idlewild Michigan and a familiar main character named Joyce. The story is one that many women face; that inability to let go of past hurt and open themselves up to be free. The characters are all very colorful and well-described. However, the town minister kind of throws the reader for a loop, completely contradicting what one would imagine a 'Southern Baptist Minister' to be. This minister takes some of the credibility away from an otherwise believable story, by HER radical New South approach to ministering to her congregation. All in all the book is a very good read and certain to lead to great book discussions. A definite RECOMMEND."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wish I had A Red Dress","review":"Great Book. I enjoyed the book because there were so many instances where I thought about myself and how I compared. Example, was I able to do all the items listed to be an independent women.Joyce showed me another way of thinking about young women who have made bad choices in life.I saw Joyce as being a very together women. She was secure in herself. Confident, yet open for love and a good relationship. It was refreshing to me to know that there are women out there who have only been with one man in their life.After Terry McMillan's first, I began thinking I was a bit strange.There were so many lessons to be learned from this novel about life and relationships.I particularly enjoyed the way Joyce taught the young ladies to think critically and make their own decisions.I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to women of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Summer Read...","review":"I thought this book was very well written with a cast of interesting characters, witty on-liners, and cleaver dialog. Cleage's writing style is truly enlightening and inspiring - she focuses on \\"life issues\\" like self-love/acceptance, courage/inner strength, and self reliance - delivering messages through the scenarios and characters in Idlewild. Although I would have liked her to have deeper defined the concept of the \\"free woman\\" and the shared more background of some of the supporting cast, like the Lattimores, Sister, and the twins...but perhaps that's for another book. Overall, it was a great summer read with a happy ending.

It's a great book for book clubs."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Colorful, Creative, and Captivating!\\"","review":"Cleage's return to Idlewild, Michigan produces a beautiful treat for readers. As somewhat of a sequel to What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day, I Wish I had a Red Dress gives a closer view into the life of Joyce Mitchell, a widow and community leader with a passion for speaking up for those who seem to have no voice.The Sewing Circus, a girls' group founded by Joyce, is in danger of losing its government funding while many local youngsters seem to be losing their minds. With what seems to be the weight of the world on her shoulders and the longing to have those shoulders caressed, Joyce allows her faith to waver.If you are ever in Idlewild and see a hodgepodge of young women with their children in a frenzy, Joyce is certainly not far. And if you see a tall, dark, and handsome Black male near, then that might just be . . . You'll have to read the book to get that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Library time","review":"Borrow it from the library, do not purchase. Not this author's best effort.

I haven't read the previous book about the main character's sister, so I came in with the expectations of reading a light hearted book about women and possibly fashion judging from the title, instead I got a book with highs and lows and discussing conepts such as gangs, drugs, domestic violence, loss, fear, respect, and raising oneself and others out of hopelessness. It was a very enjoyable read.

Then she started a nonprofit agency called the Sewing Circus for women with issues. Where's the connection?Sorry.

VERY unreliable. Frequent write failures, drive keeps disconnecting itself which causes the device to become \\"dirty\\" and it needs to be error checked. Last error check took over 8 hours due to frequent disconnects which meant I had to keep starting the process over. I haven't used the software since the day I installed it. Software autostarts when drive is powered on and sometimes hangs up which causes the drive to, you guessed it, hang up. The only way to break the hang-up is to power off and on the drive, which causes it to become dirty and starts the error checking again.

Turn the gain all the way up and low end diminishes. It sounded like a Line 6 modeling amp with the metal settings on high.This pedal is cheap and may work better on a solid state amp, I never tried it. Some of Danelectro's pedals are gimmicky.

As you use the videos again, and again, you can begin to anticipate the different parts of the session.

Then we found the temperature was way off. Eventually, oil was able to get into the control housing and that is the end of that. It's dead. It's a disappointment in that we enjoyed the fryer in the beginning and it was an upgrade from a cheaper plastic-cased fryer.

I do like the deep fryer in general, it does not take to long to heat back up to temperature in between frys and you can actually bake quit a bit of food in one time. Which is great for our family of 5.The only thing I do not like is that you have to take the cover off completely to put the food in or take it out. When you for example put frozen fries in it splatters and you have to be quick not to get it on yourself plus the cover has oil all over it and when you put it somewhere that area will get greasy too.I also feel that this fryer is a little easier to clean (compared to some previous ones we had) just because it does not have a lot of complicated parts or corners etc. You can just take the heating element out and the container comes out to clean in the sink.Overall I think we made a good choice and I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fryer","review":"After opening the box and cleaning the product as per the instructions I filled it with the recommended oil and went at it for some fantastic onion rings.

The charactures came to life, I could feel Dale's conflicting feelings concerning Jonny and I could put a face to all the the remaining cast. Marcus shows a genuine insight into the relationships between the various law enforcement agencies involved and the interaction with the military types. In the end I like the way he points out it's not the agency you are with it's who you are, the preperation and effort required to excel. I like the way respect was earned and not given and the seriousconsequences when you don't realize you don't have all the answers. Bottom line it was pure Marcus Wynn, no better way to spend an afternoon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"What a great book. If you are at all interested in thrillers, special operations or just a good read with very interesting and thought out characters. Story is familiar but unique and is absolutely a page turner. Marcus Wynne has two other books that are also highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book, Great Introduction to Marcus Wynne","review":"Been years since I read this, but I still remember the scene where Jonny Maxwell turns the tables on the various law enforcement agencies hunting him down. Top notch.Well written, awesome pacing, great story. Why isn't there a movie of this yet? Actually, there is, kind of. In 2003, there was a movie called The Hunted, directed by William Friedkin and starring Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro. That movie is very much in the vein/style of No Other Option, but the book is much better. If you're the type of person who likes to wait for the movie version of a book instead of reading it, my advice is to watch The Hunted and if you like it and are curious to see an even more intense story along the same lines, check out No Other Option.Then you'll be hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Miller: why is he even in the book","review":"All he do is sit there listen to others talk, pretend to be cool and then have a lot of sex. At the end he even fail to capture or kill Jonny but saved by her girlfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wynne is a winner.","review":"I've read truckloads of thrillers. Most of them are pretty standard fare and follow a basic formula. The end is almost never in doubt. But it's not about the destination, it's about the journey and Marcus Wynne takes the reader on a very suspenseful and exciting one with No Other Option.Some may say that the characters lack significant depth and they would be right. But let's face it, this isn't Pulitzer winning material. If that's what your looking for look elsewhere. For me, the characters are as fleshed out as they need to be.I rank Mr. Wynne right up there with my favorites in this genre, most notably Stephen Hunter. I can't wait to read Warrior in the Shadows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to a Reader in South America","review":"As a former \\"partner\\" of Marcus, I would like to say that he is a very talented, honest individual. To \\" A Reader In South America,\\" I would offer a different perspective of females in law enforcement. If there are so few that are attractive, why is it so typical that their partners feel a need to either protect them or engage in other activities with them, most often both?

It is well written and gives us the credibility that we deserve.Great job, Marcus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"This was given as a gift to someone who has enjoyed Steven Fry in QI the Series and Hugh Laurie in Black Adder.

The period detail is amazing, especially the whiz-bang use of that period's slang, the \\"lingo franco\\" of the day. Plus, hey, Fry and Laurie!My only real complaint is that the farce can get repetitive, although maybe it was never intended that this entire series be viewed in one week's time. Also, minor quibble, after watching every episode, I still have no idea who some of these characters are. I am certain that more clever viewers than I will like this show all the more for knowing who's who."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeeves and Wooster review","review":"This is so much fun! if you love PG Wodehouse, Hugh Laurie, or anything British it doesn't get better than this! Lot of light hearted, good clean fun and nonsense. What a perfect twit Bertie is, and Stephen Fry as Jeeves is superb. Lots of wonderful English locations, terrific casting and acting. I think you will enjoy it much more if you have read some of the books or short stories by Wodehouse, so you are in on the basic working mode of Jeeves, the power of the Aunts, and the cluelessness of Bertie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and witty","review":"Started reading Wodehouse for the first time this year, and became an addict. This series perfectly captures the wit and feel of the novels, even if details get tweaked to make the stories work visually.I was a little disappointed when they swapped out actors for Gussie in the 3rd season since the actor who played him in the first two seasons was superb. (I must have replayed the scene where Gussie mimics the male newt's courting dance 50 times and brayed like a donkey every time.)Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are perfection as Bertie and Jeeves; their expressions and timing - well, everything they do - are a delight. By the way, this set is worth the price just for the side-splitting cow creamer episodes, which Wodehouse wrote in \\"The Code of the Woosters.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic!","review":"In my opinion, this is the most consistently funny British comedy team since Monty Python! Laurie and Fry could not have been cast more perfectly as Wooster and Jeeves respectively. Simon Langton (who also directed the superb BBC version of Pride & Prejudice) does a stunning job on the first season and he may be the best director that the series encountered. However, I highly recommend all of the DVDs - I always pull out Jeeves and Wooster when I need a pick-me-up. Family and friends have also caught the Wooster bug and are watching the episodes voraciously! As a side note, fans of \\"House\\" (which also stars Hugh Laurie) will be impressed with the actor's range - Bertie Wooster is a total about face from Gregory House but equally as watchable! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like a bootleg DVD series, grainy picture quality, color poor","review":"This is a very disappointing edition.

Wodehouse. The setting and backgrounds are beautiful and the writing is excellent, especially in the episodes which were drawn from multiple stories. The true masterpiece of this series is the acting of the two lead characters. Stephen Fry's work has flown under the radar in every instance and his portrayal of Jeeves ranks with the great comedy character depictions. Hugh Laurie is equally brilliant. Those who only know him as House seriously need to watch him as Bertie Wooster. After that they should check him out in Blackadder and A Bit of Fry and Laurie. I can't watch him as House because it is such a step down from the brilliance of his performance as Wooster. I also can't take the American accent, it doesn't do him justice in his ability to steep any sentence with layers of nuance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain funny.","review":"We have watched Jeeves and Wooster for years and have thoroughly enjoyed the episodes.To now have the complete series is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"about this show","review":"As soon you will understand british english it will be very funny.

The problem is that the show's theme song is so catchy that if you are at all like me, it will stick in your head, repeat itself dozens if not hundreds of times a day, and even interfere with your sleep!And the theme song is the BACKGROUND music for the show and keeps being played in most scenes! NOT GOOD!Alas, the DVDs, like the VCR tapes, do NOT have closed captioning, so there is no way of avoiding having the jingly, ear-fetching, tune bore into one's skull!I'm an avid P.G. Wodehouse reader and love the humor, comedy, and wonderful timing of this duo, but the music overwhelms the pleasure!Why, oh why, did they not put closed captioning on these? Can the IDA apply here? Can they be forced to to open this up to the hard of hearing? And help the rest of us who'd rather not hear the music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Puzzling New/Old Release","review":"The eight discs that clock in at a hefty 1150 minutes of wry British wit that stars Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry is a puzzling (re)release on a pair of critical areas: there is nothing new from the complete series that was issued in 2002 and the transfer to disc remains \\"iffy,\\" which plagued its initial appearance in the marketplace.Laurie portrays Bertram Wilberforce \\"Bertie\\" Wooster - the bumbling, dimwitted aristocrat - and Fry is the witty valet, Reginald Jeeves, in the series that is based on Sir P.G. Wodehouse's \\"Jeeves and Wooster\\" stories. The 23 episodes appeared on the ITV network from April 1990 to June 1993 and feature bossy aunts, romantic scrapes and a number of friends who just can't stay out of mischief.Hopefully there are plans for a definitive set and this repackaging of a prior release is a bridge to that end. Though the shows were outstanding, there needs to be a serious production makeover to make for a solid collectible for fans of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A&E Continues to distribute bad quality products","review":"Jeeves & Wooster is an awesomely funny series. Sadly, A&E; just can't seem to put out a decent quality product.

In reality they're only cementing their reputation as a company that doesn't care about their customers.

Wodehouse. And here you can immerse yourself in his greatest creations--Wooster and Jeeves. My wife and I have regularly wended our ways through these delicious and droll comedies, ever since they first appeared on PBS 17 years ago. Been through the series six or eight times so far. The earlier episodes tend to be stronger. Because of these shows, we find ourselves unable to watch Hugh Laurie on House and take him seriously--because we know that somewhere inside that irascible, misanthropic M.D. is a sweet, inept, clumsy British twit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply..... my most favorite series ever","review":"This is truly one of the best series I've ever had the pleasure of watching. I covet it as my most favorite - the Jeeves and Wooster characters are absolutely impeccable and bloody hilarious!

Wodehouse was a genius and the man who put this together for tv was incredible!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series, Great Price","review":"Buying the complete series is a much better value than buying seasons individually. Whether you are familiar with the books or not, I think anyone can like this series, especially if you like the genre of British humor.

This is a particular negative for this series becuase there is a lot of clever word play, but the accents and sound quality make it diffuclt to always fully capture."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I believe so, sir.\\"","review":"You have to have a certain taste for Wodehouse's made-up world of total dodo-aristocrats. I find the plots quite funny albeit a little formulaic. Having watched a few of these, it is impossible to read the original stories without hearing Stephen Fry's voice as Jeeves. (For example, \\"No, sir\\" now acquires his unique intonation.) Separating Jeeves from Fry is like trying to imagine Rumpole as someone other than Leo McKern, that is, impossible. And reconciling Hugh Laurie's Wooster with his House is an interesting exercise in suspension of disbelief (which I happily engage in weekly).This set contains a lot of Jeeves and Wooster. I figure to watch it over a period of a year or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugh Laurie's comic past returns!","review":"For those who have just discovered Hugh Laurie as the nasty doc in \\"House\\" and for those who have always loved his comic gems, this is a wonderful series. Laurie and Stephen Fry were a great comedy team...their timing is priceless. And the P.G. Wodehouse stories are masterpieces of construction with amazing characters like Gussie Fink-Nottle and Roderick Spode. A real treat.

She recites the clues she uses to put it together as she goes along and when it is completed we use the cardboard children as little dolls and walk them through the fair. Plenty of other small creatures from her collection visit the completed puzzle and make their way down the winding paths to the various rides and games.

Back and forth. Back and forth. It just got boring. Then comes the \\"Twist\\" ending, which everyone will see coming. By the end, I was just a little annoyed with this film, so I can't give it three stars. More like 2.5.Bruce Campbell is in it for maybe a minute at the end, but he is the best thing in it.Also, in the pantheon of super strong serial killers, this guy has got to be one of the strongest.

This book deals with the internal conflicts one faces with race, identity, love and life.

The theme of colonialism is present throughout the book and gives the reader a first hand look at what happens when two different cultures merge. What captured by heart in this book is Adah's determination in life. With each turning page one goes through the hardships of her life. Your heart yerns for everything to work out in the end.

I was trying to replace an older remote that is no longer available, and even though it is in disrepair the older one still works better than this one.Main complaint is that when you select a device that you want to communicate with it only stays with that device for 1 button push. Then you have to select the device again. That is a real pain in the butt.I thought maybe that I just needed to select the right codes for my devices since it didn't seem to be working as I thought it should, but that was a big mistake.

As such, Vineland -- ostensibly a critique of Reagan-era snitch-destruction of the sons and daughters of the idealistic 60s -- avoids a lot of the harpy, pedantic ranting you'd expect and instead weaves together a lurid, transglobal set of normal and paranormal events, bizarre characters (good and evil) and inventive dialogue, all linked with breathtakingly clear, page-long sentences that have the effect of a bomb going off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad english","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all. Although there may have been some hope for the story line, the writing style put an end to any enjoyment for me.

I found myself spending more time trying to decipher the meaning of 'dis' and 'dat', dat I forget what I was reading about.We picked this book for our book club, no one liked it.

Still, he cannot be beat word-for-word play (keep your eyes peeled for the \\"slimebag\\" reference) and there is no end to his strange humor and laid back characterization. The mainstreaming of this late-eighties novel makes you wonder about lashback to his older prose style (V., Gravity's Rainbow) in \\"Mason and Dixon\\". Not only worth the read, worth to buy and just have around as it is one of the few truly poignant social commentaries on the end of the \\"baby-boom/ greed-driven/ hippy sell out\\" shift into the nineties (whatever they might be considered to be)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing read","review":"This has become one of my favorite books.

Taking you all over the map of the west coast, and several decades to boot, it has an ethereal quality which masks the quick gut-shots it delivers like a one-two punch. Scenes of dark passage followed by moments of startling clarity and epiphany, no easy answers for anyone but a long winding trail that is still followed to this very day. Tracing the route our country has taken in the last forty years with anecdotal excursions on the side, Vineland holds portent for the years to come.Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"M-Pact Glove","review":"bought these for motorcycle riding.

Period.That said, the film editing leaves something to be desired. With six cameramen you'd think that the film editor/director could have chosen the best possible angle and used that. But no. Often its merely a snippet of a blistering guitar solo as the point of view changes every three seconds. And while one can appreciate the attempt to capture the full sonic affect of an Opeth song by fast cutting to various band members, at times the affect is to wonder why you are hearing a guitar lead but not seeing it.So Opeth gets a 6 (out of 5) for music, the director gets a 4 (out of 6) for visuals. You can do the math. And despite my minor quibble, this is an incredible document of a staggering performance.

She's visibly good at her job -- shows competence, doesn't just tell you she's good.This is well-written for genre -- it's not gushy or annoyingly repetitive, characters maintain consistent voices, and the prose style doesn't get in the way of enjoying the plot. Does it have the depth of, say, a V.I. Warshawski story? No. But it's about fashion. Pretty clothes. Pretty people. Pretty sets.

It didn't. Instead, Green spun a convoluted plot that made absolutely no sense. Worse still, this book was in serious need of a good editor. There were some glaring errors. The dialogue was hokey and irritating at best. Green tried to keep her characters current with making pop culture references from 2001-2002. Most of the time it came off as a middle-aged surburban parent trying to capture urban lingo. It didn't work. And some of the references were tasteless- like the reference to R&B singer Aaliyah's death (which was mispelled). All of this I could have overlooked had there been a good story with a good mystery (seeing that it is in the mystery genre).

There is not a bad song on the album. He shows his confidence in his faith in the song titled \\"When The Devil Wants To Wrestle\\", one of my favorites.

It is a moving and telling script.The son is a gay set designer for the Met in New York. He's heavy into Wagner (and the play calls for lot's of Wagner background music). He loves his parents, but they really haven't accepted his orientation. He loves his sister dearly. She is married to a geneticist and is a committed pro-choice, pro-gay liberal. She gets pregnant and her husband and she have a genetics test to tell them about the baby. It's almost certainly going to be left-handed, intelligent, a boy, and gay.Hmmmm...maybe it's time to have an abortion...The resolution is powerful and moving...and you may not like the end if you saw the cable movie.This is superb theatre reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"Prior to reading this book I had an ambivilent view towards abortion.

Whatever your position is on life vs death pre-birth - read this book and be prepared to be emotionally moved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncle Tom's Clinic","review":"Uncle Tom's Clinic, by Jay Mikes, is an explosive look at the issue of abortion. It also deals with the hopes, desires, and frustrations of couples waiting to adopt a baby. The characters in this story are so believable that they may remind you of people you already know. You might even shed a tear or two as they face life changing problems. You may also be encouraged as they struggle with their convictions and beliefs. This book brings the political and moral issues of abortion out in the open. Uncle Tom's Clinic is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual with many layers; lasts forever","review":"This is not a fragrance that you'll find on just anyone; it's unusual and not imitative of anything else that I know of. It's super-green to start (maybe even over-powering for some), but quickly dries down to more of a floral-green (green being secondary). I have to say, this fragrance lasts forever! It's unreal; I can go all day with one spritz. Amazon has the lowest price that I can find. BTW, 3.4 oz is a pretty big bottle and will last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"I just finished reading this book. There are some good stories in it. For example, the story about the joke Reagan liked to tell--about the extremely optimistic kid trying to find a pony in a pile of manure--\\"There must be a pony in here somewhere.\\" The story conveys the optimism demonstrated by Reagan throughout his presidency. The other great story was about how \\"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\\" worked its way into the Reagan speech at Berlin Wall couple years before it really collapsed. The author himself was the speech writer, and he gave detailed account of how it was drafted, shaped, and finally delivered in its now well-known form. The better stories like the above appear in the first half of the book however. Overall I enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young People Grab It","review":"This is a must read, especialy for young people.

Reagan, his wife Nancy, and much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Reagan Primer","review":"As the pundits and revisionists attempt to rewrite the history of his presidency, those who know Reagan continue to demontstrate the effect this great man had on them and history. This book is an excellent introduction into how Reagan the Man affected Reagan the President. Through examples of how Reagan handled his life, his staff and his faith, Mr. Robinson gives us insight into the inner world of Ronald Reagan. His rock solid faith and conviction flowed through events both personal and public, and changed the very course of history. I will most certainly be buying Reagan's memoir to get more perspective on a man who is without a doubt one of the great presidents of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, fizzled at the end","review":"This is a good story about how Ronald Reagan \\"the man\\" behaved as Ronald Reagan \\"the President.\\" There are some interesting stories, amusing anecdotes and plenty of moral lessons. I enjoyed the first half of this book, but felt it really fizzled out in the middle and dragged on at the end. It was almost as if the author lost interest and had to fill some extra pages.I bought it after hearing Peter Robinson doing a radio interview and was really looking forward to a great read. Unfortunately, the anecdotes I enjoyed most I had already heard in his radio interview.The title is the true story - How Ronald Reagan changed Peter Robinson's life. While interesting, not worth the money for hardcover.

I can honestly say this book made me a better person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Touching Enough","review":"I was worried about this book because like all of the books I've read on Reagan, it really fails to introduce us to the man. We get to see the legend part, but I feel that we need to know more about the man. I was deeply touched during the Reagan years and I became interested in politics, but I need to see the man in his element. Try a different book on Reagan. You'll be glad to skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"I read an average of 2 books per week, and of the 100 or so I've read in the past year this is without a doubt my favorite. What I particularly enjoyed about this book is that it isn't another history lesson on how R.R. ended the cold war. It's a character study of two people, the President and the author, and how a young man is forever changed by his association with the President. There is some history in there, but it doesn't give that \\"text book\\" feel. This is a truly engrossing story and you will find it very difficult to put this book down. When you're finished you'll feel good about Ronald Reagan, Peter Robinson, your country and yourself. Read this book, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a phenomenal book!","review":"Peter Robinson's book gets at who Ronald Reagan really was in a way that none of the other Reagan bios really do.

He tried it on and said it was too tight, so jokingly I tried it on (I wear a men's medium) and the arms were just about right on me. The body of the sweatshirt is probably a small 2x, but the arms and arm holes are way too small.

If you want grabbing, try Hefties \\"Hefty Gripper Tall, 13 Gallon Kitchen Bags, Case Pack, Six - 40 Count Boxes (240 Bags).

I found this CD in a bin or CD's being given away outside a record store in Brooklyn. It appears that Gallo's 15 minutes might be almost over, but it has appeared to be the case before. I wonder, how a record with less creativity could be created? The recordings are horrible, the writing pathetic and the instrumentation only serves as an instrument of ego. But where does it all come from? It seems like something tragic must have happened to Gallo as a small boy, and he intends to sucker middle America into thinking his falsified pain is art. Buy a Damiel Johnston CD and stay away from this. The more quickly we ignore him, the sooner it will stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you deaf?","review":"This album is the worst thing I have ever heard.

Vincent is talented and the labels of egomanical or narcissitic is unfair. I think he is a man ahead of his time and he will be appreciated when he's dead which happens to many true artist. But maybe he should stick with acting, directing and painting. Music is not his area to shine in."},{"rating":"2","title":"When","review":"I was not sure what a Vincent Gallo music album would sound like.

It's original, touching and very much a surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"You people have got to be kidding...","review":"Ok, yeah, I liked Buffalo '66. I also sort of like the instrumental noodling tracks on this album. That's about where this thing stops, though. This is Vincent Gallo doing what all musicians do when they're bored, and then selling it to you and receiving 5 star reviews. Half the songs sound like someone screwing around on the keyboard with a background loop, and really, they're not so bad. The rest, though, feature good old Prince Vince singing. The tone and quality of his voice aren't terrible, but his lyrics sound like second graders writing love notes back and forth. It's really impossible to listen to, simply because I cannot get over how horrible the words are. The guy makes music like he paints. Dull, inane and lifeless. \\"Most beautiful recording ever made\\"? Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather amateur","review":"I wanted to like this album, but I don't.

Very talented man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Interesting Music...","review":"Basically i stumbled upon Vincent Gallo's music about a year ago, somewhere on the internet, and i was instantly taken by it. I have never seen a single one of his movies so this review isnt based on how good looking or how good of an actor he is. It is a really amazing album, that hypnotizes you. My favorite tracks are the ones that He actually sings on because i just love his voice. \\"Laura\\" is such a good song it is worth alot. Please take a listen, although the samples dont really do justice to the songs. This album is really intended for certain people, and if you are here reading this, than that might be you! Pick It Up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible lo-fi indulgance","review":"Amateurish mopey audio muck for the most part. Gallo does demonstrate a small amount of recording insight when not obsessing over his own self-absorbed melancholy, but this unfortunately comes through more in tiny shades of instrumental flux rather then the concentrated efforts on vocal and lyrical pretentiousness of the highest order. With many a horrible composition guiding the arrogant actor's air-bloated voice, his disc will be relegated to a far off, cult appreciation weirdness, if that compliment can even be achieved by perhaps his few fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"music note is backwards","review":"The flag on a 8th note is supposed to go to the right, not to the left, I did not notice this at first because in the mirror it looks right, but one of my musician friends pointed it out then I felt like an idiot, which is too bad, because I loved these earrings, but now I feel stupid wearing them knowing that the flag is pointing in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return","review":"After the unit had more and more problems loading disks (new) it finally stopped all together.

We thought Samsung was a reliable brand plus it had good reviews on a few sites.At first it was great then slowly we started to have problems. Last year we started noticing pixelation on some scenes but we blew it off as just something on the disc (dust, dog hair, etc...). Then it started doing it on brand new DVDs & everything went down hill from there.Now it skips scenes, freezes up and continues to pixel on scenes. Very frustrating! Sometimes it works perfect, other times you have to restart three or four times just to get the movie going.Of course the warrenty is expired & there isn't anything we can do except take it to \\"an authorized dealer\\".

Then I decided to carefully read the User Manual and figure out how to playback CDRs with MP3 files. Guess what, no mention of how to do this. Then I went to look at the original box and there is no indication that MP3 is supported! I got back onto the Amazon website and reread the two customer reviews that preceded the one you are now reading and they both indicated that the P401 plays MP3s. ....Bottom line: I like the unit for its DVD, CD and CDR performance, aesthetics and compact size but I expected (and need) MP3 support and now am trying to decide do I send it back or keep it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre player.","review":"Very, very mediocre player: slow loading time, noisy drive, clumsy menus.As a progressive scan player, is well down below the standard set by the Panasonic RP-56."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are great knives","review":"These knives are made of forged high carbon steel and are hand ground just like most of the other big name brands.

I've tried 3 different power sources (2 different cigarrette adaptors and 1 power inverter) no luck.Another problem is that the unit gets extremely hot and starts effecting the movie about 3/4 the way through it. you have to stop the movie and let the unit cool down.

I was watching a brand new DVD yesterday and could not figure out why the disk stopped playing and became distorted. When I examined the disk, I noticed that it was developing wear marks on the edges but I could not figure out how. Then I noticed that the wear marks were in the same position as the white felt pads. I believe these were designed to keep the disk from scratching if it was bounced due the portable nature of the unit. However, either due to the internal heat of the unit or whatever may be the case the pads seem to actually touch the disk and wear off onto it. I could not remove the marks and luckly was able to get a replacement for the disk. I also returned the player in hopes of finding another unit that was designed without these type of pads.

There's no lock for the camera button on the side of the phone. so you can easily trigger it and drain your battery. 3. Battery life is short. I don't know if it's T-Mobile though. I bought two new phones for a family plan. The Sumsung I carry around with me needs a recharge every other day. This one sits at home most of the time and still need recharge every 4 days.

The battery for this phone is the same as Nokia 6102. I previously had a Nokia 6102 and its battery lasted 4-5 days with moderate usage. When I got 6133, its battery drained out in 2 days. However when I enabled all the \\"Power Saver\\" options (settings => main/mini display, turn off screen saver, turn off keypad, start-up and switch off tones etc.) in 6133, the battery started lasting around 4-5 days with moderate usage.

We reset the settings back to factory defaults and now it works.Call quality is great and reception in better than my old Motorola I had. Ringer volume with the handset when making a call is a little low but conversations come through clear. I get about 3 days on the battery but the phone is sometimes out of the network reach for a few hours and that will shorten battery life as it keeps searching for the network."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!!","review":"When my boyfriend lost his phone, T-mobile convinced me to \\"upgrade\\" and get the buy one get one free promotion on this phone.

It feels nice to hold and use as well. After about nine months, the flip pins started to loosen and one fell out fairly soon afterwards. I tried to deal with T-Mobile and then Nokia and got no real assistance. Recently, the top of the phone has gotten shaky and the screen felt loose. In the past week, it's given me a \\"SIM card failure\\" message which disappears after restarting. Today, it's in a coma. The small screen comes on, but not the main- so no texting, calendar, or other text. It also stopped dialing. I'm very disappointed in this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing volume, otherwise okay","review":"I selected the Nokia 6133 after researching a number of T-Mobile phones on Amazon, CNet, etc. After reading so many rave reviews about this phone I was very disappointed with the audio volume level on the handset. On the highest volume setting I have trouble hearing most of the people who call me. The speakerphone and headphones sound fine (on my side at least).

The speaker only worked 90% of the time, I could not make conference calls (not without incredibly loud and irritating noises over the speaker), it would not recognize bluetooth headsets as it should, the camera was constantly turning on in my pocket, and the physical design of the phone meant it was constantly pulling out whiskers from my cheek, no matter how close I shaved. I returned the phone to T-Mobile after a week. Save yourself the trouble and get a different phone. I ended up with a Motorola V195. It's a great basic phone. No camera, no mp3 player, but it has every phone-related option that a phone should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice features when it works","review":"I like this phone but I'm on 3rd one using warranty and still over a year on phone plan.

Finally a nice flip phone from the Scandinavian company. Coming from Europe, I am very familiar with Nokia products, due to the fact, that Nokia is much more popular overseas than here in the US.But beside all my good experience with other Nokia phones (I owned about 5 over the last years), I have to say, that this is one of the weakest Nokia phones so far, for a few reasons:1. Battery life. If you do not want to recharge your phone every 1 or 2 days (at medium / low level use), stay away from it.2. Internal memory. More or less not existing. So forget about taking pictures3. Reception. At best on a medium level. Especially indoors the reception is more than poor.Overall, the phone looks nice, but doesn't live up to Nokia's standard (which I am used to).

The author does a great job analyzing each album and provides great interviews by the band members and those involved in the making of each album. My only complaint about the book is the constant misspellings of peoples names. i.e music executive Mo Ostin is continuously spelled Austin, and there are inaccurate song titles listed throughout.

There is also a feature alot of people are interested in, it can change widescreen into fullscreen with most movies. Most people complain because they don't like the little black bars but with this player the bars can disapear. I've watched a wide array of movies on this player and they all play great. No complaints here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"[price]no good","review":"I was looking for a nice dvd player and a stumbled on the SamsungM301. It looked nice and it had some nice features but when I hooked it up thats when it all started. First I put a music cd into test the player. All it did was flash no disc. After that I put in a dvd it would play that and it worked great. But then I wanted to watch Rush Hour 2 and the it would play but the picturewas black then it got light then it got black again. After that the picture was split and very jumpy. So I took it back and they gave me a new player. I took it home and this time it would play a music cd but it would not play a dvd. Whats the point of buying a dvd player if it will not play a dvd. Back in November my friend bought a Hitachi dvd Player and he has no problem there yet.

All normal looking people -- No distracting super models here.The routines are shown at 3 levels with Joel doing the most difficult and his mom doing the beginner's moves. I have sincepurchased other videos by Joel's FitPack company as I like his simple style. It is not boring (as other reviewers have stated) as I am more interesting in technique than being entertained.If you are part of the target demographics for this video .. that is over 50, I encourage you to give it a try.

I was afraid to bend with the upper body one, but afterwards found my hips to be in less pain and more moveable.

Also like the first book, these comics are a lot more childish than the other Simpsons Comics books. Many of the punch lines are more silly than funny. Highlights include Bart and Milhouse dressing up like Sonny and Cher to escape truant patrolman Leopold in \\"Bart Simpson's Day Off,\\" and the comic \\"See You Later, Alligator\\" which has the Comic Book Guy offering $25 shopping sprees for the best science fair projects (this comic actually has a good ending). This book also includes shorts featuring a day in the life of Ralph Wiggum and baby Kang and Kodos.

In short, \\"suck it up & git 'er done!\\" The satisfaction of a warm place to work/hang out lasts way longer than the whining over a few screwy nuts & bolts...Update: Sadly, the double barrel kit now runs afoul of the nanny state in WA, so they are no longer available there.

It revels in all the martyrdom myths of Catholicism in all its gory details and with nothing but saccharine reverence for the martyrs and their supposed \\"great deed\\". Most sickeningly of all, the book ends with an open invitation to the reader to die for his faith himself!(\\"Who knows why the martyrs and saints of the future will be? Maybe you?\\") In a world already torn apart by religious battles and strife, such a comment is at best irresponsible and at worst catastrophic. This book does not belong in an enlightened age. Good riddance to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really nice","review":"This is a REALLY nice example of the possibilities that exist when an author weaves together multiple strands of thought in a comprehensive view of a topic or region. Here Muir examines the New England landscape from the perspectives of ecology, economics and history and makes each topic come alive as it is informed by the others. The prose is excellent and the pace and choice of examples kept me intrigued to the end. As someone who spends a good deal of time teaching about the topics that Muir focuses on I tend to be a sceptical consumer but here I found myself constantly nodding \\"yes!\\" or exclaiming \\"Aha! NOW I understand why THAT happened\\". This is a great book for students of Landscape Ecology as well as anyone seriously interested in the history and ecology of New England, and I suspect that even people who have never set foot east of the Mississippi will still benefit greatly from having read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much economy not enough nature.","review":"The title of this book is a bit misleading as the titular pond plays a minor role. This book is mainly concerned with the economic history of New England; the secondary concern is the effect this economic growth has had on New England's environment. As an overview of New England's growth from colonial struggles to industrial age giant, this book performs admirably and the material is well researched and documented. As a description of the environmental changes brought forth by this growth, the book is not quite as successful.The author occasionally intrudes with first person commentary, which seems strangely out of place and this often relates to the environmental impact of New England's economic transformations. A bit dry in tone with an annoying choice of typeface, Reflections is a work that will enhance your knowledge, but not necessarily entertain you at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You!","review":"Diana Muir read my review of All Souls & emailed me. I saw it was from the University of New England Press & thought it would be a more academic book. It wasn't and that was fine with me! A great timeline, using a pond in Newton, MA as a backdrop.

I didn't find it mindblowing as others have, but I feel like this is because I'm more knowledgeable about the effects of mass media and other forms of influence (due to my profession). I can see that the book would be more exciting for some other people who don't think about these issues as often. The nice thing about it is there are a lot of references to interesting books and movies. However, I still think one would do better to read one of those books, than this book itself. For instance, pick up Robert Cialdini's Influence. Or a good book on memes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure what to think.

There's an extraordinarily self-conscious branding attempt. There are a couple different pseudonyms such that the author's identity is pretty confused. There's an effort to get readers to think about a lot of things that are worth thinking about.It's a fun read. Just don't take it as seriously as it wants you to. And if you've read a lot of Robert Anton Wilson or Buckminster Fuller, it's probably not worth your time. Basically, I'm not sure to what extent this is an attempt to capitalize on the work of authors writing in a certain niche and build a brand around it, and to what extent this is interesting, original material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and awkwardly sized","review":"I purchased both this and the matching one with shorts and was disappointed by both.

It seems standard though I've been trying to find one with a thinner layer of filling but I looked high and low even in diet places but sadly it doesn't exist. If there was half the filling, maybe just add one thin layer in the middle instead of two..it would be perfect I would buy cases of it. Now I find myself opening up each wafer and scrapping it off in order to enjoy it that's why I gave it 4 stars.

After all, it's branded with BNL style, and what fan wouldn't want a fun AND functional item?

One might expect, at the least, that a poet writing about his travels would produce a book that would have beautiful descriptions of people, places and things. At best, one could hope for exploration of insights and thoughts about what it is to be a traveler - actually and metaphorically, and speculation about the spiritual import of such a journey.Unfortunately, what we get in this book is a collection of places vaguely described by a depressed man who spends most of his time writing about himself and his reaction to the places so ill-described. Frankly, this self-described \\"grumpy\\" man is not very good company for this trip, and all we are left with is a sense of trip of wonderful possibilities unrealized.

Those were usually Powerpoint presentations with audio. I was very disappointed with this training.The \\"CBT\\" is actually just a PDF that has been indexed by the menu-driven \\"study engine\\". Except that the PDF was written exclusively from the study engine. This is evident when you start with Chapter 1 and it takes you to page 53 in the PDF. Immediately, the PDF starts referencing material covered in the earlier pages (which you haven't read yet).Like the other reviewer, I printed out the PDF on a duplexing printer (377 pages on 188 pieces of paper) and am reading the PDF in sequential page order.THE GOOD: The test engine is very good and will allow me to \\"familiarlize\\" myself with the type of questions I might get on the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, book needs proof reading badly","review":"This book is very difficult to follow. Topics are not presented in a way that promotes learning, full of lists of ill referenced tables and facts, abundant use of acronyms without definition.

Mad Croc is also pretty bad, the sick bitter taste this gum has, is alot like chewing a no doze tablet. Its just crap and I cannot believe people reviewed it and said it tasted good.

This reviewer uses it to restore alertness during long drives, long meetings, and sometimes early morning hikes.The gum is coated with a cinnamon flavor shell which has a strong taste. The gum itself is easy chewed for a few minutes for increased alertness. A second piece can be chewed if the first doesn't quite do the trick. A package with five pieces of gum fits easily into a pocket.The package warns against having more than one or two pieces at a time; it is not a substitute for real rest. Prolonged chewing can leave your mouth dried out. Exceeding the recommended dosage can leave your heart racing from caffeine overload.\\"Stay Alert Gum\\" is highly recommended as a substitute for a cup of coffee or soda in overcoming minor fatigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product-Motorcycle Riding","review":"I have been using this product for many years and keep reordering it. I share these packets with our motorcycle club on those long rides where that after-lunch fog sets in. These chewable tablets are much more convienent to take, while riding, than stoping to drink those energy drinks or taking a Nodose tablet. I have found that chewing 1/2 of a tablet does the trick without over-wiring me on the ride.

The father and twin relationship was so hard to get a clear understanding of that the family relationship was very hard to follow. The twin Elliott, was not developed as a person.

Overall, this is an interesting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, Gripping Action!!!!","review":"I really liked \\"Trust No One.\\" Especially the character Brody Hawke and his brother Elliot. I mean, who hasn't dreamed of having an identical twin? Their conversations were fun and interesting... Brody is intimidated at having such a cosmopolitan brother, Elliot is surprised by having a brother who is a SEAL. Simply fun.Now for what I didn't like: I really did NOT like the romance being between his brother's fianc��e and Brody. His brother deserved better than to have Brody steal his fianc��e, even if Tori was going to call it off, likewise Brody was a jerk to betray his brother like that. Bleh. I also thought Tori's character was very undeveloped. I mean she seemed to serve no purpose other than to be an object for Brody and El to fight over. She was a bit on the spineless side.This was a great book, with exciting gripping characters, even if the Heroine irritated me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book! You can see that the author made a very good research concerning the production of wine and vineyards!

So, I doubly enjoyed a good thriller, and very well written book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny and way too long","review":"The editing in this book is terrible. So very bad. Shame on Zebra Romantic Suspense for producing a book with so many blatant errors in it.Repetitive phrases are used; 'heart pounding', 'hung the moon'. Silent knowing, understanding and probing looks are also way over used. The main character's pasts and feelings are explained so frequently it's boring and irritating. The same sets are described over and over.Too many explanations points!!!!!Brody Hawke is a horrible example of a Navy SEAL.Nothing about this book works well or is believable.I usually keep the books I've read, but I'll sell this one because there is no chance I'll ever want to read it again.I apologize for the harshness of this review, I usually find something positive to say about an author's work. I just can't do that in this case.

The transcendental pleasure of a child free in the fields and woods, oblivious to all but this timeless moment, is expressed beautifully by this master nature writer who is so under-appreciated here in the States. The plot weakens in places, and judged by that and action only, the book would disappoint, but the charm and poignancy of some moments is unmatched. No one enchanted by fine talking animal books should miss this distillation of childhood's mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"The selections in this book miss the point completely","review":"Althought the editor has done a fine job of selecting sections of prose writing, he has failed to include anything that may give a glimpse into the thoughts and contemplations of John Ruskin.

What would the US have to gain by beating the hell out of itself? That suggests we made attacks on ourselves to pin the blame on Arabs and wage a war.

It's a classic, standard angle, fast prime lens. The low light performance at f/1.4 is great. AF speed is slow though on my E-600. I believe the internal mechanism on the lens itself is slow. It does lock on in some pretty low light situations though (just not quickly). There is some vignetting at f/1.4 and f/2. This is largely gone by F/2.8 or f/4. The lens is pretty sharp at f/1.4 and I would say as sharp as it gets by f/2.8. Diffraction sets in by f/11.

There is often a poetic beauty and clarity in his language. His apparently simple Biblically cadenced sentences are perceptually precise and focused. His stories generally have themes and create in a few lines memorable characters. Think of the old man who drinks without spilling in a 'Clean Well- Lighted Place' and who recites the \\"Nada y Nada' version of the \\"Lord's Prayer'. Or think of Krebs the soldier who comes home from the war and whose experience has estranged him completely from the sentimentalities and cliches of his family and home life. Think of Nick Adams himself the Hemingway alter ego whose innocence meets terrible experience more than one time. Hemingway is a master of close observation , a great American classic.

It also sounds better then the Casio $99 keyboard.

Amazon sent us a new one very promptly which we appreciated but nevertheless it is the wrong stand.

I find I mostly agree with Jackson's ratings, though I've tried a couple of products he rates very highly which I definitely disagree on, and a couple of my favorites which he rates much lower than I expected. Where I find his ratings lacking is in commentary on how he arrives at the rating. He's descriptive of the characteristics (color, nose, body, palet and finish), but doesn't offer any insight as to why he asigns the given numeric value. Murray's book is far superior in that regard. The font is a nice size, where Murray's book is way too small for me to read without some magnification. Overall, I think this is a good book and worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, nice remake of 5th edition","review":"i have the fifth edition, this one completes the vision of Jackson. must have for the whisky enthusiast. nice to use for tastings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick facts for scotch lovers","review":"An update for one of the best manuals on scotch tasting.

He was immediately able to place the stickers over the right shapes and spent so much time looking at all the new things, learning new names. I actually \\"laminated\\" the sticker pages for him with packaging tape because he loves reusable stickers and now he gets to take the stickers on and off as he pleases. It was also his first coloring book - another surprise - he's learning to draw in the lines and play with different colors.My only problem with the book is that there are pictures of different things on the cover, like the rubber dinosaur and robot, which are not included inside the book, and he keeps on saying \\"I want this one!\\"Overall, excellent book for toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3-year old loves it","review":"My kiddo has loved finding the stickers in the back that coordinate with the pictures sorted under each letter.

He isn't old enough to do it all by himself, which is great because we can spend some quality time together learning and playing. I would recommend this to any parent looking to work on the alphabet with their child. We not only are able to work on the capital and lowercase letters, but what words start with each letter. My son loves putting the stickers where they belong and naming the new stickers. Some of the stickers are a little off the wall (Quiche? But I guess Q is pretty hard to find words for!) But its overall a great purchase that I would buy again. The pages we've completed we go back and name all of the stickers and letters again.

If you're already in a sexual relationship with a woman, you'll learn very little about sex you don't already know. Even if you aren't, there are better guides on dating than this one.If you want a book that actually teaches you something about driving women wild in bed, get Lou Paget's How to Give Her Absolute Pleasure or Susan Crain Bakos' Sexational Secrets, which really deliver the goods this one promises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"I had heard good things about this book a while back but I was severely disappointed.

As someone who has been on a binge of Le Carre books for several months, this worthy effort peals away the reflections of a Cold War warrior through Smiley's presentation to young men and women in training to ply Smiley's trade in post Cold War circumstances. A series of anecdotes add up to a series of lessons learned, some good and some bad, but all worth learning. Smiley was never caught up in the hubris of others. He had a sense of limitations on the power to make significant change in world affairs, but he also had a sense of necessity for someone to act to oppose the Russian Bear. Perhaps I liked this book because, at age 70, I find myself going through a reflective period, coming to grips with the horizon that seemed so far away in my prime and realizing that the road will actually come to an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is one of my favorite Le Carre books.

This is because, in a addition to the noise, the seams of the microwave are slightly off. So, when we called LG to get this product replaced, they refused to honor their 1-Year warranty and blamed it on the installation.

I was very surprised when the album version didn't feature Styles P (don't worry - that version is on there as a bonus track). But this album is very very good. Akon may not have Usher's voice, but he can sing very well.He sings about issues that are very different from his counterparts like R Kelly or Usher. Instead of being about girls, cars, and parties, Akon is very open about the corrections system and his emotions. It's almost heartbreaking and extremely powerful to hear someone singing so heartfelt about being in prison and what happens when he gets out.I'd recommend this album highly, not just for fans of R&B;, but for fans of straight-up rap as well. I think this album is a little overlooked, but it's so powerful that even the hardest rap fans should find something they can like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Akon's Album is mediocre at best.","review":"Locked Up is the best song on this album. Akon has several songs that sound similar to Locked Up but they just do not have the same passion and effect. Belly Dancer is another nice song and so is Trouble. However, beyond these three songs this CD lacks appeal. Akon is talented and has a unique, velvety sounding voice. However, he needs not just good sounding songs, but good sounding sonds that complement his unique voice. And this CD lacks those. Nice first try. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble ~Akon~ Good or Bad?","review":"I thought that the record Trouble is absolutely amazing!The kick back songs and the emontional ones are great.I really like the song on the cd.

Akon, I think to myself is that a name of a gang or a chipmunk because honestly it sounded like a chipmunk, but my assumtions were wrong it's just some random guy crying because his girlfriend left him and then he has this Bobby Vinton sample going in the background which tells me immediately to turn the TV off, however I leave it on to listen to the song thinking it will get better however it doesn't it gets worse and worse. His voice is horrible and strained. The next day my best friend gives me his CD and says it is really good and that I should listen to it. So I reluctantly listen to it and hear the most horrible array of songs ever, honestly even another ragga-reggae-ish wannabe Rihannah is better than this stupid mindless pap.Save your money and your sanity, avoid Akon at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Boob","review":"This is the best cd ever and if you dont have one you should get a few for you and your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"This is a neat CD.

The other tracks suck aswell. Dont waste your money buy \\"The Massacre\\", \\"The Documentary\\", \\"The Calm\\", or \\"Encore\\" instead. Hell even \\"Love. Angel. Music. Baby.\\" is better. The only joy i got from this is, the video for \\"Lonely\\", because theres nothing better then hearing a dumbass mis prounouncing the word lonely and being dumped by an ugly girl.

It was exactly what I thought I was getting and on the back of the plate it says that it's an officially licensed Ford product, which is even better!I guess the one useful thing I could say is that the picture in the ad is pretty poor.

There is absolutely no explanation, no verbal instruction, no how-to, nothing. All you get are two men (presumably) doing Tai Chi.

I know enough about Tai Chi to know that there is supposed to be a warm up; some stretching, loosening of the joints and so on before you begin but there is none of that shown. I guess one is supposed to mimic what they do, but if so, they could at least say \\"Copy what these guys do.\\" or something. Even then, you would be skipping the warm-up.

I had never touched a clarinet before and was looking for a book to help me get started before I pursued lessons. I had piano lessons as a kid, so I can read music.This book rushes through fundamentals like assembling the instrument, cleaning it, holding it and blowing on it correctly. It provides a fingering chart without explanation--this took me hours to decipher. It offers a short history of the instruments and an introduction to musical notation. The bulk of the book is a survey of music history, touching on different classical composers and offering sample sheet music from each. The music selections are NOT for beginners.I honestly can't figure out whom this book is for.

I was very surprised to find how much I actually enjoyed this book, even with it's somewhat more serious undertone. The best way to read Wickhams books is to picture this as a completely different author, not the same as the Shopaholic series, because you will be disappointed. Wickham writes books with more serious storylines and characters, these do not have the same amount of whimsy and happily-after-ever as her Kinsella books.The Wedding Girl kept me intrigured until the very end, there is a slight twist that I did not see happening and it left me feeling very fulfilled. The storyline overall was well done, although somewhat unbelievable, that is what 'fiction' is, right? Milly was very likeable, as well with most of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Kinsella instead of Wickham","review":"Why do I keep trying to read Madeline Wickham books? It's those darn book jackets that pull me in. I'm expecting a fun, frothy beach read (like her Kinsella books), and they are nothing of the kind. When she writes as Kinsella, she is funny, witty, romantic, and enjoyable. As Madeline Wickham, she creates unappealing characters and boring plotlines. In this instance, she makes Simon so unappealing that the reader never warms up to him. Why would I want him to get the girl? I don't. Molly, the heroine, is sweet, but frustrating. She is never honest with her loved ones. The \\"secret\\" theme has been done ad nauseum, and this sheds absolutely no new light on it. I think if the book jackets were more appropriate to the slower, more serious story lines, I would have the proper expectations when I buy one.

It's bland and completely forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, but strong finish.","review":"I found the story difficult to get into at first, but I'm glad I stuck with it.

Couldn't put it down once I started!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun, easy read","review":"i loved this mostly cuz i loved the topic. i thought the events of the story played out the way they needed to. wickman was able to cover so many different moral and ethical issues using parallel and foil storylines. the writing was engaging and the chaeacters were interesting. overall a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Ok, so this is not great literature. I still think it is a good story with good characters. It moved along quickly and always kept my interest. I think readers of both Ms. Wickham and Ms. Kinsella have to realize - 2 different names, 2 different styles of writing. I recommend this book for a fun escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book","review":"This was a really cute story, one of Wickham's best in my opinion. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cute girlie story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prompt and Perfect!","review":"This book was shipped to me in great time! I ordered and received the book in less than a week. The book was in perfect shape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book started out with an interesting enough plot. Unfortunately, the main character needed to be more developed in order to be appealing (her main characteristic seems to be that she is really nice and sweet). The characters in the book have deep rooted problems and in the end everything wraps up WAY too neatly. I bought this book to read at the beach knowing it would be a lighter read but unfortunately I was still disappointed by the way it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite...even of the Wickham books!","review":"As has been noted by other reviewers, there is a disconnect between Sophie Kinsella books and Madeline Wickham books. I agree, but being an avid reader, and someone author loyal, I've decided to give Madeline Wickham a try (I've read about 4 of her other books). While MW stories are not nearly as lighthearted as SK stories (the characters often have fewer redeeming characteristics, a bit mean spirited, the storylines are heavier), this was by far my least favorite. Perhaps it was because I just finished reading the lighthearted and surprisingly touching The Twenties Girl.At any rate, I found this book difficult to finish, especially considering it is chick lit. The plot seemed too over the edge, the characters were immeadiately unlikeable, and I felt that while it tried to end happily ever after it didn't seem to resolve anything.I'll think twice before reading another Madeline Wickham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unrealistic","review":"I loved Confessions of a Shopaholic and this is just definitely not the same caliber. I heard that the Madeleine Wickham books deal with more \\"serious\\" issues but not very believably. If you want a happy ending with no apparent character development then this is the book for you. Just not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"unmemorable","review":"I know i enjoyed reading this, but i don't really remember it very well now. Good in the moment chick-lit, but unmemorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"RSVP YES to the Wedding Girl","review":"With secrets and unexpected plot twists galore, the Wedding Girl is an entertaining read you won't want to put down. The main character, Milly makes some questionable decisions when confronted with a secret from her past that may prevent her from marrying the man she loves. As the stress from Milly's past grows, it creates problems that seep into the lives of her loved ones and friends. The author, Madeline Wickham, does a great job of bringing each character and their anguish vividly to life on each page. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Madeleine Wickman (AKA Sophie's) best book","review":"To be honest this book does not come close to Sophie's previous books. It's lacks the witt and charm that her Shopaholic Series produced.

I have a bit of medical knowledge and wanted a reference that didn't \\"talk\\" to me as if I knew nothing. This book treats the reader as an intelligent being. I especially enjoyed the narrative style - felt that Ms. Douglas was chatting with me about my questions and concerns. I appreciated her not sugar-coating the likelihood of having aches and pains but, at the same time, encouraging the reader to fully live in the experience - she presents a very realistic picture. It was exciting to read the list of developmental milestones that the baby is going through and what to expect next on this journey. The list of relevant Canadian resources in the appendix is comprehensive and very useful. Thank you so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"What to Expect\\"","review":"I bought \\"what to expect when you're expecting\\" and was disappointed with the patronizing style and lack of detailed information. A friend loaned me her copy of \\"the Mother of All Pregnancy Books\\" and it was much better. It is Canadian and touches on Canada specific information like midwifery and Canadian regulations. It also has a less patronizing style and a more positive tone, without shying away from the tough information. For a high-level, wide-scope book on pregnancy and birth, if you're trying to choose between this and \\"what to expect,\\" I believe you'll be happier choosing \\"the Mother.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Gift for the expectant mom!","review":"The Mother of All Pregnancy Books was given to me as a gift when I was first pregnant.

The whole album is real 100%. This should go down as a classic straight up it's gangsta hip hop. He has that classic Southeast style which is why we are going to take over the world by storm.

It is an ideal reference book for practicing hydrogeologists and environmental engineers, as well as an excellent textbook for undergraduate and perhaps first year graduate students. The strength of the book lies in its thorough coverage of the literature and in its balance between theory and application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nahin could have done better...","review":"Although Dr. Nahin may be a seasoned explorer of ideas involving time travel, his failure to used organized paragraphs and effective examples greatly lowered the value of this how-to book.Nahin also omitted the concept of parallel universes entirely. (A now popular belief, that as soon as a traveler breaks his own space-time barrier and moves back in time, the universes splits into two identical entities, the original universe where you came from is the one you can never return to. This may sound disheartening, but this is the only conceivable way in which the time traveler would not induce changes in histories, and therefore time paradoxes.)Books like this deserve to be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book!","review":"Before you read this book, when someone tells you, \\"Time travel is not real,\\" you will agree. After you read this book, when someone tells you, \\"Time travel is not real,\\" you will object strongly and start explaining to them all of the REAL laws of time travel and the REAL concept of time travel. If you are a science fiction writer, I STRONGLY suggest that you read this so that you story will not be a heap of junk in a garbage can. You will learn many, many, things such as the REAL science of hyperspace, which is the possible fifth dimension,(the fifth dimension is not simply something that someone made up) and the REAL science of wormholes.

I thought it was an excellent book, mentally engaging, full of subtlety and ambiguity. The main character Jo's life choices, and the events that shape who she's become are thoroughly explored. Not only that, the book was a real page turner due to the central mystery of the story, that was resolved near the end. I'm irritated at the (in my opinion, mindless) comments that say, \\"I hated the character so therefore the book is bad.\\" I don't understand what one thing has to do with the other. The point is, the character is well drawn in all her complexity and imperfection, and the relationship dynamics are realistically portrayed. Don't miss this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Past Time; Relived","review":"A very thought provoking journey of how everyday life can bring one back around full circle to relive a time passed. Easy reading that makes the reader think of their own past and how easily previous events can revisit you and take hold of your every emotion and change your life in an instant.I truely enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mundane and mundaner","review":"I picked this book up several times when it was first out and then again with its paperback debut and always put it down without buying. Then a friend passed a copy along to me. After finishing it, I found my first reservations were correct. What a grindingly slow, unsurprising, indulgent book. It centers around a woman who revisits her life in a \\"commune\\" (it's no commune anyone from those days would recognize) in the 1960s after encountering a housemate from those days. There's a murder mystery around which the entire book revolves, but if you don't figure out this whodunnit about three chapters before it's revealed, you're not reading closely enough! The modern-day characters are curiously detached from their livelihoods and almost universally depressing as they grind through their days. Have to say this is one to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"while i was gone","review":"Well written, but uninteresting.Sue Miller can write, she's good at developing characters, and also at writing dialogue. But I found this particular story is quite ordinary, even though it deals w/a particular horrific event. It's surprising that there couldn't have been more of a payoff after going through this journey.By the middle I was so bored, but was determined to finish this book, hoping that it would have some kind of exciting finish. Very disappointing.I doubt I'll pick up her future books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed","review":"I never felt very compassionate for the characters.

She was the only interesting person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why does this woman have no friends? no one to say \\"You'll never guess!\\" or \\"my daughter's a brat\\" to me this makes the book phony. \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" was the same. I think it is just plain lazy of the author. If this woman was real she would have friends, or a friend, and would have discussed things! Granted she was a loner, but by no means was she so extreme that she should have no-one. I don't mean to obsess, but people doen't make such HUGE choices without talking to anyone!They just don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible, stupid book!!!","review":"I love books, but this one was a horrible waste. I waded through all the pain, all the trauma, all the incessant meaningless detail, and in the end, NOTHING happened! It was an extremely unsatisfying waste of my time.

It's not as if she had loved him, and, furthermore, hadn't seemed to be attracted to him when they were young. One point against the plot.Second point: Eli's confession was so silly. Why now? Why to her? What was the point?Third point: I'm no prude and I've read the best of them, but what did the heavy sex scene with her husband add to the plot. It seemed that Miller's editor told her to throw a couple of pages of heavy panting into a boring book in order for it to sell.Sorry - Miller has done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAS EXPECTING MORE","review":"I enjoyed some parts of this book but I have to say, I was a bit disappointed. It seemed much too wordy for me and I found the end anti-climatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Turn of Events!","review":"Unlike \\"The Good Mother\\", this novel hits hard. Really hard. One can't help but identifying with the heroine, Joey Becker. There are not many lapses in this book. Get ready for \\"tension\\" to permeate your cells as you place yourself in Joey Becker's shoes. This can be a hard read for people with ulcers. There is no \\"letting\\" up as the heroine confronts a reality that she really can't bear. The novel becomes more frozen as you read. Frozen with ice until you feel like you want to scream. It's a great book and a marvelous read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an attention grabber","review":"I began this novel from Sue Miller and after over 100 pages I still wasn't sure I wanted to keep reading. The main character Jo Becker lives in a beautiful farmhouse with her minister husband and three almost grown children. She loves animals and is a veterinarian. One day a dog is brought to her office which leads her to discover a link to her past... the owner of the dog. She tells about running away from her first marriage and leading a bohemian lifestyle until one of her roommates was brutally murdered.I just did not find this character very interesting, didn't really care why she kept running away from things and didn't care about who committed the murder. I don't think there was a lot in the book for me to connect to...Overall, I still think I would give another novel by Sue Miller a chance, but I'd pass on this one. It just wasn't all that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK at the beginning","review":"At first I was really into this book, but near the middle I lost interest. I like the writer's style, but didn't really care for the story. I couldn't really relate to Eli Mayhew, and didn't really care about the relationship between him and the main character. The daughters were not really likable either."},{"rating":"1","title":"While I Was Gone","review":"I really did not enjoy the story. I found the main character to be weak and unaware of all that was right with her life. I didn't like all the thoughts of infidelity either. Her husband should have left her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drags on with detail","review":"There is too much development of characters who are inconsequential to the plot. The story line drags along then hits some exciting points. But, it seems fragmented and doesn't lead to anything. I might try one of her other books instead, \\"The Distinguished Guest\\" or \\"The Good Mother\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying read for Women of all Ages!","review":"Much has been said about the plot. The woman is believable. We identify immediately with middle-aged Jo as she tells us about her life both present and past. We understand her frustrations and her secret thoughts and desires. And as she deliberately brings her past into the present, we wonder about the wisdom of her choice as she plunges into a relationship that might destroy all she cares about now. I worried about her and wondered how it would all end. The novel hold attention and interest. (However, I doubted Jo's freedom of choice, for in reality, she would have had to be more involved with her husband's church ministry than she was in the novel. It seemed his vocation was one in which she shared little with him,and this is not true of minister's wives I have known who must serve equally with their husbands.)Evelyn Horan - authorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Books One - Three"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slooooow!","review":"I found this book very dull reading. The characters were shallow, self centered and unbelievable. A good book to read if you can't sleep at night. No minister I ever knew was anything like the wimp in this story and no self respecting pastor would ever marry a selfish woman like he did because a ministers wife is extremely important in her husband's work.
