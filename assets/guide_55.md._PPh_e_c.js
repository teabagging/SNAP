Please don't believe this junk works for a second.

A lot of promises but no delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Viciously sexist and totally insincere.","review":"This books reveals no insight at all in women. It rambles on and on pandering to men who just want to get laid. Not to suggest that Louis & Copeland's waste of good paper will help you with that objective either. I doubt it. Their book is written like off the top of their head and has nothing of substance, even for the man who is no more than a seducer.The book of the same title by Dr. Badalamenti is rich in insight and is written for men who wish to connect and not just have sex. Dr. Badalamenti's book is written with female psychology in mind and with deep insight into what women really want. Dr. Badalamenti's book helped me a great deal. Louis & Copeland's book has nothing to say that I would recommend for use or for understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many women have read this book?!","review":"I read my brother's copy - and it gave me the chills. It panders to men's insecurities while stereotyping women in the worst way. I felt queasy knowing adult men would take the author's words to heart when initiating a relationship with women. I have read passages aloud to female friends and co-workers. Those who weren't choked with mirth were outraged. Please, please, PLEASE do not attempt to apply these principles to mature women in the real world. It will only prolong your sense of loneliness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it!","review":"I just found the book and found a lot of the information very helpful.I found this book to be more in depth and much less sexist and less hard edged than most of the other dating books for men. In fact, I found nothing in this book to be controversial in the least bit. Unless the meer idea of men dating and having sex is offensive,but certainly not to me. I think the Louis and Copeland did a good job and created a book for every man out there. I have used it to get motivated and to get out and date. I can honestly say that I use the techniques in the book on a day to day basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are true gonzo studs!","review":"I originally bought the book because I heard the authors on a radio show. They were nuts. They took no crap from anyone, and it was halarious and beautiful. Finally, a couple of average guys striking back against the PC garbage of today.

If you don't know to go to the dentist, not to wear sweatpants in public (see Seinfeld episode), and not let your hair grow down your neck, then buy this book. Other facts, such as good places to meet women, i.e., bookstores, coffee shops, are common knowledge. Some advice, such as first dates should be short and are best at coffee shops are intelligent but again should already be known. Bottom line, I don't have \\"game,\\" and if you don't have that you aren't going to meet womeon. This book helps you in the conversation department.

So women are made of transistors, already? I read on, and on, and on.

If all you want is sex then try Steele's book or do what these authors do: pay for it.The authors claim they did 5 years of dating research and then compared notes to write this book. So maybe they dated manakins with transistorized heads and boobs, already. It would take a boob to read this book. The nerd's cure, it is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, Concise, Detailed","review":"I read this book cover to cover. I have not tried using the princicples presented, but they are detailed, clear, and I think they would work.The authors take you through the whole process of presentation (how you should look and act, more clean yourself up than changing what you are), where to meet and how to talk to a woman and it is a numbers game, how to flirt and get a priming date (safe location to explore if you really want to date the girl with an exit strategy), seduction date(s), and what to do thereafter....The book is thick and full of details.

This is the most mean-spirited, joyless, degrading book about \\"relationships\\" I have ever read. It's theme is how to score, score, score -- whatever the cost, even if you despise the woman you're targeting. According to the authors, all women are bimbos and bubbleheads. They are whining, emotional, stupid creatures that are put on earth to be used by men for sex. Here's a sample of what it says about women who were sexually abused: \\"...she probably has very weak boundaries. The good side of this is that she might therefore be easy to get into bed. The bad side is that it won't be worth it when she flips out.\\" Had enough? No woman with a heart, soul and mind would ever fall for the \\"techniques\\" outlined in this book. I am horrified that this trash was actually signed up and published. It makes me very angry and sad that this neanderthal mentality still survives.

Ridiculously trivial examples of Bruces and Bobs (Dos and Donts) and hints your Granny gave you already ages ago: dress clean, cut that hair, vacuum that carpet and be sure to have changed those sheets before taking a Lady to your apartment.

I tried some of the stuff and got dismal results. Now I realize that many (most) reviews here are fake and must have been written by the authors. They've even entered positive responses to some of the negative ones to defend themselves. This is dishonest and consistant with their bogus claim that their book is useful. Put more weight on the bad reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Attitude - Practical Advice Wanting","review":"I think these guys are on the money on their advice about how one should approach the dating scene: don't take it personally, maintain a positive self-image, be optimistic, playful with women, don't put all of your eggs in one basket, don't let rejection make or break your life, and don't let your success with the opposite sex control whether you are happy with your life. On the other hand, the book promises too much. I believe their tactics are terrible and will not work. I have tried them, and I have felt and looked foolish. I just can't see them working with even semi-intelligent women. Some of their lines are so corny: approach a woman behind a counter of a toy store and say something like, \\"Hello Goddess of Toys.\\" I am not making this up. This is their advice. Save your $$$ and read this review again. Take the principles to heart. Forget their practical advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"So where's the meat?","review":"This is a long, wordy book that lacks substance. It makes many promises based on ploys from I know not where for bagging women. I doubt that this is a research work and I would not try its methods because they are obviously nonsense. The book lacks the integrity and painstaking research of the same title by Dr. Badalamenti, a book that helped me get oriented and become more successful with women."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best: Detailed, Practical, It Works","review":"This is great guide to understanding the dating/mating dynamics between men and women. Basically it focuses on self-empowerment and taking responsibility for all aspects of your own life. It actually asks you to become more yourself, not some sharkey pick-up guy. It gives practical, detailed examples that make a lot of sense.I've had much more dating success with women because the techniques and my understanding of flirting and romance have become second-nature, not some mechanical, by-rote process.What is it about self-help books that brings out the worst in competing authors?

If you buy this, tape down the connections coming out of the device so they can't move. The item was so cheap, I bought it to find out if the technology would work because I read so many reviews where people couldn't get these type of devices to work.

We were visiting friends and we were served coffee which tasted very good and it was a bit milder than what we drink, so I asked about the brand and was told it was Jermiah's Kona mixed with some french roast. I ordered my bag from Amazon and the shipment was prompt and well packaged. As for the coffee, it was terrible: stale, no aroma, beans were dry. I figured that since I have the bag I might as well brew some and the result was undrinkable coffee. I tried it by itself, mixed 1/2 french roast, 1/4 ...without any success.

Hell, the first line of the first song starts out with the rhyme 'line' and 'time', for Chrissakes!

They have this stereotypical punk image where as long as you have the spikey hair and piercings you're a punk. Well, most true punks have some political or philosophical message to say in the lyrics and there is none of that on this album. If you like this kind of band, I guess you should also check out The Offspring's new CD's, they're pretty similar to this.

Also ramen is fried, these rice noodles are steam cooked, not fried. And I like the fact that they put two flavor packets, one is the soup mix and the other is the spicy oil, so if your kids don't like hot spicy, they don't have to add the spicy oil packet.

What I read was mildly interesting but not enlightening. I got a bit infuriated when, researching 'anorexia', I saw two entries which basically said: 'Minimize the effects of stress by eating well, exercising, meditating, having foot rubs and long warm baths and taking (maybe 10 minutes?) to put things in perspective to get a grip. With 'friends' like these, who needs...??? Whatever happened to 'throw the bum out'? Tell your parents to fudge themselves. Why not spend the next 10, 20, even 30 YEARS getting a grip??

As I have a small child, I have seen this film perhaps thirty times, and I look forward to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, good read","review":"This book is a great fantasy book, good enough to rival LOTR and Harry Potter. When you read this book it takes you away to places that you never thought that you would go. It is a great sequel to the first book the Lost Years series. In this book Merlin even comes up with the mysterious sword Excalibur. He doesnt say that he does but the clues hint to the name. If you liked Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings you will definetly love the Series The Lost Years of Merlin.T.A.

Other books that were written by the same author were The Lost Years of Merlin, The Fires of Merlin, The Mirror of Merlin, and The Wings of Merlin. I think The Lost Years of Merlin is the best. Anybody who likes the Harry Potter books would probably like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Seven Songs of Merlin","review":"The Seven Songs of Merlin is an excellent book written by T.A Barron. When I started this book it kept climbing to excitement throughout the book. It took me three days to read this book because it was so entertaining. The Seven Songs of Merlin is about a young wizard who brought back his mother from the dead. But soon an evil nemesis poisoned Merlin's mother with magic. In one week she will die, but Merlin has one chance in saving her. He has to find the Elixer. Now he must wonder into the lands of Fincayra discovering songs along the way that will help him through his journey. But the Elixer that a wizard owns is very distant. Will young Merlin collect all the songs and get the Elixer from Dagda the wizard in less than a week? Also tomake matters worse Merlin has to face Rhita Gawr an evil wizard and a cyclops that killed Merlin's grandfather who was the greatest wizard of all time. Will Merlin succeed? Who knows until you read this greatbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book's a BEAUTY!","review":"Seven Songs is Barron at his best (and don't think I say that because I'm from Colorado, as is Barron). This is one of the best YA books I've read -- and as an 8th grade teacher, I've read zillions as have my students. There are TONS of YA books not worth my students' or my time, but this is a winner. There is emphasis on a young person setting up a personal code of ethics--but absolutely not at the expense of the wonderous tale of young Merlin. And Barron makes me believe in all the adventures. It's a tender story--with some rip-roaring adventure. I don't often see the two combined so well. If it reminds me of another book, it is of Hesse's Siddhartha. I am not a \\"fantasy fan\\" in any way -- but Barron writes for ALL readers in this one. I do NOT see how it could have been ignored for the awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Words","review":"I personaly don't like to read very much and would only read when I was forced to, mostly for school assinments, however I love Merlin and Mid-Evil times.

After stalling for some time my mother finaly forgot that a had the book in my room, but I was bord one day and desided to read it. This boy how could not stand to read was suddenly swept away by this wonderful book, I finished the book, but I had to read more,I am now on the process of reading \\"The Lost Years of Merlin\\", and have \\"The Fires of Merlin\\" for after that, and can't wait to read his new book he's writing to come out.

This video does not offer walk throughs on how to do many of the poses. She just quickly changes from one pose to the next, without explaining how to do it, give you time to inhale or exhale properly, show you where and how to position hands and feet for support, or how to twist core body, etc. Both her verbal explanations and visuals leave me frustrated, wondering if I should position the hands one way or another for a particular pose. What is worse, the camera does not follow many of her important movements, focusing sometimes only on her face or on a detail of her shirt, instead of showing how she is positioning her arms, hand, toes, etc. even when she puts them behind her body -- these are important details in yoga, because incorrect poses can lead to injuries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good selection of poses","review":"I really enjoy this dvd. There is a natural flow between poses with good descriptions, and the selection is great for allover stretching and toning. Unlike some prenatal dvd's, it actually does give a workout. I don't feel too exhausted afterward, but I do feel that I've accomplished something. Many of the poses were ones that I enjoyed before pregnancy, so the transition in this first dvd is not enormous. The instructor's voice is pleasant and thoughtful. I would highly recommend this.I also bought Prenatal Yoga with Mary Pappas-Sandonas and disliked it. That dvd had no transitions, too many props, and poses with little to no stretching...I got more of a workout from constantly stopping the dvd and moving all of the props for the next pose. I would not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"video for experts","review":"This video was clearly for those yoga experts or people that do yoga quite often.

The first thing I noticed was the laughably bad production value. The word \\"cheesy\\" comes to mind. A smoke machine?! It was a bit silly. And her instruction was seriously lacking. I guess for someone who is really new to yoga this might be ok, but even her breathing instruction bothered me. She seemed to have lungs the size of a small bird or something, I could not go at her pace as my breaths took much longer. Overall, I wasn't thrilled with every aspect of this dvd, the poses, the way she instructed them, the sound quality (AWFUL,) the video quality, the ridiculous set, etc. Save your money or invest in a different dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disturbing Book","review":"This is a very disturbing book on many levels. I find it to be quite contradictory to the basic tenets of Christianity. For example, the author says in the Public Relations section that John the Baptist was a great PR man for Jesus...(hmmm...is he proposing that an organizational leader is Jesus and the workers are the followers???!!!) He says John the Baptist 'knew his place' and that too many people think they are the 'stars' at their job when the only 'stars' should be the executives and the enterprise.

The only issue that I have noticed is that the scanning process, if that is how the e-books are generated, has produced text that is rife with errors.

I really wish I had known before purchasing it that the lead character would be a multi-sexual. I think everyone (whether they be straight, gay or a green alien from Mars) likes to read books that they can identify with...you know, put yourself in the lead character's shoes so to speak.

The Forest Oracle is the worst of the bunch. The plotline is thin. The writing is bad. This is a railroad that railroads the PC's to no-where. There are many \\"encounters\\" and \\"rooms\\" described with box-text where the description basically says 'You enter a room, there is a table, and nothing else'. If the players look around, nothing happens. If the players stop moving, nothing happens. If the players move on to the next room, they are being pushed down the railroad -- and when they get to the destination, nothing exciting or interesting happens there either. Eventually they come to a bridge where they must roll a saving throw, or fall off the bridge and die in a 200' chasm. When the most exciting plot event is a Save Or Die, for 1st level characters, that is very boring indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Large","review":"I ordered this calculator desiring a much quieter alternative to the ribbon printing calculator one of my employees was using in the office.

My review does not reflect the quality of the product, per se, rather it is a review of how well the product suited my needs. The calculator is 13.75 inches long x 8.5 inches wide x 3.5 inches tall.

Warners probably took a fresh print from the original RKO materials, which in this case must have come down to us in decent shape (the RKO library is problematic). Warner's hasn't sterilized the film by eliminating absolutely all grain and speckle, however. The minor artifacts that remain are probably on the negative--literally part of the film itself.

Also, watching Mitchum being treated as a pin ball in a machine, soon makes you want to distrust everyone else in the picture, while looking for the frame too.It was a difficult movie to be in as almost everyone of note ends up dead and only the two people you would least suspect are the only ones having a shot, no pun intended, at a happy ending.This is truly a magnificent motion picture that will linger with the viewer, one to be watched again and again. I think I first saw the movie on TV in glorius black and white and not a thing has changed over the years.If you like Mitchum, Greer, and Douglas this is a film for you.

Too bad, she had nice lips."},{"rating":"2","title":"High-Class Noir","review":"\\"Out of the Past\\" is classic noir, filmed in black and white, released in 1947. It has high quality stars: Robert Mitchum plays private investigator Jeff Bailey, Jane Greer plays a sultry beauty named Kathie Moffat and Kirk Douglas plays a dashing multi-millionaire mobster with the classy name of Whit Sterling.Bailey is hired to find Sterling's missing mistress, Kathie and complications develop. Many good plot twists keep you interested and the movie is done with top notch directing and script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Past","review":"Replete with expressionistic lighting, ominous atmosphere, cynical dialogue, and a sizzling femme fatale--Jacques Tourneur's \\"Out of the Past\\" is quintessential film noir. In a star-making performance, Mitchum cemented his image as a laconic, world-weary fatalist while the white-hot Greer-- radiant as Kathie--makes one of the most sensual entrances in film history. All conspire to make Tourneur's \\"Past\\" damn close to perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite...","review":"from the past with a great lineup of actors and actresses like Mitchum, Douglas, Greer.

Including the other two that complete this triology. Genies, spells, enchanted palaces...quite a different venue than I am used to reading but very enjoyable. The story is complete, no loose ends left at the end and it truly brings a conclusion to the other books in the triology, yet you do not have to read them to get the gist of the story. Claire Delacroix will always be one of my favorite romance authors!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Bio","review":"This book helped tremendously with my study for the Biology CLEP exam. Everything in here is broken down into easy bite sized chunks with short reviews... so easy, you will wonder if you are actually learning anything. I assure you, if you struggle with biology (especially the Calvin and Kreb cycles and human anatomy) this book will help you develop the conceptual framework you need for a first year biology class or CLEP exam.

It is helpful to me as a sponsor and as a sponsee. The first part talks about what sponsorship is about and also what it isn't. The first half of the book is for someone looking for a sponsor and what they should look for. The second half of the book is for Sponsors and has some good guidelines for being a sponsor culled from the experience and wisdom of numerous people besides just the author. I was a little skeptical at first because it is not AA literature, but it is a Hazledon book which is acceptable. Being a sponsor in AA is not a professional role, so having a book like this can be helpful because what most people know about being a sponsor they learned from their sponsor. As AA as a community continues to evolve and grow, and old timers die, it's good to have additional wisdom for guidance. This is just my opinion, I do not speak for AA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guide for Sponsors","review":"This is an excellent resource for sponsors.

I now split up my exercise separating weight lifting from the cardio of Sprint 8. I was using high impact interval training prior to buying this book (low weights, high reps). While the whole program is a little more than I'm willing to do, I found it best for me to stay between level 3 & 4 (there are 5 levels of training in the book) and get much more benefit for the same amount of hours of training per week. I highly recommend the book for all levels of fitness"},{"rating":"1","title":"Key concept is undefined","review":"The author tells you to exercise at certain intensity levels but nowhere in the book is \\"intensity level\\" quantitatively defined. Instead, he tells you that when you are winded enough you at the right intensity level.The book sets out guidelines for aerobic exercise using heart rate but heart rate does not equal intensity rate. You are supposed to figure \\"intensity rate\\" out for yourself by how distressed you get while exercising.Sort of like that famous US Supreme Court definition of obscenity: I know it when I see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Learn the Sprint 8 Program this could have been a 2 page book","review":"If you were looking for detailed instructions on the Sprint 8 program this book could have been 2 pages. The content is fine but not original in any way and the number of times the author reiterates the Sprint 8 program gets old really fast. So if you are buying the book to learn the Sprint 8 program you don't need this book as it has been detailed on the author's website and many other websites. If you know nothing about exercise and want to learn how to exercise (lift weights, eat better etc.,) this may be a good book for you (very dated though)."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer \\"Jerome Back.\\".

All I kept getting back were more \\"articles\\" which weren't really artlikes at all, but extracts from the book. What's the use of selling information if you're not told how to put it into practical use?The book itself is about 70% longer than it needs to be due to print large enough to use on a billboard, completely useless photos, and puff pieces talking about the book itself! The thing could have been condensed to about 15-20 pages.The useless photos, wasted \\"hype space\\" for the book itself, and the AWFUL customer service mar any useful information.

The characters were so real and deep. I really got to know and love them. They felt like real women with real strengths and real problems and the real power to change their lives for the better.

Every 30 or 40-something woman should read this and feel the power for herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterical and REAL","review":"I picked this book up after reading the flap and the description, and decided to go ahead and buy it. I'm REALLY glad I did!! The characters are fun and REAL--they speak the way my friends and I speak.

Definitely a five star read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Charming and Real","review":"I loved this book. The characters were very real and so much like women I know.

I bought them because I like the seasonings that these chips feature, and I am a salty-snack junkie. The chips are quite stiff and heavy, and a single serving is so dense that you only get about 7 chips before you reach the one-ounce standard serving. The texture is a stale-hard crunchy combination similar to that of uncooked pasta. I have 10 bags of these only because I'm cheap and I can't bear to throw them away.

I had a fairly new XP system, but had to get a new high speed hard disk drive and DVD drive to try to use this hog, and still was dissatisfied.

It still can't run at highest settings without slowing down to an unusable crawl, so don't even bother to order it if you have anything less than the above. This is the ONLY application that ever made me feel my computer was seriously underpowered.

I can currently play pretty much any game on the market with no problems and good performance with decent frames rate. THIS SIM is BAD. I had to jack down all the settings to make it perform even so-so. Flight graphics very choppy and sluggish. Turning performance settings WAY down helps, but does not completly cure the issues.

I flew a cessna out of our hometown airport last night right in the midst of the snow storm we were experiencing! How cool is that?Be cautioned that this game requires some HEFTY graphics cards to be able to take full advantage of its splendor. I will be replacing my ATI 2600 PRO for a Geforce 8600 GT so I can get the full effect, but its a worthwhile upgrade!

First off, Microsoft took great lengths into detail, like how the baggage carts move, the gate opens, and it's almost like real life. However, your plane cannot blow up...COME ON! What ever happened to real world problems? Landing gear fails, out of gas, etc.?? All your plane does is keeps on rolling when it hits the ground. Now here's the catch. You really need to cough up the extra $$$ for a joystick to really get the MAX enjoyment out of this game. The mouse and keyboard don't cut it.

Following this associate giving a speech, Paul Revere said, \\"The more he proclaimed his honor, the faster we counted our spoons.\\" In this case, the more Ms. Ashrawi proclaims the divine right of Arabs to land they lost in a war they started, the less credible I found her argument.Again, I was really hoping for something good here - unfortunately, this book was a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"curious journal","review":"I found here a curious journal of personal thoughts and queries of someone searching their being; as if jotting down experiential flashes in an attempt to express oneself and be known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spe-cial: out of the ordinary; unusual; exceptional","review":"Not to often does a book come along that can change your life. \\"it is not enough to be a reflection.....when we are called it is with our own light that we answer.\\" Mrs. Kay has written a book of beautiful small poems and what amounts to be a vision into the heart of an amazing person.

Although this action figure looks GREAT, it does NOT perform well. The four tentacle arms are so heavy and long that Dr. Ock cannot stand up on his own; you MUST hold him up yourself. Also, the figure is NOT very durable. We have not had this item a week and one arm has a slight crack incurred while trying to remove his overcoat (the human arms do not bend well and removing the overcoat, while possible, is quite awkward). Today, while playing with it with my son, one of Dr. Ock's tentacles broke off at the joint where it joins his back so now only three tentacles can be used.

The author relies heavily on dialogue to impart information. Most writers do this from time to time to advance the story, but Maddox uses it almost exclusively. Worse, the dialogue is unnatural and repetitious. I'd like to know the word counts for \\"Mark\\" and \\"Eddie\\" since he has each of his main two characters calling the other by name in nearly every sentence. In addition, the author has a problem with grammar, and I often found it difficult to understand what he was trying to say. He often uses adjectives as nouns and sometimes drops prepositions. Did he have an editor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope you like dialogue","review":"All of the analysis in these other critiques is quite profound, and the philosophical thesis of this book is certainly interesting. I am surprised, however, that few others feel as I do: this text is unreadable. The whole freaking thing is dialogue. Rather than write \\"they decided to go to the store\\", Maddox writes \\"'Hey, wanna go to the store'...'Sure, let's go\\"...'okay'\\". Maybe this style is considered cutting edge and left-of-mainstream presentation in some circles, or maybe I got a gag version of this book that no one else has, but I really struggled to get through this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Grade C Movie in Book Form","review":"I won't bother reiterating what has been said about the book in other reviews. I bought the book based on many of them. The problem I have is not the ideas, they are quite interesting. The problem is in the execution. This book is so crudely written that I had to put it down. If Mr. Maddox could write he might actually create a very good novel, but this is klutzy to an extreme. I was simultaneously reading David McCullough's biography of John Adams and was struck by the elegance of his writing compared to Karl Mark Maddox's. But read the other reviews and take your choice, it is only money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable!","review":"After reading the reviews on this site, I thought that this would help me to examine all of my thoughts and beliefs. Other reviewers have said that this is a wonderful book for all intelligent and open-minded people. I decided to splurge and buy this book new, certain that it would be well worth the price.However, the writing is so horrible that I couldn't get past the first few pages. For all I know, it is as good as everybody says, but I didn't want to waste my time wading through badly written prose in the hopes of finding something meaningful. Maybe I'll pick it up again someday, when I have nothing else to read (which won't be anytime soon). Until then, it will just collect dust on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs an Editor but decent premise","review":"If you are Christian or other religion that requires belief in a divinity do not buy this book. This author makes a what if God does not exist claim, and in so doing states that humans will in the future, create god. A god that is capable of near everything to include giving that ability to all humans who qualify after eons of tutoring.The book also has some grammer shortcommings that shocked me occasionally, I suspect the publisher is to blame for this, but surprised that these errors were not caught. Some parts of the book flow amazingly well and are extremely enlightening, while others dismay.An environmentalist would love this book, basically it is a save the planet type read with the hopes of giving humankind a chance at self redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading, but is a thinker.","review":"The one evident item about SB: 1 or God is that Mr. Maddox is not compelled to satisfy lustful readers for creative style, but much more so for true creativity. This is an entertainment piece but with a design to inform. Maddox is right on target concerning many subjects and we could be rewarded considerably by heeding the warnings. This is the one book that I would recommend reading concerning our current situation. There is not another book on the market that compares to SB 1 concerning world destiny. By all means get a copy and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it zero stars","review":"One of the worst books I've ever tried to read -- and I'm an avid reader of science fiction (which is the gendre the author puts this books into) as well as alternative history, futurism and religion. But this is simply atrocious. I'm sorry that the 5-star reviewers haven't read anything more inspiring than this overwrought diatribe. Besides the annoyingly quirky syntax and stilted dialog, it's filled with such laughably innane concepts such as 'the city of God's people' which has streets paved with pure gold and gates incrusted with precious jewels. Please -- just a little creativity would have been refreshing. I can't even get into the trite and unimaginative construct he calls the 'blue spot'. I was hoping for a great read based on all these reviews but this isn't even a 1-star book. Don't get me wrong, the author's message is a good one -- but we've heard it all before -- many, many times in many (better) ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider the source...","review":"Search the author's name yourself. Check out the acts for which he is wanted for in Oregon. Don't forget the accusations that the author has written 90% of the 5 star reviews himself.Then ask yourself if such a person really has anything worth hearing about God, life's meaning...any wisdom at all. The author's actions speak so loud, they drown out any words he has to say...or write.Men construct idols to worship, of gods made in the image of their own, fallen human nature, rather than submit in repentance and faith to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior sent to free us from such idolatry.Jesus said that a bad tree produces bad fruit. So why take a chance with your hard-earned money on a very dubious source, when there are so many truly excellent books out there to choose from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well thought out","review":"SB:1 or God is a very well thought out book written by an intelligent author. It is the examination of an alternative view of the origin of God, or what could defined as God from a realistic perspective. The book is very thought provoking, although somewhat unsubstantiated at times; leaving the reader to rely on the facts at face value. However, this is a necessary evil because of the depth of many of the arguments. Basically, the author lays out a possible version of the workings of human existence and the meaning of life. And in doing so, refutes some portions of the Bible while supporting others...very interesting, indeed. The author wants us to really consider, \\"What if?\\" and the implications that follow.In essence, a thought provoking book with an extremely creative premise. Definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"After reading the other reviews I ordered a copy of the book. I dont see what the hoopla was all about. As far as science fiction goes, it was amaturish. As philosophy the idea's put forth are nothing new, and the dialog was tedious.

He has extensive experience with native shamen and tells of his adventures in a way that allows the reader to grasp the ecstatic methods of these priests. His is not the sum of all knowledge on shamanism and it can be seen as a condensed version, but this is still a very good book to begin with. His techniques are good enough to allow one to develop a shamanic connection from within themselves and their own culture. This book is NOT a rip-off of native practices. No one culture can claim to be the first shamen, everyone's ancestors practiced it at some point. For those who wish to journey, this book will guide you to your path and from there, you can fly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of senile trash","review":"Michael Harner seemed a serious scholar at the New School For Social Research in the 1970's, and his The Jivaro seemed a serious book.

It is an easy to read and understand book. I would recommend reading for anyone who is looking to start their journey into shamanism or for someone who has already began.

They give you the inner tools to awaken to the shamanic path."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harner's version of Shamanism","review":"Harner's work has been eclipsed by many authentic ethnical and tribal sources. The reading here is very dated. What he presents is a stripped down version (antiseptic) of some techniques for journeying. But Harner's philosophy is pretty locked into what drum-beat rhythms work and this is simply not true, not required to do shamanic journeys. You will get a very slanted almost confined view. And that is the antithesis to shamanism in general.Shamanism is best accessed, especially for the beginner, within some cultural context and Harner has cleansed his techniques away from their cultures. Even his views (and his disciples Ingerman) on soul retrieval are still changing due to lack of root within cultural context.If you are new to shamanism then start instead with The Book of the Shaman by Nicholas Wood. If you are into some healing aspects then goto Shaman, Healer, Sage by Villoldo or Woman who glows in the dark by Elena Avila."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled","review":"I'm a bit upset by the number of people who have been fooled by this book. I can say this because I am Native American, and 'Shamanism' has always been in my family. This author has stolen our traditions, took them as his own, warped them, and is now attempting profit. I would have given this book a lower rating if it were possible. Please don't look to him as an authority on this subject. He doesn't even always focus on the important aspects of 'Shamanism' anyway, he kind of gets caught up in his own ideals of it.For those of you who're sincerely interested in this subject, just look inside yourself. Realize there is no 'imagination', pay attention to what you feel, and knowledge will come.

Harner begins with a simple discussion of the background ideas of the shamanic worldview, then gives instructions for the basic methods of shamanic trance, gaining a spirit-ally and using the new skills for healing and personal power and growth.

It is a compact but comprehensive report of experiences, techniques and thoughts of shamans and scholars that devoted to the study of shamanism. The book denotes a long period of serious practical learning and research. It presents also a very intersting philosophical and spiritual point of view of the relation of humans with all other beings and Nature. The comments presented and the techniques proposed by the author as adapted to our western way of life, consitute a practical guide to those intending to introduce themselves to the practice of shamanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harnerism not Shamanism","review":"This book is commercialized shamanism. Although interesting and well written it is one of the many tools Harner has used to make a name for himself at the expense of others. He has studied different forms of Shamanism extensively, but he takes their \\"core\\" and fits it into a nice neat package with an artistic cover. Taking Shamanism out of context is degrading to the cultures for whom Shamanism is an integral part of their life. Harner has taken the opportunity to put someone elses spirituality up for sale. I suggest readers of this book to read Paul C. Johnson's article \\"Shamanism from Ecuador to Chicago: A Case Study in New Age Ritual Appropriation.\\" It can be found in the journal Religion (April 1995)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks, Michael--Not.","review":"Here it is, the little book that started the big (and profitable) idea that \\"shamanism\\" is an open-to-all, homogenous \\"religion\\" you can join just as you might join a Christian church.

If lying on your bed listening to a drumming tape or shelling out several hundred bucks to attend a workshop makes you a shaman, then watching Yentl makes you a rabbi. Believe what you want to believe, but sue me if I don't come to any of your healing ceremonies (or brises). Anyone who really wants to study Native ways out of admiration for them will research what Native people the world over have to say about \\"shamanism\\" (and I mean the majority, not just the ones who want your money).

It is an eye-opener and educates the reader on many issues that traditional vets do not discuss with their clients.

It is highly compassionate, interesting and very informative. After reading it, one will understand the dangers of low grade commercial food and the debilitating effects of vaccines on our companions. The book contains a comprehensive list of diseases and its possible solutions. The last two chapters of this book were outstanding! This book is highly recommended. I am very glad that in I am close to a Holistic Vet here in beautiful San Antonio."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REAL EYE OPENER","review":"The first thing I did, before I even finished the book, was to throw out all the commercial dog & cat food in the house. I will NEVER feed any of my pets that food again. My one dog, suffering from hot spots that started to appear under her paw pads, also developed a growth (within a two week period of time), and arthritis. Only 5 yrs. old, even I knew this wasn't NORMAL. I took her to a more progressive vet for a 2nd opinion, and it was she who recommended this book. Dr. Goldstein book was an eye opener about food, water, vaccines and a holistic approach to health. He also lists the names of holistic vets in the back along with other vital information. My dog's growth is shrinking! And under the efforts of her new holistic vet, her other problems are showing improvement. If you have a pet and Love it, this book is a MUST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely inspiring","review":"It took me less than a week to read this book. I am a veterinarian in Tenneessee that practices conventional medicine. While I do not see the end to this any time soon, this book has inspired me to try more holistic methods. I have been interested in that approach for several years and am glad to see that there is interest from all angles. If only it was so easy to just stop conventional medicine and start holistic medicine! Dr. Goldstein is right on the money with his dietary suggestions. All pet owners and veterinarians should read this book, if for nothing more than a testimony to the human animal bond!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"Although I'm still in the process of reading this book, I've already learned so much about animal healing from Dr. Goldstein. This book really opens your mind up about what type of food to feed your pets and holistic medicine vs. conventional medicine. This book made me think twice before I buy any pet food in stores or when deciding to bring my pet to a vet. Dr. Goldstein's findings are backed up by research data and his own personal experience as a Veterinarian and pet owner. I highly recommend this book to all pet owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Healing","review":"Every pet owner should be reading this - your pets will be grateful!

I had expectations that I would learn something new, but alas, I did not. I have used a holistic vet for years and this was the same old thing. I thought he would go into more detail on treatments.

If you are interested in reading about one vet's proud experiences and ideas of his own practice, then this book is for you.There is some useful and interesting information throughout the book, but I find Goldstein rather arrogant and narrow minded in his writing. The meat of this book is about his own case studies (in the form of stories), which aren't very thorough and contain a lot of ramblings on of his own interests and ideals.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. If you are interested in learning more about holistic and natural care for your pet, there are so many other books out there. Leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had this book years ago!","review":"I have several books on natural healing and feeding of our pets. I started with an adopted puppy that was not doing well on any of the better commercial brands. This book has reinforced that I am doing the right things, and sadly I could have done more for my beloveds that I had before him. I am making sure that everyone in my family has a copy, as well as our veterinarians. If my current vet isn't willing to work with me, I will find another."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFULL, POWERFUL.... with love.","review":"This book is written by a doctor who pratcies what he preaches! I couldn't put it down, that is how powerful his message is. I've tried for years to help my family to lead healthly active lives. I now have the information to do the same with my dear pet campanions. He also offers Web Sites, Pet Supply Companies, Help Groups that can be the information sources & and others with common cares. For those of us who care this book is a God send & not the complicated event you think it might be. Slainte!

I tried some of the suggestions in it and, although I was hoping for the \\"miracles\\" that Dr. Goldstein suggests happens, I didn't have that experience myself. I can't say that he's wrong, but I don't believe in his magic cures. I still think nutrition is very important, but a good book doesn't build up your hopes just to let you down. This book has some good points but, in general, I think it's full of a lot of stuff that can't be proven by medical science, and I personally didn't have a lot of luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Information","review":"If you are looking for more information, as I have been, this is a good book. It was very helpful. I am reading practically everything I can find regarding dog health as my 4 -year old Siberian cross just developed epilepsy. I have discovered that each book I get has an extra bit of information that I did not glean before from other books. (Good for the booksellers, right?) But seriously, it has good information! I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this book!!","review":"I am so glad I found this book! It opened my eyes to so many things that I had wondered about. Dr. Goldstein writes in such an easy manner, and though it is very informative it's also enjoyable to read. I highly recommend this book and I think every animal lover and pet owner should own a copy. I have used the reference portion in treating my pets for ailments when I couldn't get to a vet or to supplement their veterinary care. This will be a mainstay in my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really informative....","review":"This book is one of the most helpful and educational veterinary books I've ever read.

I only wish he had been nearby when I lost my beloved 8 year old golden retriever to lymphoma earlier this year....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome stuff!!!","review":"This is a great product.

Basically this is a book of color illustrations reproduced in dull, muddy gray-tones. There is maybe, at most, 5 pages of text and 5 pages of color illos but I'm probably overestimating. So don't buy this one for information and the illos are terrible. You're better off buying the actual works by these illustrators rather than waste your money only to be subjected to the hash this publisher has made of them. Truly disappointing in every aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Sound","review":"This unique sound is very enjoyable. Ian Anderson and the band will never be copied, because they are totally original. Very creative melodies, the heartbeat of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"this band is TIGHT!","review":"Here is a recording that both at once makes you feel like you are in the Scottish highlands and at the same time watching a good old garage band that is really hitting their stride together..its both old and new, mellow and heavy(not in a heavy metal sense), and a great example of musicians who play together as ONE unit. Jethro Tull is one of the most unique band of musicians and this is a great start for anyone interested in a listen. Not for the faint of heart...you will either love it or hate it, but you wont deny the quality of the songwriting or musicianship!"},{"rating":"2","title":"true album-oriented rock","review":"When I first heard this album, at its time of release in the 70s, I was hooked. Coming from an Anglo-Saxon heritage, it naturally stirs my soul and is one of those rare albums that gives one the illusion of a total diversion from the present day when sequestered under headphones. It is by far the very best of Tull to me, if I were made to make a choice. A lot of thought, and no doubt research into madrigals, went into its concept. At its release, no one had conceptualized whole albums like Tull could. What's remarkable is how repeatedly playable the album was, and still is, at a time when no one published recordings anything like them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I might make you feel, but I can't make you...","review":"THINK. What are the chances that someone botched the recording of each track of ALL TWENTY of Jethro Tull's studio albums, such that each needs desperately to be mucked about with (or \\"remastered\\")?THINK. If attaching out-takes, interviews, radio snippets, and live recordings, pretty much whatever can be dredged up, in fact, to ALL TWENTY of Jethro Tull's studio albums constitutes a bonus, why doesn't it incur the record company any extra expense? 1) No extra physical material is being proffered; these \\"bonus tracks\\" are not being put on separate discs so that you can listen only when you feel inclined. 2) All the \\"bonus tracks\\" had already been recorded and were lying about; there was no recording overhead either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their very best","review":"Jethro Tull has had many albums in their long career. Most artists who last that long have an album that stands out from the rest.Aqualung is probably their biggest seller and most popular.I personally like to listen to Songs from the Wood. When Ian Anderson did this CD he was at the top of his game.This album contains: Songs from the Wood, Jack in the green, Hunting girl, Ring out solstice bells, Velvet green and my personal favorite, The Whistler, which includes a very lively piccolo.The flavor of this release is Celtic. Personally I love Celtic music, especially the way Jethro Tull does it. If you like Tull you need to get this one if you don't already have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, maybe THIS is my least favorite Tull album.","review":"This has got to be the least meaningful, and most frivolous, Tull album ever. Apparently Ian had grown tired philosophical jousting, and wanted to take a mental vacation in the country with his pants zipped none too tightly.Thank goodness it wasn't a permanent retirement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The glory years of Tull","review":"My final analysis: Tull reached their musical apex with the power trio of Heavy Horses, Stormwatch and this wonderful musical experience known as Song for the Wood.

The magnets are VERY weak. The pieces are keyed with a little bit of plastic that sticks out of the middle (I would assume this feature was needed to help hold the whole thing together because the magnets are so weak)But it prevents you from building anything else. Once the item is built and the stickers are on it is just basically a building (and a big one at that.)

Really stinky toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Staple for Everyday Cooking","review":"If you grew up in the 1950s, and your mother did not use Fannie Farmer, GoodHousekeeping nor The Joy of Cooking, chances are she used The Basic Cookbook. This is still an irreplaceable cookbook for the homecook who would like to cook nutritious meals along with a daily dessert without breaking the bank. It includes the kinds of recipes that are out-of-fashion but are delicious and inexpensive to make, such as homemade puddings, basic nine serving sheet cakes and cookies. Long forgotten recipes for meringue cookies such as cornflake kisses may be a revelation to young cooks.

Specifically, because it represents two men originally motivated, given the time, by worthy ideals, but who become antagonists through events and machinations of others beyond their control.

Not only was the presentation itself very poor (sloppily formatted, typos on some of the pages) but the content was so simplistic and obvious that it was almost embarrassing. Halebsky's suggestions are for exactly the type of activities/discussions I throw together in 3 minutes when I haven't had time to prepare a \\"real\\" group. My participants are extremely demanding--they need to be entertained and active while participating in the therapeutic process. I was hoping for a book that would give me some fresh new ideas about providing experiences for them, rather than the same old chitchat which they find repetitive and boring, but this book wasn't it.

As some have noted the repeated CGI scenes detract from the audio telling of the story. Your ears hear something new going on, but the scene is from another battle depicted previously. Also when this series was originally telecast it may have made sense to remind the viewer with flashbacks of something previously shown a week or two before, but if you are watching the programs, not week to week, but maybe one right after the other, the flashbacks are boring. So why give this series four stars? Simply because it presents meaningfully much background that I have not seen or read before. This series raises the most interesting of questions. Had Eisenhower not held Patton back in order to feed Montgomery's quest for glory would there ever have been a Battle of the Bulge? There is much to suggest that with Patton the Germans would have not had time to mount a winter offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice work","review":"My only complaint was that this series could use some editing.I appreciate that they removed the advertisements but they needed to also remove theteases (normally used to bait you to not switch away your TV during advertisement) andthe recapitulation (summary when you return from the ad).

I couldn't stand it... had to get a Linksys instead that has no such problem.Oh, and one more thing: you need cables that are different than the regular KVM switch cables.

Each synopsis seems to be a repeat of the previous one depending on the region. Sticking pretty much to the main highways and spending far too much time in the big cities (8 places in Pittsburgh alone) the repetitious style starts to wear thin. In NJ (My home state) you are pretty much limited to subs and hot dogs. This is repeated throughout the book, lobster roll and clams in New England, BBQ and fried food in the south, you get the picture. Occasionally peppered throughout are a few personal commentaries about the people and places, but I think this could have been a more useful guide by focusing on fewer places with more detail. The summary says you should carry it with you, but its size keeps it from being a good traveling companion, especially considering its narrow culinary focus.

Half of each essay is devoted to the specifics of 'initiation rituals' in each sect, the other half to lore related to the sect or the sect's place in history. The author's thesis is that, throughout history, all secret society initiation rites are very similar and are all about 'brainwashing'. Pretty wide coverage including: the Assassins, Knights Templar, Sufi, Gnostics, Witches, Rosicrucians, and Tongs. Some of my other favorite sects/cults are missing.

Very big JEERS AND SNEERS as Paramount once again makes us pay money to watch its advertisements. Be prepared for 5-10 minutes of advertising you can't fast-forward through in order to watch your DVDs. You can even use the \\"title menu\\" button. All standard control methods to bypass the advertising have been blocked on the disks.The show is a first rate 5-star accomplishment. The product, or rather its company, is turning into a 1-star annoyance with each new disk they put out. Hence the overall low rating I give this set of DVDs as a product, not as a show. I paid for a show, not as tricked funding for advertising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dvd's!","review":"Frasier is one of my favorite shows and I am SO happy to know that I can purchase these dvd's and at such a great price!

NO deleted scenes. NO bloopers. NO interviews with the actors or creators. NO commentary. What DO we get? ADS! Crass commercialism has spoiled the legacy of Frasier, a show that so many people worked so hard on. The Seinfeld fans get extras galore. Seinfeld Season 4 has 13 HOURS of exclusive special features! We loyal Frasier stalwarts get nothing. This fan is very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking forward to Season 6 already..","review":"This season was hilarious..

The first time I heard Junior Jack was winter of 2002-2003 with the song \\"Thrill Me.\\" I thought it was very different than anything else that was out at the time, and loved it. Then I didn't hear anything from them...until last summer with \\"E Samba\\" playing in clubs and I heard the vocal collaboration with Robert Smith (The Cure)on \\"Da Hype\\" and couldn't believe these were the \\"Thrill Me\\" guys, and went nuts! I had to find out who these guys were!!!!! Then \\"Stupidisco\\"........whoa!! Got the album and am so impressed with it. Every song goes into each other smoothly, even with the blend of funk, soul, latin, and house. Highly recommended to liven up the party, to put on doing chores, or takin a drive with the windows down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the Influence!","review":"Junior Jack's \\"Trust it\\" is among the greatest house albums out there right now with the smash hit \\"Da Hype\\" that is samples from Human League's \\"Don't you want me\\" the samba influented \\"E Samba\\" that was a big hit in the summer 2003 and now yet another wonderful club hit in \\"Stupidisco\\" with female voice samples. The album is filled with wonderful house music with influents from all over the world, there's simply a great variety of songs here. Junior Jack had a big club hit long time ago with \\"My Feelings\\" and the've been making load of remixes but this is actually their first album i think. The result is amazing, apart from the songs i mentioned, there's funk (Trust it), soul,(alone) jazz( the roots) and latin (hola) inspired songs, if you haven't discovered house yet, it's time! and don't foget to turn up the volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very best!","review":"I've had this CD since the late 1980s and I'm now on my second copy.

The songs are soothing and relaxing and uplifting. This is one Christmas CD that I absolutely would not be without. 10 stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll either love it or hate it!","review":"No-one likes this album: they either love it or they hate it. It polarises people.Upon first listening to A Passion Play I was quite disappointed, especially when compared with Thick As A Brick, Jethro Tull's previous concept album. 'Why did I buy this junk?' I thought. My second listen felt a little better. By the third listen I was addicted.It's fairly similar in structure to Thick As A Brick, though much darker in feeling. Brilliant chord progression and licks. I love the little intermission where \\"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\\" is told, backed with amazingly suitable music and other effects.I absolutely love this album. It's a very close second to Thick As A Brick for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album! though not for some","review":"A Passion Play is a muiscal masterpiece, equal to its counterpart concept album \\"Thick AS A Brick\\". Although I may think its great others may not because its very UNIQUE style, Ian shows us how extremely diverse and yet exceptional his song writing can be. The Story of \\"The Hare who lost his Spectacles\\" is amusing and is supposed be, so don't whine about it. The album is not for everyone, so if you don't like twenty minute long songs, or didn't like the other Tull concept album \\"Thick As A Brick\\" than don't buy this one. However if you already own this album and do enjoy it, you may also enjoy \\"NightCap\\" which includes the first failed attempt of this album and a sseperate disc of rare Tull tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone please help re: JT's \\"A Passion Play\\" album","review":"What is wrong with \\"this version\\" of the CD?

But don't worry--it's like Thick As a Brick, only a bit more connected. Packed with symbolism, religous references, instrumentals, and everything else in between, APP is one of Tull's stronger song/albums.The overture will probably grind your nerves, as will a few other parts (A couple instrumentals, for example), but the organ part is stunning, as is Ian Anderson's flute playing (as usual). I also like the theme and the \\"Story of a Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\\", a must-hear (I'm serious--in the middle of the song, Ian Anderson yells out, \\"This is the story of a hare who lost his spectacles\\" and then they kick into a fairytale or something like that.) A perfect purchase for all Tull fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"...lose the spectacules","review":"Just a brief note for rock-music historians. Shortly after the release and critical acclaim of the Thick As A Brick recording, both fans and critics alike were anxiously awaiting Tull's next musical effort. Passion Play just built on the foundation already laid by Thick. Just skip the first 4 minutes of, the \\"Hare Who Lost His Spectacules\\" track, and you will have a CD worthy of any Tull collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"no need for \\"hare\\"","review":"It would have been 5 stars but right in the middle of the album \\"THE HARE WHO LOST HIS SPECTACLES\\" but with a little editing....The rest of the album is as good as \\"brick\\" yes i said it \\"AS GOOD\\"!

A great album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lotsa Tull fans love this one...but not me.","review":"I guess there is something to A Passion Play that I may be tone deaf to, but many Tull fans swear this is one fo the best.

You can pump up to a little higher number, and this device slowly comes back down and really give you a clear picture of your blood pressure. Something to do with it that could be critical is to take your blood pressure about two hours after you start taking your medications if you do that. Oxycodine sent my blood pressure from the 123/71 area up to the 180/133.

I purchased this on my Doctor's recommendation to get a cuff type because he felt the wrist band monitor's were not as accurate. Well, we could not get an accurate reading from the LifeSource and it actually HURT when pumped to the point were it signaled it was ready to start. To be fair my wife and I have a lot of body fat (large arms, but we ordered the large size cuff) and this may affect the accuracy of the reading and the pressure required. I like the manual inflate concept and wish it would have worked for us. But it did not and we returned it and continue to use the ForeCare Model 1300 wrist band monitor my in-laws gave us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable, painful product","review":"I've used this product about a dozen times. It is painful to use because the pressure ticks down 1 point at a time and it takes minutes to get a reading. My arm tingles and I usually have a headache afterward. On several occasions it has failed to even give me a reading. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"LifeSource UA-704V Blood pressure monitor","review":"This has been a great purchase! The cuff is convenient and easy to use. I have owned the product for about one month now and have been impressed with the apparent durability and quality. The one feature that I especially appreciate is the manual inflation.

It is a great value and as a nurse I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work!","review":"Ordered this monitor to check my husband's BP every day, on doctor's orders.

Had the visiting nurse try it and she also had no success.Returned it to Amazon the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuff is too large","review":"It is a great product, even if it doesn't measure perfect all the time, it is pretty close. If your blood pressure is too low/high, the device will show it. However, the cuff may be too large, even for large people. I am overweight, and by going with the measurement, I should be using the medium cuff. But it still measures my blood pressure correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with small cuff!","review":"I understood that this comes with a medium cuff and knew that would be too big for me, so I ordered the Lifesource small cuff at the same time. I liked the fact I wouldn't need to buy batteries constantly, so didn't mind the extra cost of buying a separate cuff. But when the item arrived, the box stated NOT compatible with Lifesource small cuff! This information was nowhere on the online information.

Most western readers are not aware of the fact that while all of Christian Europe was in the dark ages, the intellectual culture of the early greeks and Romans was being preserved and expanded upon by the Muslims. The Muslims have made tremendous contributions in the areas philosophy, art, poetry, astronomy, medicine, etc. If the religion was flawed, as Miller suggests, this period of flourishing would not be possible. The situation as it exists in the Middle East today is one that is perpetuated by the west (i.e. U.S.) in order to maintain their oil interests.

First of all, the ceremony is supposed to be secret so that any new Knight that participates is not informed prior to the ceremony. Knowing the outcome takes a lot of the charm and suspense out of the ceremony, if the candidate already knows what lessons are to be taught.What I read were excerpts from the official handbook that are not supposed to be handed out in the public domain. The worst part was that there were huge parts missing. The book is a shame because it was plagiarized from the Knights of Columbus and is not beneficial at all. IT really should be taken off the market.I feel that I was deceived and need to be refunded my money.Dennis- in Houston"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not complete","review":"I found several printed pages but mostly blank pages.

A kid who raised a horse and made it a champ (just like her mother!). Also notice how we find out about all the characters and how they've grown up. The Townsends son is snotty like his parents. This book has DETAIL and it has both racing AND eventing. This is probably the best book in the Thoroughbred series, it hooks you, it's realistic, and Christina has grit, she goes on through her injury. This book kind of made a dead end though. That's okay, Joanna probably didn't think they would skip 10 years (10 years is at least 10 books!), to the futureand drop everything and mutate the series.

I am also glad that in the new books Christina is with Parker, not Kevin. But other than those things, I wish the new books were more like this one. I also liked Rebecca, Christina's best friend in this book, a lot better then Melanie.

Any no name writer could spin this tale of John Constantine, it's suprising to see the Ennis name on it. Constantine himself loses most of what made him so cool in other Ennis works...

It's hard to imagine such a prolific climber fading away at such a young age, you don't hear about him much now-a-days. This book isn't really written in chronological order and each chapter really can almost stand alone. Details his trips to Austraila and Germany the best. Gives insight into the statement I hear often climbing, 'Oh, that's a Henry Barber route,' which mean that it was probably hard. A must read for any Northeast based climber."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product helped me lose weight","review":"I am amazed with the results I achieved with this product.

Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good info but not well organized","review":"There is some good info in this book but the principle criticism with is a major lack of organization of the material. It is almost as though the topics were written on little pieces of paper, thrown into a hat, and then drawn one at a time and associated to chapter 2, chapter 3, etc. For example, a discussion of binary numbers and network addressing, a preliminary topic, is left until chapter 8.\\"VLSMs\\" and \\"IP unnumbered\\" are combined into one chapter. Although both topics can be thought to solve a similar problem, not much of a case is made for that. There are actually no chapters specific to routing protocols, the heart of routing. Instead, an assumption seems to be made that the reader is already familiar with routing protocols, in spite of the first chapter assuming the reader knows nothing about routing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book to add to one's library.","review":"I'm not a network engineer, I'm a recruiter specializing in recruiting network engineers, so much of this book is a bit too technical for me.However, this book has been an extremely valuable reference for someone like me who at times will need to research specific networking topics.IP Routing Primer speaks in a manner that is easy to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than Nothing","review":"Not really much of a dictionary, in my view -- e.g., the entry for \\"TIS\\" simply tells you what the acronym stands for.

Looking at someone's point of view who has dealt with type 1 diabetes for most of her life and how she handled her care, monitoring of blood sugars, medical personnel, emotions, and relationships has put a whole new look on how I should or shouldn't teach and help my own child with this disease. The author made me understand completely what she had dealt with and how, making living with diabetes more understandable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drudge to read","review":"Reviews of this book - particularly from sufferers of diabetes - tend to be favourable. However, for me, this book was unreadable.Her style is that of a diary, with sentences comprised of just a few words. You encounter a period/full stop on nearly every line. There is hardly a chance to get going with this book.I skipped chapters hoping that the style would settle down. It does not and I gave up reading this book depositing it in the trash bin. I very much doubt I could sell it on ebay for anything apart from the cost of postage.Perhaps the content may be of interest to diabetics, but otherwise it's a depressing mournful series of short sentences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unappealing Narrator","review":"I really wanted to like this book, and I wanted to like the narrator, because she has been through hell with her diabetes. But I found her attitudes toward the medical profession and her family hard to empathize with. She comes across as selfish and self-absorbed. A good medical narrative should offer some perspective on the \\"big picture,\\" I feel, not just the world of the patient. She's a competent writer, but she's hampered by her \\"This happened and then that happened,\\" prose style, and never looks into what others might be thinking and feeling. The prose began to feel so robotic, and so humorless, I found myself skipping paragraphs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, and at the same time, tremendously true to life.","review":"\\"Needles\\" is an amazing book. Being a diabetic for nearly 26 of my 29 years, I was certain that the last thing I would want to read about was diabetes. Ms Dominick blew me away! I was emotionally touched by the personal, familial aspects of the book. The whole sister-sister relationship/bond was quite profoundly moving for me. In addition to the emotional reaction, I found myself wondering at times if the author knew something of my childhood/adulthood with diabetes. I often saw myself in the pages of this book. I suspect that many diabetics would say the same.I was thoroughly impressed by Ms Dominick's account of a lifetime with diabetes. It was not soft-pedaled and was presented realistically. People on \\"the outside\\" can nonchalantly say that this disease is controllable and therefore not a big deal. I applaud Ms Dominick for telling the truth about it and telling it so eloquently."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is wierd, not even 1 star","review":"I have purchased this movie twice, looking for the movie that is described in the synopsis, the second time thinking that there had been a mis-labeling the first time around.

The concept of going inside a reality dating show & mocking the surrealness is great. I just feel the concept didn't hit the mark. Everthing seemed to flash by quickly and only the ending surprised me.The main character's plan of going on the show as fictional character (that would appear castworthy to the network) was novel, but it never carried out. The book would've been the same with or without that angle. It served to do nothing but add more strange elements that felt underdeveloped.I never really felt like I was there, or even \\"outside looking in\\" when reading this novel. I simply felt like I was reading a book with a big black rain cloud hanging over it.In short, great concept...less than perfect execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"bo-o-o-o-o-ring","review":"Wow, I feel like I read a different book than the other reviewers! I enjoy reality television and Nick Hornby, to whom comparisons have been made, but I thought this book was neither interesting nor particularly well written. While the premise is terrific, a schlump creating a more interesting character to get onto a reality show, the execution was lame. Joseph and his alter-ego Jeb are almost indistinguishable, and neither is likable (nor terribly interesting). Also, there should have been a rich stock of reality-tv stereotypes, but the people \\"Jeb\\" encounters are one-dimensional and too much alike.

I actually took so long to put in the update because of personal reasons.After wearing this chain, in about 3 days, the pearl fell off on its own some where. there was no force applied.

The \\"new\\" races require signifigant adjustment to either bring them into acceptable PC power levels or large adjustments in the ECL. At first I thought the core classes might save this book but I was mistaken. They too are extremely over powered. Aditionally the prestige classes are just plain silly. Even the spells are over powered.

Mueller is obviously a fan, and sometimes finds things to praise in films that are actually pretty dull (\\"The Sky's the Limit,\\" \\"Belle of New York\\"). But unlike most movie books, this one is fully thought-out, beautifully written, and just about exhaustive. Even the footnotes and appendices make entertaining reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astaire Dancing","review":"Astaire Dancing is a wonderful tribute to the great Fred Astaire.

A wonderful book with loads of pictures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book for Astaire's Dancing Artistry","review":"Mueller's book is uniquely about Fred Astaire's dancing movies.All of them. One for each chapter. He covers almost every dance, and analyzes them in such detail as only a dancer, perhaps, can appreciate. I read this book a chapter a day, and watched almost all the movies. The book can be tedious in its detail, but his comments on the dances you've seen and the stories behind the scenes add to your understanding of the films and how they were made. He sees things you don't see in a first viewing of a film. Mueller's commentary can also be heard in several of the film DVDs as a special feature. He says less about Astaire's singing: he was a great interpreter of so many standards that were written for him. There was none better in expression of the lyric. Perhaps someone should write a book on his singing, which was a part of his great artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immensely better than stock H1 bulbs!","review":"Our subaru had dim headlights - but no more!

We haven't put them to an outdoor test, but I'm imagining the end that sticks out beyond the actual handle will be cut from the metal rubbing.

What really gives the game away is a segment with Phyllis Diller in which comes out and announces that it's Mothers' Day.

The picture quality is great, even in the daylight. The sound quality is about as good as it gets without adding amplifiers. And the surround effects are excellent as well. We paired it with a 12\\" monitor for the rear seats, as well as with IR wireless headsets so we can listen to music if we don't want to watch the movie with the kids. The only thing I would want added to it is a front Aux jack for iPods or stuff like that.Also, we grounded the green wire for the parking brake sensor to the black common ground and that allows the movies to play while driving.

Trobisch's untimely death in 1979 has left a hole in the Christian community. His warmth and caring glow through these works. His rich experience with both life and His Lord ooze from the texts of these letters where he so tenderly answers to those of his flock in need. Though many might not agree with everything Trobisch writes, pastors, counselors, helpers of every kind, and just plain, ordinary folk have a timeless mine of treasure available to them in this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"a GREAT poster!","review":"We got this for our son who LOVES space!

But, short of that, any Board of Directors should have this book as a guide to understanding the depth of their own responsibilities, how to manage a consultant, the seriousness of the effort and planning ongoing giving programs. I did not give it a 5 only because it does not spell out oversite structures for committees.

It's quick and straight forward. The book flows well; containing easy to understand concepts and explanations. The examples get a bit tedious at times, but they are relevant and provide good insight into the author's intent.Having worked with sheep, I will say that if you put a sheep on your shoulders, they will urinate on you (natural reaction to almost anything -good or bad- seems to be to urinate). With that in mind, a good shepherd isn't going to have much choice but to smell a bit 'iffy' assuming they have really been taking care of their flock.

Buy Elvis or Annie Lennox, Robert Plant or Cheap Trick....at least you will get real talent who deserve our money and attention. If you think this is Avril's only fake, just go to any of her concerts. She can barely sing on key or remember lyrics.

I shouldn't have to shut down ALL automatic updates everytime I want to play the game.

It just will NOT keep a sharp edge and getting one on it is no trivial effort if even possible. I have 3 steels, a knife sharpening stone block, a Chef's Choice electrical sharpener and they all, to a tee, cannot get an edge on this crazy knife. God knows I've tried. I know my knives too because I own 3 Globals, 2 Wustoffs, 2 Shun Pros and several Calphalon knives - which I think certain Calphalon knives are far, far better. It's not always the co$t of an item.

The biggest pocket is for the camera and then there are two other littler pockets which can be used for a memory card or any other small camera accessory. It also comes with a over the shoulder strap which makes it very convenient. On the back of the camera case, there is a Velcro strap that can be used as a belt clip.

Musically, if I remember there were only 3 instrumentalists, with the one guitar player having to play in a way that \\"filled\\" as much space as he could, instead of being able to play in a way that creates \\"ambience\\" like on their studio albums. Another dissapointment is that the album doesnt really have a strong \\"new\\" song in it! I mean after all these years, they could have written one new song!

Since the juicer can only do one piece at a time, my drinks tend to get layered by the order in which I juice each piece of fruit or vegetable, and straws aren't always strong enough to mix up the juice well. I also use this for mixing powdered mixes with water or milk, which I prefer to drink cold even though warm water mixes them better. I never need to heat up my drinks anymore in order to mix them - I love this product. I received the purple color by random for a few dollars less than being able to choose my color, and it was entirely worth it. All three pieces are very easy to clean with soap and water, and a sponge every few uses on the ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a paragon of practical design! The lid screws down and the mouthpiece cover snaps in tightly, so you can dump in the liquid and the protein powder, batten down the hatches, and shake it all together. It has a spherical whisk inside - appropriately called a \\"blender ball\\" - that breaks up the protein powder as you shake with minimal bubbles, thus largely eliminating the foamy head problem of mixing the powder in a blender. (There were no lumps, either, unlike mixing with a spoon or fork.) I did a brief \\"antigravity\\" test (I turned it upside down and shook it for a few seconds) and there was nary a drop spilled, leading me to believe that there are possibilities of being able to prop this upright in my messenger bag with some liquid in it for protein shakes on the go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller is better","review":"My husband had the original larger size for his protein shakes but it never calls for that much product.

It's a lousy excuse for a cultural film, composed as it is of a seemingly endless montage of architecture, horse-drawn carriages and a couple waltzing in a park, presumably because it was cheaper than hiring a group of dancers and a ballroom.That is, in fact, the word which defines this production: Cheap. The sound quality is horrific. As soon as you adjust the sound so you can actually hear the music -- which isn't that well done to begin with -- the volume shoots up so high it's almost painful. The film itself could've been shot by any reasonably competent amateur with a video camera and a couple of friends who have formal attire and can dance a bit.There's nothing about this DVD that I can recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lighter","review":"my friend really likes anime and she smokes so this was a pretty nice lighter for her, she really enjoys it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!!","review":"So much better than I expected from the pictures!

Just some music that is ok but gets on your nerves after a while. Some of the footage was computer generated and not real. Most, however, was pure flying footage. If you do not know much about military aircraft it is difficut to tell when you are watching a different plane. For the price you can't beat it. But if you want to learn more about aviation, this company makes a three dvd set of documentaries about bombers, fighters and attack planes that is much better and the price is about the same. This was a better choice for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maaaavelous","review":"The Show: Ok, I have to be honest, I dont think i quite like series 2 as much as the first. Some of the sets were inexplicably changed (drive room) which drove me bonkers. The episodes are funny enough, but they seem to lack the pointed sarcasm and thoughtfulness of series one. However, there are a few awesome episodes. Mainly, in my opinion, Stasis Leak, Thanks For The Memory, and Kryten. The most important thing is that the crew got off the ship once in a while. Even if it was to visit an alternate universe version of it (Parallel Universe). The tongue-tied song is still classic.The DVD: The sound and picture are fabulous. Similar to the series 1 DVD set. Where the DVD really shines though is in extras. Namely the Red Dwarf A-Z. Awesome. The commentaries and featurettes keep getting better. Fantastic DVD all-around for fans and newbs alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, but why the effects?","review":"I have seen every episode of this show many times. I was completely bewildered that they added horrible special effects to the original content and worse of all, they replaced the awesome model shots with the terrible CGI ship. Although that doesn't warrant a 4-star review, it does ruin things a little for me. Why the unnecessary additions? Like when Rimmer starts changing personalities, they added the vhs effect with the annoying noise. It only takes away from the scene and pisses fans off...horrible decision. I have no idea what they were thinking when they did this. Oh and they replaced the intro, which is especially stupid since it includes Kryten who didn't even come on regularly until season 3. *sigh*"},{"rating":"2","title":"The worlds premier Sci-Fi comdey programme is here!!!","review":"...and its about time.

It drastically deviates from the established theories on the origin of Illyrians, a people inhabiting the Balkan Peninsula in the Roman times. Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I am not going to be concerned as much with his refusal to endorse the Albanians as the descendants of the Illyrians, but more with his methods of arriving to conclusions without much serious historical or scientific work. Not the most serious work on the Illyrians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why add the \\"-us\\" suffix to Illyrian names?","review":"The \\"-us, -is, -os\\" suffixes are used by Greek for Greek names. Illyrians don't use the \\"-*s\\" suffix.Bardyllis is wrong. The original name is Bardhyl. Bardyllis has been deformed to fit the Greek grammar.Ballaios is wrong. The original name is Bala/Balla. Bala is a family name used by Albanians in Kosovo in Duka Gjini valley. Also the Bal is used to call the older brother in some Illyrian tribes where addressing the older brother directly by name was not polite. This is still used in by Kosovo Albanians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact","review":"(...)The Bosnjaks are not Illyrians. Bosnjaks are Slav Muslims (Serbo-Muslim).This book is poor and not accurate.

I prefer fiction based on actual happenings, but the writing read more like a police report."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book delivers! Henderson has done an exemplary job of detailing the disappearance of two hunters and the investigator who finally brings the murderers to justice. I got a real sense of everyone introduced in the book, and we finally find out what happened to Brian Ognjan and David Tyll. The Duvall family were so sure that their reign of terror would keep them from ever being prosecuted for the brutal (and that's putting it mildly) murders that they often bragged and hinted about them. It was clear that even 18 years after the murders people were scared to come forward. The real hero of the story is the investigator, Bronco, who doggedly pursued the case and refused to let up when the going got tough. A sad story, very well told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant read! From a huge true crime fan!","review":"I was born in Michigan but moved in Dec. 1984. I never heard about this case, so when I picked the book up and read the blurb, I bought it.Not disappointed that I did. Henderson is not a perfect writer, and there are alot of spelling and other errors in the book. I agree with another reviewer about the chapters being a bit short. But, the story itself is a grabber and seemed well researched. It kept me awake many nights. All the guys wanted to do was take a weekend off, get away from it all and have some guy time.You feel total revulsion for the Duvall gang. The area where the crime happened is beautiful. The crime, horrifying. The book, a page turner.Highly recommend it for any true crime buff like myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"This book had a good story line.

We live in Michigan, work in northern Michigan, and have a cabin 20 minutes north of where this occurred. Most of the locals are wonderful, friendly folks who are just happy to see new faces. The moral of the story that I tell to my husband, who is a \\"hunter\\" who really goes on that November trip to have fun and play poker - \\"Watch what you say\\". You never know who you will tick off while playing pool. There are some evil people out there. This book even made me think of how I look at other patrons when we women stop at bars on the way up north for our girls' weekends. It's sad to think these characters had so many living in fear for at least a quarter of their lives. It's a great read. I would love to meet Barb Boudro and tell her how proud we are of her courage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Book","review":"This book is not a puzzle. It has no solution without a cheap trick. The clues are meaningless. Do not waste time on this piece of junk"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun!","review":"The concept of this book/puzzle is simple: each page is a separate room. Left-hand pages include brief descriptions of the rooms, while right-hand pages feature detailed illustrations of the rooms. The two major puzzles of the book are: 1. to get to the \\"center\\" of the maze (room 45), and find the shortest route back to page 1, and 2. to solve the riddle feature in the center of the maze.The illustrations are fun to look at and, to my eye, resemble the work of Chris Van Allsburg (\\"Jumanji\\", \\"Polar Express\\", \\"Zathura\\", \\"The Mysteries of Harris Burdick\\").I recommend this book for lovers of riddles and puzzles or anyone who enjoyed \\"MYST\\" or the old Infocom games, like \\"Zork\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable and unusual book","review":"This book amazed me when it first came out.

I invested in this edition right before living in Paris and many times was tempted to go down the street to Larousse's offices and throw it through the window.

The rest of this could sound like they were trying to imitate The Left Banke, or The Hassles take your pick. The Arkay 4 not one song was good.

(And w/ the 4 for 3 promotion plus free ship I got them all for less than $20).The leaf pattern is simple & elegant.

The sage green matches my walls perfectly.Other pros:* MADE IN USA!* Perfect size for salads, snacks, kids, or those watching their serving sizes.* Lightweight.

I love all of Margaret Atwood's other books and have always enjoyed the skillful movements back and forth through stages in the charcters lives. Unfortunatly, this device doesn't work well in this book because so very little actually happens. It is character driven and introspective to a fault, especially since none of the characters are likeable. Those in sympathetic positions (Lesje and Nate) are too colorless to inspire affection or loyalty, and Elizabeth, while possessing of some spirit and initiative, is too selfish and cold to inspire sympathy. If you've decided to read Margaret Atwood, please start with Cat's Eye or Alias Grace or The Robber Bride. There may be something to be learned from Life Before Man, but it's too sad and slow a lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting and at the same time, quite repetitive","review":"The story was interesting.

However, the story line is uninteresting and repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"Though I'm a huge Atwood fan, I just couldn't get through this one. The bleak, depressing way in which the relationships were represented and the un-likeability (is that a word?) of all the characters made Life Before Man pretty painful. Maybe someday I'll pick it up and have the heart to get completely through it - like maybe when life's just too happy and I need a good downer. I won't hold my breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Before Man","review":"I originally bought this book because of the description of Lesje's character-her obsession with dinosaurs. Throughout the book, she was my favorite of the three. Nate was nice but so soft that he could never argue with Elizabeth, who I hated because of her extremely manipulative tendencies. I thought it was interesting how she was depicted at the end, and I loved the last line of the book. Very depressing, and I didn't catch most of the symbolism the first time around, so I'll have to re-read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really get it...","review":"I didn't really \\"get\\" this book.

One can certainly understand why the author, a German Jew, would be so quick to see anti-Semitism in Erasmus' works. However, this topic was addressed with far more erudition and intellectual integrity by Shimon Markish, another Jewish scholar, in the book Erasmus and the Jews.The book is filled with angry rhetoric and verbal excesses. He calls the German people of the time \\"semi-illiterate\\". He manages to apply just about every invective he can to his victim: cowardly, brutal, stupid, vicious, hypocritical, hate-filled, shameless, and on and on.

She had such a great storyline but somehow ruined it with the bland writing. I thought it would be good with the positive reviews it had been getting, but I fail to see why it got such amazing reviews.If you enjoy good, three-dimensional characters, a descriptive scene, engaging plot, and/or a sweet romantic fantasy with a bit of adventure and action, you won't enjoy this book. If you enjoy writers such as Ballantine, Shearin, or Briggs, I can almost garuntee you won't enjoy the book.I know many won't agree with my review, but the sad truth is that this book is bland and simply boring.

The instructors talk way too much, especially about their next DVD, instead of focusing on what they need to teach on THIS DVD. I don't believe they have actually taught WCS since they don't go over the hurdles someone totally new to WCS would have to overcome. The basic rhythm pattern of WCS involves two triple steps (three steps in two beats of music). Unless you know cha cha, which also has a triple step, you will never get the triple step from the video. Some free videos I have seen on YouTube are actually more effective at teaching the basics of WCS. Search \\"west coast swing Manhattan\\" in YouTube for videos that I have found actually effective. Even good videos can at best give you a notion;instruction will be necessary for most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"No cooling here","review":"I bought this item because the manufacturer claimed it would keep a laptop cool.

Although it does keep the heat from your lap it certainly did not keep my 17\\" laptop cool at all.

There is little critical perspective such as in the editor's 1968 THE AMERICAN CINEMA.For the same money one could purchase David Thomson's A BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF FILM.

Read this work slowly; within each of the seemingly-simple discussions there is a world of though to be discovered. Anyone with the least bit of background in philosophical readings can literally read page-by-page, discovering the sources of many of the greatest philosophers of all-time. The \\"Republic\\" is not so much a work of literature as it is an explosion of thought; a ten-book brainstorm of one of the greatest minds of all-time.

For sure, an unusual and ambitious setting for a serial murder mystery, which historian Donald James tackles in \\"Monstrum\\". It is this ambition, however, that fatally flaws what could have been an intriguing novel; there are simply too many plots set in motion and too many messages that James is trying to deliver.

It's delicious!I loved the *practical* suggestions on how to start a wine collection -- e.g. skip buying a few lattes each week and buy a bottle of wine instead.

The double head works great on both my presta valves and my wife's schrader valves. It takes a bit of adjustment to get used to the double head but once you do it is very intuitive.

Football was fine, no problems. For the bikes, very difficult to get it sealed on the valve and locked properly, as the large double head is extremely cumbersome.Had a 15 year old foot pump that worked great until the hose got one too many leaks in it, and thought I would upgrade.

Anthony Quinn has a great role as Tom Healy, the manager of a touring Western theatrical troupe who is always trying to keep his star actress Angela Rossini (Loren) under control.Colourful tale based on the novel \\"Heller with a Gun\\" by Louis L'Amour, deftly-directed by George Cukor (whose background in theatre served him in good stead in this backstage-flavoured story). As usual, Edith Head comes up trumps with her costumes (especially for the show-within-the-show). With Margaret O'Brien, Eileen Heckart and Steve Forrest. No extras but the 16:9 transfer should appease fans of this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD","review":"Been looking for this dvd for a while product was in excellant shape fast shipping would buy from this vendor again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather dull, but worth it to see La Loren as a blonde","review":"\\"Heller in Pink Tights\\" is not one of Sophia Loren's best (it's kind of boring, actually) or best-known offerings, but it's certainly worth a look, if only to see what she looks like as a blonde.

I give this 4 stars because the music is killer but truthfully anyone would be better off buying the original albums. Theres no unique music in this collection, but as with most Japanese product, the package is exceptional.I can understand someone wanting only this vocal oriented Todd tune selection but there are so many of these best ofs around-its refreshing to get one thats not so concerned with hits.

They had a great sound; were very comfortable; and actually stayed in my ears (which is always a plus), unlike the Apple headphones.My favorite thing about these headphones is the fact that the cords are different lengths. This lets you wrap the longer one around the back of your neck, keeping the cords out of your way, for the most part, if you bend over or anything.My only problem with these was how easily the earbud covers (the little rubber bits) come off after a while, which makes them extremely easy to lose. They come with a smaller and a larger pair of covers, and by now, I've lost one cover from each pair... which unfortunately renders my earbuds pretty much useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price.","review":"I'm a musician, after my shure e2c's died, I was like crazy looking for other In-ear phones, and I said $25 why not?

I have a brother who is intellectually disabled and so when I heard that Robin Williams was in it, and he played the part of a person like this, I had to see it. It was much better than I ever expected. The humor, the roller-coaster ride, the ending, it was great! It may not have been a popular movie, but if you have not seen it, you should, you won't be disapointed. It's entertaining, refreshing, full of surprises. It's hard to predict. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I am going to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"House of \\"D\\"etermination","review":"This is a movie that I didn't get a chance to see while in theaters, unfortunately.

Do yourself a favor and read this book, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"Levy brings it. That is really all that needs to be said. To borrow an twenties-talk-esque analogy some people like to pick up bands before they make it big, others see a talented football player who is underrated and champion them throughout their impressive career...Levy is an author that will make it. The book is a fun read, what it may lack in length it makes up for in entertainment. A bit disjointed at times (and I defy most first efforts not to be), the book maintains a witty and fresh perspective on life in the twenties. I would argue that while the experiences may not be yours...most of it just about anyone will be able to relate to, or at best be able to relate someone they know to it. Buy it! Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"This is aboslutely one of the worst books I have ever read.

Be sure to use dry everything or you will get hardened chocolate before you finish. Make sure your fruit is dry, juicy fruit will coat but it will harden fast and might not look as smooth as you desire. Test it first if you are a perfectionist doing this for a special occasion. Water plus melted chocolate equals hardened chocolate. (Hint, if you pour it on ice-cream, it will harden right up, not stay like hot fudge sauce.)It can coat a bit gloppy so if you are looking for perfection, you might want to look in a cook book for perfect chocolate coating. All in all, it works as it's advertised. Again, do a test run to get it right if you are going to worry about perfection. It tastes like chocolate, but think the difference between a grocery store candy bar vs high quality chocolate. This is more on the lines of candy bark.It's easy, fast and does a good basic job of coating."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like eating plastic","review":"Tastes waxy and fake - and that's because it's got partially hydrogenated oil.

Two very attactive women. 2) There was constant action throughout the movie. Even a couple of catfights. 3) Of course it wouldn't be a guy film without tons of unnecessary nudity. Both Grier and Markov have full frontial shots! 4)But to top it off, it's not like you're sitting though a bunch of mindless scenes just to see Grier and Markov. Rather this film has a really great storyline. The plot is believable (except for maybe one scene) and the message really touches your heart. It's a great film worth owning. and if you like it you should check out..\\"Black Mama, White Mama\\"..not nearly as good but has it's moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Gotta Love the 70s -- Action - Nudity - Lust - Catfights","review":"Two viscous catfights, three duels in the arena, a gladiatrix revolt, and a running battle through the catacombs as the girls escape make for plenty of action. Plus for Pam Grier fans, a full frontal nudity shower scene.

Very little plot:exotic women are kidnapped from foreign locales andare trained in the arena, where they put on spectaclesfor eager, bloodthirsty onlookers. In the end, the fittestof the fittest, Grier and Markov, are forced to fight eachother. Fight or die, one or both. In the end, they bothrebel and race for freedom while pursued by the emperor'ssoldiers.Not much else to it.Even nudity isn't a plus here.It was not until this filmthat I noticed how extremely BEAUTIFULMargret Markov is. Whatever happened to her?I think this film is worth the time, but I don'tthink you'd want to buy it, unless you already have aspace on your DVD rack for once-viewed movies that will never again see daylight.This would be one of those movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Awful!","review":"Yeah I know that this was a \\"B\\" movie but this was a chore to watch! I purchased it hoping like every other male to get to see some great nude scenes of Pam Grier and the few nude scenes (only 2 of Pam) are not even worth it. The picture guality for a DVD left much to be desired. There was no plot whatsoever but then again this is a Corman picture.

I failed to find anything in this version that *occurred* in The Iliad. The poem of that name is about the chain of events leading up to the death of the Trojan hero, Hector. Anyone who read this synopsis and then later tried to read the Homeric poem would wonder where the horse was and if they accidentally skipped the famous argument settled by Paris.Reading other reviews I see that the authors played fast and loose with facts in other areas.I am now very disappointed with this book.

So they have now decided to do mini-collections that have not thrived to make them worth buying. With The Looney Tunes: Unleashed, it is quite honestly the worst DVD collection of Looney Tunes on home video. There are only 3 of the classic cartoons from Bugs Bunny, Tweety & Sylvester and Daffy Duck on this collection. The DVD features 3 shorts, Bad Ol' Putty Tat, Stork Naked, and Apes Of Wrath. The cartoons each are still funny today, like they were made around 60 years ago. While the idea was there, the gripe is it isn't worth the money. There are better DVD's out there for new and die hard looney tunes fans worth the money, but Looney Tunes: Unleashed, will possibly be worth turning your back on.Price: D-Shorts: C+Overall: D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner Bros is Getting Lazy or Greedy","review":"Wow!

It's wrist-mounting capability was essential to keep both hands free at all times, and the controls were easy to use and figure out. The fact that it is rechargeable means that I don't have to run around looking for batteries to keep it going. A quick charge is all it takes.

Each chapter wasted 2 to 5 pages describing what was coming in the chapter. Points and paragraphs were continually restated and repeated. The book could have been 1/4 of the size.

There are many very nice photos in the back of the book, but with only one per species it makes the book useless as a field guide. Many species are depicted in plumages that are rarely seen in Texas (e.g. (Oldsquaw in breeding plumage). There are a number of birds included in the book that have never been documented in the state (e.g. Bristle-thighed Curlew, Great Knot, Blue Ground-Dove, Smooth-billed Ani).

The Starker is indeed wonderful and Martzy even surpasses her legendary Tchaikovsky Concerto tone.

Its depravity will simultaneously creep you out and enthrall you (and you'll want to come back for more.)

The xevoz tower over these mini dinos, preventing them from flying on the dactyls.Size (they are about 3\\" high by 9\\" wingspan) aside, these are nice figures.

Is there actually some appeal in the overcomplicated, vindictively fiddly controls? Or maybe it's the uninspiring level design, the flat, underwhelming graphics (even for their time), or maybe it's the impossibly cryptic puzzles and diamond hard gameplay? I mean, I like a challenge but this is just over the top.What is it that made these games so popular? How could so many people be won over by a shallow, soullessly designed and impossibly proportioned heroine? It certainly isn't the flat, unoriginal plot. Tomb Raider sucks ass, play Soul Reaver if you want a proper adventure game and leave this to the rabid dogs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful photography and history","review":"This is a big \\"coffee table\\" type book, filled with luscious photos of exotic locations and peoples, tons of old maps and history, and did I mention the glorious photos?

In my Subaru, the power goes OFF when I leave the car, leaving this 'fake alarm' OFF and serving NO PURPOSE.

On my car, and I believe on most cars today, when you turn off the engine and remove the key no power goes to the outlet. That may not be true on some cars, but certainly is on the few cars I tried the gadget on.I could go under the dash and attempt to rewire the outlet, but that's a little beyond my abilities or inclination.However, the price was so inexpensive that it was worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves these dolls!","review":"I bought these dolls to go with my 3-year-old daughter's Loving Family Dollhouse and she loves them.

After all, what would be the point? Mr. Tyner has evolved as an artist, and Mr. Foster is stylistically worlds apart from Elvin Jones. Nevertheless, when I listen to these renditions, an inevitable comparison is invoked with the originals, and the element I find missing is the glue that the very unsung Jimmy Garrison provided. George Mraz just leaves me cold. He has more chops than the majority of bassists, but to me he's technically overwrought, and I strongly dislike that thin, transducer-enhanced tone. For lack of a better word, I miss a certain \\"organic\\" ingredient that I found in the original recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves 10 stars","review":"This is such a rewarding CD ! McCoy Tyner's recordings are among my favorites in jazz and in a trio setting he is really allowed to display his incredible virtuosity. Here he is beautifully accompanied by George Mraz and Al Foster. Mraz provides fine bass playing throughout and several of his solos are just outstanding as well. The drumming is perfectly suited to these arrangements of tunes recorded by Coltrane and Foster's drum solo on Afro Blue is wonderful.I just caught Tyner's more recent trio with Eric Harland and Charnett Moffett performing in LA and they were playing as if they were of one mind. Harland's drumming is terrific as well. After seeing them and then listening to this I for one will never miss an opportunity to hear McCoy Tyner in a trio setting.Buy this CD if you don't have it.

We especially liked its ability to handle a 12\\" pizza, which it baked very well. It also performed well at toasting, baking small casseroles, pies, etc. We never used it for broiling.However, one of the calrod broil/toast elements burst with a blast of white light while toasting, and I have been unable to locate any source for replacement parts. No one expects things to last forever, but our previous toaster oven lasted closer to ten years, not 2 1/2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would return it if I didn't have to mail it.","review":"After reading the reviews on Amazon I cautiously ordered this mostly because most reviewers gave it good marks for even toasting. If I could return it locally and did not have to mail it back to Amazon I would return it. The Red power light went out almost immediately and if it were not for the noise it makes, yes, I said noise, you could easily forget that you did not turn it off. With the power light not working you can't tell by looking at it if you accidentally left it on. The noise can be minor or at times very annoying. I would almost say that it rattles at times. Cooking and toasting though are both very good in my opinion and that is why I'm keeping it. I can get over the noise factor and the light not working. The unit cooks in less time and more evenly than my last Toaster-Oven. Two stars overall, no stars for quality and four stars for cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great for 18 months, then threw sparks","review":"Received as a wedding gift, and my wife and I were thrilled with the unit for about 18 months. Then it started throwing a burning/electrical smell. A couple weeks later, I caught it throwing sparks out the side!Since I was out of the 1 yr warranty, I figured no harm could be done by trying to repair it myself.Found two 1N5408 diodes, one of which was burnt and snapped in half. Cost to purchase new diodes - about $0.25.Cost to purchase new toaster oven - $50 minimum.So if you have this unit, find that it starts makes an electrical burning odor, and have a soldering gun, it can be repaired in a very cost effective manner.Regardless - a toaster oven only lasting 18 months is pretty poor, which is why I rate this only 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential DANGEROUS Flaw BEWARE!","review":"Worked fine for one year. Then the top elements stopped working. I took a closer look inside the oven and could see that two top elements had WARPED. They were so bent that they were touching the inside-top of the oven.

Although this book is scary and compelling to read, I wasn't sure if it was a pure sci-fi/horror story or a spiritual message from the author. I think the book was way to short to really develop either story line and a lot of events were never fully explored or explained.The author seemed to have a number of favorite words such as \\"susurrant\\" that he used quite often. He also seems to favor a lot of alliteration, sometimes a bit too much.It is a good story though, and scary enough that the reader may want to limit the reading of it to the daylight hours.

You will not a read another book that will affect you like this story's ending does. What a concept!!!! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the flowery prose was a little too overwhelming. Otherwise, it's perfect.READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently, an awful choice for my first DK book","review":"Turning a metaphor once in a while is good prose. Continuous languid twist of verbiage in a trite, ridiculous, pseudo-religion-freak, self-indulgent pretense of poetry-a-la King (Steven) is a little over the top. This book is so bad it's humorous. Now I need someone to convince me to purchase any other DK novel.While my usual (historical non-fiction) can be impassionate and light on creativity, it beats mindless, pointless, woeful musings of the human endeavor as related by what must certainly be identified as an under-developed, mal-adjusted, forcibly female point of view. Why else would the audio book publisher adopt an untrained female reader to help destroy this production? I was undecided as to which was more catastrophic. The book or the poignant example of what happens when an author signs a multi-book contract with his publisher...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This book starts out good, but quickly goes down hill...and fast! I love Dean Koontz, but this book is absolutely terrible! I couldn't even finish the entire book, and had to actually force myself to read 187 pages of it before I just couldn't read any more of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads Like a Bad Movie","review":"I also really like Dean Koontz's books, but this one reads like a bad B movie. I swear the scenes were written so they could be made into a visual movie to shock the audience. Events didn't tie together well, and the ending was a let down. If you are a fan check this one out at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stupid closing chapter!!!!","review":"Koontz has some classics and some clunkers. This is a BIG clunker!! The first half of the book is very good. However, the deal with Molly's father never made sense. The big bugs never made sense. The TS Eliot parts are ridiculous. The fungi? Please give me a break. However, the closing chapter in which she writes the \\"memorized\\" alien quote, (C'mon, how could she remember word for word something she heard in an alien language????) in the sand and then is able to \\"translate\\" it is so stupid I could not believe it. I cringe even now as I write about it. What a dumb ending to what could have been a very good book, (without the bugs, the fungus, the father, the doll, the Scandanavian kids, the alien quote, you get the idea)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on, it was good, really!","review":"This was a great read until you get to the end. The end, well the last half of the book, could have went a different way. It could have been much better. It had me thinking about the possible endings, and I was totally surprised at the final few pages. Not a good surprised either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The horror that was a comedy","review":"Mystery and Thriller? They got that wrong, it's comedy, pretty much from the start. Once you see this, the book reads much easier. It's a fast read. Skimming the book to get past all the flowery metaphors, you find that only the afternoon is lost, and you get a good chuckle.It's hard to believe, very hard to believe, that the same person that wrote this also wrote the Odd Thomas series. Both ends of the spectrum, I guess. Under Aaron Wolfe he wrote a simular book \\"Invasion\\" that is silly as well, but that was in 75, and we've forgiven him for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious Crap","review":"If I wanted to read about God destroying the world and starting over, I'd consult a bible - not Dean Koontz. Enough with the religious stuff already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dean Koontz's worst book.","review":"Okay this has to be one of the worst books I've read by DK. The charachters were really shallow, the plot was ridiculous and the alien spores? Come on. It was a great disappointment...I wouldn't have expected this from the \\"master\\" of all horror!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed and disgusted at the ending...","review":"The book would have gotten a 5 star rating but the end just messed it ALL up. If I could give this a 5, I would! The concept of an alien invasion terraforming the whole world into its image was both fascinating and horrifying..I loved it!But, Dean Koontz had to go and mess it all up. Apparently, the \\"Aliens\\" that killed the folks in the International Space Station was Lucifer himself. The giant mothership that was making it rain? It was Hell. Hell was a spaceship floating in outer space. Lucifer decided that Humanity is violent and killed everyone except a few folks and all the kids. Humanity got a second chance.I've only read a three of his books (this one included) and I will never read another one because they always end in such disappointment. And what the heck is this thing he has about dogs? Arrgh.Mr. Koontz, next time, don't mess up a great story with religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was he thinking","review":"one of the worst books i have ever read. you should have a 0 rating available for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Junk","review":"This is the worst novel I have read (almost completed) in ages, let alone the worst by Koontz. The worst of it is that Koontz keeps quoting T.S. Eliot, perhaps in an attempt to impress and lift his overwritten drivel into the realms of what is so loosely termed 'literary fiction'. At least I got a laugh out of the purple prose, but the unacknowledged 'borrowings' from Eliot angered me. The book is plotless, themeless, without anything near real characterization, all couched in overblown language - in short, worthless, even if you wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip at all costs","review":"The Mist meets the Dreamcatcher meets the Stand meets the Theasarua meets the Bibile...but in the worst way...pretentious junk... Just leave it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Nearly As Bad As Everyone Seems To Think. . .","review":"I read this book in a day (it's a fairly easy read) and upon finishing was left with a feeling of satisfaction. I'm confused as to why this book has gotten so many bad reviews.The book has a very good message behind it, one that I think more readers should take to heart.To those becrying 'religion' and 'politics', well, an author has the right to express his own ideas through the literature he creates. I think that some people might be angry because the book's subject really strikes a chord within them, because they realize that if THEY were in this setting, they'd be among the 'walking dead'.The only reason I gave this book four stars and not five is this: It's a bit too short. I think that Koontz could have expanded a bit more than he did. It's still a very interesting and compelling read, but like I said, I read it in a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite from Koontz..","review":"I love Koontz but this book fell far from the mark. It started off slow and I found myself thinking, \\"Where is this going?\\" And, in the end, I felt it took me nowhere. And, the T.S. Elliott quotes got a little annoying. If you're a fan like me, I know you'll read it despite this review but if you're a first-time Koontz reader, don't start with this book. It is definitely not his best work - try Odd Thomas or even (going way back here) The Funhouse instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you like science fiction then you might think this book is okay. I found it in the mystery section, not where it should be though. The plot is so far fetched that I had trouble finding anything to hold on to to keep my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!!","review":"I have so many problems with this book. There is absolutely NO character development, from beginning to end. I did not care what happened to the main character at all, because Koontz did not give me a reason to care. There was no closure at the end of the book. It was almost like he didn't know what to do with the story once he got to a certain point so he just ended it. There were definitely some creepy moments where I had to keep reading or I wouldn't be able to sleep, but that's the only good thing I can say. I threw the book across the room when I was done with it in disgust. Very very disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Taking","review":"I was taken all right--taken for a loss of twenty dollars and three days of my time! I've been reading Koontz since '88, and this is by far his worst novel. This story is absolutely pointless, filled with unnecessary spelling-bee vocabulary--c'mon, phantasmagorically?--flat-lined narration, and cloying internal monologue. (There is something called dialogue, Mr. Koontz.) There wasn't even one thread of suspense in this entire tale of . . . I won't give away the weak plot. Advice: Read Intensity if you want classic Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"Having read all of Koontz's work...even under his pseudonyms...and enjoyed most, his work is trickling away from that which made his work such enjoyable reading. This story was soooo dark (probably his point, with the religious overtones that come to light at the end). I too miss the days of Strangers, Watchers...I want better characters and less illiterations. They distract from the story. I will be hard pressed to continue buying Koontz books unless his style changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can this honestly be the same Dean Koontz?","review":"I just finished The Taking. What a waste. I mourn not the money spent on this book, but the time expended in wallowing through it. I honestly though Intensity was one of the scariest books I ever read. Excellent. This however, almost appears to have been written by some other, lame writer, under his name.Aside from characters who were so unappealing that I honestly hoped they'd all be done away with, the monsters here were silly beyond words. And I was floored by how many needlessly large words were used that only a few linguists would even begin to understand. This actually appeared to me to be a novice writer (not someone so acclaimed) who was trying to show off their vocabulary. In short, I thought this book stunk, and don't waste your time or money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"I have enjoyed Koontz' work in the past, but this one novel finished him for me. Just as you can get a \\"Warning - Sexually Explicit Content\\" advisory before you enter a porn web site, I feel that books that wrap all the loose ends up in the last ten pages with a goofy, pseudo-christian \\"Rapture\\" event should have some kind of warning on the cover. I'll ignore the \\"Wouldn't you Hollywood people just LOVE to make a film out of this?\\" kind of cinemagraphic staging of each horror scene in each chapter and get to my basic gripe: I would have been much more pleased and much more intellectually challenged by an ending that stated \\"And then I woke up and was I REALLY, REALLY glad that it was all a bad dream!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Gawk!","review":"Only for religious people believing that we will all burn in hell if we don't have faith in -errm say -in dogs - and I think that is why they find this garbage a helluva read, obviously rolling in ecstasy, thinking that the Messiah is on the long way home. Puh-leeze!As a story -because I can't call it a novel- it is a mishmash- a nice student's thesarus for learners of English as a second-language...they be not in fear of losing track of the story because THERE IS NO STORY.By the way, yes, we all know...he is Mr. Koontz, not Dean, which is disrespectful at the least. Unfortunate for Mr. Koontz the other one is THE KING, not King.Leave this in Amazon shelves for getting dust and read Odd Thomas or the Face. At least they have a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"The Boring\\"","review":"This book was so slow I couldn't bear to finish it. I had the audio version and didn't even finish the first disk, it was so slow. Koontz takes a chapter from 19th century writers in spending so much time in description without anything happening. I didn't want to invest my time into hearing Koontz attempt to talk about sex from a woman's perspective....ewwwww.\\"Odd Thomas\\" is an infinitely better book, and I would encourage you to read that one. I'm surprised that both of these books came from the same writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP WITH THE ADJECTIVES DEAN!!!","review":"I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years, but I stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago, because after awhile, it seemed as if all of his characters were the same. I recently read the back cover of this book, and it sounded so interesting, so I gave it a chance. Boy, was I sorry. It is as if Dean Koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student! His sentences are awkward, mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can - it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side. This was way too distracting, and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale.Please Dean, take an opportunity to read some 'how-to' books on writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Koontz the Reactionary Nutcase is back","review":"After Odd Thomas (a MUCH better book than this), I rather hoped that Koontz had recovered from his weird affinity for the lunatic fringe of the Far Right, but this badly written tome finds him right smack in the middle of it again. When the Barbie-and-Ken newscasters try to get the Noble Scientists to blame the weird weather happenings on Global Warming and the Noble Scientists try -again- to explain that Global Warming is a myth, you KNOW you're in for a brainless diatribe. This whole book seemed to be a vehicle for Koontz to imply that our corrupt culture is dooming us all to hell. St. John's Wort, Dean. Take it every day.I can't believe I read the whole thing, and I'm glad I checked it out of the library rather than spend actual personal funds to buy it. Now if I could just bill somebody to get those lost hours back..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Koontz?","review":"I was a huge Koontz fan in the 90's and possibly even the beginning of 2000. Something happened however. One after another I feel like he's been underwhelming. The Taking might be the worst Koontz book I've ever read. It just has no point. It ends before it starts and suddenly the mayhem he has taken the entire book to create is fixed, pretty much. It's not compelling, not engaging... I wanted to put it down half way through but I RARELY don't finish a book.The Taking was a big mis-step for Koontz. I followed this up with Velocity which was underwhelming as well - largely forgettable, though definitly not as bad as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I think I can safely say I have read all of Koontz's books. If you are also a fan, do not buy this book! \\"Diarreha of the word processor\\" hit the nail on the head. What started out as a decent read with plenty of suspense soon turned into blah blah blah blah blah! I started reading one or two sentences a page just to get through it.Mr. Koontz, you are so much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of Koontz","review":"I've read and enjoyed many Dean Koontz novels over the years, and this novel is by far, the worst of the lot. The novel starts out well enough, but becomes a mish-mash of ideas. There is no real suspense because once you see an object or meet a character, it's completely obvious what is going to happen next. If you're a real Dean Koontz devotee, I urge you to pick up a copy at your local library--don't spend money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepiness that really sticks with you!","review":"This apocalyptic thriller had me staying up way too late on work nights! It even had me sneaking around my house with a flashlight after everyone else was in bed, making sure there were not lurking monsters around every corner... And I am a big-time horror lover! The sense of creepiness that this book oozes really sticks with you.As my first Koontz book (I don't know why), this book will definitely not be my last. Although the author's almost sentence frequent use of metaphors and similes annoyed me at first, I became used to it after a couple of chapters. I think this tendency to extreme description probably helped pull me more into the story. This book is one I will keep on my shelves to read again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE MP3","review":"The book is awesome, but the download from audible sucks. I downloaded it and tried to burn it, but it didn't burn right. When I tried again, it told me I could only burn it once and wouldn't let me try again. Do not purchase anything from Audible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Descending deeper into the macabre.","review":"I picked up this book with the slight hope that he would return to his glory days with books like Watchers, Strangers and Lightning. His writing used to be a mix of genres, but for a long time now, it has strictly been very dark horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"Classic\\" - By a longshot!","review":"The book started with a lot of promise, but by the end, I was skimming to get it over with. The characters were unrealistic and the gender-role-reversal of the main couple (SHE obviously has the external gonads in the family) was painfully realized. The book read like a alien/horror romance novel, with long, drawn-out periods of drippy introspection that made me angry, it was so insipid. Comparisons to real classics in science fiction are laughable. First and last book I will read by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I am a huge Koontz fan but the story was stupid, the writing was terrible, and the book was long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall very enjoyable","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book...and, despite what others may think, I am not \\"paid by Koontz\\" and I have read many other agreed-upon quality books. I genuinely enjoyed this one.From the beginning, the book had me hooked...he jumps into the story, into the suspense, so quickly. I, like another reviewer, could never figure out how in the world the characters could even hope for a happy ending.My only complaints would be that yes, his metaphors sometimes were overdone, and the abrupt transition in the story to give the main characters the purpose of saving the children was disturbing for a long time; it seemed contrived at first, like he just all of a sudden decided they needed a mission, but was finally explained.I loved the ending...and I won't give it away. It was somewhat predictable, but that's ok...a good deal of our entertainment these days is predictable; I personally enjoy seeing how the author/director/etc will play out that ending.Just a good, fun read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"errr....","review":"I have read some Kootnz books and this one seems no different. \\"The Taking\\" is bland and will not stick out in my memory of books to remember.My beef on Kootnz himself is that is one, WAY TOO obsessed with dogs. Does he own like 20 or something and each has to be the star in his book? In all his books he has the dogs be some kind of special, powerful, force of good. Not that that's not true :) but it can be really annoying.The other thing that is a repetive theme is his obsession with horrible pasts. If you have read \\"One door away from heaven\\", your know what I mean.I did give it 2 stars because there were times that I was kinda scared. However, the plot lacked any real creativness and it was too short for the problems that it presented. Also the ending was really dumb. The \\"aliens\\" just magically disapear because Molly stood them up. Who let him publish this? Don't waste your time on this book, but if you must reading it an audiobook would probably be more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not there, perhaps taken. . .","review":"If you are looking for classic Dean Koontz with his ability to create memorable characters and events that you just love, pass on this book! Dean has slipped a bit from the norm. Perhaps he was \\"taken\\" with nostalgia for his older science fiction works. This book reminds me of his early sci-fi books like \\"The Fall of the Dream Machine\\". Don't go there either! Oh, and Dean, please give us more books like \\"Odd Thomas\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good ideas, poor execution","review":"I always look forward to Koontz' new releases. This one looked interesting from the jacket summary. The idea of aliens that think of us as gnats, terraforming our world and how they were going about it was a great idea to be explored. But it wasn't. It turned into yet more dogs again help save the humans from the minions of hell (literally). If the last few chapters w/the in-your-face religious moralizing were removed the book would be better. If ANY other ending was put in their place this would be MUCH better. As others have said, don't waste your money...this will soon be on the Borders bargain rack. The text is also off-putting. At times it seemed that he was trying to see how many archaic, poly-syllabic words he could fit into a sentence. If you want to read some good Koontz, grab Odd Thomas, From the Corner of His Eye, The Face, Phantoms, or just about anything else. This is one of his worst. Right there w/False Memory in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Editor, Please!","review":"How can one of the most skilled writers in the world suddenly publish such garbage? I've been reading Koontz for years, and never been more disappointed than I was about halfway through \\"The Taking\\". Koontz abandoned storytelling for trying to impress us with how wordy he can be and how many big and unusual words he has in his vocabulary. You want to impress people with how smart you are, take up teaching or something, Koontz. But if you intend to keep an audience for your novels, you'd be wise to get back to the basics and tell the doggone story. People accuse King of being wordy, but at least he knows how to tell a story, even if he does publish thousand-pagers.Basic sentences, Koontz. Basic vocabulary. Please get back to that or start a new carreer in writing crossword puzzles.Save your money, folks. Save your money. But if you must read it, get it from the library, or take my copy from the landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Koontz???","review":"What happened to the Dean Koontz of the 80's? This book was boring. The prose was so exaggerated and the story filled with so much fluff to make it longer, that it was hard to keep interest and I was unable to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess.","review":"This book started okay and then went way downhill. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could move on to something else. I would skip paragraphs of useless explanations and just read the dialouge. Creatures with faces on their hands and evil fungi?? What the F*#k? The characters were boring and one dimensional. The Dogs and her evil father...all done to death by Koontz. After reading The Face, Odd Thomas, and Dark Rivers of the Heart in the last few months I was looking forward to this. All of those were great, this was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"where did the old Dean Koontz go?","review":"I have read all of Koontz's books and I anxiously awaited this book and after reading it, I knew the wait wasn't worth it. I had just read Odd Thomas and so hoped this new book would be better. Alas it wasn't. Where of where did our Dean Koontz of Dark Rivers of the Heart and Watchers and Dragon Tears, etc.go? He would so carfully craft a story and draw you into it so deep that you couldn't wait to finish it but you didn't want it to end. This book was so formulaic that you really didn't have to finish it to know what was going to happen. In his early books, every word he typed seemed important to the story. In this book, you have page after page of almost nothing but adjectives. I want my old Koontz back. This book was not worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Dean Koontz ever","review":"This is a nearly unreadable mash-up of the worst aspects of Danielle Steele, Robert Heinlein and the Left Behind series. It has purple prose, fevered nightmares and an insulting suspension of any effort to create a story arc. I have read quite a bit of Dean Koontz's work and this, this is absolutely inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"we have to save the children...","review":"Like so many horror writers out there, Dean fell into this horrible cliche. \\"We have to save the children.\\" there have been no child characters up to this point, but suddenly, the plot shifts to \\"we have to save the children.\\" This is disgusting garbage. This book started out with a good idea, followed up with some disturbing imagery (which is a good thing in a horror book) then fell flat on its face with the stupid \\"we have to save the children\\" tripe that comes from out of nowhere and is sentimental garbage. I was having fun with it, but couldnt finish the book due to this annoying plot cliche. If this is all you have left, dean, its time to retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT his best effort..........to say the least.","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE Dean Koontz. Realistically, I've probably put his kids thru college or at least added a room onto his house with all the money I've spent on his books in the past. But this one..........WHEW!!!! It really threw me for a loop. Without going too far into it and boring you: If you're expecting \\"Odd Thomas\\", \\"Tick Tock\\", \\"The Hideaway\\" or any other Koontzesque favorites, you'll be HIGHLY disappointed.It's well written as are most of his books, but it's about an alien invasion with really no unexpected twists. I think we all love his books for those twists or really wacky things that happen. But none of it is here. Zero.If you're in the mood for an alien invasion book, read the \\"War of the Worlds\\". I've never read it, but it HAS to be better then this. Sorry Dean..........I still love ya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it LUMINOUS?!","review":"How many times can the word, luminous (and its variations - luminosity, luminescence, etc.), be used in one book? Hundreds. Dean Koontz has written many books I've enjoyed but this one is just awful. The plot does not thicken until the novel is nearly finished and by then, who cares. What Koontz often does well is develop good dog characters. He misses the mark this time and the humans are not much to brag about either. The ending is ridiculous. I could almost see the author sitting at his desk scratching his head wondering how to stop writing. He should have stopped around Page 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambitious Concept--Great Delivery!","review":"Without giving away any element of the book's suspense, I must say that the denouement of THE TAKING was truly thought-provoking. Only Koontz could give such an imaginative, yet philosophical, spin to the concepts of heaven and hell and their relationships to the space/time continuum. Those readers who feel that Koontz is a Stephen King mimic give too much credit to the latter author. Koontz is, always has been, and always will be in a class by himself. THE TAKING gets another thumbs up for this prolific storyteller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too religious","review":"I do not read books to be surprised at the end by a religious message. If I was in the least interested in being manipulated like that, I would search out and read those 'left behind' books or the drivel put out by the scientologists. The last book I read by Koontz was 'The Watchers' which I really enjoyed (I think... - it was a long time ago), but having been given this book as a gift just before a road trip, I felt compelled to read it. It was an OK horror book up until the last chapter or so when it turned to crap. Please save me from preachers in any guise. No more Koontz in my lifetime..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding me, right?","review":"I enjoy most of Koontz's books. This was not one of them. If you are in the market for adjectives, adverbs and similes, you've got one-stop shopping here. Beyond that, there's not much you can say for it. For me, a good sci-fi/suspense book can have a hook as outrageous as the imagination is capable of. But the characters have to be believable. They need to say and do things I might do in a similar situation. SPOILER COMING UP -I'm sorry, but if an unnatural storm suddenly hits me, I'm going to be thinking global warming or techno-terrorism. I am not going to be thinking little green men (or little red monkies, as the case may be). IMHO, Mr. Koontz should leave the Left Behind series to the guys who invented it. I've never read them, but they have to be better than The Taking."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least the cover art was okay","review":"This book starts with wonderful imagery and builds tension quickly. However, it soon becomes a repetitive morass of warmed-over Stephen King coupled with Koontz' annoying fascination with preternatural dogs and a murky religious consciousness that bogs the story down even more. Just to make it murkier, he has developed a passion for purple prose that makes third-rate romance novels read like Shakespeare. Definitely my last Koontz book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hummmm Bug","review":"The end of this book with all its mysteries RUINED this book for me.But no hard feelings. I still love you very much Mr Koontz.Forever Sir."},{"rating":"2","title":"scary!","review":"I enjoy many of Dean Koontz's books - this one was scary enough that I had a hard time sleeping. His writing and my vivid imagination had me thinking about the 'morals' that this book subtly taught - in a frightingly yet hopeful way. Interesting how so many of his books have pets as 'angels' or 'messengers from above.' I could not put it down until the very last page. Then I had to sit and think about it for awhile. Not many books affect me like that. This is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable page turner...","review":"I am big fan of Dean Koontz because he is consistent and knows how to write mystery/suspense. He didn't let me down in The Taking.The mystery and premise of the novel is extremely intriguing and as the novel continues Koontz adds small, little mysteries the characters encounter that allow you continue to read and be intrigued. The characters were real enough and dialogue flowed well.My only complaints are the ending seems a little to abrupt without any true exposition and the novel is little too bleak. I have read his other books,(the older ones) and he is usually not too dark. The religious overtones for the ending while I did not mind, suggests a dark, old testament view that is a little too depressing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"After Odd Thomas and The Face I was really looking forward to reading The Taking. Man, was I disappointed. It was so boring, I would skip whole pages just so I could get to the end. Mr. Koontz must have been in a drugged state to think that this book was anything up to his usual standards. I have always enjoyed his books and will continue to read them unless the next one is like this one and then, I\\"m afraid, I'll have to pass him by. It seems like he has gone the way of Stephen King in the last years when Mr. King's books got way too weird and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Didn't Make Sense","review":"There are many drawn out events in this book that are creepy and really seem utterly implausible. Combined together, these events give this book a pointless feel. I always like it when the characters have to challenge their assumptions about themselves and go through a transformation. With such a huge end of the world happening, some character change would seem to have to happen. The book just moves along pointlessly from one hard to image event to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAH!","review":"I have read almost all Koontz's books. I expected so much more. Way too much religious crap thrown in at the end. Very dissappointing!

I recently bought a mix of his earlier works for my nephew to read. This one was a huge disappointment.The events in this work are so mystifying that even the characters ask each other what the heck is going on. They look at each other and say, \\"why would this happen? why would they do this?\\" but we are NEVER told. Many, many weird things happen that are NEVER explained.The final, strange explanation (thought up by a character; we don't even know if she is right) still doesn't explain most of what happened. I love science fiction; this was just weird, confusing, dismal narrative. I was really trying to keep an open mind even to the very end. Just not worth the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this become a top ten?","review":"In the beginning I enjoyed Koontz books, but he became predictable and boring. This book took all my effort to even get to the end. The characters were boring and I didn't care what happened to them. It seemed he just repeated the same things over and over. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in so many areas...","review":"I have been a fan of Mr. Koontz for many years. I have to say this is the furthest thing from Midnight and Strangers you could Imagine.The story starts with a spooky rain, but degenerates into isolated encounters peiced together with a vague alien invasion theme.The problem is in the \\"why\\". Why do the invaders do any of the things they do? There isn't really an answer.Mr. Koontz also seems to recycle the same romantic dialogue that seemed out of place in the better Odd Thomas. DO people really talk like this? Go and re-read Lightling before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first and last visit with Koontz","review":"Bloated writing style that seems less descriptive than self serving, I found myself yelling \\"enough already, let's move on!!\\" His ascension to soapbox preachiness, about the media, etc, is transparent and superficial. And its not enough that he writes a story that has roots from Noah to Close Encounters, he must tell us explicitly lest his poor readers miss the connection. Yuck!! Come to think of it, one star is too much!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thanks.","review":"I've been a Koontz fan for many years - some of his books I've absolutely loved, and some have been a little disappointing, but this is one of his weakest works by far. It's a long story that drags on and on with LOADS of narrative (zzzzz) and over-the-top adjectives that make even an English major's head spin. The ending seems like a cheap and easy out - I guess even HE got tired of the story. Why not just stick a red bow on the cover so readers can tie up this lame story in a nice little package without having to endure reading this overly-long tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy","review":"I found this story to be far too wordy. I skipped past many paragraphs just to get back to the actual story. It felt like he was just trying to fill up the page by dragging out each event, and going off on bunny trails. The end was not satisfying and seemed thrown together."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow - worst koontz book ever","review":"After the first hour I wanted to just put it down and walk away. I should have. It doesn't get any better and the more I go on, the more I am just grateful that I listen to these books while I drive and therefore, am not really waisting my time.I usually like Koontz books even the more sci-fi ones but this just sucked"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book EVER?","review":"This is probably one of the worst books I've ever read in general, not just the worst Dean Koontz book I've ever read. The only reason I finished it is because I don't like to waste money. I threw it directly into the trash when I was finished because I wouldn't wish it on anyone else.I don't even want to explain the story, because I'll feel like an idiot typing out the synopsis, but suffice it to say that there are many other reviewers who feel the same way I do. This was a horrible story and a horrible book. The typical Dean Koontz way of having 18 descriptive words before a noun got especially tiring in this book. \\"The silverish golden coppery red bluish luminescent lightish wavering wiggly horrifying chitenous...\\"Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Beginning, Horibble Middle, Dreadful Ending","review":"\\"The Taking\\" was a complete waste of time. The beginning was dull and tiresome to read. Molly and Neil are boring as individual characters and they have no chemistry as a couple. There was no point in bringing Michael Render in the book either. He brought no excitement, no twist to the story. Render was a waste of 10 pages of reading time.I had to read the first chapter over and over just to get a jump start on the story. It did not draw me into the book and make me crave for more. It actually did the opposite. I wanted to stop reading it, but I decided to give it a chance. I figured once I got to the middle, the story would take off, but it never did. The only reason why I read it to the end was because I thought Koontz might have a twist or something at the end that would tie the whole book together, but he didn't.Total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze Fest...Total Yawner","review":"This is the first Dean Koontz book I ever tried to read...and it may be my last. The book did absolutely nothing to hold my attention (this is a #1 New York Times Best Selling Author???). I had to force myself to read the first few chapters before I couldn't stand it anymore. Total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Taking of the Reader's Money\\"","review":"I used to count on this author for quick entertaining thrillers, but enough is enough. This book is all about a fast, easy paycheck for the Koontz franchise (coming soon, Dean Koontz's Hamlet!). \\"It was a dark and stormy night\\" summarizes the setting, and of course we get the usual psychic household pets and sensitive, enlightened beautiful people. Various descriptions seem lifted verbatim from his earlier novels. (He's used the word \\"sussurant\\" before, but not twice in the same book; I'm convinced the dog ate his thesaurus.) The whole thing feels as if the writing was outsourced to third-world peasants who were given Koontz's earlier novels as a guide. If you've just gotta have a Koontz fix, buy the recently re-released Icebound instead (written maybe 20 years ago and a departure for him, no things-that-go-bump-in-the-night, but a fairly entertaining yarn.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever","review":"I've read everything that Dean Koontz has written. I expected more from this book and didn't get it. It started to build into something that could have been good but it let me down. Certainly not his best work. Won't stop me from reading his new books but you could probably let this one slide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense with a message","review":"Koontz always takes his readers on wild, thrilling rides, using his vivid imagination and excellent way with words. Here, he takes us on an almost-nonstop journey from comfort to terror to thought-provoking revelation. Not his best book of late, but still an entertaining read with an ah-ha ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing spectacular for Koontz, but still very good","review":"Koontz has been a bit of hit-or-miss over the past 5 years or so. \\"From the corner of his eye\\" and \\"Odd Thomas\\" were bull's eye, while \\"The Face\\" and \\"The Taking\\" didn't quite hit the spot.However, having said that, Koontz never puts out anything BAD - this is merely comparing him to himself. Make no mistake, The Taking is a solid story masterfully told, it merely fails to create the kind of mesmerizing athmosphere you find in the better ones.The book itself is somewhat short, but the storyline is pretty simple so it's probably wise to keep it snappy to avoid \\"Stephen King Syndrome\\" (pointless blathering for 800 pages before anything happens). While simplistic, the story works and the characters are alive. Simply put: this is nice, light summer reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story with great twist!","review":"This book will draw you into the world of the main characters from the very start. It's engrossing and suspenseful. The twist at the end, which plays with the way we define and categorize things, is intelligent and brave. Easy and enjoyable read. Koontz fails to disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and suspensful","review":"Koontz is a master storyteller, and in the beginning of the book one can almost feel an unseen weight hanging over the main characters. It's coming closer, threatening to crush them, and as evident as it is that the strange things happening to them is only the beginning, there is no guessing where it will lead. Most of the book is a pageturner - it is intense and suspensful and one really wants to know what's going to happen. Towards the end the religious overtones become a little too strong for my taste and that's why it only gets four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Taking","review":"I have always been a Dean Koontz fan, but this book was like watchng a movie and seeing commercials for T.S, Elliot. This was written like a screen play by Bentley Little, where the end came very soon,It seems that he was in a hurry to finish this book.At most it should have been a paper back as he once started.I hope he will get back on track and write with more than a deadline. I am always an avid reader of his work this one just dissappointed me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get out your thesauruses","review":"OH MY!!!!!!!! If you can get through reading a book that uses words like expatriates and susurration than you get credit. This book was trying to show his use of descriptive words. Horrible. If you can get past that then try such phrases as \\"fear suckled\\" Koontz has really done a hatch job this time"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total WASTE of time even if you have lots of time at hand","review":"This book is supposed to depict alien invasions and how a small band of people surrived the attack. But Koontz is so weak in his descriptions that you can never get to the bottom and share the terror felt by the lead characters. His aliens are so evasive that when you finish the book, you still cannot tell what they want from the attack. Koontz was once a good writer. What's wrong with him? Is he that desperate for money and have to churn out books like this? If you relly want to read books with theme like this, read Stephen King's The Stand. And will understand what I mean by a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Preachy","review":"I have never read a Koontz book before, and know very little about him other than his name. I picked up this book because it promised a spooky read. The opening was very good (though other reviewers have alleged that it is a \\"rip-off\\" of an SK novel - I've never read the novel in question, so I don't know). I settled in to be engrossed and entertained. HOWEVER, as I moved farther into the book, I began to realize that the plot was moving towards a preachy, insipid, eye-roll-inducing conclusion. Ugh! I will never pick up another Koontz book. What a waste of time. (PS I completely agree with the other reviewer that mentioned the deeply weird \\"global warming\\" rant that happens in the beginning of the book - that little scene serves as a warning for the Far Right nonsense still to come.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"?????","review":"I am a devoted fan but this book confused me. I was intrigued through the entire book until the end. I may have missed it but what made the main character so special ?

On the Other there is THIS book.He starts off well, more or less. He builds tension and such, but... The mains in this one are so one dimension and \\"Duddly DoRightish\\" that by chapter four I was rooting for the \\"Aliens\\".Add to that a confusing, at times, narrative and an ending that is not only weak but fairly simple to figure out halfway through... (The attack on the space station was the high point. After that things go downhill into moralizing and predictability)Only get this one if you are a Koontz fan who wants to have his complete works. Other than that read Stephen King whilst dressed like an arc angel, you'll get the same affect.B Goetz"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Taking is Suspensful~ created by: Natalie H.","review":"The taking is about a woman named Molly, who is married with no children. It is about the end of the world. Different things happen in the book, wierd things. Some of these obsticles that Molly and her husband incounter are things or people that are not alive but are moving and talking. Several different \\"things\\" such as spaceships, giant bugs, or unknown beings, are killing people. Molly, her husband, and a dog become an alliance and linger around their small community in search for alive children to protect. I think that this book is great because of the suspence. Some suspensful moments are when Molly goes up stairs of her neighbors house when she runs across her neighbor which had blew out his brains when she hears someting on the roof that just fell into the attic. It made me want to read on and find out what would happen to Molly, and I hope it will for the future readers of \\"The Taking\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disaster","review":"The plot starts off well enough, but by the middle of the book it gets utterly ridiculous. The main characters are awesome, but the details of the situation become gruesome and horribly described. Is the reader supposed to take these descriptions literally or do they symbolize the point the author wants to make? I've enjoyed reading Dean Koontz for years, but this book was an utter disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"For years, I have considered reading Koontz novels a guilty pleasure, but this one was amazing. It was richer than his previous works and was filled with more hope. In a lot of ways, it reminded me of \\"Twilight Eyes\\", which was also about redemption and a kind of end to the world. The spiritual turn to the book really rang true to my own beliefs. The mainstays of kootzian fiction were present; writers, dogs, California, but it was more substantial and earnest. Very good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Help! Stop it, Dean! Why are you turning into Stephen King before our eyes? - Stephan King with a vocabulary on steroids. I am not used to having the terror interrupted by the need to consult a dictionary, nor being bombarded by the philosophy of Evil. \\"The mystery of evil is too deep to be illuminated by the light of reason\\" - p222.Koontz has a formidable and growing supply of writing skills, which when focused on pure Evil is almost too much to take. I felt like the whole book was in a steep power dive which surely was out of control and we could not escape a super tragic conclusion. But at about 1/8 inch of pages before the end, some order began to be seen in the chaos. Someone took control, we pulled out of the power dive, and we had Noah after the flood complete with rainbow - a complete new view of God's Plan after the Armageddon. Cool! Nice work, Mr. Koontz! Just don't do it again! OR do it again but first another nice doggie-eye view story to calm us down, PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars, negative five stars.","review":"I had open beart surgery two months ago and I have been desperate for reading material. Koontz is always a reliable read, so I whipped \\"The Taking\\" off the shelf without my usual perusal before buying.YUCK!Suspense? Not really. So many heavy-handed clues, fore-shadowings and religious flavorings, so much purple prose wondering how advanced aliens could be so evil---THEY AREN\\"T ALIENS IT\\"S SATAN, this book is part of the \\"Left Behind\\" genre!Hope I've saved you from reading the book.BTW, the narrative style is really cloying, third person narration telling us what the protagonist is thinking/obsessing about.If you like \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" you'll probably like this one.BAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"From Science Fiction to Bible Fiction at the End","review":"OK, I'll admit a lot of this book was kinda cheesy but I really LOVE that stuff! It features a clever alien takeover concept and I was completely hooked.But the ending was just plain stooopid. To take a sci-fi type premise and, at the very last minute, explain it all away as just a \\"Noah's Ark\\" type religious cleansing of the earth is absolutely absurd.It is almost as bad as the classic, last-chapter, \\"you were only dreaming\\" cop-out.Bad, Bad, Bad.On the other hand you might like this if you are big \\"Left Behind\\" fan!With a better ending I would have given the book at least 4 stars. As it is, I'd give it zero if it were possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, what a waste of time!","review":"I love world-end books...but as far as I can see, Mr. Koontz is not the one capable of writing a world-end story. The book tries to be a unique mixture of world-end books and movies but falls flat on full face. And the ending, with strong echoes of Left Behind series and the Stand, is one of the cheapset ends I have read in my whole life. Skip this stinking trick and re-read the Stand or watch the War of the Worlds again. And Mr Koontz, you'd better stick with your infinite horde of golden retrievers, labradors or whatsoever and your psychopaths--at least you were capable of bringing a REAL END to those stories...A shame on publishing world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if I could give it 0 stars, I would.","review":"This book was really awful. I have enjoyed Koontz's other stories in the past, especially classics like Watchers and even his recent crazy story, Life Expectancy.This book has no redeeming qualities. Everything feels very rushed. I feel no connections to the characters. He spent more time describing the way the neighbor's family was brutally killed (which has NOTHING to do with the story) than he did spending time getting to know Neil, who is key to the story. I know Koontz can make likeable characters, I have met many of them. He fails miserably in this. I hate to say it, but this is trash produced by an author that can ride on his past success. Not every book will be a success, but his editor/publisher should get smacked for this one.Okay, this book does have one redeeming quality. It is quite short. The amount of my life I wasted on this book was only about 2.5 hours...but that is 2.5 hours I won't be able to get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book drove me nuts","review":"I had never read Koontz before and picked this up at my in-laws house. While not normally the kind of book I read, it looked like it would be fun to read while on vacation. Boy, was I wrong. Instead of being fun, it actually p*ssed me off that I wasted my time on it. I will admit, the opening was fun and interesting, but the story quickly degenerated. The book moves from event to event with the apparent intention of filling up pages and not progressing the story. The only reason I finished the book was to see where it was going, thinking \\"it really can't be this bad.\\" Unfortunately, it wasn't going anywhere, at least not anywhere interesting. The climax is so lame (spoiler: they literally wake up in the morning and everything is fine) it amazes me this book got printed. Finally, it did feel like the author was getting a little preachy about his views on religion, which is not a bad thing if it's within the context of a good story. Sadly, this was not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this","review":"so you can save your time and money. A terrible book from a mediocre writer. All that religious/ political/ hope-springs-ethernal hodgepodge doesn't help it. Yes, I know I don't expect a Steinbeck/ Tolstoy/ Bradbury/ King style writing but hell I only wanted a pleasent read. Unfortunately there is none except silly cardboard characters and extremely screwed-up sentences. Pity for trees and souls like me who bought this dump thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the Work of a Best Selling Author?","review":"This is the first Koontz book I've read. It will be the last. His plotting is ill-concieved and simplistic...not to mention terribly ethnocentric. His conception of characterization relies wholey on hyperbole and repetition. Making matters worse is Koontz's insistence on creating heroes whose only qualifying characteristics are that they are not pathetically stupid and are sickeningly consistent in their lack of depth. His method of exposition assumes stupidity on the part of his readers...then, as if to apologize for his arrogance, Koontz juggles in as much obscure vocabulary as he can manage. One gets the impression of a writer struggling to be seen as a good writer rather than actually becoming one.The story is a throw-away knock-off of the Left Behind books, and deserves to be forgotten as quickly as possible.What I wonder is this: Why has Koontz become a successful writer in spite of being so bad at it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale and Disappointing","review":"Dean Koontz has turned out 5 (or is it 6) books this year. He is obviously going through a very prolific phase. It is unfortunate, but this book falls way short of typical Koontz brilliance. And I am a huge fan, having read every book he ever wrote.The Taking starts off strong with an interesting premise -- a new \\"War of the Worlds.\\" It quickly falls flat,however, with his tried and true cookie cutter characters -- the young and in love couple standing alone against the world in search of truth, justice, and the American way.Add a dose of idiotic plot twists (animated corpses, self-mutilating dolls, buzzing walls, psycho-sentient dogs) and the usual paint-by-numbers limn of atmospheric melange meant to instill fear and trepidation. The only thing it instilled was boredom relieved by non-stop ennui.My recommedation, skip this book and try some of the classic Koontz: Dragon Tears, Intensity, and Mr. Murder, just to name a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"the taking","review":"This was my first Koontz. It seemed at first a magnificently horrific war-of-the-worlds story but then lamely proves to be nothing but a marketable version of armageddon.

[...] would've loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money!","review":"I'm a long time Dean Koontz fan, but I did not like \\"The Taking\\". There was way too much narration and not enough dialogue between the characters. Characterization was weak, leaving you with the feeling that you didn't really know these people.There were plenty of scary moments, but they all fell flat. If Koontz had taken time with his characters like Stephen King did in The Stand and Salem's Lot, or the way Koontz himself did with Twilight Eyes and Watchers, he would've produced a very effective novel.The ending was a confusing mix of the book of Revelation and War of the Worlds. Considering the number of successes he has under his belt, I guess even an author as talented as Koontz is going to bomb out every now and then."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!!!","review":"I think this book was great it kept you on the edge of your seat and was never boring.

Try READING it and your opinion will change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Easy to Read","review":"This is my first book by this author. At first I find the story intriging, but as the pages went by, I was getting quite irritated by the digressing manner the story began drifting back and forth from present to the past.

Anyway, I got a bored halfway through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Balderdash","review":"Mr. Koontz appears to be addicted to overuse of the thesaurus, and has yet to learn how it is properly done.

I'll probably still buy his next book, but he has definitely fallen out of favor with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Please, guys doooon't quarrel over this chicken. It is not worthy. It is the first Koontz that I read; I read it after I saw some interesting Amazon reader reviews on it; and I highly regret that I didn't take into account the one-star ones. The ones attaching four or five stars should be simply acting with their hearts in it, not with their minds.The book is simply bad and falls flat on its face. The prose is the most terrible thing about it...add the preaching, almost lecturing narrative that goes nowhere, it is sure to give migraines anyone with a sense of taste in reading. And if this is really improved and polished Koontz over the years then thank you I would leave the other ones in the dust bin as well.Give a wide berth to this pointless thing passing as a novel.A quick note: I have read two King books (Bag of Bones and Dreamcatcher) and he seems to be far superior to Koontz. Should be no comparison there but of course Koontz experts should know better than me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Waste of A Day","review":"I must say, that I do like Koontz immensely. I found \\"Odd Thomas\\" to be quite good, as well as many of his other books. However, \\"The Taking\\" was just not for me.I recommend that you do not waste your time on this book. I dont want to begrudge anyone in terms of fulfilling their curiosities, but please dont even try here.The subject matter was confused, as well as the characters. The climax and conclusion were fuzzy, and not action packed for the buildup that was created.If you are looking for a book that will hold you steadfastly to your seat, that a suggestion: Read Patrick Suskind's \\"Perfume\\". AWESOME book. It is exceptionally strange, but a great story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye-rollingly bad","review":"I must agree with many of my fellow readers who rate this a one-star. I would have offered it a zero star rating if that was available to me. I have read many Koontz books over the years, and have found several to be highly worthy and compulsively readable. Not this one. Strange, since I highly enjoyed his previous effort, \\"Odd Thomas\\", that his very next novel should be so weak and pointless. (...). Who, anymore, gives a crap about yet another alien invasion? Eye-rollingly bad. How about saintly protagonists who, with the help of good doggies, go on a mission to \\"save the children\\" from all the spooky, omniscient, evil, omnipresent aliens?

My eyes kept skipping ahead to the next paragraph before i'd finished. i did notice the 'theme' about dogs, but it's not bothersome. it's not like the dogs saved the world or anything. Anywho, when i reached the last part of the book, where everything comes together and you think, \\"Oh yeeeeah. Now it makes sense.\\" i was actually thinking, \\"WTF?!\\" The end of the book made me seriously think that Dean Koontz got distracted by the 'Left Behind' series. That's the impression i got. Dean, you really let me down.

I just wasn't sure where the novel was going early on and that is what ruined it from the onset. Koontz didn't make me love the characters to wanna cheer for them at all. I felt it was thrown together too easily and it was a tad clich��d. I remember I was at page 200 and I had to stop and say; what the heck? Nothing is happening here, the action was minimal and the characters were wooden...(to me) The ending was a bit of a let down as well.I have to say wow, Koontz has written like 5 books in 2 years, this is too much. The stories are not as sharp and tight as they used to be. Dean slow down and write a tight good novel like Whispers. We will wait patiently for them. I will definitely continue reading Koontz, I am and will always be a great fan of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic attempt","review":"I ONLY gave it 2 stars because the beginning started out great.

Spare yourself!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was the best of openings, it was the worst of endings","review":"This book is an unintended paradox. It contains perhaps the best beginning of any of Koontz's books, yet probably the worst ending. That's not the whole problem--the middle isn't much good either. The minute descriptions of fungi are needlessly detailed, literally nauseating, and serve no purpose. And they go on and on and on. Did I mention the descriptions of fungi?As you read through the book, you keep wondering how certain issues will be resolved--the simple answer is: they aren't.Koontz is still one of the most talented writers in America. I've heard that Mr. Koontz has gone back to rewrite some of his previous books. I'd like to see him do that with this one--keep the first 1/4 of the book, and do something completely different with the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dean please come back","review":"The best book I ever read of Koontz was From the Corner of His Eye.Things have gone downhill.He has started with weird music and lost track of those of us paying for these increasingly weirder booksHello Dean??? What can we do to get you back?don't get this book.ellen in atlanta"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly needs a good editor..","review":"Once again I am convinced that Dean Koontz is paid for his writing by the kilogram. Within the first few paragraphs he skates on the thin ice of purple prose and then smashes through to spend the remainder of the book wallowing in overblown descriptive passages. To be honest some of the images he presents are in bad taste, not for the weak stomached. I found myself on countless occasions screaming internally for him to get to the point instead of using the pages for practicing his meandering literary technique. It's a shame, because when you filter out the excess adjectives and metaphors, it's possible to see that he does indeed have immense literary talent. His publishers are doing him a misjustice in letting him run away with his imagination. They need to reign him in and firmly direct him towards more worthwhile endeavours."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Koontz book ever!","review":"I absolutely love this book. The imagery is so creepy and the source of the creepiness was such a surprise! Can't recommend highly enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"End of the World - Draw Your own Conclusions and Enjoy the Ride","review":"I was looking for a distraction from life and found it! I have not read Dean Koontz in a long time. I forgot what a great storyteller he is. I was addicted to this book, it kept me riveted to the end. The start was great and I read every word. Later in the book, I found myself skipping parts and having to go back and read them. The book was one step away from being either a movie script or too much like the Left Behind series. The scary scenes I could visualize how they would be portrayed in a movie. The spirituality and religious angle was written for main stream American, with the reader drawing their own conclusions. I loved the analysis that the main characters, Molly and Neil, did comparing their situation to science fiction movies and writers, such as: Star Wars, Star Trek and Arthur Clarke."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Taking","review":"This book stunk. I am a long time fan of Koontz but if he keeps writing stuff like this I won't be. The Face was just as bad. Hey Dean stop goofing off and give us stuff like The Bad Place and Watchers!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel robbed","review":"Take my word and if you really want to read this silly thing, read the first 150 pages and then close the cover and hide it behind your other books. NEVER READ THE END! Otherwise you will do what I did: Put it to the bottom of the dust bin because you feel disgusted and robbed of your time and intelligence. I cannot express my shock and feel of treachery because of the most STUPID end I have seen in my whole lifeOh, Mr. Koontz, you, too, should have gone in that ship!"},{"rating":"1","title":"After finishing the last page, I threw this book across the room and vowed to never read Koontz again!","review":"I have read a handful of Koontz's books, mainly on vacation while lying on the beach in a half-drunken stupor. They usually are fairly entertaining and do not tax the mind too much with heavy plots.As with most fiction, I am usually disappointed with the endings. Ah, but this book takes the cake! Don't bother reading it unless you want to scream in disgust and hide your head in shame for the unabashed dissent into schlockiness (is that a word?) the author uses to tie up all the loose ends.I must say the book begins with a sense of hope. The descriptions and experiences of the rain and weird events in the first few chapters is really good. But, unfortunately, it just goes way, way, way, downhill from there.Sorry, Mr. Koontz. I won't be returning to your books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make it to the end of this book","review":"Try as I may, I couldn't make it all the way to the end of the book - A first for me in many years.

This book is boring, preachy, and downright judgemental. It drags and drags and the ending is just plain loony."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!","review":"I was so into this book up until about a third of the way and then it all just went down hill. I am so glad to see that others felt the same. I was really into the Terraforming concept but then it just got downright stupid.The part that really bothers me is that there are so many writers out there that have probably written extremely awesome books but will never see the light of day in the publishing world because all the money is spent on over-rated writers like Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I found this book trite in plot, especially in conclusion. The story felt very unresolved due to the poor climax, and it wasn't the 'spirituality' of it that turned me off. The entire work was rife with clich��.Save yourself the time, you'll never get back the hours of your life wasted reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Finally Happened!!","review":"10,000 monkey's typing on 10,000 word processor's with thesaurus's ...Write novel..{NO}..book...In all fairness I love most of DK works..But this one Suck's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best....","review":"Too many words, takes a long time to get to the point, you could read the last couple chapters and get 90% of the book. He takes whole chapters to tell something he could have said in one small paragraph. I have read many of his books and I am a real fan of his but this one is not done very well. The idea/theme of the book is pretty good, it is kind of a bible story, thought provoking, with a moral lesson, like most of his books. If you really like to read and like the author, try it, but you probably will be tempted to give up on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different for Koontz, and better","review":"I find it interesting that the opening review here smites King for Koontz. The two couldn't be more different, true, but King of late fills his books with compelling characters and a certain humanity the horror genre often lacks.Koontz also takes a different approach than most horror, ignoring the endless repetition of gory descriptions, but his characters never feel fully fleshed out. They never quite seem human, and always read like characters in a book. For this Koontz is rarely amongst my reads, despite friends in the publishing business that seem to give me every release gratis.The preachiness in this book mentioned by others is clear. It's there, and it will grate on you. For once, though, the characters seem to have some life in them outside of simple words on a page.Koontz seems to be trying something new, and rising as more than a mere RL Stine for adults. This story is more novel and less cookie-cutter, but still has ways to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I rarely review books I dislike so much, but this one truly is awful. I was hoping for an apocalyptic thriller, and I don't mind novels that end without complete resolution. That said, the protagonist's frequent quoting of T.S. Eliot annoyed me (especially because the quotations have no real connection to the novel's plot). Also disappointing were the undeveloped characters and plot. This novel is like sitting through a very long, boring trailer for a movie you suspect could be quite wonderful. Ultimately unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"good start","review":"This story starts out well. It grabs you from the begining, wondering what the heck it could be. But about half way thru the book, the story peters out. It starts to go the way of the new version of 'the second comimg' modern style. It could have been so much better. Koontz seems to stumble through the story like he had a good idea but didn't quite know where to take it. The ending was goofy, with 'them' just leaving, leaving a 'a brave new world'. Koontz is capable of so much better. It seems he just can't seem to get beyond his catholic upbringing. He seems compelled to insert some of it into his other books as well. I was disapointed in this one especially."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as subtle as a hand grenade","review":"I'm not a hard core Dean Koontz fan but I have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them (at least enough to pick up another from time to time)Until now.I've always found Koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'The Taking' is about as subtle as a hand grenade. We get it - people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life. They should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs.The preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'Noah's Arc' ending. This the worst novel I've read in a long time - and may be the last Dean Koontz novel I'll ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could Koontz write this?","review":"I have read the majority of Koontz' work and have always found it entertaining. \\"The taking,\\" however took me nowhere but confusion. What was he thinking? I was expecting a return to \\"Watchers\\" and, landed in a blinding rainstorm for a few hundred pages with a pack of dogs and and a rag tag band of lifeless characters pursued by a ridiculous fungus that stole peoples faces and stuck them on its hands. Try again, Dean. Your previous horror work blows this out of the RAIN! This was an utter waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"i have recomended dean koontz to my friends who previously would not read his books because they did not like to read about aliens. Koontz last few years have rendered very good books with a few exceptions. this book was definitely a waste of my precious reading time. i skipped over several chapters to get to the end which rendered nothing of value. i quickly emailed my friends advising them to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make me laugh!","review":"five or four star reviewers. This book is terrible and that's all! You can't admit that your 'pet' writer wrote a very poor book full of silly similes and egocentric show of unknown words. Koontz: my advice never forget that you are only an average suspense writer. Give up with playing thesaurus and dreaming of being the new T.S. Eliot of the century! Your writing skills are very mundane If there is anyone who doesn't believe me, then get and read book if you can stand. There is no story, not a single memorable line...only description, description and again description with some words I have never heard before (maybe from 17th century) No need to mention the pretentious overblown, unreasonable message!Pity for my five hours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"This book went from a good start to a mediocre middle to a bad ending. Not DK's worst but close enough. The relgion tie-in was, well for want of a better way of saying it hideous."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever","review":"This book is one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. The impression that it gave me is that the writers think that we love reading any garbage they write and that Koontz had a certain number of pages to fill in, so he couldn't stop repeating himself... what made for such a garbage, garbage, garbage... I thought all that ridiculous rave about ETs had ended in the 1990's, but I see that some people still think that ETs will take the Earth and abduct us... Ridiculous stuff. Unfortunately, there's no zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to forget","review":"WOW. I feel good. There really are people here that find something redeeming in this forgottable effort.Don't misunderstand me. I love Koontz. I have read 20 books of him, but he has recently somehow changed: he started to make a list of unknown words set side by side, resulting in what? Nothing! The Taking is the zenith of his love with these non-used words, and his willingness to show us how he is in command of language; but he simply forgot something: To tell a story with strong characters.Now two stars for the great beginning (which disturbingly reminds the Mist, though just like Mr. Murder reminded Dark Half and the Door to December reminded Firestarter) and my respect for Mr. KoontzI'll tell you: Two more offers like this and I am done with Mr. Koontz, no matter how his themes and language may be evalated because if this book was by another author, I would crush it under my feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Koontz novel ever !!!","review":"This one is just a waste of time, dont read it otherwise you would not read him again and he is a worthy enough writer to be given a second chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, terrible delivery","review":"I think this is a great idea for a book but the delivery SUCKS. I am normally a die hard fan of Deak Koontz but usually his books have been getting worse and worse. What is WRONG with him??? What is with all the LONG words and comparisons? This man is so busy trying to give us the meaning of life he does not focus on the story!! It took me a long time to get through this book. If you can deal with the fact he cant stop for one page to stay on the story line then maybe you can stomach through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it fair to review a book you just couldn't read???","review":"I started this book with high hopes. I just couldn't get past the second chapter! For some reason, the writing style Koontz chose for this book was so annoying that I just couldn't make myself read any further. Any you know what? There are too many good books out there to read, so don't waste your time on a bad one.First, it's almost like Koontz sat with a Thesaurus after he finished the story and changed what felt like 50 words in each paragraph to a word so obscure that even my English-major sister was looking them up in a dictionary. OK - I'm exaggerating the number, I'm just telling you how it felt.Second, his excessive use of similes was so distracting that I found myself counting how many of them appeared on each page."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Taking","review":"I have read all of Dean Koontz's books and usually love them but this book was a total waste of money.I struggled to finish it. It was very boring and uninteresting.I am very suprised that Dean Koontz actually wrote this book.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Time","review":"I read lots of books. Very few, do I quit reading before I finish. One was Stephen King's 'Misery', another, Bentley Little's 'The Collection' and another - Rex Miller's 'Slob' - and finally, there was this one. Can't give a complete review since I never finished the book, and usually, I enjoy Koontz's books, but this one is a real dog. Even slow starters get better after a few hundred pages - not this one. Horror? No, I don't think so, I'm still not sure what the book was supposed to be about - perhaps he just needed to complete some sort of publishing commitment. Pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much use of the theasarus feature!!!","review":"I have read all of Koontz's books and like many other people noticed, this is just too wordy, too much of an attempt to show just how many exotic ways he can use unusual words, to describe things like a window or sound outside. I am over halfway through and will finish it just because I want to know what is going on, but I am constantly rolling my eyes, and just thinking, this sentence takes too much work to figure out all of the words. I have a doctorate and am well educated, but on each page there are probably at least three words that I don't even know. I had always been annoyed in the past with his insistence on using the pretentious word \\"preternatural\\" in EVERY book and I looked for it and knew I would cringe when I saw it, but at least it would only be one or two sentences in the entire book. Well this entire book is like that! He really used the theasaurus feature too much in writing this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't snatch it up","review":"The foundation of success in a horror story is a strong, original beginning. The author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief. Dean Koontz failed to make this upfront investment in The Taking. The story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements - stormy night, body snatchers, magic mirrors, ghouls, and (Koontz's favorite) Delphic dogs - before settling down with a very modest storyline about a non-denominational rapture.Koontz can usually be counted on to deliver some pleasant thrills or humor if not the chills of real horror. But The Taking provides no such return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Below Par","review":"This is supposed to be the story of how a small town reacts to the end of the world. It was supposed to be reminscent of War of the Worlds. As I have read over 20 Dean Koontz novels, generally liking the vast majority of them, I had high expectations for this book. I enjoyed how he portrayed small town reaction to catastrophe in other books, and I was excited to see the reaction to an alien invasion. Unfortunately the book starts off on the wrong foot and never recovers. The story goes from bizarre occurrences, which are mildly intriguing at best, but deals with a lot of supernatural occurrences rather than aliens. All of the weird incidents are attributed to 'aliens may have technology that makes all this weird stuff seem to defy science as we know it.' Well, that doesn't help make the story exiting or intersting, just odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Slow Can u Go?","review":"I could only make it past page 18! I've read lots by this author and gobbled them up but WOW. 18 pages and Koontz is still writing about coyotes on the porch! I started to page through the book and more and more and more descriptions about the same stuff... the concept sounded awesome but dude! Where is the suspense? I didn't think a major author could have wrote a book more borning than some of the education books I had to read in high school and college but somehow Dean managed."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be ridiculous","review":"The Mist + Dreamcatcher + The Stand (by Stephen King) + Webster's New World Roget's A-Z Thesaurus + Oxford's Dictionary (19th century edition with obsolote words) + some phantasmagorial psalms + some small church talk + almost-blasphemy-like unacknowledged T.S Elliot borrowings = the Taking...with a bonus of one of the worst endings in the history; worse than that of Strangers, another book of him and Stephen King's ItSure you will feel uplifted when you finish it. You will be actually GLAD to get rid of it.By the way, it is T.S. ELLIOT, not Eliot...Bad. Simply bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The novel starts interestingly enough; a mysterious silver rain falls and animals start behaving unnaturally. Strange weather phenomenon is experienced over the globe. Soon it becomes evident that Earth is under attack. Things get increasingly strange and horrific from there.The problem is, the horror seemed very matter-of-fact, and the characters were so bland I had little reason to care what happened to them. The only thing that kept me reading was the element of mystery - what was behind the strangeness of some of the events?The mystery is largely resolved by the end (albeit with a couple of hanging threads). The ending itself comes as an interesting surprise and it wraps up the story, but the brief exposition at the end feels kind of tacked on.This is the first Dean Koontz novel I have read. On the basis of \\"The Taking\\" I won't be seeking out more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Used to like Koontz, but the past few books of his I've read have really disappointed me. There are a few, but only a few OK parts of this book. I'm surprised I stuck with it til the end but somehow I did. Such a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat interesting but not worth the read","review":"This was a difficult book to slog through. The Taking could have been so much more. It has a good concept and a good start, but loses it's way to the point that I was tempted to give up on it. It becomes muddled and lacks focus. It lumbers along with a cool idea but never really takes off. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche upon Cliche, Not in a good way.","review":"This book has a pretty good start but as usual with most of KOONT'S books they veer out of control in the middle and crash at the end. I spend more time critiquing than enjoying! Try \\"Phantoms\\" instead, it's not perfect but it's a far cry better than this mess. Better yet! read anything by Jeff Long this guy knows how to write an engaging, intelligent, unpredictable thriller!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I couldn't wait for this book to come out. Having read the synopsis, I thought \\"this is gonna be great\\". I was wrong. I usually like Mr. Koontz's books. They're always interesting and fun, and he knows how to scare. This started as a good book and turned into a quasi LeHaye/Jenkins book (that's the first thing I thought of at the end). Sorry, Mr. Koontz. I hope your next book (like Odd Thomas)is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geez...","review":"I've been a Dean Koontz fan for many years now. Or was, anyway. I used to recommend his books to everyone; he even became my favorite author, dethroning Stephen King! His books had a little of everything...although sometimes the cheese-factor gets out of hand.You know, it's funny, but when I used to discuss books and novelists with other people, I used to joke about Dean Koontz, \\"...in the past few years, he's either found Jesus or joined a cult!\\". The conclusion of this book confirms that I was closer to the truth than I initially thought.Read his earlier stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So terrible, I think it gave me cancer!","review":"I can't believe any money goes to Kootz for this book. Do not read this. For the love of GOD! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Read anything else. Even Dr. Seuss! This is one of the most unimaginative pieces of drivel I have ever read. EVER. Upon reaching the end, I decided to burn the book. Just stop trying, Dean. Don't be like Stephen King. The character development is dismal. The pace is sporadic. The plot...sweet Jesus, the plot! Don't listen to anyone who gave this book a rating of more than 2 stars.

This night, however, the liquid rhythms failed to lull her into slumber...\\" Are you cringing yet? Oh, it gets much worse. If you can force yourself to continue, you will be grinding your teeth to nerve endings by page 100.The sentence structure is stilted, the vocabulary pretentious. The characters are lifeless. And the dialogue--\\"I was plesantly soused, full of the giddy curiousity that makes dipsomania such an adventure.\\" Mr Koontz needs to study the art of how people speak. Read Robert B. Parker. Read Hemingway.Terrible, terrible stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follow the Yellow Brick Road, Dorothy!","review":"I was utterly stunned by Koontz and how he took a masterpiece that this book could have been and threw into the trash bin with such an insipid ending! I saw where he was heading toward the end and I prayed he would somehow reverse course and pull out a shocker ending, but, alas, no. He took the time and time again worn out path down the yellow brick road and saved the world with a boring \\"and they set out to build the world anew\\" hackneyed, blase quickie wrapup in the final pages. It was as if he put his heart and soul into this book, then suddenly became bored with it and decided to wrap it up as succinctly as possible to get it over with. I have been a life long Koontz fan, and I was utterly crushed by how shabbily he has treated his loyal readers with this one. For shame, Mr. Koontz! How dare you have the nerve to even charge for this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This was a really interesting book. It was suspenseful and kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next. It looks like people either love it or hate it. I enjoyed it. It was completely implausible and often I had to laugh at the impossible things Koontz was able to dream up and describe so vividly. It was just a really good trip to another world, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow... that was a letdown.","review":"I'm a big time Koontz fan, and I find most of his books to be suspenseful page-turners. I anxiously look forward to his books as they came out. My wife picked this up for me when it came out and within the first chapter I was thinking \\"Wow, what a letdown\\". This book just lacks the intense page-turning suspense of his usual books. It picked up a little further into the book, but tended to drag on. I found the story/concept in the book interesting, but the story itself just wasn't written up to my expectations for his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Koontz has lost it.","review":"There was a time when I could not wait for the next Dean Koontz book to come out. Those were the days of books like 'Watchers', 'Lightning' and 'Whispers. The last few, especially 'The Taking' have been down hill and not worth the bother. It seems Koontz is far more interested in getting his own political views across than he is in writing good books. Sorry to say it but this was my last Koontz read."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be no stars","review":"What a waste of trees!Quick summary: God, in a bad mood for some reason, sends spaceships full of odd mushrooms to kill everyone.

That is the book in essence."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment.","review":"I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A \\"Left Behind\\" book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Koontz Book Ever","review":"This really deserves no stars. The book could have been about 100 pages long and that would have been too long.

I believe dean koontz is on top of his game right now. \\"the taking\\" is suspenseful and scary. had me guessing throughout the book. what appears at first to be a full scale alien attack is something far more dark, sinister and shocking. believable heroine and heroic animals you can't help but root for. very clever and fun read. too many books with engaging stories have abrupt or unsatisfying endings, not this one. it came as a complete surprise to me.

That was an unfortunate choice, because the audio static drove me crazy trying to figure out what I had set up incorrectly. Now that I've read other reviews here (and verified that my other Blu Rays sound terrific), I realize the problem is the \\"Dark City\\" disc. While I'm obviously relieved the problem is not my new TV or player, I'm disappointed I won't have an enjoyable Blu Ray experience with this film (apparently until I upgrade from simple stereo to full surround sound). I've seen \\"Dark City\\" in the theaters and on regular DVD, so I didn't hesitate to buy it again on Blu Ray. It's a beautiful, 5-star film, but be leery of this Blu Ray audio experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb film","review":"I've always loved this movie, and when I saw that it was available in Blu-Ray I jumped at it. I was interested that it contains both the director's cut and the original theatrical version, and have watched, and enjoyed, both. But, contrary to my pre-conceptions, I prefer the theatrical version. This is often the case; the compromises directors are \\"forced\\" to make sometimes make for a better move in the end: Last of the Mohicans and Blade Runner come to mind as other examples. Yet I cannot figure out why this should be so.Anyway, a great movie, wonderfully rendered in Blu-Ray, and at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and boring","review":"I love science fiction, but not this movie. The first few minutes are great. A man wakes up without a memory. He is confused and scared. Then everything just becomes a painful, slow bore. The beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly is wasted in this atrocious movie. Sleep. You can go to sleep. Sleep I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a bit boring","review":"The movie had interesting scenes here and there but for the most part it wasn't all that exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shamefully Bad","review":"Terrible acting, lousy script, well that just about sums up Dark City, a retro-science fiction disaster that has a trite story line and characters so flat you could slide them under a door. I have no idea why this film is popular with anyone. Please don't waste your time with this poor attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but had it's flaws","review":"Now, this truly is a great movie, and is worth the rent at the very least by any Sci-Fi/Fantasy fan.The problem I have is with all the other reviewers saying that the Matrix copied Dark City, some of it was filmed at the same places, but think about this. Dark City was released 1 year before The Matrix (so it did come out first,) but odds are The Matrix in that year was more or less working on the special effects, and not the plot of the movie.This movie is great, but I am getting tired of it getting compared to The Matrix so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Siskel says -","review":"This was the final \\"Best movie of the year.\\" Claimed by Gene Siskel prior to his passing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good blu-ray quality. Story didn't hold interest.","review":"Even though the story was meant to keep you wondering what was really happening, I found it to be rather boring and complicated. Scenes with the bald guys recurred too often and were not interesting. There are some good special features. Director's cut offered considerably more content. For a movie which was supposed to be dark, the quality was good, but the scenery was bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Movie Gets Amazing Director's Cut and AAA HiDef Presentation","review":"Dark City has always been in my top five favorite movies ever since I saw it in the theater. Between the theater, VHS, and DVD, I have probably seen this movie 25-30 times. Now, with the release of the Director's Cut on Blu-Ray, I am sure I will be watching it many more times.The D.C. has many new pieces that add to the puzzle of the storyline. Also, the removal of the intro voice over is a welcomed change. Top that off with a crisp HD transfer, with deep blacks and vivid colors, and you've got a real masterpiece here.I cannot recommend this enough. Dark City is one of those movies that nobody seems to have heard of, but whenever I have forced somebody to watch, they ALWAYS love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whole new World you won't want to miss.","review":"This movie was my surprise purchase of the year and on my list it scores right up there with \\"Watchmen\\", \\"Flash Gordon\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" and is a thoroughly enjoyable mind bender of the 1st Degree. Seldom does a movie keep me guessing right up to the very end but when all is finally revealed it is the most one of the satisfying cinematic experiences you'll have in a long time.A true mix of Film Noir and science fiction unlike any other. I only wish I had seen it in the theatre but in upverted 1080p on a 60-inch Sony Bravia it is still a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before the Matrix","review":"First off, everyone who says this movie is just like the Matrix forgets that Dark City came out before the Matrix. The acting is much better in this movie. Also, the commentary by Roger Ebert is extremely interesting. Once you understand the genre of Dark City, then you can appreciate the acting done by Kiefer Sutherland. This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Buy this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Acting","review":"This film has some of the worst acting i've ever seen. The movie has a good story line but it;s hard to watch with this terrible acting. DONT BUY THIS, you will only watch it once. Hire it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark City","review":"I have a poor laserdisc of this. After seeing it the second time, I want to upgrade to DVD. Sutherland is excellent as the doctor, his acting is on a par with Sean Penn. Rufus Sewell is very convincing, but who is this masked man? I haven't seen him before or since. I need to look harder I guess. Jennifer is always gorgeous but I wish she was a better actor. Hurt is always very good and he did not disappoint this time. If you don't enjoy this movie, then you are probably not a sci-fi fan. I enjoyed it more than Blade Runner. I needed to watch it twice; first to follow the story line; second to appreciate the acting. The brief nudity is not contrived and this film shows that we can have convincing dialog without resorting to foul language. I hope it was a financial sucesss so that Hollywood can provide more exciting films like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood","review":"The most common criticism of this film is that the characters are shallow. OF COURSE they're shallow. They have no past. Not one that informs their being in any meaningful way. Taking that as a given, the film is an imaginative effort worth applauding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Audio Malfunction","review":"For some obscure, techno-geek reason, some blu-ray discs won't function on certain blu-ray DVD players, Sony chief among them. I tried two different copies of this blu-ray and encountered the same malfunction, which was major distortion in the 7.1 DTS audio of the film itself. Back to the regular DVD release for me: some technical advancement is functionally a step backward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful way to spent a couple of hours","review":"It won't light up your life but if you like dark sci-fi this is worth the cheap price. The effects aren't bad and the storyline is interesting, if not very plausable. More could have been done to increase the menace level of the bad guys - they just din't seem scary enough, more because of scripting I think and not the acting or make-up which were both adequate and more.Worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Concept but Delivered Poorly in the Film","review":"As a sci-fi fan, I've often wondered how good this film was. I took the notion to purchase the film and it was absolutely not what I expected. The antagonists in the film were way too weird to even imagine they could be real. The story has an interesting concept and I believe that it could have been delivered much better than the cheese seen in this movie. Don't let the well known actors fool you in this one. They're at their worst delivering some of the most cheesy dialog with superficial expression. This one is going back to the sale rack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Sounds make for an unpleasant movie nite","review":"I should have read the reviews before I purchased this but this was my first blu-ray disc and I was a little too hasty. When you first put it in you hear something - then as the movie progresses you hear more... what is that? Static on a brand new DVD (BD)?... wow I thought I was going crazy until I read the reviews and other articles on the internet. DO NOT PURCHASE if you expect to play the sound via HDMI into a TV like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sets","review":"The movie has great sets, and is kind of a mix between matrix and blade runner. However the acting is unconvincing, the big secret is revealed at the beginning, and the character development is weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"With all the positive reviews, and an inclusion on Robert Ebert's great movies list, I thought this film would have at least have a single redeeming quality. Nope. I guess if you liked the 3rd Matrix this might be up your alley. Melodramatic and predictable in the extreme.The plot feels like it was written by a middle school dungeons and dragons club: the characters are flat, the pacing is totally off, and the fight scenes are essentially taken straight from dragon ball Z.All I can hope for is that mystery science theatre 3000 does a reunion episode so I can get something out of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken DVD","review":"Upon opening the DVD case, the DVD was cracked from edge to center. I was not able to play the DVD and I promptly returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I gave this movie one star for the incredibly freaky, yet artistic setting of the movie. I gave it another star because the overall story IS good. Unfortunatly, Hollywood has again succeeded in messing up a movie that had potential. This movie was a total and complete waste of my time. It's so confusing that it gave me a headache. Not only that, the characters aren't developed enough, the acting is lousy, and the ending was totally and completly stupid. It didn't scare me; it bored me to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"What more can I say that hasn't already been said? Great extra features and commentary. Amazing price so I simply had to get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"I don't buy very many videos, even of favorite movies, but I'm buying this one!The dark vision, the chilling beauty, the perfectly realized film noir/sf combo -- all have been commented on before. But how many films ask questions in which the answers don't leave you wanting more? Few indeed. But in Dark City, you never know what'll happen next, and when your questions are finally answered, in the last 10 minutes, I guarantee you'll be as blown away as you've been during the rest of the movie.Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"COOLEST MOVIE THAT I'VE EVER SEEN","review":"Usually, when you seen a movie, either the story is bad, or the special effects are bad. It's not everyday that you stumble across a movie that totally blows your mind. Although I've seen better special effects they had just the right amount, so that they didn't drown out the storyline. The plot is so thick that everytime you watch it you pull out new facts that make the movie fit together all the more tightly. In this movie there was no need for endless and pointless gore. I love this movie and if you don't then you need to get your head checked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great visuals. Good concept","review":"The visuals for this movie are incredible. It is very clear that the people behind the Crow have been involved in the visuals. The story maybe isn't that well developed, but has an interesting premise. The quality of the DVD is great, I have not noticed any glitches whatsoever. If you're looking for an original movie with great imagery and a weird story, this is the one to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple review.","review":"BOTH versions of the movie are on this blu-ray disc. The sound and picture are great even if the people seem soft in a few scenes. The extra features are nothing to write home about, but there are more here than on the standard DVD version (non Director's Cut). It also comes with a free download of the movie in standard format. Overall, I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star movie at the very least!","review":"This movie is my second favorite sci-fi movie. It's orignality is sure to keep the viewer's interest. Also it stars Kiefer Sutherland. He puts on a very strong acting role, one of his best. The movie presents a scary phenomenon in which Strangers are able to stop time at 12 am. While time is stop they re-arrange people and give them new identities. People wake up not realizing who they are or who they were yesterday. However, one man is still able to move while time is stopped. There is an icredible one one one confrontational battle where each person is using mental powers in attempt to destroy the other (similar to the force in Star Wars). However, the plot thickens as you learn about what the Strangers are really up to. Oh, did I mention that the Strangers are aliens?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very dark","review":"I love how dark this movie is and it's from the director of\\"The Crow\\" you can't go wrong with this movie check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Crow meets Bladerunner","review":"A lot like the Crow and Bladerunner, dark as a film noir movie ought to be. My only complaint is the overdramatic music. The visual effects are stunning, and the plot is very well written. A great movie all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hidden gem","review":"A brilliant movie made even better in Blu-Ray. A great Sci-fi story with wonderful performances by Rufus Sewell, William Hurt and Keifer Sutherland. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Marred only by a somewhat out-of-place and formulaic action sequence near the end, this otherwise-perfect film deftly blends a fusion of times and genres into a spellbinding movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better","review":"The great vision of this movie is enhanced with the Blu-Ray format.This movie is made for High-Def and a big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is one of the best movies I have seen in awhile. The story not be that fast paced, but if that's all your into, learn something. This is GREAT....BUY BUY BUY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looking, if a somewhat empty story.","review":"Going against the grain, I was disappointed by this film. It looked like a million bucks, had outstanding art direction, set design, and special effects. In that, there was vision. But the story is convoluted, and often has nothing coherent to keep it driving forward. Like it suffered from an identify crisis. I often felt like I was watching something impressive (and expensive), but with nothing in the story to keep my curiosity going or my anticipation up I had a hard time keeping interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best movies people haven't seen","review":"My first impression of this movie was based on one of the trailers that I had seen in the theatres. Unfortunately, the preview doesn't really tell you what the story is about, but ironically that made me enjoy the movie much more so.I'm no Siskel or Ebert, but this has to be one of the best movies of all time. It's definitely bound to become a cult classic. Like Blade Runner, this movie touches upon the search for identity, and that what makes it so engaging. The lighting and colors, as well as the set design, brings this movie to life. It is a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Sci-Fi in this flick","review":"Strong in story and plot, weak on characters, Dark City is a triumph considering today's mundane choice of genX and couples comedies. The story reminds of a Rod Serling twilight zone twist. This piece of sci-fi is sure to be talked about for a long time to come. Only hitch: the aliens look exactly like the cenobites from \\"Hellraiser\\" fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a great value","review":"I just recently bought this DVD for this ridiculously low price. I feel like I owe more money. The story is one of the better sci-fi stories I have seen in a while. I don't want to give anything away as far as the plot goes. Let's just say the main character, played with brilliant bewilderment by Rufus Sewell, is stuck in a situation he has no knowledge of getting himself into. Like Jason Bourne, our hero learns about his world at the same rate that we do, since he can't trust his own memories. All the performances are great especially the underrated Kiefer Sutherland. The extras are all informative.Now if the director would have taken the talent he shows here up a notch with I, Robot instead of going down a level."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTRAORDINARY!","review":"I first watched \\"Dark City\\" in the theater. I was hooked at that moment. It was one of the most original films I had watched in a long time. Director Proyas does a masterful job at directing this Neo-Noir Science Fiction extravaganza. \\"Dark City\\" is reminiscient of \\"Blade Runner,\\" with its extreme set design, with obvious influences in early German expressionist films like \\"Nosferatu\\" and \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\\" If you are a fan of \\"Blade Runner,\\" then \\"Dark City\\" is a must to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your time and money.","review":"I am a lifelong, avid Sci-fi fan. I read all these reviews saying that this was some sort of cult classic, not true. Sadly those reviews must be from those that never watch anything BUT Sci-fi.The movie was horrible, the story was scattered.Not well done in any shape or form."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFULL: Mortal Combat meets Crouching Tiger","review":"I'd add \\"meets 28 Days Later\\" to the title, but that would be an insult to 28 days.Wow. I can't believe this movie got so many rave reviews. Maybe it would be useful if the reviews included the reviewers age.To even mention Blade Runner in context with this movie is a joke.We both fell asleep, twice!They don't make movies like they used to, thats for sure.I wish I too could fight evil by pointing my forehead and issuing a \\"shockwave\\".Look for my copy to turn up soon, cheap.If you're an adult, best to skip this excersize in stupidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted potential","review":"This sci-fi noir thriller has some yawning gaps in its plot, and the sets, though interesting, can't make up for the paucity of material. A friend who knew of my appreciation for \\"Blade Runner\\" recommended \\"Dark City\\" to me. I don't base this review on Ridley Scott's film (which has its own flaws and contradictions), but on its own the movie feels flat. It belongs more to the world of \\"Dick Tracy\\" than \\"Blade Runner\\" or \\"Metropolis\\". Actors like Keifer Sutherland, Ian Richardson and William Hurt are wasted in this half-hearted effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"the dark side of 'The Truman Show'","review":"that about sums it up :-)lots and lots and lots of style, not a whole lot of feeling. terrific FX and some nice touches (the aliens' names, for example). but a month or two later, I remember nothing but the ambience. it was good ambience though :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are we who we think we are?","review":"Dark City was an excellent film which plays on a feeling that each of us has experienced at one time or another, that feeling that we believe we lived another life. Rufus Sewell as Murdock is excellent, supported by Hurt and Connelly in their respective roles. Sutherland overdoes his role slightly, but is overcome by acting of Richard O'Brian as one of the \\"Strangers.\\" Excellent movie!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This One Is A Classic","review":"This is one of the best sci-fi movies in years. It is visually unique, suspenseful, intelligent and surprisingly romantic. I look forward to seeing Alex Proyas' future work."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent movie! 'nuff said!","review":"As one of the best sci-fi movies of the 90's, this movie film contains a nice balance of film noir and science fiction. Alex Proyas's vision mystifies and explores the dark elements of life with this film and The Crow, and can be classified as one of the great film makers, along with Luc Besson (The Professional, Fifth Element) and Ingmar Bergman (Seventh Seal)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A phenomenal, unique film; this edition fixes its only flaw.","review":"In the original edition a voiceover at the beginning, added at the behest of the studio, explains 2/3 of what was intended to be a mystery for most of the film. It always bothered me, being one of the few discernible flaws in an otherwise masterful \\"neo-noir\\" exercise for the cerebellum. Luckily, the Director's Cut axes this unfortunate component. If you are new to Dark City, BUY THE DIRECTOR'S CUT. Besides the aforementioned exclusion, there are also other noteworthy inclusions to the story. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't go into detail, but the new scenes add depth and extra angles to an already engrossing character-driven story. Last but not least, the three commentary tracks are entertaining, particularly Roger Ebert's track. All in all, a great value for one hell of an underrated masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites","review":"I was surprised to read the editorial review at the top... The idea itself behind this movie is enough to make it interesting. Amazon's editorialist needs to have his memory switched out when they tune down the city."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is messed up","review":"Ok, I have an excellent system, new Sony Blu Ray, Onkyo amplifier and a Vizio TV. However, when playing this disc the audio has this unbearable noise that makes it impossible to enjoy.

When played back through a stereo receiver or TV there is much static/distortion of the audio track. I tried two different discs with the same result. Had to return them both. Fortunately Amazon's customer service is excellent. There are numerous similar comments from other customers here, wish I would have read them before I ordered the movie. It's possible that when played back through a new receiver with the proper decoding that the distortion goes away, but when played through a stereo receiver or TV it's unbearable. I have purchased many, many blu-ray discs and this is the first and only time I have experienced this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but I hated this film","review":"Dark City is one of the few films that I have ever disliked to watch. I found it difficult to pay attention to the film because it was so un-entertaining. Admittedly, its plot is different and looks at existing ideas in a fresh angle but the style of this film was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not region free","review":"Important information especially for customers outside the USA. This movie is not region free, but instead region A (America). You cannot play this disc in any European country !!! I have to return my disc, because I cannot play it.Since blue ray is the winner in the HD format, more and more blue ray discs are no longer region free.One star for the wrong information by Amazon, not for the film. The film deserves a five star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark City","review":"I was greatly disappointed with this film, although it boast a great actor listing the movement and story line were flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Pity","review":"I purchased this film solely on the reviews and without previewing. Though I am a huge fan of the genre, it is extremely rare when it is well done. This was indeed a sophmoric work, a grand idea but without a budget and substandard writing (Sam Raimi???)it is difficult to pull off. It seems that Blade Runner, with about the same two or three soundstages, created a world far more unique and captivating. This story had a great influence on the Matrix, but it developed unnaturally fast even to be comic book plausable. It was sloppy, choppy and without depth. Finally, when the true nature of the \\"Dark City\\" is revealed, it reminded me of some bad anime, full of techinical imagery, but without any true vision.In short, its drive-in fare"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie and great on DVD!","review":"This movie was one of the best I've seen in over a year! The imagery and production were superb! Certainly in the ranks of Blade Runner or Coppola's Dracula for being visually stunning. I was surprised at the defensive nature of the special features section, as I don't see anything for which the makers of this film to be apologetic or even defend. This film will stand on its own as have Metorpolis, Blade Runner and other movies that took their audiences further than may have been comfortable for some. I encourage you to listen to part of the commentary by Roger Ebert - he clearly liked this movie as well, and offers unique insight in his commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies in a very long time!","review":"This movie has two things that are severely lacking in the motion picture industry these days: (a) creativity; (b) originality!This movie is undescrible. Somehow, it reminds me of a mix between Phillip K. Dick's Blade Runner and Terry Gilliam's Brazil. It is a wonderfully superb movie, with an equally excellent story. Watch it. See what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sci-Fi Movie Ever","review":"This movie I was impresed with right from the begining. just with all the city images andhow they changed the city every night was just fantasticly done.and the story keeped you going right in the first five minuets.Its a story of a man's suffered a memery loss and a demented geius helps him control his power.When his memory is lost he is framed for a murder.A sympathetic detective is after him and a group of ominous beings are after him. throghout the movie you have questions that you want to be ansered and they are ansered in time throgh the movie.Anyone who loves a good Sc-Fi and mystery with awesome speacial effects than see dark city.

I used this book during the planning stages to identify fun things to see and do. I really loved the descriptions of possible side-trips, such as London Bridge in Lake Havasu City, the Petrified National Forest, Walnut Canyon National Monument, and many others. This book does not contain maps, however, or instructions on how to stay on Route 66; the actual road signs are not clear at times, and instructions (or a good map) is essential.

With no formal art training and no prior experience with painting, I have learned and am able to apply the principles and techniques taught by the author.

I've competed at the most basic amatuer level in triathlons, and I've led a life that is relatively healthy (I run often, know how to swim, and I take a long bike if the weather permits). Knowing how to eat right, and how to stretch, this book provide absolutely no help to me. If, though, you've never done anything althetic before, and you don't know that \\"whole foods are better for you than processed foods,\\" and you need to be told not to eat mayonaise three times a day, then maybe you should consider reading this before competing in a triathlon. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style","review":"I'll confess I only made it through the first 2 chapters, then I quit. The info seemed decent, but you really have to like this style of writing, which I don't. I'm guessing the author's 3 main objectives, in order of priority, were (1) be light 'n' breezy even if you say nothing (we learn that the bagpipes are \\"an instrument intended to make up for the country's ongoing lack of battle strategy\\"); (2) imitate David Barry; (3) say something about Celtic history. If you like that style (and it appears other reviewers do), then fine.

Some of the best laughs come from a young Asian boy who is brought up by an Italian family and his delivering of many familiar phrases is hilarious. Unfortunately the rest of the film is not as consistent.The cast is good and the Italian family is spot on, but there are only scattered laughs. I've seen this all before and done better.

There is no building of characters, no climax. You either step right in and enjoy the ride or get off.The main character is such a hard nut to crack. There are some authors who want you to empathize wth the characters and you are drawn into the story. Mr. Burke does the opposite, he intentionally keeps the main character distant. You never really get inside of what he's like, only a glimpse that he does have feelings when he carries on a relationship with an HIV positive female.The book wasn't very long and reads like snapshots. You'll get your focus but then it's gone. You'll either finish this book and stick with it because reading this chaos is manageable or you'll put it down out of frustration that it's all over the place. There's no middle ground with it. I invite you to give it a try and if you finish it I can guarantee you won't forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lean on detail but packs a powerful punch","review":"I picked up this book because Burke is, like myself, a former paramedic and author, and our writing deals with a similar theme: the emotional lives of people who work with and around pain and death. Burke has a sparse writing style that is lean on detail and left me feeling like I was held at arm's length from really getting to know the characters. I also wanted more detail about the paramedical happenings (but I'm a medical drama junkie so that's probably just me!). That said, this book is masterful in many ways. Burke takes a bleak situation and inhabits it with people that we all know/recognize in real life. Then there's love...for who can control WHO we fall in love with?? And somehow, he writes beauty into this relationship and what comes after it (which I'll keep to myself so as not to ruin it for others!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard hitting powerful emotion","review":"the pemier album by Walkinbird proves that rock music can still exist in a genine form!

This is great if you are in college and researching male dancers or something but otherwise it's kind of lame.

Whoever was the camera man and the director need to really watch nude men,at times it seeems like he didn't want to show alot of the men waist down....yeah you see something once in awhile but it seems to me that more women in the audience had alot of camera time. It really was not worth the money and It could have been alot better. Women or Gay Men could have shot this video better and given better sceans. I can't believe I wasted my money on this video.... but wait, on the cover of the video it has \\"Director's Cut\\"!!!!

After installation, the signal sent from the DVD player (a regular DVD upconverted to 1080P) was displaying static noise all over the place. Rechecked connections to make sure everything was plugged in correctly, but nothing helped. On a hunch, I set the DVD player to send a 1080i signal to the HDTV: no more static. Researching online, I found other people had the same problem with other cables from other companies: their problems were solved when they replaced their cheaper HDMI cables with more expensive ones. Since my HDTV also upconverts to 1080P, I ended up letting the DVD player upconvert only to 1080i, but this is not what I was expecting to do when purchasing this cable, and there is no reason why this cable should not be able to carry a 1080P signal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I bought this cable a couple months ago in preparation for wall mounting my TV.

After wasting all that time to run the cable I couldn't get a signal, then I ran a different cable I had laying around and had no problems at all, but this cable was to short to rerun behind the wall. I then had to go buy a new one that worked from a local store, and come to find out now that I'm passed the return period on this piece of junk...All in all I was very unhappy with all the time that was wasted, not to mention the money!

My rating is based on the price associated with this dvd pack - please do the simple math. It is possible to pick up all the seasons of Frasier at Amazon.com for a lot cheaper if you buy them separately. I simply do not understand this extra cost associated with buying the set - are we becoming so lazy that we are willing to pay a premium in excess of US$ 30 to buy the set together instead of going through the trouble(!) to buy them separately?

Their last few albums have been great. This latest CD seems very difficult to listen to as it just sounds like they went overboard with the distortion. The combined exhausting vocals that try so hard to be dark and scary, but are so overdone, end up sounding like static no matter what volume or settings I listen to it at. Shamefully, only one or two songs on this CD stood out to me, compared to their earlier works that all sounded pretty good. The rest just fades away into a noisy hodgepodge of screeching garbage. The vocals are unintelligible, which isn't such a big deal (who pays attention to the words anyway with this music) but the echo effect and guttural ranting gets old way too fast. Add so much distorted noise that you can barely appreciate what music lies beneath the mess, you get a CD that sounds damaged when in fact it is just the noise you just paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"Wow Papa,This book is great!

Aside from recording quality I can see most of these songs appearing on Character. Guitarwork is tight, and DT is without a doubt my favorite metal band... they don't simply grind charnel house with their guitars, the construct beautiful melody that speeds right along.Though metal fans tend to be fickle, I have to say that the established a specific style with this album, and though they broke from it largely in the future, they've emerged a very mature and competent band that takes these ideas and makes something truly new and original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be wise and buy it...

What caracterizes this music is the, what I call, \\"Clever Riffs and Melodies,\\" meaning neither brutal, nor very melodic music, but catchy-it sticks in your mind after. This album is the successor of At The Gates' \\"Slaughter of the Soul\\" and the continuation of the tradition in more technical, at times more melodical, conceptions.I absolutely guaranty that no human being who enjoys Death Metal will not like this masterpiece.

The production is real good too with good clear sound. I just wish a band with this kind of talent would toss the death vocals. If someone like Bruce Dickinson from Iron Maiden took over it would be scary how far these guys could go. Even though I hate the grunting I'll still give this a 5 star, because I would recommend to any metal fan. Will I buy more from this group?

My favorite passage in this book goes as follows: \\"Recent linkage analysis studies have replicated initial reports of positive linkage to chromosome 6 markers in families with schizophrenia. Although there are several negative studies, the evidence implicating the short arm of chromosome 6 is the strongest to date for schizophrenia.\\" \\"Several negative studies\\"? That sounds quite uncompelling to me. If you are going to assert that mental illnesses are genetic and human beings can be reduced to genetic robots..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky interface, missing features, European sounds","review":"I'm not familiar with other computer based Spanish-English dictionaries with audio pronuncaiation, or even if there are any.

I have been using this for years and panicked slightly when my local grocery store stopped carrying it. Luckily I found this on Amazon and had no hesitation about buying a case of twelve canisters. I love the brownie recipe on the back of the container but have also successfully made rich chocolate cakes and frostings with this cocoa. The Saco web site also has some good recipes that I'd recommend. I would not ever go back to Hershey's or Nestle's cocoa powder; even Ghirardelli (which I love for their delicious semi-sweet chocolate chips) does not compare to this.

The setup for the lead character's transition to life as a courtesan is abbreviated and unconvincing. There are too many horrible moments for this to be romantic.

I always enjoy when I'm able to learn something new. A courtesean's life was similiar to a Geisha girl in Japan. The women are gifted in the art of seduction, music, dancing, singing and conversation. One of the benefits that this life afforded them was education. Courteseans also enjoyed much more freedom than society allowed the majority of most women. Of course the price for education and freedom was the sacrifice of safety and protection that marriage would have provided them. A good quote from the movie, \\"My cage might be bigger than yours, but it's still a cage.\\" (Courtesean to married woman) The end of the movie that involves the Inquisition was a surprise.

The costumes are very well done. The acting is very decent, but I was so distracted by the whole premise \\"sexual promiscuity=freedom\\". Historically, women were treated unfairly; I still think the heroin's \\"profession\\" is incredibly demeaning. The whole \\"love need not heed any rules or morals\\" doesn't work for me in a story.

I rented it on a whim, but it proved to be an enjoyable evening's viewing. Catherine McCormack is excellent as the witty heroine, Veronica Franco, and Rufus Sewell does justice to an underwritten part as her lover, Marco.

This movie delivers that and more, wonderfully romantic. Yes, it does glorify prostitution, but so did Pretty Woman, and that movie was a huge hit.If you are a history buff looking for historical accuracy...pass on this film. However, if you are a romantic who is looking for a beautiful period love story...this is your movie! It has been and remains, my all-time favorite movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerously Addicting","review":"This is a movie to watch again and again without ever tiring of it.

This is a great movie to give as a gift as well as for a girls' night in with a glass of wine. The plot holds your interest till the very end and leaves you wanting to watch it again.

There are root-beer floats and chocolate milkshakes (hers is quadruple-chocolate!) but also scroppino (Champagne, lemon sorbet, and vodka) and sorbet terrine with raspberry sauce.

I made a cookie crumb ice cream cake the day before my dinner party in between shopping, cleaning and other chores. It seemed to take almost no extra time and it was beautiful as well as delicious. My two teenage sons were also very proud of their hot fudge sundae tart, but unfortunately, they ate almost all of it themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I was unpleasantly surprised to find that this book is a collection of the author's recipes. Might be my bad for assuming that there would be more IceCream Cake ideas. Most of the \\"ideas\\" are things that you could come up with on your own with a little imagination. Verdict: Don't waste the bucks unless you want a step-by-step on how to scoop ice cream and make it look \\"purty.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER COOL AND VERY, VERY ENTERTAINING","review":"This baroque , shady and very entertaining book is an epic tour of the gilded and subterrean world of con men, hustlers and gamblers. What surprised me about this book is despite the narcissism and aggression of many of the characters portrayed here, they (and the book) have a artistic and poetic pedigree too. A lot of great writers are in this book --Borges, Baudelaire, Dostoevsky, Luc Sante, Runyon, Brecht, Saul Bellow, Nick Pilegg,i. Hunter Thompson, David Mamet, Nick Tosches and Martin Amis. BUt for my money, the gem or the jewel in the crown is John Molyneux's mini-memoir of gambling in London in the sixties, which, apparently, is a piece written especially for the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not hesitate to purchase this book.","review":"I bought this book as a reference for a con related video game I am working on.

Overall, a very fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"starts out fine, then gets loud","review":"Seems to work, and is inexpensive. When it first starts, it makes a reasonably small amount of noise. You can hear the fan, but it's not too bad. I would be happy if that's all the noise it ever made. But after a half hour or so on my machine, it seems to perhaps warm up to the point where the fan speeds up to keep it cool. At that point it's pretty loud and even rattles a bit.

Also, what compounds the problem is that the butcher was never caught.So, what do you got? A John Gilmore SEVERED type of tale? Not quite, because John Gilmore is the superior writer and his book is a compelling read every step of the way (even though John Gilmore was not certain of who did Elizabeth Short in, either.)But hey, some scribes are born true-crime writers, some are not.I did say when the author of Torso stays with the bodycount and the ensuing manhunt the book is a scream--by that I mean it just might make your lunch back up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating saga of an important New York immigrant family","review":"Richard K. Lieberman's \\"Steinway & Sons\\" delighted me. As a writer doing research into late nineteenth-century New York, I found Lieberman's saga of this German family bringing its craftsmen's tradition to New York and making out very well indeed fascinating. The members of the family come alive in all their shrewdness and occasional peccadilloes. Lieberman does a fine job of tracing how the public's regard for the piano changed overtime. He also brings to life the internal contradiction within the company. On the one hand they wanted recognition as the makers of the finest concert grands, on the other hand the money was in selling to the mass market which wanted cheap pianos for home entertainment. This is a great read, even if the only instrument you play is a tape deck."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully vivid story of pianos and people","review":"I was pleased to read Lieberman's book on the Steinways and their pianos. This social history of pianos, piano-making, and piano-promoting makes its characters come alive. And just when you were wondering what the context is - what was happening in New York City, in the United States, or in Germany at the Germany at the time - Lieberman is there to tell you. While it's clear that this was a monumental research effort, it doesn't read like one. This is a great book of social history written by a historian who obviously relishes telling a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe Rocket Gloves need Help","review":"I have the same pair gloves.

They need to be about 1/4 inch longer to be useful. They must have been designed for a bike with a really thin frame. They also don't include a bolt to mount to the brake support. A new set of nuts and bolts aren't expensive to purchase, its just annoying that I have to make an extra trip to the hardware store to get what should have come standard in the pack. The only piece that is of any use is the bracket that attaches the bike rack to the brake post...which should come standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robt E","review":"Mounting Hardware has a nice finnish .

After a great deal of unpleasant time under the car, I tried to get a professional to install it. One dealer wanted $185.00, the other wouldn't touch it. A friend in a body shop installed it for $30.00 and did a beautiful job. He had to ream two holes to make it fit and said that no one could do it without an air wrench.

This book documents the efforts of a team of scientists from around the world to remove the mammoth from the permafrost. Information about the behavior, migration, and extinction of mammoths is included. Photographs from the expedition, diagrams, and maps round out the text. The text also raises the question of whether or not it would be ethical to clone mammoths if it became scientifically possible. The ultimate answer is left to the student.

A lot of the tracks aren't even on these, and the order on the rest of them is all mixed up. Bad quality sound, without the energy and passion of the original -- sounds like elevator music. There are even misspellings throughout the playlists. It is not readily obvious to the buyer that it isn't what you think it is, until it arrives.The Fellowship volume won't play on one of my hard drives at all; it plays, but fuzzily, on my laptop.

It's very disappointing for Sony to put out a third-rate product like this!

Not this Sony.Further more, the remote and menu screens do not work properly. I won't go into a lengthy description, but suffice it to say, it's messed up. The only thing that works right on this thing is the DVD player, but I say even that with hesitation. On DVD menus, the Enter button does not work.

Since then, my Dora lover has received various other Dora dolls, so we have a collection that sings, dances, speaks various languages, and the ONLY one she plays with regularly is the Dress Up Adventure Dora - she's more posable, does something other than sing, and you can change her outfits. Perfect for my almost 5 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money.","review":"My daugher recieved this expensive($40) doll for Christmas. She worked the first day doing both dances after that she only does the one. The switch inside her is no longer working and I have a disappointed child. It's too loud (as most toys these days) and does not do very much to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancing with Dora","review":"This is a great toy for girls who love dora and love dancing, She comes with 2 different dresses and does the Marange and dances like a ballerina!! Sings as she dances and actually moves around on the floor alot as if she was really dancing!! My daughter loves this doll and loves to see her dance, so much so that she sings with her in spanish and english!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story but.......","review":"The romance genre is famous for the divorced/separated wife/girlfriend who keeps a baby secret from a former husband/lover. My instinct is too consider such women selfish even if I do enjoy the story after all it is fiction. This book just confirms my belief such women really are selfish, Laurn after a week coldly (in my opinion) leaves her husband. (Ok lets put that down to the immaturity of youth). Five years later circumstances forces them back together even tho they both still love each other. So considering what Lauren did to Caleb why expect him to make the first move and declare his love- you leave the man after one week, don't tell him he has a son, get back together but its the man who must declare his undying love first and put his heart on the table so you can feel secure that he really loves you? Maybe I am getting old in my mindset but please this format is getting tiresome to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album","review":"This album is a treat for any jazz fans out there, especially if you're into Coltrane. If you can listen to Giant Steps then Stepping Around the Giant back to back, it's a nice compliment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Before ever buying the Blue October CD, I attended a concert they were playing at (the 101X 8 Ball on August 8, 2003) and fell insanely in love with their music, especially the beautiful blue violin that Ryan Delahoussaye played (being a violinist myself). I instantly got their autographs and chatted up Jeremy Furstenfeld (the drummer) after they performed, ever since then I've had their CD in my CD player of stereo as often as I can have it in there. I absolutely adore the band as musicians but also as people. Even my mom finds their music amazing - she was brought to tears by the lyrics of Inner Glow - that shows something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"I LOVE this CD! I wasn't expecting to like it as much or more than their Foiled CD. I love this band, and their music really hits home for me. I am so glad that I made the purchase and will probably wear this CD out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like Paul Simon","review":"Ok this is album is really great, if anyone gives it less than 5 stars then don't even bother reading their opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band and album sucks from lack of musical talent!!!","review":"The music here is child's play and laughable. The guitars, bass, and drums are all mediocore. Any teenager just learning to play guitar could master their chords their first class. Their lyrics are not \\"deep\\" either. All alternative rock bands' lyrics revolve around the same topics. There is not an ounce of talent found anywhere on the album. If you want bands that have talent playing guitar and writing lyrics listen to Guns N' Roses and Old Metallica(nothing after Justice For All). So if you want talentless music go ahead and waste you money on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt songs, that most can identify with","review":"I have been a Blue October fan for the last couple years. My first album was Foiled. Prior to Foiled, I had not heard them. I liked Foiled so much that it was hard to imagine a better album but had to buy their previous releases. History for Sale is a lot less commercial than Foiled. It's songs are deep, depressing, insightful, and relatable. The album is likable upon first listen. The strength of the lyrics and music make this a album IMO a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far...THE BEST","review":"This is by far THE BEST Blue Oct CD ever. I am totally in love with every single track, never skipping a one. It is an even flow of music that I pop in while driving as it takes me away."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS BAND!!","review":"I've seen them perform at a local venue in Houston & let me tell ya, they are FANTASTIC! Their music is soulful and very original. There isn't one song that I don't like on this CD! Justin Furstenfeld (lead vocals) is a brilliant writer & VERY talented singer! I first heard about them from some friends of mine that live in San Marcos, TX (Where they got started) & I've been in love with them ever since! BUY THIS CD you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its about time....","review":"There is definetly something for everyone on here. The song \\"Razorblade\\" filled with rage about his uncle, suddenly and unpredictably switches to a softer, love ballad \\"Calling You.\\" When you put this cd in, i promise, the songs do not fade towards the end of the cd eitheir. Every song just gets better then the next. The song \\"Amazing\\" definetly fits its title, and \\"Come In Closer\\" is just an absolutely beautiful, original song with haunting lyrics. I think the song on here though that will for sure win your attention will have to be \\"Inner Glow\\" which the lyrics talk about the radio and how much artists have lost their \\"inner glow.\\" Anyone who just wants an original band, who doesnt sound commericial and like everyone else out there, this is the band for you. The tracks just get better each time you listen to them, which is a rare thing these days. Definetly reccommed to any smart person with good taste in music....pick up this cd today."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the best image quality, stick with the previous releases","review":"Warner Bros really blew it with these new Special Edition releases of the Chaplin films. Instead of transferring them to DVD from the original film sources, they merely converted some PAL versions to NTSC. So, while the new Warner's DVDs have better sound than the previous versions released by Image Entertainment, they are also slightly sped up due to the PAL to NTSC conversion. But, worst of all, as The Laser Examiner website noted, \\"The picture quality during normal playback is noticeably softer and less defined in texture as well as detail, and the overlaps make the motion fuzzy as well.\\" So, if you're a visual purist, you're probably better off grabbing the original Image Entertainment DVD releases of the Chaplin films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful film","review":"Some films leave me with a sense of wonder and amazement, and this was one of those films. Very beautiful, elegant, worldly, and emotional."},{"rating":"2","title":"as close to a masterpiece as he came in those last years","review":"probably the best of chaplins later movies (ive never seen \\"countess from hong kong\\" but ive never known of anyone who likes it) this movie tells the tale of who charlie might have become had he NOT become charlot: a washed-up has been trying to refind his glory through mentoring a beautiful young dancer, played rather stiffly by claire bloom. the film is touching, that schmaltzy musical score tuga st the heart, buster keaton offers a brilliant cameo, and the music hall routines are a riot. we still miss the little tramp, but this is a fine film in its own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaplin Should Have Remained Silent","review":"I couldn't disagree with the Lewiston, Idaho, reviewer more when it comes to Charles Chaplin's \\"Limelight.\\" Chaplin's \\"philosophy of life\\" is enough to make you cringe. It's a shame, really, because it could have been a truly great film. Chaplin was better off keeping his mouth shut and relying on his pantomimic brilliance, which dominate \\"Limelight's\\" best moments. The Chaplin-Keaton performance remains the film's highlight. A silent Chaplin far outweighs the talky, pretentious bore that he had become in his final films."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring Movie Chaplin Ever Made","review":"Hello,I am a person who really loves Chaplin, and own copies of almost every movie available from his Sennet days to \\"A King In New York\\". I usually play them from the earliest to the latest about once every year or two. My heart sinks as I approach \\"Limelight\\". I find it to be a trial to sit through. It seems to drone on and on, and be filled with bathos.If I hear Claire Bloom say \\"Calvero\\" over again, and whine on and on about life, I will probably scream. Actually the best part of the movie by far is when Chaplin slaps her. This is what we wanted to do for the first 6 or 7 hours the movie appears to last. The only other highlight is of course Chaplin's encounters with Buster Keaton, although why we hear no one laughing during their music routine, I don't know. It really ruins it. I would say this movie is a sad comment on a star in decline, but \\"A King in New York\\" has a lot of funny pleasurable moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaplin revised","review":"A pretentious, dull and tedious movie about a vaudeville clown saving a ballerina from suicide. Calvero(Chaplin) goes on and on with self indulgent monoloughes and performs on-stage comedy for two year olds.He even took the opportunity to reduce the great Buster Keaton to a studio intern. Heartbreaking to witness.I regret I saw it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassingly painful to watch","review":"Chaplin was at his worst here. He styled himself a philosopher in this movie and spends way too much time spouting his half-baked thoughts about everything you can imagine. Chaplin may have thought of himself as a wise old sage but his self-written dialogue makes him sound more like an ignorant old fogey who doesn't know when to shut up. He passes off the tritest of observations as ageless wisdom and the audience wonders if it is a joke. Horrible movie but Keaton is a joy to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Reference","review":"I bought \\"Pacific NW GPS\\" Companion because it was cheaper and covered a wider area...big mistake on my part! This book, although only Washington-specific in scope, is so much more extensive and complete. It lists not only towns and landmarks, as \\"PNW GPS C\\" does, but also campgrounds, summits, lakes, airports, major highway intersections, and much, much more. \\"PNW GPS C\\" may suffice for the casual GPS user driving from town to town, but the serious user will want the \\"GPS Waypoints\\" volumes instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection","review":"A few of these fell kind of flat for me, but overall I found this to be a great collection. Oddly, my favorite of the bunch was Lark Till Dawn, Princess - the one about the drag queen. I say \\"oddly\\" because it was probably the least creepy out of a group of stories that generally seemed to be going for hella creepy. Instead it was campy, hilarious, and sweetly poignant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for young and old","review":"My first grader loves this! We have to read it every night before bed.

The author puts his own opinion on the events rather that just purely stating what happened, and it is poorly written in my opinion.

In reading his personal story, with historical facts added, one can now fully understand why Montenegro wants to be seperated from the union of Serbia and Montenegro. Montenegro succesfull in withstanding the Ottoman empire under its heroic leaders of which King Nikola was the best known (58 year reign) deserves to become independant again. Especially after the long period of communism that has plundered and terrorized the brave inhabitants of the country for so long.

Thank you Ken."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRETTY GOOD STORY -- VERY BAD EDITING","review":"Since I live in the area in which the book takes place, I kind of enjoyed the story. Whoever edits for the publisher did a TERRIBLE job!

Kenneth R. Lewis has captured the atmosphere of the Oregon coast and its small towns brilliantly in this debut novel. And having worked as a citizen volunteer for a couple law enforcement agencies, I can say his characterizations are dead on as well. In almost every aspect of life you have the good guys and bad guys duking it out (sometimes physically) for power and I cheered to myself when good won out over evil in \\"Little Blue Whales.\\" The story is chock-full of action, suspense, romance and, yes, wide-eyed terror. I read all 450+ pages in two sittings and literally could not put it down once I picked it up the second time. I finished it around 1:00 in the morning and it was well worth losing sleep over. I urge you to NOT miss this book! I can't wait for a sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are never out of style","review":"Even at 80-90 years old, they are timeless classics that never lose their luster. I remember watching these when I was a kid, and I still love them and not just as a walk down memory lane. They are great family views because everyone of all ages can enjoy them. It's sort of like Loony Tunes that way. That while it may have been written with kids in mind as the main audience, adults can certainly enjoy them too. It is a bit slapsticky at times, but the kids \\"one-liners\\" will never fail to put a smile on your face. I just wonder what they would have had to say if you told them at the time that people would still be watching them nearly a century later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that funny","review":"I wanted to rent The Little Rascals movie (1994). This is an older tv show of the same name. It's cute, somewhat funny. I watched it with my 5 year old and she found it confusing. I wasn't a fan of the violence, I doubt much of it would make it onto a kids show nowadays (a guy being pulled over a bed of nails, being electric shocked....) I know it's all in good fun, but I still find it inappropriate for little ones and not very funny either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cerama Bryte cleaning pads ????","review":"The shipping was more expensive than the pads.

I read the instructions three times to make sure it would not scratch. My cooktop was two weeks old and I was just trying to get some small spots off to return it to pristine condition. I applied the ceramabryte to the pad and used a little elbow grease because the spots were stubborn. Finally the spots were removed but in place were grayed areas on my black cooktop where I had applied pressure to remove the spots. When the light hits them it looks like smears or water marks. In hind sight, the razor would have worked better but I was afraid it would scratch and the directions said to use razor on large burned areas. These were just specks. This is an expensive lesson since a new cooktop is ~$200."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yert another unnecessary item - don't buy them","review":"I used the scrubber once and it felt like it would scratch if I rubbed hard.

I can't find a single original observation to point to, and many of the observations about \\"Chinese etiquette\\" are really just observations about etiquette in general - such as the universal practice of starting a conversation with small talk.One particularly annoying part of this book is the author's practice of compling long lists of Chinese vocabularly, phrases, place names, and historical references, and then failing to provide the character or \\"tone\\" marks. As anyone with an even cursory knowledge of China knows, Chinese is a tonal language and, hence, without tone marks a vocabulary item is completely useless to a foreigner.

The nature of its problems seem to be design flaws, so I doubt there is any chance of scoring a \`good one.'1. The rubber gasket upon which the air compression depends seems to be too small, and so gives no seal, so that the stroke goes down about 75% before air begins to be pushed.2. Though it is incidental in view of the catastrophic failure already described, the top cap is not attached, and detaches, i.e., the pump falls apart, on every upstroke.Inasmuch as this pump is incapable of accomplishing it's one and only function, it is worthless. I am appalled that this tyre pump ever made it into production. I always research these reviews before taking a shot in the dark, but did not read anything negative. I had to pay the initial $5 P+P, then $13.50 return postage-well over half the value-to find out that I cannot buy a pump through the post."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practical - head is too large - too much plastic.","review":"The end of the hose (the part that attaches to your tire valve, etc) is too large. I can't use it on my kids' bikes because it won't fit between the spokes on their tires, and I can't use it on my car because it won't fit in the nook on my wheels. It is even difficult to use to inflate balls with an inflation needle. It is difficult to get the needle attached to the hose-end because the diameter of the cavity, into which the needle goes, it slightly too small. With force, you can get it in, but good luck trying to get it back out.Part of the reason for all these prolems is that too much plastic is used in the hose-end. If they only used steel, it could have been made much smaller - and therefore much more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Equipment You Can't Rely On","review":"This is a great looking pump. Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well. After just a few uses, the connector head no longer works with presta valves. It will not even inflate to 20 psi. The warranty is worthless. I tried to find a replacement head but it has to be ordered and is too expensive.Don't make the mistake of buying this pump.

I messed around with it for a while trying to insert it right and finally gave up and returned it. I ended up buying a Specialized pump with a dual valve head and it works better.The actual build quality of the pump is better than some because the floor plate is metal and the pump doesn't flex when you pump high pressure, but beware of the presta head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good pump but small gauge increments of 4 PSI is unwelcome","review":"It's a solid pump with an easy to use valve head. What I have found frustrating is the gauge.The numerical increments are every 20 PSI: 0 / 20/ 40 / 60 / 80 et cetera. That would be fine but the marked increments between numerals is 4 PSI. For example, after \\"20\\" the tiny hash marks indicate 24, 28, 32, and 36. With the gauge near the bottom of the pump it is nearly impossible to discern the hash marks while pumping.This pump is fine for inflating my bicycle tire to 80 PSI but near impossible to use with my motorcycle tire at 33 PSI. If you have have better than 20/20 vision and use a base-4 numerical system, this is the ideal pump for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap materials","review":"as has been noted many times before, this pump has several problems.- the head is large and hard to get a good seal; it may take several tries to before being able to pump- the hose is made of a cheap plastic - it will start cracking right away wherever it bends (near the outlet and where it's stored over the handle), and quickly blows out.don't pay their support company todson half the cost of the pump to get a new hose; get 3/16\\" fuel line from your local auto parts store. only costs about two bucks, fits perfectly, and will last a lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life","review":"This pump worked great for a while, then it began to get worse.

The strongest and most unique part of the pump is the Schraeder/Presta valve head. When put on the valve stem of your tire, the head attaches snuggly to both the Schraeder and Presta style valves. An aluminium lever latches the valve head of the pump tightly to the stem and valve - uniquely tight.The pump has a strong construction with a steel base and a padded pump handle. Air gauge is accurate and beefy.Overall, the pump provides a better than average tire filling experience.

The walls don't stand up. As soon as you let go the whole thing topples over. Very frustrating for my preschooler.

Very mint smell when you sray it on so do not use it before a party, but it seems to work for a long time. A neighbor said two sprays about a week apart work wonders. Correct. Saturation is not needed. Light spray, move on, done fast. My sucess with tulips is the best recommend I can give. It also works on azaleas, another form of deer candy.

This is an independent film so the production quality is not glitzy Hollywood. The actors are not seasoned but their performances are credible and show honesty. The music is very good, much better than most main stream films. The confrontation, beating and later death of the title character and the following epiphany of the involved characters is very well done. This film doesn't do all the work for you, that is, you need to become reflective to get the entire impact of the film. The messages in this film are complex and presented well.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young children","review":"Let me start by saying that the music is indeed beautiful. The acting however is not. The story is nothing new, very familiar territory, similar to Beauty and the Beast. The biggest problem I have with this for young children (and I have other smaller problems) is the scene at the end where the mob beats Ribaldi to death. It is very violent, the music is very intense, and entirely too much for anyone under 7. I don't think talking about it afterwards lessens the impact of that hateful and violent of a crime playing out in front of their eyes. I was very surprised at all the reviews that mention little children watching this. If I was rating the music alone I would likely give it a 4, the movie however is poorly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rigoletto","review":"This family film throws a musical flar with fantasy filled with mystery and love!

Sharp and solid construction.After a couple of weeks of use they all started showing signs of rust. Called the manufacturer and they said it must be my water and the fact that I washed them in the dishwasher. They said, to stop the knifes from rusting I should wash the set by hand only. Even though the product is marked as dishwasher safe, but not with my water supposedly. Then I informed them that one knife, that was never placed in the dishwasher and only washed by hand, wash also rusting. They said it must be the water. I told them I wanted my money refunded or to send me a set that would not rust. They insisted that I return them to the seller. They would not honor the warranty.Funny thing is I bought Chicago Cutlery because I have a set that I have used for 20 years. 10 of those years with the previously mentioned water and dishwasher.

With that being said, you can't compare them to the high end knives like Mac or Henkel. Fit and finish is okay, they do have some cosmetic faults but don't effect perfomance. They come razor sharp right out of the box. If there is a flaw it is with the knife storage block. This is an 18 piece set meaning it comes with 16 knives and a scissor. The block however has a slot for a honing steel but only if you leave one of the knives out. I am not sure why they did that but it seems like a waste. The sharpener works good, and overall this is a nice set. Handles are comfortable, even for me with large hands, and don't grow significantly smaller as the knives get smaller as you find in other lower quality brands. I would highly recommend this set to someone who is looking for a really good starter knife set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but very loose in the block","review":"The knives work great! Very sharp and if you take care of them, not leaving them in water, cleaning them right away, you wont have to worry about them rusting like some reviews said.

As I took out the first knife and admired the handle and weight, I noticed the ungodly amount of chips in the one blade. It went down hill from there. There was literally a chip in every blade, including the serrated steak knives. After all of my anticipation and love for the brand, I felt betrayed.

My knives are sharp and handling them as recommended (handwashing and drying before returning to the block) has worked fine. I see no signs of any blade damage as some report. Likewise, my knives do not have any rough spots on the handles as some claim. These knives feel good in my hands and have done a very good job of cutting everything I have used them for. I really like the built-in sharpener as I like having knives I can easily sharpen when I think they need it and it doesn't get any easier than this setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality knives","review":"My wife and I purchased these knives as a house warming gift to ourselves on the recommendation of a professional chef, and also based on the fact that I also own a set of the Walnut Traditions that I love. We wanted an upgrade to the WT set. That was a big mistake. We do not have a dishwasher, and wash and dry by hand immediately after use. We have experienced the rusting that many other reviewers mention. The worst part is that it is practically impossible to get these knives sharp and get them to hold an edge. Chicago Cutlery's warranty is not near what it once was. In the past, when the tip broke off one of my WT's, I took it back to an ACE Hardware where they promptly handed me a new one! Anyway, we will be donating these and investing in a select few quality knives (Global or equal). I'd rather have fewer knives of higher quality. My advice is to learn what knives you use most, and invest in high quality versatile tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighted!","review":"Twenty-six years ago my husband and I received a set of Chicago Cutlery knives as a wedding gift. They were not as high-quality as these knives, but they served us well until the wooden handles started to deteriorate (this was largely due to our family neglecting to take care of them properly). We have just remodeled our kitchen and decided to update its contents as well so we purchased this beautiful new set of knives. They are sturdy, easy to use, and elegantly designed. I am especially pleased with the variety included in the set and the in-block knife sharpener.

I had high hopes for this set, but immediately after opening for the first time, I was extremely disappointed. The craftsmanship is simply terrible. The blades had marks and gauges in them, the handles were all scratched up, and several of the blades themselves were clearly not straight. Even the block was poorly constructed. Honestly, my current $35 set is better made, and find it unacceptable for a set that costs over $100. Perhaps I received a set that was returned by another customer and re-sold. Either way, I'm sending it back and am purchasing something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wedding Gift","review":"I reviewed a ton of knife block sets and found these to be the best bang for the buck.

The first time I used them was on a tomato and it went through with no effort at all unlike my old knives. I have used them multiple times since and it goes through things like a hot knife through butter. The in-block sharpener is great. When you first get the knives you have to run all of them through the sharpener 4-5 times to get a nice edge to them. Best knives I've ever used! Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Value","review":"These are FORGED knives at the price of a stamped blade set. Aside from the bread knife, they are NOT serrated, which means you can resharpen them, including the steak knives. Unless you plan on tossing out knives when they get dull, avoid serrated knives. Yes, there are some small nicks and other irregularities, but the overall quality is as good as a $600 block set. THIS IS THE BEST VALUE OUT THERE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive for a bad quality product","review":"I bought this cutlery because I had a similar chef knive. However, with 3 months of use, it started to rust. When I called their warranty, they said that it must be something wrong with water in our house. The blade is too thin, and the edges started to break. I wouldnt buy this. I think in probably six months I will buy a better knive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good cutlery","review":"I used to work at a packing house so my knives have to be good and sharp.

After trying them for a few weeks now I have found they have good balance and craftmanship and hold an edege very well right out of the box, three or four strokes through the sharpener built right into the block and they are as good as new. I will recommend these to friends or family.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift","review":"A gift to daughter, said she was satisfied with these knives. Uses these knives every day.

I couldn't afford to pay a thousand dollars for a set but wanted something really nice. I bought this set based on some of the other reviews and was really pleasantly surprised when it arrived. I will consider this set if I ever have to replace the set I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knives, especially when on sale!","review":"We purchased these as our first set of knives and have owned them for about 6 months. In reading some other reviews, people are complaining about rusty knives - well, it says to HAND WASH them - and if you are literate and follow directions, you will have no problem with this set. The biggest selling point for me was that the 8 steak knives come with and store in the block.We use these on a daily basis, and make a point of handwashing them immediately after use. After 6 months, no rust or weird spots. They are sharp, look nice, the block is solid and well crafted, and I would definitely recommend these to people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stars for the Commentary Alone!","review":"Although it has been noted by other reviewers, I just wanted to note how unusual the commentary track is on this disc. For the first 10 minutes, you get a pretty standard HGL play by play. Then, he leaves and the founder of Something Weird Video sits around with David Freidman and a few other (hard to hear) people and discusses the history of the company. They finish their story early, however, so for the last half hour or so, it is all filler! You would think this would be terrible, but in truth it is pretty entertaining. The SW guy actually makes a point to say that the commentaries are usually much more professional than this--right before he gets a phone call from his wife! As far as the movie goes, no nudity, not much violence to speak of, and only really notable for a scene where a man is attacked by his bedsheets. That's pretty brilliant, but the rest is dull. Think of the exposition scenes in Blood Feast, if you need an example..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ed Wood - Move over!","review":"I gave this turkey 2 stars because it made it after 36 years todvd. Being one of the bit actors-stuntmen in this film (I'm the bad actor blonde thug in the bar scene with those awful lines.),I would put it on a level just above \\"Plan 9 From Outerspace\\".The acting,and cutting left a lot to be desired.I did, however, find one thing that might add some redeemingvalue to \\"Something Weird\\".

It is all bad in every respect - it even fails to be amusing in its badness. If by some bizarre magic, one were actually able to consider BLOOD FEAST to be the pinnacle of movie-making, SOMETHING WEIRD would fall at the very bottom. The basic plot concept has some promise, but the acting throughout sounds as if the actors were reading their lines for the first time after a night of no sleep. In fact, the best thing about this DVD is the cover. Unfortunately, actress Elizabeth Lee never looks so pretty at any point in the film, not even in the scene from which the cover is taken. This is mainly the result of horrible, garish makeup, especially around the eyes. The potential viewer should pull a copy of the cover off the internet and avoid a waste of money and time. (I gave this one star only because one cannot award less than that.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"vibration came soon","review":"i have not even got 3000 miles on these and have vibration in the pedal already.would not buy again,not pleased at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Yarn but BUYER BEWARE on shipping!","review":"So I decided to try and order 14 skeins of yarn of 'Red Heart Soft Yarn'. 7 in one color, and 7 in another color. My main reason for possibly getting it thru Amazon is because the going price at the time was about a $1 cheaper per skein then anywhere else.... and that includes Hobby Lobby and Joann Fabrics. Problem is after putting around $35 worth of yarn in my cart, it totaled to around $105! That's $69 dollars to ship YARN. And the seller it was coming from was SuperMart.Now, if I order this direct from Joann Fabrics online..... the same yarn, and same amounts, cost only $7.95 to ship to me for standard shipping. And the grand total is only $56.81 even with paying more per skein. Regular prices. No sales. Moral of the story is...... Don't be fooled by lower skein price. I'm going to take the time and go to Joann's to get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quicker than the internet. Puts the pleasure back into browsing","review":"This atlas is fantastic.

Instead I read an ugly book of ugly characters. While the writing is masterful in creating the twin emotions of depression and despair within the reader, there is no rational reason why any reader would choose to feel this way. I left \\"Kissing in Manhattan\\" wondering where the stories promised by the book jacket had gone. Maybe Patrick tied them up and refused to let them come out and play."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice surprise...","review":"David Schickler is awesome! What a way to pull all the characters together! A must read!!! The plot never lost its edge and I had trouble putting this book down. Not only a fun book but also a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Pose, Little Substance","review":"Okay, here's the latest thing that not-very-smart people can feel smart about liking. It's provocative (in a simplistic way), surrealistic, and utterly without emotional heft. But it has the patina of knowingness and sophistication, so people can feel safe championing it at cocktail parties. But, alas, it's empty; it confuses non-sequitur with originality, provocativeness with true meaning, elusiveness with complexity. But don't buy the hype. Here's a writer who obviously has talent, but who must learn to be honest--to forget the posing--if he's ever to produce anything really worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I managed to read this book front to back, and I did manage to come out alive, but... I wouldn't want to go back. The characters were just a bunch of people possessing only quirky traits but lacking any real personality. for all the reveiwers who said this seemed like a typical male fantasy, well I wouldn't necessarily call it typical, but it mostly dealt with men possessing women and women in turn throwing themselves at the men, and as a guy-crazy female myself, I found absolutely NOTHING appealing about any of these psychopaths. All of them made me feel uncomfortable in one way or another, and I'd probably get restraining orders on them. I could not for the life of me figure out why these women were so smitten with these awful men. It reminded me of a tamer, urban version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre... just a bunch of unbelievable characters doing weird freaky things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoyingly bad","review":"I made it through four of the shorts, but I must confess that I was enjoying getting annoyed by it. There is nothing here: no plots, no character development, no insight, no intrigue. I felt like I was wandering around in somebody's desperate fantasy. Desperate? Yes, there is desperation in every nook and cranny of the 4 stories I read - desperation to make empty characters quirky, desperation to conclude stories that have no premise, and desperation to contrive motion in stories that have no reason to move. I've rarely felt this way, but I feel like throwing the book down the garbage shoot as opposed to passing it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not MY New York","review":"Not everybody in New York is a Jewish neurotic. But David Schickler sure makes it seems like they are. Listen: When I first moved here from Nebraska that was one of the things I was afraid of, that I'd run into all these ethnic types. (Don't want to sound like a John Rocker about it, but I was just a kid and the biggest place I'd ever seen was Lincoln.) Maybe it's more colorful to pretend everybody's Jewish and that New York is filled with differently colored people like some kind of sock drawer. Not true. My New York is homogeneous, the way I like it. Schickler's is dangerous, challenging, a little weird, and not at all my cup of tea. If you're like me, stay the heck away."},{"rating":"2","title":"New York here I come!","review":"This collection of linked short stories left me wanting more! They range from the touching to the bizarre but all were linked by the setting: New York City and a specific apartment building where all the characters live or find themselves.I picked this book up on a whim due to my recent trip to New York City only to discover that I'm ready to make the trip again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Usually Hate Short Stories","review":"I usually don't care for short stories. But Kissing In Manhattan is an absolutely magnificent read. It's probably because the stories intertwine and previously introduced characters show up later making it feel more like a traditional novel. I would agree with some of the reviewers who report feeling a bit depressed after reading Kissing In Manhattan, but I would counter with the question, \\"why?\\" I think the mark of a good book is the ability to make the reader feel and think - and this book does that. As for being misogynous, well, I think a lot of people would be surprised at how many women feel about themselves and what they are willing to endure, for whatever reason. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put the book down.","review":"I found this book to be very interesting. David Schickler has a expressive way of writing. You can picture all the scenes vividly in your mind. I can't wait until he comes out with his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Distinct Voice, A Charming Book","review":"Okay, first off, try to get by the title. It sounds like a cheap romance novel, or the most sacchrine piece of writing you'll ever hope to come across. It's not.Whew, now that we got that out of the way, this book of linked stories is most distinctive for Mr. Shickler's unique voice. He writes in crisp, clear, simple sentences. At the same time, with a few simple words, he can capture a mood or the essence of a character so perfectly it can at times take your breath away.This book isn't a staggering piece of fiction. It's also not exactly a short story collection (he gives up on the finesse of interlinking stories by the last half of the book; it becomes more of a novel, albeit a good one). Mr. Shickler also hasn't written a cheesy piece of romance fiction; he's written a book that is both charming and darkly humourous in equal measure.An exciting debut for a young writer, and a great read for anyone who has ever lived in, or thought about living in New York."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, this book kind of sucks","review":"The \\"Smokers\\" story is a classic. No doubt. The others are all filler with lame attempts at connections. The elevator? Who the hell cares?I'm glad Schickler was able to weasel a big book deal out of one story, but, like Kajagoogoo, I think he's a one-hit wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexist and boring","review":"This book got great reviews, which is why I bought it, but I think that the critics got a different book from the one I read. This one is filled with weak female characters who swoon over dominating males that treat them bad and make their self-esteem drop. On top of that, the characters are shallow, the plots far-fetched and uninteresting, and the essence of New York that the author tries so hard to capture is not even remotely pictured here. Do not waste you time, read another book on New York, because there are many good ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype...","review":"This book is misogynistic and banal. If you need to affirm your relationship with New York, then visit or rent a movie by Woody Allen or, if you must, read 'Bright Lights, Big City' which has altogether more heart and density than this over-hyped, lightweight, 'East-Village cool' series of short stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Unbelievably boring. Luckily I borrowed it from the library and didn't spend a penny on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"From the first time I read \\"The Smoker,\\" an excerpt from this fantastic little novel, I was hooked! The characters, stories, and plots really resonate with the way I perceive the world and who I am: an eccentric. Planning on writing a screenplay inspired by this little gem. I would say, if you just read a couple of pages and you don't like the stories, then the book is not for you. If, however, you are curious and are hooked from the way in which David Schickler's writing delivers such a direct and no-bulls***, straight-to-the-point narratives and dialogues in his stories, then congratulations: you have found yourself a gem!If you like films like ROGER DODGER, SPREAD, AMERICAN PSYCHO, THANK YOU FOR SMOKING, CLOSER, then you will most likely enjoy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too contrived with unlikable characters","review":"The concept and part of the execution of this book are interesting, but many of the characters are just too unbelievable to really have resonance. I felt that many of the characters and situations seemed contrived to be shocking and gripping, but the effort to create them rather than tell their stories, seemed too evident. Some stories were interesting, but a few were downright annoying.I give it 2 stars, but feel 2 1/2 is more appropriate, considering I think Schickler uses some good language. He just needs to send his characters through a plausibility checker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This Mexican popgroup performs very well on stage and on their albums.

Excuse me while I go vomit."},{"rating":"1","title":"we want Infomation","review":"It would be nice if somebody could tell us what songs are on this thing. Also, what the performances are like. You lucky american kids getting this on DVD way before us in Britain."},{"rating":"2","title":"a DVD as artful as Radiohead's music","review":"It took several viewings of this DVD for me to truly appreciate its brilliance. At first I was annoyed that entire songs and interviews weren't included, but soon I realized the reason for this. The video attempts to document what it's like to be in a band like radiohead. It gives the viewer a real insiders view, where there are more important things to be documented than just the music. Because if you just want the music, then listen to the CD's. There is so much detail in this DVD that everytime I watch it I find new things I'd never noticed before - just like the band's music. This video is truly the visual equivalent of their music: very artful and at times ambiguous and contradictory. A warning though, this DVD is very intense and if you're looking for a glossy vid of concert footage, this is not for you. This DVD is for the true Radiohead fan that wants more than just the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snazzy, but empty.","review":"The documentary LOOKS cool, and it creates a mood that goes very well with radiohead's music. But 90 minutes of that is way too long. After it's all over, you realize that the film has failed to deliver a single coherent bit of information about the band. You don't really get a good insider's view -- and you certainly don't get to know any of the band members, see much of the creative process of songwriting, or hear the members' true thoughts about their work. It's a disappointment, and a missed chance on the part of Gee. So buy this video if you need it to complete your collection, but don't expect to learn anything from it, either about the band or about music-making in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"LETDOWN","review":"The idea behind Grant Gee's film, \\"Meeting People is Easy\\" may have been brilliant but this long awaited and much anticipated documentary failed to hit it's mark. The concept of how boring life on the \\"OK Computer tour was just turned ot to be a boring video about Radiohead. Despite some flashes of great camera work and some brief sounds of unreleased music, this documentary is a big disappointment to any Radiohead fan. I would leave this one out of the \\"Shopping Cart\\" and save those hard earned pennies for the new album. Please write me for a more detailed review,Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling, pseudo-arty rubbish!","review":"'Meeting People is Easy' is perhaps the most shallow, prententious, pseudo-arty films ever made. Whereas the album 'OK Computer' brilliantly dealt with themes that could easily be related to (such as fear of technology, political frustration, etc), this documentary consistently misfires. The live footage only seems to consist of Thom whining at the top of his voice and the interviews are treated so seriously by the band, the whole endeavour reaches states of self-parody. The attempt to show the difficulty in touring for rock bands fails completely, and the band members, especially the pathetic Yorke, come across as hopeless and ungrateful for the position they are in. Seeing this film has caused me to dread their next release, as it will only mean seeing them become more and more conceited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"It is unfortunate that Grant Gee refuses to let the music and words come through in this film. The few short moments of actual playing reveal a band that plays beautifully together. The oh-so-few words that are intelligible reveal intelligent men with something to say. Gee is bent on impressing us with his hipness rather than letting the musicians' vision carry the day. If you are lucky enough to work with subjects as interesting as Radiohead, just cut it straight, give us some good clean sound and get the f*@#k out of the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Radiohead doesn't suck.. but they sure do on this DVD","review":"I love Radiohead. I love documentaries and live shows about artists.This sucked, sucked, sucked.

Ick!!!!! They deserve better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making terrible documentaries is easy","review":"Let's make a list:1. The video is achingly jittery, about as saturated as a mental ward, and just a terrible montage of meaningless things.2. The audio is absolutely worthless. Most of the time there is such an obnoxious room echo that words become completely lost in the noise, and anyone interested in what band members say will be quite pissed to say the least.3. Because of the previous two things, there is no sense to the documentary. It is simply a jumble, and it's as if Grant wants to make the viewer just as sickly and depressed as Thom himself.My verdict? Radiohead is awesome; MPIE isn't good enough to act as a paperweight. If you aren't a rabid fan, don't bother even renting this. If you ARE a rabid fan, you will most likely be even less impressed with this video than I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sick of these s**t releases on DVD","review":"I JUST WANT A LIVE DVD !!!!Radiohead is fantastic, extraordinary, different, dark, intense, addictive, magic, confusing, avant garde, experimental, etc. Nothing of that is reflected with these stupid DVD's they have released. This king of DVD just contain lame boring stuff for filling the running Time and to be put on sale.I do not understand why they do not make an awesome live DVD instead of this kind of s**t. Radiohead is brilliant, but sometimes they are too obstinate and they do not understand - or they do not want to understand - that fans we are not interested in these useless DVD's for TV filled with interviews and all that bulls**t.Live Gigs always have been the best thing of Radiohead. There're dozens of complete live performances shared as Pro-Shot DVD bootlegs out there !!!!, but I want an official release !!!.PLEASE RADIOHEAD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously nothing special...","review":"I have been a Radiohead fan for about 2 and a half years now and I finally bought my first Radiohead DVD. I was expecting some weird, trippy stuff with some really good live and studio footage.The DVD is trippy alright, almost as scary as the Ring. But the live performances don't seem to sparkle or shine, and the band looks bored most of the time. I've tried to watch this DVD three different times now, and I've had to get up and stop the movie in the middle every time, because I just got bored with it. I even tried watching the second half. I just couldn't. It was too long and tiring.I would not recommend this DVD unless you can get it used for a really cheap price like I did. It's pointless, senseless, and just plain dumb.

They were able to make a lot of that little JVC mini-DV camera look a bit like film. It may come across a bit too depressing, but it shows the mad genius of Radiohead. I would have liked to have seen more live stuff of KARMA POLICE and AIRBAG. The editing (mostly just making mini-DV look like film) is inspiring to a digital filmmaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you probably expected.","review":"Before seeing this, I thought it would be a video full of interviews with the band, insight on the album, and little biographies of each member. But when I saw shots of cars on a freeway, people going up an escalator, and moments of Thom Yorke just sitting backstage from what appears to be a hidden camera, I realized that it goes perfectly with the album. It does not need any explanation by the band. The off-beatness of the video is perfect for the cd. The stimulating shots is genius with the music. It makes the music that much more emotional. It shows that the band keeps themselves in a constant reality check. They don't want you to like them because they look cool, or because they sell a lot of albums, they want you to see the message, and this is the perfect video for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with each viewing","review":"*PLEASE* ignore the vapid MTV morons that have given this bad reviews, if you are genuinely into Radiohead, and don't just blindly swallow the latest 'fashionable' band that the music media shoves down your throat, then fear not, you will get it. Its different and for me, takes repeated viewings, with each one proving more rewarding. The upshot of it all is that I feel I know the personalities of the individual Radiohead members, from the intermittent snatches of interviews and incidents, a hundred times better than could ever be possible with your garden variety VH1 'rockumentary'. For example, Thom Yorke's responses to a clueless interviewer's questions about celebs at their gigs or his half bored/half bemused expression as he holds the microphone to a crowd bellowing the lyrics of Creep are invaluable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for Radiohead fans","review":"IF YOU LOVE RADIOHEAD - BUY THIS I can't stress how much i love this DVD. It shows you a whole other side to the band and to the life of rock stars in general. Plus you get an inside look at radiohead recording in studio plus songs never released on any album (including Amnesiac) This film is also great for any film student. I can only find fault with the lack of features. There are no chapters on this dvd so you can't jump to your favorite parts, yet that hasn't stopped me from watching it hundreds of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly one of the best music documentaries of all time","review":"After viewing Meeting People is Easy several times, I would have to say that the video is magnificent. This is not your typical tour video. I feel that the problem most people(but not I) had with the video, was that most times, only snippets of songs are played. If anything, Meeting People is Easy manages to capture the chaos that success brings.Grant Gee does a great job of capturing what life is truly like on the road and how Radiohead is affected by life on the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, it's not OK, Computer!","review":"Exciting. Thought-provoking. Life-changing. Everything that Radiohead, The Most Important Band There Is Right Now (or at least until \\"Amnesiac\\") is, this DVD isn't. It's truly amazing how awful this film is, from its Z-grade film school cliches (Ooo! Fuzzy industrial monochromed images with scrolling text! How innovative) to the stultifying dull cinema verite shots of the band mumbling incoherently or posing in front of fans, cameras, and what have you. When you finally fast-forward through the desultory filler to the concert pieces, you get poorly shot, dismally recorded documents of Radiohead at their most self-indulgent.Radiohead is important enough for a director with Scorcese or Demme-level talent to document in a manner they deserve. In this piece of junk, the hack director drains the life of the band...to everyone's dismay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring.","review":"Avoid this dvd, extremely poor, unless you want to see a fly on a window, the road from the airport to the hotel. etc!

If you want to share a little time away from the crowded grounds of a concert pit, and go into thier hotel room, into their bus, then go get this tape. No this tape doesn't have much of Radiohead \\"being\\" Radiohead. I thought it would be like how they talk to each other, but it wasn't, but it was done beautifuly. I mean, did you really expect Radiohead to come out with something that made complete sense? Being a Radiohead fan doesn't garintee you liking this film, but it kind of makes you feel like you're drunk behind the sceens. I for one thought the filming techniques were interesting, and I love the version of Exit song at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just your average, run - of - the - mill rockumentry","review":"How disappointed I was when this video finally arrived. Whilst I was expecting to find an intelligent insight into the makings of Ok Computer and the subsequent touring... all I found was a typical rockumentry. When I say typical, I mean a film that speaks nothing of the band as a whole but instead is a showcase for the director's arrogance. In it's entirety, I'd estimate that in the 1 1/2 hours of screen time, there was probably about 35 minutes of the band speaking about their thoughts on life and fame... whilst the rest of the time was devoted to Grant Gee shooting scenes that bared no relevance to the band. When I read the caption: \\"A film about Radiohead\\", I was expecting to find in depth interviews with each band member... after all, Grant Gee did spend a fair amount of time with them. However, all I got was a bunch of images set to music for an hour and a half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lau Ching-Wan vs. Francis Ng","review":"The discovery of a dead body leads cop Lau Ching-Wan to believe Francis Ng is going to attempt a major theft. Director Ringo Lam is on solid, familiar ground here with this police procedural/character analysis.

Lam somehow manages to show the similarities between the cop and the thief without violating the integrity of the cop or making a hero of a crook.

Second, from the bottom, where the four legs are connected with the lower shelf.With full respect i would request the seller to improve this product.I am planning to throw it away and get a new one from IKEA."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Solid Wood as Described","review":"This product's description is misleading. It states that it's made of solid wood, but the top, shelf and drawer sides are laminated particle board, and the shelf bottom is paper cardboard! I ordered two for a guest room, based on the 3 all-wood Winsome Wood Concord tables I'd bought recently; as soon as I opened the first box and encountered the parts, back it went into the box and was returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price.","review":"Easy to assemble, looks good (for the price), very solid.

Only complaint I have is that the drawer is not tracked thus when you pull it out the whole thing drops forward.

Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Walnut\\" finish is actually \\"Cherry\\"","review":"This is the first time I have written a review for an Amazon purchase. I decided to write one this time because I don't want others to fall into the same trap. The \\"walnut\\" finish table is NOT walnut --> it's CHERRY.

First off, my drawer was very hard to assemble because the slits in the wood did not match up well. Secondly, the coating scratches very easily.I would not buy this product again, but I can't be bothered to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Very complicated to assemble especially for people like me who are challenged when it comes to this type of assembling, the instructions were also not clear. I tried and after 30 mins, it felt like I have destroyed the piece. There were mismatched coloration on some of the pieces. It's so not worth the cheap price. After an hour, I decided to fold and just not even both with getting the money back by returning, went to Pier 1 Imports and bought a $140 night stand, which saved me the headache and hassles.The picture looks really good, but unfortunately, I couldn't even put it together, but materials felt/looked cheap and flimsy, and NOt sturdy at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"I was eagerly waiting for this.

It is a defective one, not the shipping problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take heed seller, this is why I did not purchase this item","review":"I am in the market for several end tables for nursing homes. This end table fits my needs and budget perfectly. However, Customer Service is most important to me. I would rather pay more for the product to be able to contact the seller when I have a problem, especially if it is a manufactures problem. Because I did not find ONE customer that had something positive to say about the customer service, I did not purchase this item from this company. I wonder how many other sales this customer would have if they only would stand behind their product.

Minus one star for no drawer glides. I will make my own. BL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaaayyy lighter in color than shown....","review":"Ugh. I spent hours trying to find a decent looking nightstand with decent reviews that was decently priced, and finally settled on this. I was prepared for the sagging drawer (which is 100% true -- the drawer sags pretty badly), but wasn't prepared for the color it actually is! It is WAY lighter than pictured! More of a light-medium brown than a darker brown. I'm trying to transition all my furniture to be a darker brown, and these in no way fit the bill. Unfortunately, my boyfriend assembled them and threw away the boxes while I was out of town, so now we're stuck with them.... Otherwise these would have immediately gone back. As it is, I'm so unhappy with the color that as soon as we can I'd like to buy completely different nightstands and just try to sell these on eBay.Decent little stand for the price I guess, but don't plan on it being anywhere close to the color in the picture -- and know that the drawer is really really saggy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks as expected but assembly is dreadfully painful","review":"This table has the quality expected for its price, but the assembly was a tortuous event; the holes drilled for the screws were not fully done or correctly placed, moreover, the screws were those that fit the special L-shaped tool they send as a screwdriver so it was very difficult to try to get them to tighten. In the end I couldnt get the screws to go all the way in and the table feels loose and wobbly. I wouldn't recommend this table unless you want to try to test how long it takes for your fingers to bleed or have a drill with the head to use with these screws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them","review":"I bought two, got them fairly quickly and I love them, they were just what I was looking for. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for the price","review":"This night stand was the best value I could find during my internet search. Once I received the pair I had ordered and put them together, I thought that they were okay for the price. However, they are a bit shorter/smaller than I would have liked. They work for a temporary fix, but would suggest they be more for a child's room, not for an adult's. Otherwise, good material use. Some minor flaws, but over all you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serviceable Night Stand","review":"This night stand is probably best suited to someone with a platform bed. I have a mattress and box spring on a frame, and it's a bit high for the height of this nightstand. But it's a lovely nightstand, clean lines and well made, easy to assemble. I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midget Table","review":"We had a bit of a chuckle once we put this together and realized just how short it looked next to our front door.

Other than that, it went together fairly simply, and seems to be pretty solid. It's all pressed board with veneer, I suppose to be expected as about as cheap as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the color it appears","review":"After getting the pieces out and my son putting them together for us while we were out, and tossing the boxes out - I find that these tables are NOT the color they appear. I bought these to match 2 other pieces that are darker woods, and this is NOT a dark wood. Very disappointed - don't want to bother taking them apart and finding boxes for them to ship back. very disappointed with this item and this being my 2nd purchase from Amazon, I will be careful next time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"These were a great value. I got two, and they look really cute and were relatively easy to put together. My only complaint is that the top of one cracked a little bit right after I assembled it, but that could have been from the way I put it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"This table came in and my husband put it together. The finish was not good and the table was small and not made well, not sturdy, etc. We had purchased it for a gift but wouldn't give to anyone or keep it ourselves. I'm putting it in the yard sale. As my husband said, \\"it's a worthless piece of junk\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality construction despite nice design","review":"I purchased 2 of these tables recently and they both had serious defects. Scratches, rough spots, inconsistent finish between top and sides, much lighter finish on sides than top, spots where staining was skipped, some wooden parts split in drawer when fasteners are tightened, etc.I asked for replacements and they arrived with worse flaws so I combined parts to get 2 barely acceptable tables to use in dimly lit room. I returned the other two. Previous reviews were good so I think the manufacturer sent AMAZON a bad batch recently made with very poor craftsmanship.

The basics are covered in the book but it is from 1995. It suggests going to the library and travel agents for help and brouchures. It would have been nice if it mentioned the internet at all.

Overall I wouldn't recommend it only because the information can be found through any wedding site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"Spanish is my second language and I'm not all that great at it yet. But I can understand a lot of what these songs are about. This is possibly the best live recording I've ever heard; I would say these live versions are better than the originals on D��nde Est��n los Ladrones.\\"Ciega, Sordomuda\\" is hands down my favorite song on the album. It has a real Mexican sound with music by the mariachi band \\"Mora Arriaga\\". T�� is excellent and No Creo has a different arrangement with a real reggae feel to it. All of the songs are great.I think you would have to be crazy not to buy this, even if you don't speak Spanish very well. This blows away Shakira's pop music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite","review":"I actually bought this to replace one I gave away. I also have the DVD, but needed this for the car, etc! In this concert, not only is the music great, but Shakira really seems to be enjoying herself.

It takes place at that one magical turning-point that comes every year when suddenly you notice spring has crept in and claimed the earth again. Most of the action takes place after sundown of the last day of winter. During the quiet night that follows spring unfolds and we are involved in the lovely stirrings of a greening world and her wild creatures. The lyrical text entices our senses to rise and remember spring. We are treated to very, very beautiful illustrations just filled with subtle and exquisite light from sunset to sunrise, to starry full-moon skies and soft lamplit lanes in the park. This book is a jewel and it will either make you long for spring or tide you over until it returns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service","review":"The movie came quite quickly.

It made this reader wish Dr. Rawlings would spend more time on fiction and less on writing prescriptions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy Sci-Fi with a twist","review":"This movie is out there but it is a classic Sci-Fi fantasy title with an eerie setting. Best watched in the dark after the sun has set. One of its tag lines; \\"... makes The Matrix seem like child's play\\"; may be a stretch, but it is definitely worth picking up if you love Sci-Fi and have not seen it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love this 'game'","review":"'Existenz' has been done before. Totall Recall and The Game are just two recent examples where the film's protagonists are caught up in a mind-spinning set of circumstances where they begin to doubt their actions, motives and even themselves! What Existenz has going for it is comical and deadpan humour. I can remember some parts of the film where I laughed out loud and was then unsure of whether I was supposed to. Jennifer Jason Leigh and up-and-comer Jude Law are great. Obviously shot with a low buget but despite this, the production values are solid. I enjoyed 'Existenz'. You will too. Expect to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative futuristic Virtual Reality game within a game","review":"eXistenz is a uniquely architected thriller. It will keep you guessing at what you can't imagine will happen next. Keeping you, as well as some of the characters in the dark as to what is real and what is unreal. You are forced to follow the plot as it develops as you are being plunged into scenarios in which nothing makes immediate sense and always takes another scene to figure out. The acting is excellent . Jennifer Jason Leigh is a perfect personality for her character at once innocent and covertely knowing much more.Sara Polley is also perfect as an innocent who in time accepts his role in eXistenz. All very good with the proverbial twist at the end.Also there are some really yukky scenes that test your tolerance for Yuk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cronenberg: still squishy after all these years","review":"Another slice of unreality from Cronenberg that drops you into another odd existence from which you have to figure out the rules. It's got the usual Cronenberg trademarks we know and love (weird organic creations, odd surgical instruments, extreme feminist symbolism dealing with gaping holes in men's bodies into which women stick things, organic guns, etc.), a higher level of starpower than most Cronenberg flicks, and mutant Chinese food. How can you go wrong? People either love Cronenberg or they hate him. I fall completely on the love side and have ever since I first saw Scanners all those years ago. The only thing missing here? The everpresent Stephen Lack. Whither, David? Bring him back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts \\"The Matrix\\" to shame","review":"eXistenZ, make sure that you spell it that way; for David Cronenberg is one of our top artists with this 1999 release and, sad to say his most recent effort last year disappointed me royally and wound up on my worst list. Anyway for those of you that like the weird and surreal in your cinematic efforts this one is definitely for you. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law are compelling and wonderful in this sci-fi thriller which was Cronenberg's first original screenplay since 'Videodrome' in 1982. Not for the faint of heart and it's full of laughs which ease the tension and always has me guffawing every time I see it. Knock yerself out with eXistenZ.\\"Death to Realism!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than The Matrix","review":"Cronenberg made the thinking person's Matrix with this film.

Matrix doesn't come close."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like sci-fi you'll love this","review":"I recently saw this movie. I had not even heard of it but after watching it ranks in my top 5 favorite movies, EVER.

Highly recomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is on my list of all time Turkeys","review":"Oh dear! Bored after the first five minutes and I just knew it would get better..but it didn't. It just trundled on, throwing in new characters now and again, until the predictable ending. The characters acted like the were in a computer game throughout - but if this 'game' was released I think games players would leave it on the shelve. So, is this an insight into computer games of the future ? - nope! There are so many sci-fi programs and films that actaully have an INTELLIGENT insight into the future, that you shouldn't bother with dull, unimaginative and dreadful nonsense like this. I don't understand why people compare this to the Matrix - 2 very different films. Matrix has a vision of the future not unlike Terminator, eXistenZ has a blurred vision that seems to be based on the worst computer games ever written. One word - DON'T"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Videodrome instead","review":"eXistenZ is a shallower reworking of Cronenberg's earlier work and succeeds only in bringing the ideas into line with the more modern technology. Videodrome is more intelligent and far more atmospheric while James Woods' role in the lead is far more involving. I became somewhat depressed watching this film because it looked very much like Cronenberg had run out of ideas. One other thing - I've always liked the ending to Cronenberg's films, but the line 'Are we still in the game?' is really laying it on with a trowel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually that's a NEGATIVE FIVE STARS","review":"This movie is absolutely horrid. All of the imagery and sound effects are disgusting, the acting is terrible, the plot is ridiculous. I REALLY wanted to leave the theatre but I just had to see what else they would do, that's how bad it was. It was sooo cheezy!

I've been a fan of Cronenberg for many years and have liked quite a few of his films. I've also always respected Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law. This film, though, was laughable. The dialogue was awkward, the acting was empty and the story was just strange without creating anything intruiging. I cannot believe the people writing reviews comparing this to The Matrix and calling it a \\"smarter version\\". Smarter how? Not even close. and the Matrix is not even a great film in it's own right - but compared to this, it is. A better film than both of these (which both films steal from, liberally) is Alphaville. Rent the Criterion edition and you'll know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me....","review":"If you like this movie, why not just visit a slaughter house. At least there is a plot. I have to vent b/c this flick really sucked. I watched a good deal of the last hour in fastforward. This movie lacked a plot, special effects, acting, and a soundtrack.

Thank god I rented it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor collaboration and props, wooden script","review":"I know half of the people who love Cronenberg will say \\"But all of that is part of the plan!\\" but seriously, this movie was poorly done. The props looked like something made out of dental mold rubber using a budget of tens of dollars, and the plot simply plods along. Willem Defoe and other named actors spice up the film a bit, but overall, not something I would watch again, even when desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"GROANIN BERG","review":"As we are all aware, video games have progressed so far to the point that it doesn't take much imagination to conjure a world where the distinction between reality and game playing could occur. David Cronenberg, whose best film I think, is DEAD ZONE, reverts to his graphic sense of sensationalism to bring us this story about a video game unlike others before. His imagination is to be heralded, what with live pods and stranger things going on with guns that shoot teeth, etc., etc. The problem is the whole thing is so chaotic, tedious and self-serving that EXISTENZ becomes little more than a muddled bore. I wasn't impressed with Jennifer Jason Leigh or Jude Law; they appeared to be acting and not inhabiting their roles at all. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are wasted in their roles and what little special effects there are have been done before and better.I appreciate innovation and creative differences in movies, but they should be a little more cohesive and entertaining than this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit By a Car","review":"First of all, get the Canadian edition--as a previous reviewer stated, it has three separate audiocommentary tracks. It even has a documentary about the production designer, which seems to be an odd inclusion. Secondly, this is as much religious criticism as it is science fiction, and if you like both this film, although slow, is never boring. Finally, this is a film wherein the viewer sees only intriguing pieces of the puzzle rather than the whole picture. It is thought-provoking and rewards repeated viewings, and certainly worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like, too intelligent and stuff for Keanu fans dude!","review":"Existenz should not be mentioned in the same breath as the Matrix. Doing so would mean that there will be many disapointed people out there who have been violently denied their 2 hours of meaningless special effects and bad acting. David Cronenbergs films are always strangely funny, tongue in cheek and filled with more than a passing sense of irony. The fact that people have bagged this film based on it's apparent similarities to the Matrix, I'm sure, would put a huge smile on Cronenbergs face. Indeed, he achieved his goal. Were you watching this film? Beautifully shot and acted, David Cronenberg has once again provided a smarter product for more discerning viewers. If you don't get it, you are what this film is about. Funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different. And funky.","review":"This film is wonderfully non-exploitative. It delves very lightly into the ideas behind the gaming world...and where it could go, and how it could affect our future. The game seems to surround the question of whether such realistic games could distort our reality. The film is clever in the way it pursues this initially, but falters a lot. It definitely has interesting situations...and a few twisted images. Cronenberg doesn't leave you with much to think about, just a few ooh's and ahh's. Jennifer Jason Leigh doesn't give much to the film. She's as whiny and annoying as ever with the exception of the lines \\"Did I win?\\", \\"Did I win?\\". That was endearing. It's a different sort of film which holds your attention, so for that alone it's worth seeing. It's light and Jude Law is worth watching without doubt. No pomp."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun movie","review":"The art of making cool movies has been forgotten. Here is one from Croneberg: a nifty story with a layered plot that you have to watch carefully and more than once. This movie presents a video game designer as an artiste and players as her loyal followers in a world that values facscimiles over reality. They are just more fun and liberating. The story manages to have us questioning reality and the idea of free will. The acting is pleasantly peculiar and un-American. The art design is nauseously original. The DVD is very good, giving us director and scpecial effects producer commentary as well as a look at the art used in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low budget?","review":"The story had good potential, but seemed way too low budget -- the pods had a very unsophisticated outer shell, etc. Also, the acting, or rather overacting, left something to be desired.

It has a nice polt twist throughout the whole movie. Kinda wierd, but fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal film, despite the director...","review":"The film has a plot that is much more accessible than most others by Cronenberg. I was hesitant to watch this film after Crash, which I herald as one of the most painful films to watch--ever. This movie incorporates elements of action with suspense, all the while requiring you to think about the events that were transpiring. You begin to wonder yourself, where the two leads began the game, and how their actions (crimes) affected them [they themselves were unsure at points in the movie]. It was great and grows more interesting with subsequent viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"One WEIRD movie","review":"My roomate and I watched this movie, and we turned it off after the first 30 minutes because it was like stupid. But we gave it another shot, and in the end, you kinda wonder what happened. The movie starts out really slow, and just starts throwing in characters, so after a while, you start losing track of who is who. This movie pretty much sucked until the end, when you find out what the movie was about, and the ending leaves a lot of questions unanswered. This movie HAD some possibilities, but the premise was like WAY too out there, and the script was pretty weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"Wow!

A fan of the strange, this movie hooked me in the first few moments with the Kubrick-esque car escape down back country farm roads. I had hope, but alas. . .horrible acting (yes, even by Jude Law. . .why get rid of that glorious accent?) and a story that Croneneberg thought was so very clever.

It's not, it's utter rubbish. The concept is far too similar to 'The Game', the difference being that 'The Game' is a very good film. The acting is wooden, and the characters have to keep explaining what the hell it is they are doing. Imagine 'Star Wars': \\"This is your father's Light-sabre Luke, the light comes out of this bit but it doesn't go on and on forever, gradually getting dimmer like normal light, it stops after a while. Also it can cut through things and hurt people which light can't normally do, and.........blah, blah, blah, blah, blah\\"Cronenberg should be banned from directing and should have to personnaly pay back the money that was WASTED on this boring, rubbish.If you like this film you can help David pay the money back instead of buying the DVD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"David; either give it up or move on...","review":"Okay, we know that David Cronenberg can be disgusting. But, he can be disgusting in an interesting way, at times. This movie was not one of those times. To me, it seemed as though old Dave had some nasty squelching noises left over from an earlier movie and just wanted something resembling a plot in which to play them. Though the movie twists and turns, every twist and turn is obvious at least five minutes before they happen. The \\"special\\" effects aren't even up to Cronenberg standards - not hi-tech, not repulsive, just plain cheesy.

I know that having high hopes going into a movie will cause you to think less of it had you not had those expectations. In this case it wouldn't have mattered - IT WAS TERRIBLE! This was one of those movies that I just couldn't wait for it to end. The only reason that I kept watching it was the hope that something in the ending would happen to salvage the whole thing - IT DIDN'T!

There is no sense in the story, it's just about killing people without understanding why. The characers try to explain it, but you get so confused with all this non-sense! Forget reflecting, just turn off the TV. The best part of this movie is the end which could be described as quite good (when they're back to reality).I liked the cast, especialy Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, who played quite well (I really hope they didn't choose to play in this movie or I'd be concerned)I really regret the movie being so bad, I could have enjoyed it if there had been less meaningless violence and less disgusting body parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn&#65533;t enjoy the &#65533;Matrix&#65533; either&#65533;..","review":"ATLOB (I won't tell you what that stands for).

Bad acting, implausible plot, no visual FX. Too bad there is no way to rate it zero stars - I would if I could.

I hesitate to call it \\"full-length\\" though, since it clocks in a just over a half-hour long. But I'd rather have a compact, tighter album than an overly long, drawn-out, watered-down 75-minute affair.I would agree with some of the other reviewers that this isn't Ozo's best album. But it is still solid. It's upbeat and fun. Don't Mess with the Dragon is a party album, a feel-good record.One complaint - the rapping is below average and has been for quite awhile now. They could really use a guest appearance by Chali 2na, of Jurassic 5, again. I could do without rap on any future Ozo albums.Overall though, it's not mind-blowingly great, but it is good. And it's way better than 95% of the other new music you could be buying. So pick it up. It's hard to sit still and be unhappy when Ozo's coming through the speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but still awesome","review":"I've been an Ozo fan since they were selling tapes out of the trunk of their car at the L.A. County fair oh-so-many years ago. Ozo is always changing, which is refreshing in this industry of sameness. While this is a shorter album, it's still a good, solid album. I think the best track on there would have to be \\"Magnolia Soul\\" (a fun, soulful nod to New Orleans). This album is still worth picking up, despite the weird and negative reviews from the ultra die-hards. Try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slouching toward pop - disappointing","review":"I have been a big fan of Ozomatli since their first CD. I rave about them to all who will listen as most people who love this band do. This CD is indeed the turning point toward pop for this band. There are shades of the old band in some of the songs like La Gallina, or Violeta but most of the stuff is empty. It is like a band trying to cover Ozomatli songs. I am sure that most fans will give this a try in spite of the negative reviews, but for our sake guys don't do this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best...","review":"in fact, I have to say it is my least favorite album of Ozo's. That is not bad, in my opinion. I would rate their previous three as five stars. Some of the songs get a little repetitious and are rather short. However, I saw them live three weeks ago (my 15th time) and their songs have much more energy live. My personal favorite is \\"La Gallina\\". I heard it first live, and it blew me away.As good as all their recordings are, the only way to really listen to Ozo is live. I never miss a chance to see them. If they are ever in your neck of the woods, go! But be ready to move and dance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's fire","review":"If you're a fan of Ozomatli and someone who'd never heard of them asked you what genre they are, chances are you wouldn't be able to give him/her an answer (what their very name means is a head-scratcher). But their latest album Don't Mess with the Dragon is filled with great stuff.\\"Can't Stop\\" is an ideal way to open the album because you indeed won't be able to stop playing the disc after that track. From there you'll find standouts like \\"Here We Go\\", \\"When I Close My Eyes\\" and the necessary tribute-to-your-hometown, \\"City of Angels\\". And an Ozomatli album wouldn't be complete without some Latin tunes, so \\"La Gallina\\" and \\"Violeta\\" are good examples of that.I only gave the album four stars because a few of the songs start to sound the same after a while and also, it's pretty hard to top their previous album, Street Signs. But Don't Mess with the Dragon is still a blazin' album that belongs in your collection.Anthony Rupert"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is more mainstream than earlier Ozo","review":"Which may be why some listeners object. \\"Dragon's\\" good and it may be their entree into more acknowledgement. \\"Street Signs\\" is probably my favorite of their CDs and more indicative of their work, but this is still a great melange of a lot of different styles and worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a 36 pack","review":"They describe it as a pack of 36, but send you only one kit (one window worth).

Dyno-ed tested..","review":"Dyno-ed my 4.6 Mustang and added about (13-15)HP. BUT that was in cold (40) degree weather. As the temp goes up the HP goes down (4-6) HP when (85).Also I have a V-6 and V-4. Ford F-150, Acura Integra. The smaller the engine the more porportinate HP it will produce. If you are at all noise sensitive DONT buy this. When you stomp on the gas it sounds like a supercharger. Now if you are easy on the pedal you will never know it is there. The more your car revs the more you will hear it suck in the air. If you are at all mechanical savy you can put this on yourself. It was very easy for me. Bottom line it is a cheap and easy way to make more HP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet Eye infection solution","review":"My pet had weepy eyes and a yellowish discharge, I could guess that it was some sort of eye infection and was wondering what can be done.

My motive in buying the sampler DVD (and I have several of his other samplers) was to show my father what the Cha Cha, Salsa and Tango looked like. (Dad protested that he could already do the Foxtrot and I did not expect him to get much use from the Hustle steps -- because it is a fairly complex dance with many different steps.) We decided to concentrate on three dances: a slow-tempo [rumba], medium-tempo [cha cha] and fast-tempo dance [Salsa]. The product is introductory and does not teach many steps since the DVD is 77 minutes long, there are five dances to showcase and there is generic introductory material that eats up bandwidth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good video for beginners.","review":"The instructors do not teach the dance steps except by dancing themselves which is difficult to follow. We were only able to follow a few of the steps after many rewinds. The small amount of verbal instrucion is not clear and just as difficult to follow. The photo shots from the waist up are not very helpful for learning to dance. I do not plan to buy any more of their dance videos. There are others on the market that are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great showing","review":"Able to see the early fall classics especially Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth pre 1943 prior to official highlight films."},{"rating":"2","title":"This software is great!","review":"This software is great!

My kids like it okay, but my husband and I could barely sit through it.Wait for the book on tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Software implementation available for S-Plus and R","review":"Although not obvious, there is software available to implement the functionality described mathematically in the book. Alexander McNeil provides S-Plus code on his personal website, and there is an R port of that code on CRAN called QRMlib. Most of the provided software is on fitting fat-tailed distributions. This is all very useful in practice, if you care to be statistically precise. Unfortunately, many practitioners would clearly prefer rules of thumb to quantitative methods only usable with statistical software that doesn't run in Excel.

The lines are light blue, 1\\" apart. Only lined on one side. Paper is not thick - Sharpies bleed through it as do Mr. Sketch markers, but Crayola markes work well with this. Has thin cardboard covers. Useful in the classroom because I can keep the pages bound in the pad which makes it easy for students to flip through.

An earlier version of Indiana Jones but deeper and more likable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ponga Jim Delivers Quite a Punch","review":"Ponga Jim Mayo is a great discovery. Here we have the global realism and wartime intrigue of Doc Savage wrapped in the gritty, dark thrill of Robert E. Howard. These are delightful tales and it is nice that they build a cohesive universe and follow each other chronologically around the world, though all are separate adventures. I found myself tracing the journey of his ship the Semiramis in my atlas.These stories are tight, fast, and well done, with great attention to detail. L'Amour also proves he knows how to deliver a punch, with knockout endings. I did find myself wishing there were many more Ponga Jim stories or perhaps some novel-length adventures. But that's a compliment to L'Amour, not a complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what expected.","review":"I found this to be a product of rather questionable quality. The Mortar had been chipped or was defective in two different places and had been repaired with something of a different color and one end of the Pestle had been capped with a rather bad piece of stone, and poorly capped at that. I saw nothing in the write-up about it being a \\"second\\" or an \\"imperfect\\" or anything to that affect. I was very disappointed in it as it was a gift. Sometimes it doesn't pay to buy sight unseen.Based upon this I would not recommend buying from Creative Home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring one to be better","review":"This book's strength was that it made me challenge my own beliefs. As a filmmaker and writer, I have developed a sense for writing crap that appeals to the lowest common denominator. Mamet made me re-evaluate what made me become a writer, and the importance of the theater. I find his writing very interesting from the standpoint that he is very much of the theater, and an elitist as a result, but he is very favorable when discussing Hollywood. I think everyone should read his section on the Oscars in this book. Overall, I was very pleased I read the book, and would have to ultimately recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Find!","review":"If you're a fan of classic popular song, this is a fantastic find. My interest in Johnny Mercer's songwriting was piqued by a special I watched on Turner Classic Movies. I searched for what I thought was a good representation of his songs and this box set was the best I found. It took Amazon a bit longer than usual to get it to me but it was worth the wait. This set includes some of Mercer's most recognizable songs along with many I've never heard before, performed by the best singers and musicians of the era - unfortunately - nothing by Frankie - but you can't have everything. Two CDs are vocals, the third is instrumental. With only a few exceptions, everything on them is great. The sound is also very good considering how old some of the performances are.Buy this box set - it's too marvelous for words!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors, not worth the cost","review":"I bought this book set to prepare to take my ChE PE exam. The example problems are riddled with errors, and the material presentation sometimes takes giant leaps ahead (i.e. employing concepts or equations they have not yet presented). After a few chapters, I abandoned it. I recommend buying the practice problem book from NCEES instead.

The CD version of this album includes a previously unissued alternate take of \\"Swingin' Shepherd Blues,\\" a great added plus. Listeners will be interested to know that \\"A-Tisket, a-tasket\\" is sung to a Latin beat; much earlier on Fitzgerald sang this song a more traditional way in the 1941 Abbott and Costello movie Ride 'Em Cowboy.Although this may or may not be her best album ever by the critics' standards, I highly recommend this CD. The sound quality is excellent and the liner notes reproduce the original record album back cover faithfully. It certainly made me feel happy to listen to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful","review":"I actually thought this book was kind of terrible. I've liked Dallas Schulze's books in the past, but this certainly was not a good effort. The romance just didn't seem to be there, and the characters didn't seem to be developed well at all. And the whole part about Dan not having a place in his daughter Danielle's life didn't make sense. Was it just going to be a big secret forever? Seemed kind of stupid to me. The whole \\"broken people\\" idea is a good idea, but it needed to be fleshed out much more than this...in this book, it just seemed to be a device for throwing the couple together and explaining their love for each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff -- But Add Stevia","review":"After years of drinking non-fat milk, then soy milk -- I found Blue Diamond Unsweetened Vanilla Almond Milk. Great taste and only 40 calories and 4 carbs per serving ( I use two serving for cereal )and NO SUGAR! Plus fiber!

The suffering he endured during the next few years is simply unbelievable. Time and again, he broke bones, ignored tormenting pain, crawled through snowdrifts, was abandoned, starved, beaten, and rejected, and yet he still persevered.At some point, he began to have visions. He saw the Virgin Mary, \\"a ravishing beauty...decorated with gold embroidery..I experienced great admiration and love of God\\" (p 171).His death at the hands of the Iroquois makes for grim reading.

However, the surreal nature of the prison life and the magical realism that the author indulges in are overdone, too detailed and ridiculous.The author seems to be trying to say that the businessman's corruption stemmed from something in his soul, and that the prison with its psuedo-psychologist warden and its crazy rules is there to address this part of the man's character, but in the end it's all a tedious mish-mash and the speeches all go on for too long.

The fact that they are sticking with it shows that it must be WAY cheaper to manufacture -and they are so arrogant - and think that they are so big- that they can dictate to the consumer and not the other way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catalina \\"Classic\\" Is Back!","review":"We just found \\"Classic Catalina\\" at Walmart! Seems they realized their horrible mistake and brought the old formula back in August 2009. I just got off the phone with them about this. Get this - They say the only change is that they went back to artificial preservatives. They said the change in taste is entirely due to the preservatives used. What a bunch of bull. Coke used the same kind of bogus explanation when they brought back \\"Classic Coke\\". Hopefully Kraft has learned its lesson. The babyfaced marketing MBA's at Kraft were probably still in pre-school when Coke screwed up. Apparently this was not covered in their business classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste...","review":"Once the most popular salad dressing in America Kraft's Catalina brand dressing, once an icon, is no more. From the fake red dyed color to the off and slightly spoiled, rotten smell this \\"new\\" version of America's favorite should be avoided. I am certain some 24 year old MBA probably got a nice promotion out of wringing a few cents of expense per bottle this receipe probably saves Kraft.

This album seems more design than art, more intellectual vanity than inspired musical experimentation, and more sequins than substance. A candle fancies itself to be the Sun. If Judah could only find a pocket of honesty and humility in his ever expanding bag of tricks, perhaps he would treat us to something truly remarkable. But alas, Ego wins the day, and we are given a shifting glimpse into a carefully fabricated soul loosely based on the lives of others. Maybe some are dazzled by the illusion, but I'm disappointed. I recommend you save your money for something a bit less forced, and a good deal more authentic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and cheesy.","review":"My friends told me to buy this cd, and that it was overwhelmingly wonderful. I think its the silliest music I've heard in a while. There is almost nothing here worth mentioning of any quality at all. The album itself sounds quite good.

It's a quote from P. J. O'Rourke: 'Saddam's chandelier was the size of a two-car garage. If a reason to invade Iraq was wanted, felony interior decorating would have done.'This book is a private look into the homes of sixteen dictators from around the world. Here are people to whom money is absolutely no object. But they did not contact Frank Lloyd Wright to seek a brilliant new design. They knew what they liked and they got it.Many of the photographs come from fifty or more years ago, so you need to temper your view with what was in fashion at the time. This is particularly true of the homes of Hitler, Stalin, Juan Peron. The more recent homes have a kind of fancy hotel lobby look.The book is fascinating.

This subject is as worthy of serious study as any religion, and you don't have to look hard to see how closely these people's expectations parallel second comings, raptures, and apocalyptic salvation scenarios of better-known religions. As ludicrous as some of the believers are (Ariel, the \\"queen\\" of the Unarian religon who dresses like a fairy godmother, a tiara atop her bubble hairdo) I came away with renewed fascination for and frustration at our capacity to believe. An excellent artifact of our times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Singular book","review":"Curran's \\"In Advance of the Landing...\\" is a singular book that explores the mythological basis of the UFO phenomenon. Less concerned with the 'proof' of whether or not UFOs exist, Curran sets out to show that the impact of the belief in flying saucers and extraterrestrials (all of them much more clever and wise than mere earthlings) is pervasive and sits entirely within the continuum of Judea-Christianity beliefs.A revised mythology for a new technological age is beautifully rendered through Curran's photographs and words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely stories","review":"The stories and illustrations in this book are darling.

But reading about his experiences in the making of \\"Sugarland Express\\" and \\"Jaws\\"... the things he would've done differently if he could go back... the self-doubts overcome by sheer will and perseverance.

The only other problem with this bracket is once you have hung the t.v. and you want to use the tilt feature, it is hard to reach the knobs that allow you to tilt the t.v. Lastly once you hang the t.v. and you finally get the tilt that you want, it is hard to secure the security bolts at the bottom of the bracket.

The included level is ok, but I used a real full sized level. It was a fairly straight forward installation. There are 2 upright supports that attach to the back of the TV, and a bunch of different bolts supplied that may or may not work for you. My TV came with the correct size bolts, so I used those. Once these are attached, you just lift the TV and hook it onto the top of the plates. You can then slide it side to side to get the location you want.

I also saved $270.00, that's what you call a bargin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, one small flaw","review":"It is a very easy installation, and the built in level and availability for center stud mounting made it the perfect choice for me. The one problem i had with it was that because the mount is very shallow, it is damn near impossible to tighten the lower securing bolts when the tv is mounted. I have a 47 in panasonic and needed a 2 ft flat head to reach it, along with 15 minutes of headache. other than that, works and looks great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This is a huge discount compared to local department store prices.

Great product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Mount","review":"I read alot of reviews on this mount, and ALL complain about the lag bolts. The instructions say NOT to use a impact driver, only a wrench. Well being some what lazy, I did impact the lags into the studs with no problems, the heads on the lag bolts did not snap off, and checked tightness with a rachet (were tight). This is a nice mount and about a 1/3 of the cost you pay anywhere else. I bought this mount and cables before buying my 60\\" TV and saved a bundle and being spared high presures sales at the electronics stores. I will recommend this mount to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to put together","review":"No problems with this mount. Very easy to put together, sturdy. A little difficult to attach connections after tv is hung.

Easy to put together and mount TV to the wall. No fancy features but does tilt and that's enough for us. The packaging was tiny but heavy. I wasn't sure how they managed to get it in such a small box but nothing was missing or damaged. The shipping was fast. No five stars because this level they send you is like a toy and the HDMI cable is just ok. With that said after 3 days of looking in store after store and finally deciding to turn to Amazon, this is by far the biggest bang for your buck. There is NO price comparrison with what the \\"big\\" stores want for these things. Thank you Amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot beat the price","review":"I was hesitant to buy this but went ahead and pulled the trigger on it.

Pre-drilling into the wooden studs helps prevent bold head twist-off, but you can also use drywall anchors (which are just as strong). The built in bubble level was a great idea too (and permanent), but it also came with a separate (independent) bubble level as well. Then, this model's solid steel wall plate was much stronger than the flimsier perimeter \\"frame-like\\" mounts I also found here at Amazon. One great unit if you axes me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong enough for my 70\\" Sharp Aquos","review":"This wall mount is very ridged and I had no worry to hang my 70\\" LED TV on to it. Installation was a breeze. One word of advise though. Connect all wires to the TV before you hang the TV, because there is not enough room for your hand after you installed the TV on to the wall (that's probably true for most mounts). Securing the TV with the bottom screws requires a very long screw driver (I used my 20\\" long screw driver). I wish it would have had quick releases on the bottom like some other mounts instead. Other than that, I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LCD WALL MOUNT","review":"After looking in Best Buy for a wall mount at $129 I thought I would check out Amazon I found this mount and ordered it I could not be happier, it was so easy to mount my 10 year old could have done it.It came with all hardware all different size screws and bolts, mount even had a built in level to ensure straight and level and a 6ft HDMI cacble was include which best buy wanted $80All for $39 with shipping has to be best deal out there shipping was fast got it in 2 days.I will never buy from a retail store again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Screwed Me","review":"The wall mount itself is fine. It is very strong but the screws that come with the package were some of the weakest screw I have seen. I work in construction and when I saw the screws they gave me I was very hesitant to use them. All the screws snapped when they got close to the end, I had to go buy heavy duty screws to secure the mount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, great price and small nit","review":"Works well and met expectations as to quality and delivery time. the HDMI cable was a bonus. Only negative feature is the design of the tilt mechanism. You need to set up the tilt before you attach it to the TV, as the tightening bolts that adjust and hold the tilt angle can not be reset with out removing the TV from the mount. A good product but not the one to buy if your going to be changing the tilt angle often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Satisfied","review":"I was a bit hesitant because of the price; how could it possible be good quality when similar ones sell for 6 times this amount at Best Buy? This unit it strong and well put together. It also came with a massive assortment of screws, bolts, washers, and other anchors to help you mount just about any TV to any surface. I would recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"I used this wall mount to put up my 42 hitachi and it worked ok. It isn't made to be able to mount on a single stud, which would have been better for me since I was mounting to a 47 inch wide chimney wall, but it had lots of screw holed that enabled me to use two studs off center and made it work. The tilting feature works well and the tv seems safe on the wall. Mounting took about 20 minutes. I would have like to take my time and do it a little slower, but my friend was rushing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wokrs but hard to adjust","review":"This thing is fine if you are going to mount it and leave it, but making any adjustment to angle after you have it mounted is quite impossible.

It is strong enough to hold it up, we did use our own screws because some reviews said the ones that came with it we not strong (or even broke), we also used our own level because the one that came with it was not very accurate. Luckily having read the reviews we put a 2x4\\" board on the wall first then attached the mount to it to make sure we could access the inputs on the back of the t.v. Without that 2\\" space we wouldn't be able to add or remove any cords from the back of the t.v. without having to take the it off of the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY","review":"This bracket is so close to the wall it is next to impossible to add additional connections.

It is very secure, neat and easy to install. My only negative on it is that if you mount a large screen TV (mine is 60\\") you will need a very, very long screw driver (12\\" - 18\\") to tighten the bottom screws on the vertical attachment braces. Don't skip this step. Get a really long screwdriver and tighten your set-up properly. Getting the level and the cable included was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Mount.","review":"For the price, you can't beat what this mount offers. Its solid and strong.

I mounted my 50\\" TV and it feels VERY secure. The only problem I had was the spacers that came with the mount. They caused the TV to be too close to the wall. So I used the spacers from my old mount...which resolved my problem. This also limits the 'tilt' feature the mount has..so I am not sure I would try mounting anything more then a 50\\" with this mount. (and 50\\" is being generous. since I used different spacers)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"Well, it would have got 5 stars had the built in bubble level been worth a damn. Overall, a great product. They give you plenty of options for bolts for all kinds of tv's. The lag bolts are not the best, so make sure you drill pilot holes! Plenty of options for attaching it to the wall. My studs were slightly off center of where I wanted my tv and had plenty of holes to choose from.

Unfortunately, the point at which it achieves a good degree of \\"tightness\\" positions the bar at an odd angle so that it sticks out from the back quite a way. I was worried that it would interfere with the TV fitting up flush onto the bracket.2) Once the TV is hung on the upper rail there is a bolt that tightens from below to secure the brackets to the lower rail. The TV is so snug against the wall that there's really no way to get your hand behind the TV to tighten the screws so you need a really long screwdriver to reach. After installing on a 58\\" Plasma (Samsung PN58c6400) the screws were so far away from the bottom of the TV that I could not find a screwdriver long enough to reach them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wall mount","review":"Quick shipping and product as advertised.

I agree with one of the other reviews on this product about the design when the placement of the drill holes should have been about an 1/2 - 1' further away from the orginal designated area. The bolts/screws are obviously cheap but its strong enough hold no bigger then a 32' flat scren. Any bigger then I would suggest going to your nearest to get better bolts/screws.

I never put things together right but this time was very successful. This is a great product and i have to buy two more for my other plasmas. Everything I needed came in the bag with the instructions and made it so easy to put together.

Instructions were OK, had to read over them a few times. One thing to note: Do not use on the onboard level because it is very off balance! I learned the hard way! Use that Stanley triple leveler for sure! Well, the TV is covering those first holes. My plasma is up, and is staying up. Very sturdy - It would take a 10.0 on Richter scale to bring it down. Don't pay double or triple for those other mounts - this is one is just as good or even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy!","review":"Bought it for a 47\\" vizio, and it holds up very well. Only recommendation would be to go to a hardware store and buy better bolts. I had read other reviews about the bolts just breaking/snapping, so I decided not to chance it and automatically bought a few better quality bolts. I still gave it five stars because even with buying a few screws you cant beat the price/quality of this mount!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"The quality is great.

I was very surprised by the quality of this, it is pretty heavy duty actually. I hung a 40\\" tv with it. Installation was simple and removing and reinstalling tv is simple as well. I would definitely recommend this. Much better quality then a lot of similar wall mounts that I have seen in stores that cost much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality. But do not depend on the supplied levels!","review":"As another review noted, the levels are not very accurate. It would be a very nice feature if they were accurate. Use your own level! I wish I had read the reviews a little more and seen that comment. It was close enough for my eye, but it is severely lacking in the wife acceptance factor. As soon as I placed one of my levels on the TV, or the wall bracket, after mounting I saw it was off.Barring that issue, the bracket is very sturdy, and much more reasonably priced than many other mounts. I also had a power outlet directly under the TV, so I ended up buying a recessed outlet, added some 3/4 inch wood blocks and longer lag screws to set it off from the wall a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product at an amazing price!","review":"After seeing similar items online and in stores for over $100. I snatched this up after reading other reviews.This item is very well made and as other reviewers have said use your own carpenters level. The one built in isnt always accurately mounted in the unit.I would buy another one in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Wall Mount","review":"I bought this wall mount for a 42\\" plasma TV. It is almost oversized for this size TV, but I intentionally bought it that way, since I had to attach the wall mount above a fireplace where the wall is recessed on one side (asymmetrical!). Now about two thirds of the mount touch the wall and one third sticks out. The manual says that at least 2 out of the 6 huge included screws have to go into wood studs in the wall. I used 12 smaller screws, 8 on top, 4 on the bottom. By coincidence 4 of them went into studs. The mount feels rock solid. If I push against the one third that sticks out on the side without screws, it does not bend at all. I can move the plasma TV all the way to the side that sticks out to the side of the wall and the mount still doesn't bend or feel elastic in any way. I'm happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mount, especially since it's inexpensive.","review":"I bought this mount a couple of months ago, based on the reviews that I had read. So far it has lived up to all the good things that have been said about it. It was easy to install with clear and simple directions. The mount is solid steel so it appears that it will hold up for a long time. It's rated at holding up to 165 lbs. and the 60\\" plasma (LG60PZ750) that I mounted weighs about 90 lbs. and went up like a breeze and hangs solid on the wall. As in other reviews, I suggest you use your own level, not the one that comes with it or the one that is attached to the mount. They tend to be inaccurate. The 6' HDMI cable that came with the mount was an added bonus. You can't go wrong with this mount and I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"After searching all the department and electronic stores I found this wall mount on amazon.I have never ordered anything from amazon before but figured for 30 bucks I wouldn't be out muck if it was junk. I was pleasantly suprised when we installed the TV. The wall mount is very sturdy and was a level in the plate. It also comes with a level that I gave to my 8 year ould to keep in his tool box, he was happy. The instructions were clear and easy to follow and all the hardware was included. Also came with a spare HDMI cable that we will use in another room. You can feel safe ordering this wall mount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price, decent unit","review":"I would buy this again.

Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap yet Sturdy","review":"Very cheap price and wide ranging wall mount. It is of good quality, sturdy. Arrived fast, all items intact and working as intended. My daughter has a big old heavy TV in easy reach and we were afraid she would drop the TV on her. So we bought her a 32\\" flat screen TV and this wall mount for safety reasons. I've never installed a wall mounted TV before so I hit google and did as much research as I could. Bought all the tools I thought I would need. The Wall Mount comes with everything else needed. Instruction manual seems kind of like a translated one lol. It definitely needs editing. I was still able to follow it and understand enough by using common sense. It was a lot easier to install then I thought. The TV looks nice up on the wall, my daughter will be ecstatic. I ordered a second one for the TV in the living room. I am satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sturdy mount.","review":"The mount was exactly as described.

A friend of mine recommended this one to me and I was a bit skeptical. Once the mount arrived I noticed that this mount was solid and just as good any other mount out there. Dont be fooled by the brand names charging you close to 200 dollars. Save some money and purchase this one, you wont be disappointed. I have my 55 inch TV on it and the TV does not move at all. It comes with all the required hardware and even has small spacers that provide about 1/2 inch more clearance off the wall. With the tilt feature its very easy to get behind there and hook everything up. Great mount, Awesome price!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"This mount came very well packaged and feels like it is top notch quality. This is my first experience with this type of mount but there's no way that the mounts at the store costing much more than this one could be better or easier to install. The only difficult part of the installation was getting to the bottom Phillips head screws that lock the mount in place. With the tilt of the screen it was a bit of a reach to get to those. For another project I have since purchased an extra long Phillips head screwdriver from Sears and upon a test I can say that it would have made the job so much easier. Other than that, the mount is holding up fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Price, Good Unit","review":"Nice bracket: Installation was simple. It came with plenty of spare screws and washers to fit most any TV. The wall bracket level seemed accurate, although I did use my own level just to be sure.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better ones.","review":"Wasnt hard to put up. Loved the way the parts were lettered, made it much easier. It is very secure and love the way my TV looks on the wall.

You should use the spacers so that you can adjust the tilt earily. Definatly would purchase another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST value for the money!","review":"I purchased this product because of the price - I paid $30 (for something that normally costs $100+). I bought it because of 1. the price, 2. the fact that it supports 32\\" - 60\\" TVs, 3. the built in level, and 4. the ability to tilt (I ended up mounting my TV over my fireplace). The fact that it supports TVs of different sizes is great. I have a 40\\" now, but am hoping to get a 55\\" in the near future.I know most people pay $300-$400 just to have someone INSTALL one of these PLUS the cost of the TV mount. A friend helped me, but we were able to install this ourselves, above my fireplace (went through drywall AND brick. I am amazed at how easy it was to install with the set of instructions that it came with.I would highly recommend this to anyone who is thinking of purchasing a TV wall mount.

I found this book very difficult to get through and I am not sure why. I felt that many of the grammatical and usage explanations were incomplete. I think there are numerous errors and inconsistencies in the answer key. I found the chronic use of the progressive tense annoying and more frequent than contemporary Italian usage. This book has excellent word lists and great appendices. When I finally finished, I pulled those pages out of the book, punched holes in them and added them to my Italian grammar notebook.

It is not a beginner's book, you should already have some decent vocab and understanding of Italian for this, but it does a great job of explaining all those tiny little words that make sentences make sense. There are plenty of exercises, and it introduces enough new words to me where I'm learning, but not so many that I can't complete the exercises. It's great to learn, and as a reference.

Bulscu has run away from his white collar past & now is running away from his current life, sleeping in the subway instead of his apartment. He's worried about competition (the subtitling has to choose important information to go wonky during) but still won't back down from challenges from his fellow inspectors.Meanwhile, a hooded man in black is pushing people under trains. Bulscu is accused of being him and must fight him in the last 6 minutes of the film, which nevertheless contain a satisfying battle. This is a very strange film, and I haven't figured all of it out, but it is very beautiful and not at all boring. There's lots of comedy in it.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"ED WOOD LIVES","review":"Remember the name Conrad Glover-he wrote,directed,produced and stars in this piece of guano that makes 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' look like 'Citizen Kane'. The sound is hollow, the production values are nil, the script is beyond idiotic, and the cast can't even be referred to as actors and watch the characters playing the rich parents of two kidnapped girls-they dress and look as if they were cast at a soup kitchen on skid row. Another classic piece of casting involves the police detective investigating the two missing girls-she has longer dredlocks than the alien from the Predator movies, and is scarier. Please, please, please Mr Glover don't make any more movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated","review":"Book was slow in arriving.

A well written, unbiased view of the events surrounding this sad case. The author alludes to several possible reasons for the murders, but draws no conclusions, and that is as it should be as the evidence doesn't clearly support one or another.

I adore glam! But I was thinking along the lines of the New York Dolls (a cover of their song 'Personality Crisis' done by Teenage Fanclub hardly counts), Mott the Hoople, Iggy Pop, David Bowie, or Slade... None of which were on this record, to my huge dismay (No BOWIE?). This was a quite a disappointment of a collection of \\"glam classics\\". There are a few gems on here, but not enough to be worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential to any music lover's collection!!!","review":"wow. all i have to say is wow. The best thing about this movie is that it truly is ALL about the music. I actually couldn't even reccomend this soundtrack to anyone who hasn't seen the film. There are some excellent classics on this album, and some great new re-makes of classics. But above all, I must praise (worship??) the two Shudder to Think tracks. They're totally amazing pieces of songwriting. This is a must for fans of glitter and David Bowie. Truthfully, David's approval of the project wouldn't have made it any better..I'm glad he refused to let his music to be used on the soundtrack. It's left room open for other great tracks and allowed for complete, 100% originality on the parts of Todd Haynes and Michael Stipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"With songs like \\"Baby's on Fire,\\" how can you go wrong?","review":"Music by and with Bernard Butler, Johnny Greenwood (Radiohead), Thom Yorke (Radiohead), Mike Watt, Brian Eno, Pulp, and a LOT more that I am not as familiar with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds good to me","review":"I was around in the '70's, but too young to take notice of the music scene. So... this soundtrack is a huge revelation to me. Covers or originals for the film, doesn't matter to me. They all sound fabulous. I only watched the movie because Eddie Izzard was in it, but came away with the desparate need to have the music. 20th Century Boy by Placebo could easily be a top hit today. T.V. Eye!

So as a Radiohead fan, I took a listen out of sheer curiosity and was duly appalled. Although then again, I never liked the original versions to begin with.

Best of all is Carter Burwell's synthesizer track called VELVET SPACETIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is No Better Accounting of Glam","review":"One of my all time favorite movies. Accurately chronicles the Glam era. So many specific references to my idol, David Bowie and others (Iggy Pop, Marc Bolan, etc). Remakes of the songs are done very well as backdrops to the story - none better than Brian Eno's \\"Baby's On Fire\\" scene.

The soundtrack is so wonderful and caused me, about 3 or so years ago to undergo a complete personality change to reflect my nw found love of classic 70s performers like David Bowie, Biano Eno, Roxy Music and Iggy Pop. This soundtrack breathes new life into a almost forgotten music genre. Kudos to all involved with bringing the greatest music ever together on one CD.

Ewan McGredgor, displaying that he can sing other types of music besides the love songs found in Moulin Rouge, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers contribute to songs such as TV Eye, and the catchy and somewhat whiney Baby's On Fire.

I am now trying to get through the audio cd version of Playing with Fire. The narrator, as I can picture him, is speaking with the spittle collecting and the corners of his mouth. His attempt at portraying the characters' voices is pathetic. He should just read it straight out as his \\"normal\\" voice is not bad at all. The story will be good, I know, but have to suffer through this reading may not be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Interesting, yet bland, plot & characters.","review":"Robinson is vastly overrated. Nevertheless, the plot in this novel is a little better than most of his novels. Characters are etched with a vagueness that undermines the possibility of depth and ambiguity of character, that Robinson, I suspect, thinks he is creating. Main problem is Banks--Robinson thinks that facts about Banks's life--divorce, former girlfriend on force, long-range relationship, living alone etc--creates a complex, edgy character, but what the reader gets is detective that moves shallow and superficially through the novel. Robinson succeeds much better with a one-time character--the gallant lad whose heroin addicted girlfriend dies--very good portrait of angst filled young man, dealing with life, authentic personality-- his anger is vivid. I liked art expert characterization also. But Banks, female cop, cliched doctor, painter just sit there, dull and uninvolving. Forgettable novel. Highly forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just to boring to finish","review":"Sorry all your Robinson fans, but this one left me so bored that I just could not finish it. Some of the characters grabbed me and tried to pull me in, but then I'd get pushed out again. Some of the writting style was confusing as was the British language references. It took me some time to step into this style novel, and actually, I just never stepped far enough. Didn't enjoy this one, and if all of Robinson's books are this style, I'd have to say I won't be reading any more of them.

Set in wonderful Yorkshire in the depths of winter it is good to see the old Banks and Robinson back again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like any of the characters","review":"I did not like any of the characters.

Still four stars, but barely. I can always count on Robinson to give a book that earns my respect and admiration, both for the plot and the characterization. Chief Inspector Banks is a great character, a good cop, a troubled, conflicted, complex guy. His problems with ex-wife Sandra and his main squeeze of the moment -- often a co-worker -- make him eminently human. A Robinson/Banks book usually falls into a pattern and it's not unusual that you will detect who the bad guy is before the novel ends. But the joy comes from Robinson's artistry in richly weaving a tale that keeps you engrossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Perfect Letdown","review":"I've read over 150 thrillers/mysteries during the past 5 years and this novel ranks as one of the five worst. The story is a complete bore and the killer is so perfectly obvious that it seems that the only way the author keeps the story moving is to include monotonous drama about a sexually abused teenager and an emotionally limited inspector. The title, the ending and the loose ends are all meaningless and disappointments. The moral of the story: don't pay attention to the rave reviews on the inside flaps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Robinson Triumphs Again","review":"In my view, Peter Robinson is one of our greatest writers of detective fiction: in his Alan Banks' novels, he has created a complex, interesting man struggling with his issues. I am reading all of his Alan Banks novels chronologically, which I recommend because he refers to prior events in Banks' life, events that will not be as meaningful to the reader if he has not read the prior novels. In \\"Playing with Fire\\" Robinson intrigues us with a series of fires that have claimed lives. Are we dealing with an arsonist or could these fires be cleverly planned attempts to murder the victims? As Banks pursues his investigation, the reader is swept up in exciting events, one of which almost costs Banks his life. Robinson is in top form here as we join him in unravelling a fascinating mystery and in further developing the pains and pleasures of Banks' life in Yorkshire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot, hot, hot","review":"I enjoyed the plot and procedures, but was disappointed that I nailed the bad guy midway thru.

The main compartment has an adjustable divider to be sized to your laptop. No sipper on the inside pouch, so if you flip the top all the way open, your stuff can fall out. If you travel with your laptop a lot, I would go with one of the more heavy duty models, the sides on this one are a little flimsy. This is padded, but not bulletproof.

Some had a glossy surface which caused the printer ink to just lay in puddles on it and some worked a little better, having an almost matte surface, but not quite-the ink would print really lightly on them. Still others were a full matte surface and would print ok. I started using the ones with the matte surface and found many of them were defective-I couldn't burn to them-since I use them to store my own content or to burn movies that I create, it isn't an issue of restricted content.

Once you get the hang of it, you can mix a batch and have it in the mixer in about 10 minutes, with fresh sorbet or ice cream ready to eat in 30 minutes more. This factory-reconditioned machine was indistinguishable from new. The only problem I have with this Cuisinart machine is that it is very loud. But maybe they are all like that. Another great thing about making your own is you can make it completely organic, and in the case of sorbets, out of spring water if you prefer.

The Premium Vanilla recipe they give isn't quite as sweet or smooth as store-bought(maybe future attempts will make it better). I followed the suggestions that I read here about thoroughly freezing the bowl, and cooling the mixture first. You do need to re-freeze the mixture for at least an hour (2 is better) to get the right consistancy.My only complaint so far is that it is LOUD!! It seems like such a simple motor, I don't know why it would need to make such a racket.

Easy to use and clean up is a breeze. Just have to keep the bowl in the freezer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS!","review":"I recently purchased this ice cream maker. I love it. My 4 1/2 year old son made strawberry yogurt last night. It's so easy. Just freeze the canister, dump in the ingredients, turn it on, and get ready! The instruction book is helpul with lots of basic recipes. When we made our ice cream or yogurt, we really don't measure everything that goes in there - Just pour it in. My kids love and I know it's healthy for them. You can substitute lower fat ingredients and it doesn't effect the end result. A must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I absolutely love this machine. I have every kitchen appliance known to man. I recently got married and had an incredibly hard time registering, this was the only appliance that I didn't already own, so I thought 'what the heck', it can't be worse than my wooden tub/ice/salt freezer. It was amazing! It makes the perfect quantity of ice cream from a dinner for 8 and the cost savings on store bought ice cream is great. Just one pint of whipping cream and one pint of milk, a little sugar and vanilla and you are good to go! I never follow a recipe, so the book is a good guide, but feel free to embellish yourself with fresh fruit, nuts, or your favorite candy bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine - just like new out of the box","review":"Having used a Cuisinart food processor for years, I felt comfortable about ordering this machine, even re-conditioned. The price was what sold me - and the 90-day factory warranty plus the positive customer service experienced by other reviewers regarding minor problems with the product helped too. My machine arrived within about 3 days of ordering (thank you, Amazon.com). It was clean, packaged as new, with no discernible defects. I immediately washed & dried the machine's freezer insert, and placed it in my freezer overnight. My first batch of a mocha-chip gelato was good, the second batch better, and a follow-up jasmine tea sorbet (fat-free, no less) was superb. Storing the machine's insert in the freezer keeps it ready for use, and chilling the sorbet or ice cream mixture for several hours or overnight helps the freezing process. It's a bit noisy, but not more than I expected. Generally, a fun toy and nice addition to my culinary arsenal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Ice Cream Ever!","review":"I received the factory reconditioned Cuisanart ICE-20FR and can't find a hint of it having been used or re-conditioned. The only difference I can see is the warranty has been reduced to 90 days from the normal 3 year warranty.Tried the frozen yogurt recipe, it tasted awful. YUK!The following day I tried the vanilla ice cream recipe, and added chocolate chips. WOW! Without a doubt the best tasting ice cream I have ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Ice Cream","review":"I bought this item so I could make sugar-free ice cream. It does a wonderful job, turning out a tasty treat in about 20 minutes. You can't beat that!Clean up is a snap. The stirrer just rests inside the bowl, so there's no difficulty in washing up afterward. The machine looked brand new and works great. No complaints here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice Cream???","review":"More like frappe. I have attempted ice cream twice. The first time I thought maybe the bucket wasnt frozen solid, so I cranked my freezer up on high and left in there for 24 hours. BOTH times the ingredients came out thin and soupy. I even tried running the machine longer, to no avail. The only way to get anywhere near ice cream consistency was to just freeze the ingredients and keep stirring every 1/2 hour or so. Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose of an Ice Cream MAKER??? Thumbs down from me on this product, and I will probably rummage up the receipt and return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it","review":"I bought this item based on positive reviews and the seemingly great value. First this sale price is equal to most store's regular price. I've used this unit on several occasions and the results were okay. The old fashioned ice with rock salt units will get the ice cream more frozen. The unfortunate thing with this unit is that I'll never be able to use it again. The \\"bowl\\" that you freeze cracked while in the freezer and leaked some strange fluid out. It looks like ice crystals, but it is apparantly some type of chemical. Neat idea, bad execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Easy","review":"This little machine couldn't be quicker or easier. I put the bowl in my freezer overnight and made the simple vanilla ice cream recipe and had no problems on my first try. The ice cream is not as smooth as store bought ice cream, but for something that takes less than 30 minutes from start to finish I see nothing to complain about. I used the cooked custard type recipe which is a lot more work, but turns out a lot creamier. If all you want is a quick little dessert on short notice, just keep the bowl in your freezer and you can whip up some pretty decent ice cream on short notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the BEST","review":"We purchased this ice cream maker over a year ago and have used it constantly!! We're going to purchase this machine for Christmas presents for our family this year and we're SURE everyone will love it as much as we have. We LOVE making different flavors of ice cream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"I just received my ice cream maker, and the first recipe I tried was a knock-off of Ben & Jerry's N.Y. Super Fudge Chunk. The result is some of the best ice cream I've ever tasted. Although the ingredients are by no means healthy, there's a certain pleasure in knowing that every ingredient is natural. I normally keep my freezer super frozen - that may have led to my great success with the consistency of the ice cream. I had been afraid that it would be really runny but it was perfect! Yay impulse buy. Great bargain, too, on the reconditioned product. I too could find no sign that it wasn't brand new."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best gift I ever gave","review":"My Father, who is the pickiest guy in the world, loves this machine. He could not wait for it to arrive and makes ice cream everyday. That should show you how easy it is, since he is NO Martha Stewart. I saved so much with the factory refurb, I was able to pick up a second one for us, we love it too! They are wonderful machines and look brand new.... I highly reccommend it, but you may want to include a recipe book. We really like the Ben and Jerry's book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart 1.5 qt ice cream maker","review":"I really like my new ice cream maker. It works really well. It makes just enough and it freezes quickly. I only had one batch that did not freeze well; I attributed this to possibly having too much in the tub. It was a runny ice cream so I popped it into the freezer for a while and it finished freezing to the desired consistency. I highly recommend this product for 2-4 people to have ice cream!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Machine and can still be improved","review":"We have ice cream every day w/ the help of a Blender.I have made different fresh fruit flavors using reduce fat milk & sweetener sugar and its a healthy diet for us old people here in an elderly nursing home.However I have to freeze them for a while to make it a harder cream.Its a good ice cream maker for homes and for those watching calories intake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A steal!","review":"This machine's a great deal. It's refurbished, but mine arrived looking and working like brand new. It works quite effectively and makes excellent ice cream in only half an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice so far","review":"I just ordered this ice cream maker because I am on a diet including dairy and fruits; I thought I'd make sorbets. I have used this machine twice and it works well. I will say my only grumble is the ingredients freeze to the sides of the bowl and leave a frozen ring around the inside which is difficult to remove without unfreezing. Since my diet involves measuring amounts, this makes some difficulty for me. That said, I did enjoy the finished products, and I haven't seen the troubles other people reported about \\"too soft\\" mixtures. I use cold ingredients which probably helps. Both my ice milk and fruit sorbet were delicious. Lastly, I bought a reconditioned unit, and it looks and performs perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slip - Sliding Away","review":"This 1987 Chet Atkin's album finds him slip-sliding away. Please don't get me wrong. Believe me. when I was in the 8th grade, I got into fistfights defending Chet Atkin's unheralded mastery of the guitar. Of course, back then, in the 1950's I had his \\"Chet Atkins in Three Dimensions\\" on the RCA label to prove it. Now while Chet wasn't the reason I bought my first electric guitar (that was becaues of Buddy Holly), Chet Atkins and His Guitar were synonymous with excellence in the rough - the rough being country. Country was at the root of his fresh approach to the other guitar genres - folk, classical, Latin, etc. In retrospect there were about 8 seminal albums like \\"Dimensions\\" that Chet cut for RCA Victor. I'm not going to name them off because guitar aficianados are already well aware of them.(They're all out on CD by the way.)Sails is not seminal. It's down right weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I wasted good money on this bra, thinking that it would work with my low back micro mini dress.

I like the idea but what good is it when it does not fit like it is supposed to, so I have to go braless when I wear that dress.If the bra fit I would not be so upset, but I do not have a lot of money so when I buy something I want to get what I paid for and this bra is not worth 0.01 cent.So if you are thinking about buying this bra DON'T take it from me your better off going to Walmart than wasting your hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help is finally here!","review":"As a parent of an adopted son at age 2, I dismissed a lot of his actions as typical boy until at age 5 when it escalated into rage and hatred toward me and my husband.

It's a tribute to the writer that she has the skill to make a reader cringe with the charachter's humiliation, but still. Ouch. And I was hit by how surreal the party to catch the killer was. It was more Murder, She Wrote than a sensible action by charachters I feel I know.

I interpreted the title to mean sweaters designed by Fashion designers, but the \\"designer\\" in question is the author, an interior decorator. I will shop more carefully next time.The other problem was what some other reviewers have mentioned: the lack of yarn quantity/yardage.

What is appallingis that Bartholomew does not indicate the amount of yarn required for any of the many sweater options given. In addition, most of the patterns have a guage of 2.5-3 stitches with the yarn doubled. Completely frustrating! Bartholomew admits she isn't sure about the yarn because much of it was bought in the United States or abroad. Although the designs and use of color are pleasing - I think presenting a pattern book without giving a clue as to how to figure out how much yarn you need is irresponsible. This is the worse pattern book I have every purchased. In addition, she suggests finding someone and paying to have the sweater finished b/c she doesn't like sewing the seams.E.

As MacKenzie is most famous for his political agitations and leading role in the 1837 rebellion in Upper Canada, much of the book deals with his life leading up to the latter event. The author draws on a number of contemporary sources--including MacKenzie's own writings--and quotes from them regularly.

It can be said that \\"Touch The World\\" was a truly contemporary R&B album for its time with touches of Hip-Hop and New Jack Swing but that at the same time did not betray or give away the group's musical roots or heritage.

I read the 768 page book in a week flat (and ordered Vol. 2 at the mid-point to ensure I could seamlessly continue).The key to the work is the way in which Caro is able to take a complex set of events and explain it in the context of a central theme. For example, Caro uses the building of the Marshall Ford dam to explain the urgency with which Herman Brown and Alvin Wirtz worked to get Johnson elected to the House.In short, the book is well-written, thorough, and smart. Caro adds the extra value we require of a historian -- that is, he doesn't merely retell events, he places them in a coherent context so that we can understand what made LBJ.

The first 100 pages is a little slower as Caro describes the exceptionally rural background of Johnson's progenitors. (I'm beginning to research relatives of same time in Arkansas, so I really understood for the first time why everyone looks SO OLD in photographs!).

I don't like the earpiece either. There was no doc that said the earpiece could be swiveled - I only learned that after reading these reviews.

What it provides is a couple of pages of well-known curiosities (misspelling on his gravestone, for example) but no reasoned explanation of anything at all. The vast majority of the book is comprised of short stories of accounts of meeting the King all given by people whose identities are kept secret. The standard line is \\" I can never prove it, but I know He is with us still\\". My favourite account is of a guy who lives in a trailer park who is obsessed with Elvis, sees the back of someone walking past his window the morning after a night of heavy drinking, and falls down and cuts himself running out to try and see the person's face. He KNOWS he has seen Elvis....because he has the scar to prove it. If you are considering buying this book, poke out both your eyes with a pencil.

Well let me tell you this \\"jumbling tower\\" is just a piece crap. The reasons why have already been brought up. First and foremost is the size of the blocks. I'm sure that Jenga is patented and thats why this chinese knockoff uses blocks that are not the right size. According to the instructions you are supposed to rebuild the tower by hand, equally spacing every other row of blocks so that it creates a layer equal size of the last. I dont know about you but i dont want to spend 10 minutes to rebuild this tower.

After a creepy opening scene, the plot goes out the window in favor of meaningless shocks and laughable fx. Just when one thinks this joke of a horror movie can't get any worse, it does, with a poorly animated 'ghost cloud' thats presence goes unexplained and its defeat comes effortlessly and questionably.With the exception of Geoffrey Rush's wonderful performance as Mr. Price, House on Haunted Hill is a joke, a great cast (Famke Jannsen, Jeffrey Combs and Peter Gallagher) can't save the remaining untalented hacks, the fx laughable and the plot-nonexistant.

(DeepBlueSea, Godzilla, Twister, etc etc etc) I'm not even going to bother comparing this to the 1950s classic, I don't think remakes are always a bad idea but in that case, I think the charming tale is a period piece which tampering could only reveal how life in the modern era lets us down. Computers can't create terror in my opinion. I also detest the portrayal of the millionaire's wife in this flick. Aren't we sick of the stereotype of \\"the gold hunting evil woman fooling around\\".

Hill goes completely overboard on the CGI towards the end much like \\"The Haunting\\" and what we are left with is a laughable attempt at recreating the horror and tension of the original 1950's version. Good for a laugh or two but a scare, I think youll be more scared in Scooby Doo's mysteries on cartoon network."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Horror","review":"I can't believe how boring I found this film. \\"The Munsters\\" is more frightening. It's just another slasher film with no suspense. Comparisons have been made to older films like Vincent Price's wonderfully campy \\"The Abominable Dr. Phibes,\\" but this doesn't come close. Maybe it really points out how significant Vincent Price was to those other films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, and not too scary.","review":"It was a slow, and sort of boring plot line.

The cast is very good, and is fun to see PEter Gallagher in the middle of this crazy trip ! No scary moments here, only good special effects and characters with double personalities and totally stereotyped. (the athlete, the ambicious woman, the famous doctor, the great business-man, the pretty blond) GOod entertainment project !"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the most cheesiest, most perdictable film ever!","review":"I rented this film and I was very very very much disappointed in it. First of all, the plot was just plain stupid and the acting, ugh, the acting was frightning. I thought the movie was supposed to be that but no. It turns out that House on Haunted Hill is a frivolous 1hr and 30min mess that sould of never been put out again. If you want to laugh really hard then buy it. It's not my money. If you want to be thrilled or scared out of your witts then buy something else because House on Haunted Hill just doesn't cut it. . .at all. It blends comedy, horror(ha ha), and unnecsessary nudity! COME ON!"},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS: You gotta be freaking kidding me!!!","review":"The movie \\"The House on Haunted Hill\\" is a cheesey and stupid attempt to make a haunted house movie. The movie simply isn't scary and fails to evoke any interest from any sophisiticated horror movie fan.Despite opinions to the contrary, the acting is terrible...the movie suffers from the unintentional comedy syndrome in which this movie tries to be scary but becomes more of an unintentional comedy and a total joke. However, despite how truly awful this movie is, I would STILL give this movie a slight edge over that trashy remake of \\"The Haunting.\\" Nevertheless, stay away from this rubbish if you're interested in a real horror movie.Bottom Line: this movie is supposed to be a horror movie and it simply fails in its goal to produce a scary atmosphere rendering this movie a total bore and a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"More proof that you can't make the orignal better","review":"In 10 words or less, this movie was terrible! I mean it had no real plot and just kept dragging on and on. If you've ever seen a horror film in your life, you'll predict everything that's going to happen. The only thing I was surprised about was how the final \\"evil\\" would look, but other than that, it was totally not scary. The movie basically begged you to turn it off \\"End me...End me! For God's sake, end me!\\" I wouldn't recommend watching this movie or think about watching it unless you need a cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and Boring","review":"This is a \\"in desperate need rental\\". Many times I have avoided renting it because of that feeling. You know when a movie is just going to fall short of anyting but entertaining. Well it feel very short. Half way through I noticed that my apartment needed cleaning so the movied played as I cleaned and I did not miss much. The plot is predictable. Characters are flat. If you want a pretty good scary movie with a house that's alive rent The Haunting. You will get much better acting and special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"It wasn't what I expected that's for sure. The operation scene had me gagging.

I personally believe that if they gave this another title and didnt associate it with the original then people would of looked on it with a new light and see just how good it was. It had action and voilence and gore everything i loved it! The only flaw was some of the acting and wat they said; for example at the end when the two of them r on the window sill after they escaped the guy said something like \\"that was a kickass party\\" even though i know this is a entertainment movie that just annoyed me because after staying in a house like that and seeing all thos murders and ghost nobody would just say that as a joke! haha well besides that this was def. a great movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"This must be a joke right?","review":"This film was without a doubt the most pathetic attempt at horror I've ever seen in my entire life. The acting was indescribably poor and it lacked any entertainment value what so ever. If you haven't seen it, never see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"this is a poorly made version of a classic. though the actors are well known they sure know how to pick movie parts. Famke Janssen(Deep Rising) is very bitchy in this one and when she got hers I was satisfyed. I liked the fact that Taye Diggs(New Best Friend) and Ali Larter(American Outlaws) survived because they were the best people in that movie. Chris Kattan(Corky Romano), Geoffrey Rush(MysteryMen), Bridgette Wilson(I Know What You Did Last Summer), Peter Gallagher(tv's The O.C.), Max Perlich(Drugstore Cowboy and tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Lisa Loeb(the singer), Jeffrey Combs(Re-Animator 1,2&3) and James Marsters(Spike on Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) also costar. the slayings are somewhat disgusting, the dialouge suck and some good actors are wasted playing dumb roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING BORING MOVIE","review":"Come on people the plot was so lame and it was just like any other stupid movie where they get stuck in a house.But there in a crazy house.This did not scare me one bit.I thinks the best part was the very begging where the docters doing weird stuff I think thats the begging.The acting was good but nothing else.The special effects were bad with the ghost or whaterver it was.So my conclusion is don't see this movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD TASTE","review":"This is not a decent thriller. The is a lesson in inhuman treatment of helpless humans. This is something you might see in a death camp, but certainly not for entertainment. It isn't scary, just SICK.

IT was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Was Great","review":"Hello, If you like Movie's were people are in a Haunted House and there is Gore, lots Action and a great actors Then you will like this Movie....."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"I do not care if this is better than the original movie. It's still bad.Prepare yourself for a predictable movie, with flat characters, boring plot, bad acting and a really really bad ending(think Stephen King, perhaps even worse).There is some interesting scenographics and camera shooting in this movie, but it's all ruined by bad acting and badly chosen music. It would have been better to cut all the good scenes together and make a music video out of it.It has some entertainment value, but I wouldn't recommend spending any money on it.Instead I'd recommend seeing Session 9, because that one is really worth both the time and the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MUST SEE Movie Of The Year!","review":"I rated this movie 5 stars because of the visual and special effects it has produced. The movie is about a crazy doctor named Dr. Vanicutt who operates on the criminally insane people who were sent to the insane asylum, but then one night everything goes wrong and only five people survived. Later, an amusement park owner and his wife plan to have his wifes birthday party at the asylum in which he decides to give all five guests a million dollars each to anyone who stays the night inside the walls of the house on haunted hill. The movie gets a little weird at the end, but this movie is damn good and is the best movie that I've ever seen in my entire life! If you like a good mystery/thriller, you MUST watch this movie. Oh and there is a little something extra after the credits so be watching! Sleep tight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average Horror movie.","review":"This film is about 5 Pretty people got a invite to a haunted house to spend a night, and who ever can survive the night will receive a million dollars. This film try too much to be scary, but never managing it. You will pretty much knows what's going to happen next from the start to the end and knows who will die and so on. The film is pretty light on the gore, the opening sequence is the scariest part of the film, and the rest rely too much on the special effects. The film itself looks good and the horror sequences are well done but they've all been done before, but there's no major shocks or twist to surprise the audience. Overall, the film is pretty average on the verge of being bad. I suggest you rent it out first before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Had To Buy It","review":"After missing the films release at the cinema i decided to buy the film anyway as my friends had said that it was very good, and i have to agree with them. I hadnt seen the original so this was a totaly new film to me and i loved it all the way through. The storyline is there, there are plenty of deaths, the special effects are great and the cast certainly earned their pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky old movie, ain't it","review":"The House on Haunted Hill is the most underrated movie of all time. This and Hollow Man are the creepiest movies I've ever seen. I didn't want to see this movie because I thought it was going to be like the scareless Haunting, which I suppose why it didn't make a lot of money. But when I did, I loved it. Geoffry Rush was surprisingly scary as Stephen Price, SNL's Chris Kataan was funny as the owner of the house who knows that he's dead, and Famke Jannsen was convincely psychotic as Price's Wife. The only flaw of this masterpiece was the unscary use of CGI towards the end. The psycology of the guests was very realistic. It told you that under the pressure and stress these people are under, they become just as dangerous as whatever's causing the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special Effects take over this movie!Watch the original!","review":"This remake is sadly just a big movie for special effects overkill!It's so much like \\"The Haunting \\" it's laughable!But if you must buy this movie do it on DVD! at least on DVD , we get commentary from the director,delated scenes(some of which I made the movie!), a compare and contrast between this \\"House\\" and the orginal with Vincent Price! But I prefer the orginal with it chessy effects and a great story about a wife plotting to kill her husband(in the original at least her plan backfires!)Do yourself a favor and skip this special effects overkill movie and watch the original instead!But if you have a DVD player by all means buy this movie and watch the special features in the DVD(it will make the remake made a litter more sense!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope!","review":"The balance in my checking account is far scarier than this pointless remake of the 1959 horror classic. Geoff Rush looks like he was transplanted into the wrong film; the special effects go into overdrive, and Taye Diggs does little more than show off his Colgate smile. Skip it, and move on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not worth watching","review":"Being somewhat of a horror buff myself, I expected a lot more out of this film.House on Haunted Hill is a remake of the original 1958 film, and it seems that 41 years later the movie still proves to be nothing more than a complete, utter disaster.Don't waste your time on this cheap, poorly acted, mediocre attempt at horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap horror flick that doesn't need any thought.","review":"Just sit and watch. Don't try to find out the qualities of this movie because you will be disappointed.Some of the FX are quite okay but generally, the whole movie is simply laughable. The characters are all ridiculous, the dialogues are more ridiculous than the characters. It means the screenplay was for sure a bad one. What do you expect after reading the movie title ? What a surprise to discover that the house is really haunted ! Oouaaahhh Very original ! Finally the lighting gets the reward of the worst ingredient in this somewhat pathetic recipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under rated","review":"This movie was so good from the beginning to the very end. I really dont know why this movie didnt do well. I never even heard of this before. It is about 6 strangers who were invited to a party. If they stay until dawn they each win 1 million dollars, the only catch is they have to live. Trust me this movie is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the Beginning","review":"The best part of the movie was the beginning. I thought that they might actually have a good movie here. Unfortunately, they did not do such a great job. I won't go in to detail about my complaints, but I strongly believe that they could have made a very scary movie if they had done several things: 1) Laid off some of the computer-generated effects, like at the end 2)not focused so much on the feud between Price and his wife, it became annoying 3) used the crazy doctor more often. That one part of the movie (to all those who feel i will ruin the movie for them stop reading) where Rush enters the camera room and finds that the security guard's face is gone and then he sees the crazy doctor scared me to a great extent. It pains me to see a movie like this when i know it could have been so much better"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a very scary ride!","review":"I thought that this movie was really good.

Not innovative sounding enough to make me want to spend money on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with \\"When I Woke\\"","review":"I'm with the other reviewers who felt \\"When I Woke\\" was Root's best CD: better percussion, better vocal quality, better cohesion. While one can't really understand their lyrics much in \\"Woke\\" (reminds one of speaking in tongues) I still feel they do a better job than when one can actually hear and understand the lyrics in this CD.

I was hoping for more depth in the story, especially between him and his father. and little bit more about the early years. It really, relies alot on the pictures to tell the story, also the story is over before you know it. It could have delved into the business end of his life more.

There are so many things said about Michael, a lot of those invented by people who wanted to make money out of his popularity using his name. I think Michael was very pure, very sensitive and very talented. Like everybody else he made mistakes and his life like each one of us wasn't perfect but he utilized his talent for good, communicating a good message to the world and to kids. In this book you get to know his story from his own words and at the end you admire him even more because he was always awesome as a human being and as an artist giving all that he could to entertain the world and achieve levels never imagined.

The little slices of life that he shared in this book from his earlier days are very touching. It gave a rare insight into the struggle and victory that became his life. The time he spent on tour with his brother's whom he clearly loved so dearly, gave me a sense of his warmth as an individual. That is something I will treasure always along with his music. If you are an avid Micheal Jackson fan I highly recommend this book becuase it give great insight into his genuis and his humanity and his legacy.

The comedic timing is off in every 4th season episode that I've seen, including all those on this disc.

Hannah Holmes has shown me that she can probably write about any topic she chooses and make it interesting and entertaining.

But to be fair, for this price, you can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful luxury for a great price","review":"This was a much anticipated item that I received for Mother's day. I searched everywhere for the best price. Got a great deal and was blown away when it arrived. The face is not as pink as it appears, but I had already read about it online. Diamonds are almost unnoticeable, but they're there. I get compliments all of the time. It's just that type of watch. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly different","review":"This book was fairly different from the other Conan books I have read because in those ones Conan was pretty much all by himself and minding his own business, eventually getting caught up in the action. However, in this story, Conan already has a friend (Juma) and is already involved in a conflict. I thought the setting was a nice change, too, from the standard grassy hills. I probably would've given this book 5 stars, but I think it goes downhill once Conan makes it to the capital. It seems like the author is trying to fit too much into the last chapters and I have to say I was very disappointed by the end. It was a bad surprise. I would recommend this book, however, maybe not very highly, but it is a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody, gory, bad.","review":"Hmm. This movie is perfect for those who like to see graphicviolence and mediocre effects, but personally I prefer movies thathave less in the way of twitching limbs and screams as you hear each slice of the knife in lieu of suspense and excitement. I worried more about how gross the next death would be rather than how the characters would fare. Personally I hoped they would all die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it.","review":"This film features quite a lot of special effects and very little suspence and few scares. There is ridiculous B movie dialogue, the characters are all relentlessly unpleasant from the start for no reason, and there isn't much of a story. I never cared what happened to anyone in this movie, and it took a real effort to resist fast forwarding through much of it."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],B={key:0},N={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(x,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-e65b6337"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/55.md","filePath":"guide/55.md"}'),W={name:"guide/55.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
